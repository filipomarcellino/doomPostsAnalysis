hw4kym,Is it normal to have such big gaps in knowledge?,"I'm finishing a computer engineering degree but took many computer science courses. 

Right now I am staring at my final year project with my hands in my hair. All this time we've been learning for-loops, conditional branches, arrays, sorting, passing by reference, passing by value, stacks, heaps, treaps, linked lists, neural networks, genetic algorithms, big O, compression, encryption, decryption.... 

...C, C++, Java, Python, Assembler....

...and still I have no idea how you go about getting different programs written in different languages to work together as one project. How do you make a dll? How do you make an installer? How do you make the program work on different operating systems?

What's an API? What's a framework? What's a wrapper? What's a daemon? What's a socket? What's an interface when not referring to UI's? What do you mean ""just"" rebuild the kernel so that this ARM processor can even compile QT code? What is a ""kernel""?

I google what these things mean and the definitions seem really abstract and generalized to me because I can't relate how I would use any of it in any code I know how to write.

Meanwhile some teenager is in the news for hacking some poor senator's email...and I don't even know how to open an email with anything other than my left mouse button. And that is exclusive to *my* email.

Yet it seems everywhere I look online, everybody just *knows* things like they read a book or took a class that I missed out on.

How is it that some people can play a video game, decide to change it, and without any modding tools they manage to add a gazillion new features to it?

How do you learn to make plugins for a web-browser?

Whenever I need to work on a new technology I have never used before, I  have to look up tutorials on youtube that spell out the steps to me. This can't possibly be the correct way to do research, could it? How did that youtuber figure it out? What was their approach? Where do you first start looking? 

**tldr:** Basically, is this massive gap of knowledge normal? Would a better degree have covered this? Or do people naturally figure out some approach for finding stuff out that doesn't involve googling tutorials?",2020-07-22 23:21:38

bl37qz,Read Before Posting!,"Hi all,   
  
I just though I'd take some time to make clear what kind of posts are appropriate for this subreddit. Overall this is sub is mostly meant for asking questions about concepts and ideas in Computer Science. 
  
 *  Questions about what computer to buy can go to /r/suggestapc. 
 *  Questions about why a certain device or software isn't working can go to /r/techsupport  
 *  Any career related questions are going to be a better fit for /r/cscareerquestions.   
 *  Any University / School related questions will be a better fit for /r/csmajors. 
 *  Posting homework questions is generally low effort and probably will be removed. If you are stuck on a homework question, identify what concept you are struggling with and ask a question about that concept. Just don't post the HW question itself and ask us to solve it.  
 *  Low effort post asking people here for Senior Project /  Graduate Level thesis ideas may be removed. Instead, think of an idea on your own, and we can provide feedback on that idea.  
 *  General program debugging problems can go to /r/learnprogramming. However if your question is about a CS concept that is ok. Just make sure to format your code (use 4 spaces to indicate a code block). Less code is better. An acceptable post would be like: `How does the Singleton pattern ensure there is only ever one instance of itself?` And you could list any relevant code that might help express your question.

I think that in 6 years, there will be a surplus of engineers, i think that because i'm seeing a lot of people pursuing a CS degree, there a lot of books, online courses, Youtube videos, bootcamps to learn how to code, I've learned a ton by myself without the need of college education, i've even seen that you dont need at CS degree to be a software engineer. It is possible to be autodidact and become a software engineer. And as i said a lot of people are getting into this career because of its high salary, and when there is more supply of people with a certain skill, salaries decline because of supply and demand.

Also, programming is becoming easier overtime, it's easier to build a website today than it was back then in 2010, because of the new programming languages, frameworks and technology. So the barrier of entry is becoming lower overtime, making the supply of engineers increase. And when the easier a skill is, the less people pay for people with that skill.

11w6qv7,Does anybody else find AI content detectors to be really sketchy and misleading?," So I was just working on a writing assignment today and for shits and giggles I decided to pop it into some GPT content detectors to see what they said. I do use ChatGPT all the time, but didn't for this particular assignment.

I was somewhat surprised to see that 4 out of 5 detectors that I popped my paragraph into were extremely confident that it was written by a GPT model, including one (ZeroGPT) which was 100% confident. So I started popping in previous assignments which I had written, and was surprised to see that many of them were detected as AI generated content too.

The idea that these content detectors will soon be employed by teachers around the world who don't understand how they work to levy accusations of cheating against students frankly scares the shit out of me, and its very clear that the LLCs which are publishing these tools intend for them to be used this way. I'm not even convinced that the use of AI language models should even be considered cheating in many cases.

So that brings me to the second part of what scares me, which is the irresponsible way that these tools are marketed. The first time I was introduced to many of these tools they typically called themselves ""AI content detectors"", which seems pretty accurate. Lately I am noticing an increase in the use of aggressive wording on some sites, and a lot more labeling the use of generative NLP tools ""AI plagiarism"" (this wording is used by Writeful, ZeroGPT, GPTZero). But plagiarism is stealing another person's work and passing it off as your own. How can you steal from an inanimate tool who's whole purpose is to do exactly what you have done with it? Fortunately most sites still don't use this accusatory nomenclature.

But thats a bit of a pedantic question of when the tools are appropriate to use and I would rather let people form their own opinions and draw their own lines on what constitutes plagiarism. Whats **much** more concerning to me is the downright misleading claims of accuracy that some of these GPT content detectors are claiming.

ZeroGPT seems to be one of the worst offenders. They are clear about positioning their tool to be used in academic circles to evaluate student's work, and state clearly that they want universities to use their tool at large scale to detect what they call ""AI Plagiarism"". Their website claims ""we developed ZeroGPT's algorithm with an accuracy rate of text detection higher than 98%"". And yet their algorithm was 100% sure that my handwritten paragraph was generated by a language model as well as misidentifying several other things I've written over the years. They call themselves ""The most advanced and reliable ChatGPT detector tool"".

Guys, this scares the shit out of me. Way more than AI generated content does. These kinds of misleading and downright false claims are not acceptable. Students are going to get kicked out of school because of crap like this.",2023-03-20 03:08:37

ht5zmo,I Designed a Data Structure/Algorithm Battle Card,"Hi all, sorry if this reads long. I just need some input from the community.

For months I've been thinking about making game cards/battle cards (or just plain cards) for data structures and algorithms (and perhaps other concepts in computer science, such as turing machine, userland, kernel land, pumping lemma, TSP, etc).

There are two design routes I could go:

1. MTG-like fantasy art complete with myths and lore (e.g the forbidden kernel land, or the spiritual binary tree)
2. abstract art like the one shown below.

I'm in the process of:

1. compiling a list of data structures/algorithms/concepts I want to include in the pack
2. evaluating game card printers
3. looking for illustrators
4. designing a battle system (My current idea revolves around data structure/algo vs cs problems, with one side slotting in data struct/algo cards into a preset application scaffold, and the other side altering input. I also thought about battle system between hackers, but I know very little about hacking).

I don't know if compsci/software engineering community would respond positively to this. I just thought it'd be really neat if there is a card collection based on computer science. So my questions are:

1. Which design should I go with (fantasy art or abstract art)?
2. Would you buy this?
3. Battle system ideas?

I am currently in my 4th semester and I've pretty much enjoyed all the CS related subjects that I've had to take. However, this particular subject is giving me a hard time.  But that also doesn't mean that I am not familiar with some of the basic things in this subject. For example, I am totally aware of alphabets, strings and formal and informal languages. So far we have covered **DFA, NFA, DFA & NFA equivalence, Epsilon NFA, Regular Expressions** and finally **Kleene's Theorem**.   
I am able to create finite automations for these, however it takes me a lot of time to do so. For example, I was going through a problem (it was about *constructing a dfa for a sequence of five consecutive letters with two zero in them*), and it took me almost an hour to complete.     
I had been quite confident with the subject initially, however after getting average marks in my recent quiz, I'm quite demotivated.  The quiz had conceptual questions like: *""can a DFA represent a pallindrome?""*, and I thought that it did (which I later got to know was wrong).    
I am willing to follow through any kind of useful resources, and I am willing to put a lot of dedication into this subject. What can I do to get better at it?   
Also the textbook that we are following is:  **Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation by Jeffery Ullman and John Hopcroft**

Programs mostly are built with frameworks (Spring, .Net, Laravel...). They force their way of doing things. In one hand, this is good: it stops you from writing bad code, forces you away from bad practices, built-in authentication, authorization, security, ORM, template engine...

On the other hand, isn't it boring when you have to write an app step by step how somebody else imagined? First time it's definitely fun, second, third... is it really? Where is the fun in programming? It all seems kinda repetitive. Almost all web apps can be done in the same way.

ifedvd,I just don't get NoSQL databases,"Perhaps it's just because of my years of working with relational databases, but for the life of me I can't figure out how a non-relational database works.  I've read a number of tutorials and whatnot, and I understand that they are supposed to be faster and more suited for certain use-cases, but I can't really see how.

The Amazon Dynamo DB tutorial, for example, is a movie database.  If I wanted to store a cast list for a movie, I see no other way than an array of strings for each cast member.  But then if I wanted all the movies an actor was in, I'd have to either do what I suspect is some very slow iteration through all the movies' actors, or store that information in the actor table.  But now my data is doubled up and I can't see how that wouldn't create problems.

You might point out that I've tried to use a non-relational database to store a relation, but I can't imagine a database where some sort of relation isn't necessary.  Take Amazon, for example.  There's a million relationships they must be tracking--purchase to user, review to purchase, item to manufacturer, whatever.

Is the database duplicated across all connected computers or is there a powerful constantly-monitored computer that holds the database and the server/nodes read from/write to that database? 

My question for now is when I make a comment in a youtube video, how is it stored? Obviously a host/computer in the youtube network is going to receive it and insert it into a database. However, is this a database that's part of a ""local"" enormous database that's going to be copied to other regions of the world?

Kind of like a reverse hypervisor in a way - instead of sitting underneath, the memory management is done by the running operating system itself.

Is it impossible, or has nobody thought to do it because it'd be a lot of effort to solve a problem that barely exists?

I am the heavy user(?) of C/C++ , and I liked it because of the features that can manage memory directly and fast and ability to control over low level system. 

I also searched what kind of thing in the ""field"" is built by C/C++ and I found a lot of them.

For example, TensorFlow, Node.js, Firefox(mostly C), OpenCV, and many others which are famous AND huge project.

So, I am really confused. Why I fell in love with C/C++ is that actually I am really interested in what happened exactly backside of applications, how actually network communications established, processes are managed and so on.

i5vras,Books / resources about thinking robustly about solving problems,"I was recently in a job interview in which my interviewer told me that he doesn't believe that university degrees teach many useful things to students. His main point was that they don't do a proper job teaching them to think, and that he has found that even graduate students cannot properly answer problems which he gives them.

I was curious, so I asked him whether he could give me an example of a problem which graduate students can't answer properly. This was the problem:

Given a request, A, with a starting and a finishing time, decide whether it is compatible with another request, B, with a starting and finishing time (two requests are not compatible if their timespans overlap).

My answer was that one can check whether the starting time for request A is after the starting time of request B but before the finishing time of request B, and vice versa for the ending time of request A.

However, he said that my answer was completely wrong. His reason for this was that I jumped straight to solving the problem, instead of proving it beforehand and reasoning about it.  When I asked him how he would have answered if he had been asked the problem, his answer was:

The possible cases are that request A may be completely before request B, request A may partially overlap request B on the left, request A may be contained in request B, request B may be contained in request A, request A may partially overlap request B on the right, and request A  may be completely after request B.

His explanation for why this is a necessary step of reasoning about a problem was that it allows you to prove that your solution is correct (whereas I, jumping straight to the solution to of the problem, have no way of proving that my solution is correct) and that it is a formal method which allows one to write code which has a lower chance of containing bugs, as you can know that the logic for the code is sound.

From his ""proof step"" in solving the problem, you can also see quite easily that there is a solution to the problem which requires less computational power than the one I suggested: simply check whether A finishes before B starts or starts after B ends. If this is the case, then they do not overlap.

&#x200B;

So my question is whether anyone has any resources or books which they can recommend to me for helping to learn more about how to think about logic before jumping straight to writing the code. I have searched around and haven't yet been able to find anything that great. I'm mostly looking for something practical; i.e. something which only deals with abstract logical proofs and never connects this to how you can use the ideas in your coding would still be something I would be interested in reading, but less so than something which addresses practical application.

Is it a method you write into a program? Is it something built into an IDE? Is it a separate program entirely? Is the connection between Java classes in the same project an API? Is it an API that lets me send data between a Java project and a MySQL database? At what point are two things different/ distant enough that they require an API?

I also apologize in advance if this is a dumb question.

Like the title says, I want to learn about something but I don't know what it's called which makes it difficult to look up info online. I don't even know if there's a specific name or names for what I want to learn.

A little background: I work in SEO and have become increasingly interested in the technical side of it. I've dabbled in coding before (mainly Java then Python for simple data analysis and API calls) but have virtually no knowledge of how code on a web page is executed by a server, rendered in a browser, how resources are used, and everything else that happens between when an HTML document is requested by a user device and when it is loaded on their device.

I want to learn more and I've also thought about taking a course but I don't know if there's a term for this area of knowledge. The way I'm learning now is by using very basic search terms online like 'how do browsers load a page', as well as spending a lot of time in Chrome DevTools looking through the various tabs like Performance and Network, trying to understand what's happening as the page loads, and using that as a jumping off point to look into more specific things like 'what is the raster thread' and so on. Also, working in SEO, a lot of my (very rudimentary) knowledge of these concepts were learned from Google's developer articles.

Ultimately, I have a professional objective (to better understand technical SEO) but also a vested personal interest in learning this area of compsci because it feels like modern-day magic and I just want to know everything about it! How the Internet works, the role of servers, browsers, and websites, their directories, resources, and pages, and how it all comes together so I can read a news article on my phone in seconds with nothing more than typing in a string of characters, and more. I don't think the way search engines crawl and render pages will be the exact same way a browser would load them, but I think understanding the fundamentals of how the web works is a good first step and would at least guide me in my learning process, because right now I have soooo many questions about so many different things I don't even know what to look into first, and the knowledge feels so fragmented.

So I tried to keep this brief but also give enough info about what I'm trying to learn & why. If it's not clear just ask and I'll provide more details, as much as I can.

C++ has been an important part of my education since I was 16. I have some experience with Java as well(beginner). Anyway, thanks to the education system, I‚Äôve fallen in love with C++. 

Obviously, the education system does not teach how it can be used professionally. Anyway, me being an idiot I am, I continue learning C++. Everyone around me learn other languages like JavaScript or Python. It makes me feel like what I‚Äôm learning is old and maybe irrelevant?

My main concern is that I might be overlooked when we get to a stage where we start looking for jobs. I have no problem with starting to learn other programming languages as well but I just love C++ and I‚Äôm adapted to it. 

To all the C++ professionals out there, do you think I should switch and start learning something else? I forgot to mention that I‚Äôm a gamer and aspire to become a game developer but sadly there aren‚Äôt a lot of game developing companies around. I feel lost as I hear people say companies prefer hiring people who know more about JavaScript or Python and web development. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the field I want to get into.

dcuiyc,"To be a software engineer, should I go back to school to get a second undergrad in computer science?","Some basic info about me: I graduated from University of Waterloo (in Ontario, Canada) in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science ([B.Sc](https://B.Sc)) in Biology.  I live in Toronto Ontario.  I've been working since graduation, although nothing to do with computer science.  I decided that at this point I want to switch careers (I'm currently 24), and try to become a software engineer.  I have friends who are software engineers or developers and work for the big tech companies in California, such as Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn.  It might be a bit of a stretch for me to say I want to be there, as I don't have much computer science background, but working for those companies is an experience I would love to have in the hopefully near future.  I am also open to any positions computer science related, but obviously I have lots of work to do and information to learn before I can get there.  I currently reside in Toronto, so I know that there are also big tech companies here, such as the new Amazon.  

I'm posting because I need advice on how to get into computer science.  As someone with a biology background, I don't necessarily stand out in terms of knowledge and expertise.  I know some people say that they don't need ""formal"" schooling to learn computer science, and that they can teach themselves many things, but is that so?

Since I already have an undergrad, I was thinking about whether getting a second degree in CS would be beneficial.  E.g. I was talking to University of Toronto about getting a CS degree, and apparently it will take around up to 3 years to complete, including transfer credits that I may get transferred to the degree.  The advisor told me I wouldn't be able to graduate with the CS degree, as it is also under the faculty of science, but that I could take courses for CS under an arts program, for example, and fulfill the CS requirements, then graduate with the arts degree.

Has anybody been in a similar situation? E.g. doing an undergrad, then thinking about switching careers and whether or not further schooling is a good idea, and if so, what type of schooling?  Any advice would be appreciated.  Serious answers only please :)

d44cas,What are some basic Computer Science concepts every self-taught person should know?,"I have been a frontend developer for almost two years now. I am self-taught so I didn't study Computer Science at the university, which means there is a considerable amount of holes in my knowledge. That's why I would like to ask what are some basic concepts that every self-taught developer should study in order to have a better understanding of the tools they are working with.

I have always have a natural curiosity and am still very much learning a lot about programming and computers in general, but as I try to learn more and more about tools, languages and technologies (JavaScript, Blockchain, Mobile Development...) I come across basic concepts and ideas I am not familiar with. For example, I don't really understand what a Turing machine is or what we talk about when we say procedural programming.

When I ask the which of these concepts to learn to have a better general understanding of how computers work, people often say it depends on your career goals. But in my case, I don't really have a defined career goal, and it's in part due to my lack of understanding of what else I could be doing with the tools available out there. I work as a frontend developer for a blockchain development studio, which I love and hope to get deeper into, but at the same time, I feel like I will never become a better developer as long as I lack some basic computer science knowledge. I am currently learning C, as most serious developers I've talked to have explained to me the importance of understanding C.

I've been wanting to become a programmer ever since I was a child and I really wanted to follow in my father's footsteps as a programmer himself. I have previously taken this course earlier but I dropped to a lower level and I got a 66 for a average. We used a different language and now since I am back in Java I find it challenging to the point where I am struggling. I really really want to get into a good college since I am currently attending my final year of HS. Yikes, I need at least a 80% to land into the college I want to be in but at the moment I got a 54% which is on the brink of failing. This is a academic course by the way which is more challenging then previously. It's getting to the point to where I am asking myself ""Should I really pursue this?"" or that I am not fit to be a programmer but deep down I really want to become a programmer when I graduate. 

&#x200B;

I've been really dependent on my teacher on asking for help to where my teacher doesn't want to help me no more since I am getting stuck 99% of the time nowadays which sucks, I have spoken to my previous CS teacher and he said that at this rate I will not get into the college I want to be in and secure that programming job. I have other responsibilities as well such as a part time job, focusing on graduating, projects, assignments, tests etc. All of this is weighing down on me to the point where I am considering on dropping out.  I attend classes 100% of the time and the things that I have a problem with is this.

&#x200B;

I understand the theory of the program but I struggle on executing it such as typing the code myself and not knowing where to place certain pieces of code.

I keep looking back and forth and putting previous programs as a base structure.

Not understanding errors.

I feel like I've failed myself, failed my parents especially my father since I promised him I would be a better programmer than him and yet I am on the brink of failing. That was the first test by the way and since I need a 80% I have to really focus but I don't feel like I have the abilities to continue.

&#x200B;

hosvaj,Newbie here. Sister asked me a question on connecting to a website and I'm not 100% on the answer,"Hi guys

My sister asked me today ""How can multiple people connect to the same website? If I do something on my screen, why does that not change the other people's screens?""

My answer was that she was thinking of the website as a ""place"" (because it's designed to feel that way), but that's not really what's happening. You don't ""go to"" a website, rather you make a requisition and it gives you all the html and code to build the site in your browser. So you might be connected to the site, but you're only ever in your browser, not ""at"" the website.

I know that web pages and web apps are much more complicated than they used to be, but I can't imagine that they literally got 1000 times more complicated.

So sorry if this is a stupid question but I am trying to learn computer science and someone suggested I learn to code and they suggested the python language. So I do this exercise that is very simple and all I type in the code is:


print(‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù)


I then learned to maneuver to the program directory in the terminal and to run the program using the command:


python3 Hello.py


However, what I am confused about is how exactly the computer knows from python to display the text. What is the python3 command actually do here? Because if it isn‚Äôt used it does not work. Now my guess is that for other languages I need to use a command similar to python3 for each respective language. I am just not sure what the command is doing and I am hoping someone could explain it to me. Sorry if this is a dumb question, I am only thirteen and I am trying to get smarter.",2021-02-14 11:57:17

9sqes4,Scared about getting a job as a programmer.,"Hello,

Working as a programmer is genuinely scaring me. I love solving problems and trying to find their best solutions, but when i think about getting a job as a programmer, i'm scared. Most of the jobs i see aren't really involve solving problems, but much more arguing with a language to make it do what you want. Take as an example Web Developers (i had an internship in a webdev company this summer, and this started my thoughts), to me it looks like they're spending most of their time writing solutions to problem they've already solved over and over. And if i think about jobs that actually involve solving problems i start to think about deadlines, having to write bad code on purpose to meet them and even to be irrepleaceable and get job stability.

This is definitely what i don't want to do, and i'm pretty sure it'll bring me in depression pretty quickly.

What i want to do, is spend my time solving problems, find new ideas, improve programs so they're easier to use, faster, lighter, without all the bullshit that most programs today bring with themselves.

I was thinking Academia could be my thing, but i'm not even sure if i'll be able to enter University, because as much as i'd want to, i don't really have enough money, and i don't even know what working in Academia really is like. But if i think i'd like it, i'm pretty sure i'd start doing something about the money.

aj9enu,I'm a little confused about the use case for Docker/Containerization in general,"I am attempting to learn about containerization, but there is something I am missing between the concept itself and the use-case of the user, and I am unsure what that step is, so I'm hoping that it is buried in the answer to these questions I've thought of!

Here is what I'm still confused about containerization so far, and I'd love to have clarified: 

* Is containerization just an easy way to have version control for an application? 

* Containerization is a virtualization of a computer's OS, and the docker engine sits straight on the computer's OS, which means that all of the microservices it uses are actually abstract versions of the computer's version of such a service. Does this mean that Windows 10/macOS/Linux/etc. all require separate versions of Docker as they have different kernel/OS APIs? (or is it something else? please correct me)

* I am a little confused on who the end-user is for something like containerization. Is it mainly software for developers?

* In this case, if the end-user wants to use an app that is created via containerization, do they need to have Docker installed to run this application? 

* One of the examples Docker has on its GitHub is a Flask app, which is (obviously) used in websites. Can a website use Docker in this way? How would the Docker engine interact with the browser in that case?",2019-01-24 05:53:30

jy2yui,Is This Normal In Computer Science Education?,"I'm studying programming courses and it seems like no matter how hard I study or how much I practice, I can never get good enough for the exams. I started earlier this year and it started off good. I was able to cope. But I've been really struggling with the next few courses in sequence.

Just to give you an idea: I have been spending the past 5 months doing practice coding problems every day. I do as many as I can. Along with all my assignments. I spend hours at it.

I'm able to manage the assignments because there's no time limit so there's room for trial and error and improvisation. But the exams are just brutal. They expect you to solve these problems under a very short time limit. In theory, I know how to do it but I just can't understand how they can expect us to do it in the time given.  There's so much planning and thinking to do to figurer out how your program is going to work. The way its set up is that, you have to get everything right in the first go otherwise you miss your chance. Like there's no room for '' hmm what if I do do this ''. It's like they expect you to already know the code you want to type and instantly solve the problem from the moment you look at it.

I have never experienced anything like this in any other subject. I took IB math in high school and got 75% just by giving a half a\*\*sed attempt. And I've done other courses in college, and haven't experienced anything like this. Every subject I've studied was set up in a way that ensured that if a student studies the content and puts in an honest amount of effort, they would succeed.

But what I'm studying right now doesn't feel anything like that. It's almost like the teachers are trying their level best to ensure students fail. It's almost like this is a mental eugenics program that is trying to weed everyone out who isn't exceptionally intelligent with razor fast cognitive and logic skills.

But why is it set up that way in education? Shouldn't that mental eugenics type thing only be reserved for prestigious positions like jobs at Apple? Where they only want exceptionally gifted programmers depending on what their values are?

Is this a common thing in computer science education? Is it just my college or are all colleges like this? I'm able to grasp all the concepts that are taught in class, but the rate at which I solve problems is not razor fast like they want. I feel helpless. Like no matter how much I study and practice, its never good enough.",2020-11-21 02:34:37

f9y27v,Keep feeling as if I'm not smart enough for this major,"I'm a math major but since middle school I've planned on going into the cs field. I've always just felt slow when it comes to programming and cs. Everyone else seems to just get it or if they don't get it they figure it out after a couple min. It takes me days or even the entire week to figure out the same thing. I'm in a cs class now in my 2nd semester of college and they hand out projects every week. Most other people figure it out within a couple days, even just hours and It takes me an entire week of constant stress and anxiety over the project to figure it out. I always finally figure it out at the last second before the deadline and I just feel stupid. I always feel like I'm not smart enough for cs or I don't have the brain for it. I feel like this mentality just makes me even worse at programming as I just constantly overthink things. Even the most simple problems cause me so much stress. 

I really want to be a cs major. Despite dreading every assignment and the constant stress and anxiety I go through because of them, I do enjoy doing them and figuring them out. I just get so mad at myself for taking so long to figure out such seemingly simple problems that other people just work through so fast. Even my friend who was at the same level as me in our AP csa course in high school, can figure out what takes me the whole week to figure out in a few hours and had only taken one extra cs course than me last semester. Now we're in the same course. 

I wish he'd help with all the projects but he refuses to tell me anything more than the most vague of hints. Ik he wants me to figure it out on my own so I'll become a better programmer but sometimes the projects are so confusing and hard that I just get so demoralized after working on them for any longer than an hour. I just feel like I can't do them like I'm too stupid to find the answer in a reasonable time.

I struggle a lot with low self esteem and anxiety and feel like that makes it way worse and makes me overthink things. I tell myself that I'm not stupid that I'm just making things harder by overthinking them but even so it still confuses me just as much and still makes me feel stupid. 

I guess I'm just making this post to vent but I also would really like some help. All of this just makes me so depressed and makes me feel worthless. Ik this isn't the right sub to post mental health issues/problems but I feel like those are factors of my problems with programming.

If you read all this, thank you at least for hearing how I feel.

edit: Got a lot more help from this than I thought I would. I genuinely feel a lot more confident with cs now because of all your comments. I'm not dreading doing any project now and feel like I can do anything no matter how difficult if I just keep trying. Thanks a lot guys, appreciate it.",2020-02-26 18:51:27

Here are a few ideas for example related to engineering:

> To catch up with a space station in orbit, a satellite firing rockets prograde will move further away. It will initially have to fire its engines retrograde to drop to a lower orbit.

> It takes more specific energy to get to the sun than to the far planets. You do not 'fall in' at all like one would expect.

> Supersonic diverging nozzles make flow go faster.

> Subsonic pipe restrictions make velocity go up but pressure go down.

> If you had a house with freezing outside air temperature, and access to a big hot rock, in principle you would be better off using the rock to run a heat pump to move heat from the outside cold air to the warm inside of the house.

> An open fridge will make a room hotter.

> A helicopter pitching forward will have to increase its relative lift to the side, not at the back of the rotor. The FAA says it's at 90 degrees as one would expect from dynamics (but there is some debate about whether it is less than 90).

> If you could shrink to the scale of a bacterium and physically be fine, you wouldn't be able to swim in water. It'll be like super thick honey.

> An ant scaled to a human would be not be able to carry any weight (let alone 50 times). It would collapse and die, as stresses are carried through an area, and volume grows faster than area.

> You can accurately measure altitude with a couple of clocks (due to General Relativity).",2019-01-08 13:08:22

ohsp5x,"How much faster is C compared to Python? I'm currently coding a SAT solver algorithm that will have to take millions of input data, and I was wondering if I should switch from Python to C.","I'm currently coding a SAT solver algorithm for an internship, but right now it's only able to handle inputs of 10\^5 within reasonable time (over 100 of iterations, this is so we can gather statistical data on the algorithm). However, from 10\^6 and after, my Python code bottle necks and takes a long time to finish. My professor suggested that I port the code over to C, but when I try doing that there are a lot of small things that make it difficult to port. For example, I need to be able to randomize an array size for a structure that's in a header file, but you can't do this in C (well, I don't need to do this exactly, but other methods will be a bit harder to code and look sloppier). I was wondering if the bottleneck I mentioned above will be reduced drastically if I switch over to C, especially for inputs of 10\^8. I know this depends on the complexity time of the algorithm, but I was wondering if porting the code will be worth the headache because I'm pretty sure that my python code is the same time complexity as my professors pseudocode. I thought of using pypy and Numba, but they only speed up 2x to 4x, which is still slow, especially when inputs will be 10\^8 or 10\^9.

igm1lv,Applying Benfords law to images.,"I read an article about Benfords law, which suggested that you were able to detect fraudulent or edited images by analyzing an image and applying Benfords law. If the values were consistent with the pattern suggested by Benford, it would seem to imply that the image was not tampered with.

This sounds great on theory and seems fairly straight forward to test - so as an aspiring software engineer, I promptly took a couple of images on my phone, created a dataset where some had been tampered with using photoshop, and built a piece of software that goes through every image in a folder and builds a distribution of rgb values for each image, using the first number in each number as the key, and the value as an increment. 

However! As I was writing the code I realized that the rgb value only goes to 255. That severely limits the randomness. So I found a way to [compute a single unique value from r, g and b values!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52626779/calculating-a-single-representative-pixel-value-from-a-rgb-value)

ha3k5z,Public DNS sinkhole to block ads,"Hi Reddit

I just found out about [pi hole](https://pi-hole.net/), which is a DNS sinkhole you setup on your LAN so that ad-related DNS requests don't get resolved. If you have this, no device in the network gets advertisements (more or less anyway) for any app. It uses a community-managed list of which requests are ad-related and which aren't.

I'm wondering why such a DNS sinkhole does not exist as a public service. I could simply create a public DNS server that uses the community-managed lists of the pi-hole and then set this server's IP as my DNS server on my devices. Then, wherever I go or whatever network I'm connected to, I have no advertisements.

I can't be the first person to think of this, yet I found no mention of this anywhere online. Can I go ahead and set this up myself, or is there something wrong with this idea?

For example.  I have a program called Program\_A.  Program\_A is running.  I have another program, Program\_B, that I want to be able to use a method in Program\_A.  What would I do to Program\_A that would make calling it's function an API that Program\_B could use?

So I tried `' or '1' = '1` in an old website on a login page, and then I got an IP banned from that website. It said contact this email for any inquiries, so I apologized them by email. But still, I'm afraid that I could be tracked down, especially that I'm using company's internet. I didn't expect it to ever happen, nor having any intention to hack anyone.

I tried an XSS on another website like `<script>alert('xss')</script>` and it doesn't do anything, so I thought that attack prevention would just act as if the input is a string. I didn't really think I could get banned for doing this. I should have used VPN or just simulate that in my own website, not trying in the real site.

Edit: After some research on the website. This website, along with other similar webs, use the same content management system, which has been discontinued for many years. https://packetstormsecurity.com/ literally shows the vulnerability on the top Google search, including XSS and SQL Injection. There's even a Youtube video of successfully hacking the website with this content management system (partly that the admin's MD5 hashed password can be accessed and cracked easily).

aajmna,Do you guys agree with this guy's post?,"Saw this on an AskReddit post. As a senior in high school applying to universities as a CS major, I'm a lil worried.

> I'm willing to wager thousands of prospective CS students are those who found a bit of interest in programming, and then saw the amount of money a ""software programmer"" could make (or perhaps vice-versa). They've always been ""good"" with computers, and that AP CS class they took last year really piqued their interests. They researched further and found ""software/development managers"" could make over 200k a year, and suddenly they envision themselves sitting at a computer all day, hacking away, maybe even working remotely from home, and making 300k a year. And to add even more weight to the potential disillusionment, many of these soon to be CS majors hope that maybe, just maybe, they'll somehow create the next Snapchat or Facebook or Flappy Bird or Bitcoin or Unturned or whatever new product that allows them to sit down, rake in millions, and enjoy an early retirement in the ""bustle and hub"" of California's Silicon Valley. That's not to say it can't happen. By all means aim high. But you don't see nearly every prospective lawyer eyeing a spot on the Supreme Court, or every prospective biology major with realistic goals to cure cancer. A CS degree is slowly becoming the new business degree of the 21st century: I don't know what the hell I want to do in life, I like money, and I guess I've always been kind of good at math, so I'll just major in CS and I'll probably be rich or something. Check any school's available undergraduate data. Computer Science, or some form of it, is most likely one of the 3 largest majors on campus, and almost certainly their most impacted major. For all prospective CS majors here: be wary. CS is going to become infinitely more competitive in the coming decade (much more than it already is). Just stay ahead of the curve and you'll be fine.

* A thicket which has no rivers above, below, left, or right of it, is worth 2 points. 

* A thicket with 1 adjacency is worth 4 points.

* A thicket with 2 adjacency is worth 8 points.

* A thicket with 3 adjacency is worth 12 points.

* A thicket with full (4) adjacency is worth 16 points.

The best my algorithm has found so far yielded 224 points: https://loopherolayout.xyz/?c=111221211211211211212211211212212112112122121211212121121112 but then someone was able to modify that solution by hand to come up with a 234 point solution, but we've still no idea if that's optimal: https://loopherolayout.xyz/?c=111221211211211211211211211211211212212121121112111211211122

(Notice what a valid river looks like, you can't simply create a checkerboard, it must begin on one edge of the region and be contiguous with no backtracking.)

Does anyone have any ideas on if there are possible improvements to this algorithm? I attempted to memoize it by storing the score of the board in a ConcurrentHashMap, but very quickly had a 30 GB+ Map and even for much smaller areas where the non-memoized implementation sped through them, the memoized version struggled. 

The only optimization I could think of was that in the case of the 5x14 problem, we only need to exhaustively search 8 unique starting positions, as everything else should be a mirror of these 8 marked positions: https://loopherolayout.xyz?c=111001000010000100001000010000000000000000000000000000000000

I've sort of got a feeling there is no good known algorithm for something like this, but I found the problem interesting enough from a computer science perspective that I wanted to get other peoples' thoughts. Thanks!",2021-03-14 03:33:28

jvc2ah,"Why aren't RISC architectures like SPARC, Alpha and PowerPC used anymore?","A while ago, large companies selling non-PC workstations and servers switched to RISC CPUs, with some developing their own. Sun moved from 68k to their own SPARC. DEC moved from VAX to their own Alpha. SGI moved from 68k to MIPS. Also, IBM made PowerPC and Apple moved from 68k to PowerPC.

Back then people said CISC was obsolete and RISC was the future.  Right now SPARC, Alpha and I guess PowerPC are dead. MIPS is only used for embedded systems. Meanwhile, x86 remains extremely popular, though now running 64 bit code. 

Why did all those RISC architectures fail?

Seems like besides x86, ARM is the only other really popular and architecture used on many different devices. It's used in countless embedded and Android devices, there are ARM systems you could use as a personal computer, and now Apple is switching to ARM.

cyete9,Why do people still prefer Java?,"So, I had to learn Java for School a few years ago. Back then I thought ""okay, I can see why people use Java"", as I only used C and C++ before that. But now I had to learn C# for my job and for a little side-/learning-project I tried to use Java in my free time. Tried, because freaking hell did I feel limited using java. I noticed C# can do EVERYTHING that java does....often better, too. And for some stuff, there are dedicated languages or other languages that can do all that better than Java and better than C#.

&#x200B;

Some people even go as far as saying ""Java is far better than C#"", but I myself can't find an objective reason for that. I can't find anything C# is worse at other than maybe XPlatform GUI programming, which isn't a big deal in Java anyway and became very rare, but I found a lot in C# that made my life as a programmer a lot simpler and just worked better or faster with C#.

So...is this all just this kindergarden ""I prefer this language because I prefer this language! and that's why your language sucks!"" nonesense or do I miss something very important? Why do people prefer Java almost everywhere instead of a dedicated language that is focused on helping with their problem or even just C#, as even if it is ""just as good"" for the job, the chances are high that the program turns out faster",2019-09-01 20:04:18

Hello,

I wrote a conversational style book on linear algebra with humor, visualisations, numerical example, and real-life applications.

The book is structured more like a story than a traditional textbook, meaning that every new concept that is introduced is a consequence of knowledge already acquired in this document.

It starts with the definition of a vector and from there it goes all the way to the principal component analysis and the single value decomposition. Between these concepts you will learn about:

* vectors spaces, basis, span, linear combinations, and change of basis
* the dot product
* the outer product
* linear transformations
* matrix and vector multiplication
* the determinant
* the inverse of a matrix
* system of linear equations
* eigen vectors and eigen values
* eigen decomposition

The aim is to drift a bit from the rigid structure of a mathematics book and make it accessible to anyone as the only thing you need to know is the Pythagorean theorem, in fact, just in case you don't know or remember it here it is:

I feel like I am at a point where I am not a beginner in Python, however when I try to move from short scripts or notebooks to larger hobby projects(like bots). I find it hard to write good code and structure it in a way that's efficient. 

A friend of mine mentioned that I should look into Object-Oriented Programming. Which seems like a good direction. However, when I look at other people's work I still see them doing things that I have never learned before. Like creating virtual environments and structuring their directory system in logical ways. Including libraries and packages. Usually, they use \_\_init\_\_ files and store their functions in utils files. They always use version control and often run their programs through batch files.

I am wondering if you guys know of any useful resources that provide an overview of all these methods to create properly engineered software. Right now I am looking things up on the internet as I encounter them. But I believe I am still missing a lot of useful information that I haven't thought about.

I called them out on it in the beginning, realized I was out-numbered, and that it was better for my mental health to just leave as the culture was becoming increasingly toxic. I left on good terms.

Since I made a lot of contributions to this project that are still used in the product, should I still list myself as a co-founder or a founding developer? we went through an accelerator together and I also helped with fundraising, pitching, applying to accelerators & grants, and other financial stuff. I was not paid unlike the other developers/designers and offered sweat equity like the other co-founders.

tl;dr co-founder who left startup they were with for 2 years and left 2 months ago wants to know what title to list on resume",2019-03-01 03:50:53
aszqpi,What is a Framework? A bit dumb and in-depth may be.,"So i've been self-teaching about computer sciences and programming languages. Came accross with the term of framework a lot. I got the main concept of it. But is it right to possibly say that a framework is a bunch of functions based on the preferred language collected in a package to make things easier for the developer? If so, why there are some people/companies releasing out frameworks? Wouldn't they have to be similar in some aspects anyways? I get there might be differences in terms of efficiency but aren't those functions just bunch of code blocks anyways? So where does the competition coming from and why there are so many versions? They can be improved and become the best state it could ever become and at some point every framework wouldn't be the same? May be it won't because not every problem is similar to each other? I don't know...

Note that i asked all my questions accepting the framework is a collection of functions thosr do a certain job on said language. 
If this isn't the case please enlighten me.

Hello, I am a current freshman in college and math isnt my strong suit (ever since 10th grade ive not been able to perform where I would have liked) but I love coding, problem solving with programs, etc and am worried that my lack in math genius will hinder my growth as a computer scientist and maybe even land me in not so great jobs. does Calc really play a huge role in CS (and if not in general in which fields does it play out?). and is calc the most important math to know for cs?

im not too great in tests, even more so when no calculators are permitted. but in a real world application, we would have so many things to reference. But at the same time I feel I can understand the underlying concepts pretty well. Like tell me to explain something/how to do it I can, but then ask me to actually do it i get kinda stuck

2zs17q,How do CPUs run timers etc without saturating themselves? Where can a layman go to learn a little about this?,"Okay, this is a dumb question, I know. [This is me.](http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx09a8Pdhg1qb9pa3o1_500.gif)

If I write a piece of code that simply says

    wait 10 seconds
    print(""Hello"")

and keep an eye on my system stats, I notice that my CPU remains at only 1-2% execution.

This makes intuitive sense, because that's not a complicated task. But what is the CPU actually 'thinking' during that time? I can't really conceive of how it would be anything other than

    while(true)
        if it's been 10 seconds
            print(""Hello"")

a billion times per second, occupying every single instruction and incrementing some counter. That's obviously not what the CPU's doing, so what *is* it doing? Can the CPU know to wait *X* period of time before repeating an instruction? What's going on under there?

Related question: could anyone recommend an online lecture series, a book, or some other free/low-cost resource for learning a bit about this kind of thing?

m2c1sn,Big-O-Notation Confusion,"I've read multiple sources on the subject and while I get the general idea of Big-O-Notation, there are certain things about Big-O-Notation that don't make sense and which lead me to doubt my understanding of the concept. 

For example, my textbook says to ""Note that for small values 
of n, the exponential function is smaller than all of the others. As shown, it is not until n reaches 20 that the linear function is smaller than the quadratic"".

But for f(n), f(20) = 20, while for f(2^n), f(2^20) = 1048576. So what the hell? Last time I checked, 1,048,576 is greater than 20.

Something else I don't understand is if you have 100 simple statements that do the same thing, that's equivalent to having a for loop that executes one of those statements 100 times. But we say the simple statements have a complexity of O(1) while the for loop has a complexity of O(n), implying that, in general, the O(1) takes less time than the O(n). But they do the same thing, so how is that supposed to make any sense at all?

Is this because checking conditions in the loop takes time? If that's the case, why does nobody bring this up??? It's confusing as hell.",2021-03-10 23:24:10

However, I don't understand how building multiple such indexes doesn't blow up the storage space (i.e. it looks like in the example below we will need to create a tree of IDs and pointers to the database entries, then a tree of dates of birth and pointers to the database entries, and then a tree of names and pointers to the database entries - thus having to duplicate lots of data).

First of all, I know that OSI is a ""fictional"" model, it means the model is used to teach people how the Internet works (data transferring). We have TCP/IP model that we use in real life instead of using OSI. TCP/IP is the same model as OSI but it combines some layers into one layer. Okay, now let's talk about how the OSI model works. I guess you can help me if I say something wrong. I just want to show my understanding of this topic and I want you to tell me if something's wrong. Okay?

1. Physical layer - here we have physical cables that are used to transfer data from your device(pc, mobile phone, etc) to the modem or something that has the right exit to the Internet. These protocols will help us to do that: Ethernet.
2. Data link layer - obtained data is checked for some errors and then the data will be divided into frames.
3. Network layer - those frames are used to package them into packets those will be transferred on the Internet to a specific IP address.
4. Transport layer - here we have, for example, TCP/UDP protocols those provide and control transferring our packets to the specific IP address.
5. Session layer - this layer represents sessions, it means what our devices(A and B) will be doing during transferring data. For instance, how long they will be waiting and etc.
6. Presentation layer - obtained data on ""B"" device will be decrypted.
7. Application layer - this layer formats decrypted data into something that a user can see (photo, video, audio, etc). For example, HTTPS does that for you. It can show you decrypted data on a web page as photo, text, video, etc.

In addition to that, TPC/IP just combines Physical and Data link layers together and Session, Presentation and Application layers also combines together.

I can't choose where I should start focusing in my computer science studies, I am on my second year. I should at this point start to take optional courses for my studies, but can't make up my mind and been even avoiding courses because I haven't decided where to focus.

What is your opinion, should I pursue in cyber security/IT side of things, or software development? Machine learning sounds interesting too, but I am a bit bad at math.

pzgs1z,What do computer science students learn that electrical/computer engineering students don't?,"I have worked for several years as an electrical engineer, dealing with circuits and hardware as well as performing a fair amount of software design (embedded system firmware, Python scripting, LabVIEW, etc). But I'm considering possibilities for finding more software-oriented jobs in the future, and I'm wondering what it is that CS students learned that I never touched.

My EE curriculum included a hefty dose of mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, statistical analysis and the like), plus a decent chunk of programming coursework. I learned how to program in C and C++, and between my study of digital hardware design, embedded system design, and computer architecture, I think I have a pretty comprehensive grasp of how computers work and what they can do.

My counterparts on the computer engineering side would have swapped out a couple of niche EE courses for some software-focused classes, but are otherwise not too much more exposed to software design than I am.

So what did CS students learn that I didn't? Does that consist of a deep study of algorithms? Particular fields of mathematics? Advanced software design practices and paradigms? If I want to be a competitive applicant for a software job (at, for the sake of argument, Microsoft or Google), what topics might I want to specifically target for self-study?",2021-10-01 20:47:16

n11f3u,Will programming become generally easier to do but harder to be paid well to perform?,"1. Popularizing and glamorizing IT, programming and  generally STEM as a whole, at the expense of other professions such as  medicine, law, humanities, etc. IT programs for kids, for high schoolers, etc. I don't think that programs such as ""coding for kids"" are created for the strict benefit of children, it's mostly PR. Children would better benefit from being taught life skills that most of us lack even when we're old (dieting, sleeping well, financing, retirement income, stress-management, etc.) and then being show a non-biased overview of the sciences and humanities.
2. A focus on hiring migrant workers at lower wages and offshoring. And I say this as someone who migrated to a different country, I'm not a right-winger.
3. Tools  and technologies such as Stack Overflow, machine learning, automated  programming, code-less programming, higher and higher levels of  abstraction (functional paradigm, containerization, more and more  packages and libraries), a lack of care about bug-free software (except  in specific industries such as aeronautics or military), etc. These  tools made programming and IT apparently simpler and you are no longer  required to have a strong, firm grasp on every concept that you're  flailing around and sticking together with duct tape.
4. IT  solves more problems than we create. Imagine getting a job in IT 30  years ago. Some languages, frameworks or programs had way less libraries  and packages and solutions as we have today. People could brag about  writing a library with which you could solve simple integrals or some  other mathematical problem. You could work on a simple 3D game engine.  You could write drivers for Linux. Implement some thing or another.  There were far more opportunities than today. Today, Linux works on  almost any device imaginable (provided the arch is supported, mainly).  Most  languages contain libraries and packages for almost any thing, you  just type ""import neural network"" or ""import statistics"", or ""import  game\_engine"", ""import http\_server"", etc. This point is so important,  that if you boot up Linux and open the terminal, most of the common  programs you'll use were invented MANY decades ago. GREP was invented in  1973, vim in 1991, etc. And you'll be surprised how many modern  concepts and technologies are basically rehashes of what we had back in  the 70s or 80s. Hell, functional programming got a lot more popular  years ago, but it's actually really old news: lambda calculus was  invented by Church in the 1930s. The idea of containerization stems back  from the modular philosophy of Unix.

Regarding point number (4), this is also because a general improvement in technology. We wouldn't have had Stack Overflow without fast internet connection, WiFi (you can google stuff on your phone almost anywhere), cheap data, fast computers, etc.

Note,  I'm not claiming that there's a single ""evil entity"" orchestrating all  of this. It's just that, economically speaking, there's a collective  interest among the employers (companies, organizations, governments,  etc.) to lower the wages by investing in (1), (2) and (3) and (4). There are also technological improvements and even social improvements (globalization, pro-immigration) that build this trend. Call it a ""trend"" if you will. Simple  problems are getting easier to solve, problems that are left are the  ones that are very difficult to solve, and the trend goes on in this  direction, while more people are thrown at the problems.

jlexn5,Do online multiplayer games use both TCP and UDP?,"**TL;DR**

* **Shooting game example**
* **Bullet hit data over TCP ( has to be right )**
* **Player locations data over UDP (has to be latest)**


To take a shooting game for an example you can't lose data like who shot whom. Therefore my guess is data related to shooting and hitting other players are transmitted over TCP.

But when it comes to where each player is, it doesn't matter where the player was some few seconds ago. What's important is a player's latest location even if it meant that the player looks like suddenly teleported a few meters. So my guess is players' location details are transmitted over UDP.

Is my guess correct?

4zcfim,I processed fingerprints. How do I compare the results ?,"Hi,

*Full disclosure: I also asked this on Stackoverflow. Does it make me greedy ?*

I'm a trying to compare fingerprints. Here's what I got so far.

1. Get the raw image from a digitalPersona sensor. [image](http://imgur.com/tWhAXEp)

2. Binarize it. [image](http://imgur.com/1mEU1w0)

3. Skeletonize it. I used Hall's algorithm because that is the only one I got to work more or less properly. You can still see some flaws. [image](http://imgur.com/SxzDd1q)

4. Strip the convex hull (inverted Jarvis algorithm) and get all the ridge endings as an array of (i, j) coordinates (points with one neighbour only). I also have a script to get the bifurcations (3 neighbours). [representation of ridge endings only](http://imgur.com/Jt5TVab)

**What I need :** knowing that I can get these so-called minutiae (ridge endings and also bifurcations, which are not represented on the image) and also a direction for each point (e.g. direction of ridge for the ridge ending), how do I match two sets of minutiae and give a similarity score ?

**Tools and languages used:** digitalParsona U.are.U 4500 scanner, fprint library on linux, C for image aquisition, Python3 with PIL for image processing.

**My thoughts so far :**

* I can neglect  the finger rotation for now, but I probably need to normalize the sets to compensate the (x, y) shifts between two images of the same finger.
* Maybe I could transform the sets so that they have the same barycenter, but I don't know how well that will work.
* I could create a matrix of intensities for each set (e.g 5 on a point, 4 around the point, etc) so as to get something that could be represented like [this but with more spikes (best image I could find right now)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BAiSL.png) and if A minus B gives me a pretty flat surface (mathematically, that could be a low sum of squares of values in the resulting matrix) I will know that the images look alike.

**How do you think I could compare to such sets ?**

I tried to show you that I really did put some effort in this and am not trying to get you to do the work for me ;)

My coursework thus far was a mix of computer science, electrical engineering and computer hardware mix, but I mostly was inspired by software development and I am actively pursuing internships in the field. 

I had some interviews proceed to the final stage, but unfortunately no offer for now and I think it's because of the way I code. I can come up with the solution pretty quickly but I don't think I have the most optimal code and I make rookie mistakes cause while in my free time I always relied on stack overflow to get simple things like initialization of objects, etc. Also I have been working on python for the last year and my c++ is kinda rusty, so I really want to dive deep and understand the underlying structures.

I feel that I am really experienced with coding fundamentals and data structures, but I am lost in terms of how c++ works in the background, and I feel that I should improve this to give myself better opportunities but to also write better code.

In [this](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/52659/vertices-edges-vs-nodes-links) Stackexchange post someone posed a similar question, but no one really answered **why** (or if) the edge terminology is superior to other terminologies (other than it just being the convention everyone settled on). Unlike that post, I don't have any issue with the ""edge"" terminology - I am more-so curious. I find this term unintuitive - and I suspect that lack of intuition is indicative of a hole in my understanding of graph theory. Are there problems whereby the terms ""connection"" or ""link"" would not make sense and ""edge"" would?

mn4d8i,"I have three questions regarding computers: 1. How do 8-bit computers have more than 256 bytes of RAM, 2. How does an 8-bit computer display pixel on a monitor, and another question about operand/op-code logistics","Hello Everyone, I am learning about computers and have a few questions about 8-bit computers (inspired by learning about the Commodore's).

&#x200B;

Question 1:

How does an 8-bit computer have more than 256 bytes of RAM? because 8 bits can only have 256 combinations, the memory addresses must only have around 256 bytes, considering that 8-bit computers can only have 256 possible memory addresses for each byte of RAM.

If this isn't true, how does it really work, and if it is true, how do/did 8-bit computers get around that? (such as the commodore 64 having 64kB of RAM, and 20kB of ROM).

 Question 2:

How do computers (focusing on 8 bit, but all computers) display pixels on a screen. After watching some videos and reading some books, I learned that the computer outputs the letter or number to the display, but how does that monitor know where to go, how big, and how far apart each character is? Is it the monitor doing the work or the computer, and if it is the monitor how does the monitor deal with different clock speeds?

Question 3:

I learned that computer instructions are split up in two ways:  


1. in an 8 bit computer, the first four bits are op-codes, which get passed through a decoder, and the last four bits are the operand, (eg: STORE | 14 == 1010 | 1110)
2. (according to another video I found)  all 8 bits are the op-code, then the next instruction to pass through is the operand, (eg: STORE | 10110100 then 14 | {0010}1110)

\^ that storing the number as an integer

&#x200B;

The first one I understand, but the latter I do not. How does the computer remember that the next byte is meant to be an operand instead of an instruction, or an instruction instead of an operand?",2021-04-08 23:27:23

hmy593,Determine number of tries in probabilistic Turing machine,"Hi,

I'm studying for a test for complexity theory, and I've been learning about the probabilistic Turing machine. We discussed that running the machine more often creates more certainty about if we're dealing with a yes-instance or a no-instance. I want to derive a formula to describe the certainty of an instance being the yes-instance given the output of a number of runs. This formula depends on how often the PTM thought it was a no-instance, and how often it thought it was a yes-instance.

Because the TM is probabilistic, the results are not perfect. Querying the PTM with a yes-instance has a probability of `k` of resulting into True, the no-instances have a probability of `l` of resulting into False.  This leads to the following confusion matrix.

|input \\ output|True|False|
|:-|:-|:-|
|True|k|1 - k|
|False|1 - l|l|

How could I derive the certainty of an instance being a yes-instance after a number of tries? My ideal formula would look like a function that gets higher between \[0,1\] when the PTM rules as a yes-instance, and lower when the PTM rules as a no-instance.

&#x200B;

What I did myself:

I think this should be solved with the bayes rule, given we know the following (I is yes-instance of input, \~I is no-instance of input, same holds for O).

P(O|I) = k             (The probability of recognizing the input as a yes-instance is k)

P(\~O|\~I) = l         (The probability of recognizing the input as a no-instance is l)

Using the [Bayes Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem), it should be possible to derive P(I|O) and P(\~I|\~O), but I can't seem to find out how. This is because I thinkDoes anyone know how?

I am also not sure about how to use P(I|O) and P(\~I|\~O) to generate the formula I have in mind, but I have a feeling its the right way.

It occurs to me that a number of things about this scenario seem to just flat out contradict basic facts of computer science like the fact that Turing completeness guarantees that anything one Turing-complete computer can do, amother Turing-complete computer can do in principle given enough time, power, storage etc. Daru shouldn't need the actual IBN 5100 to be able to translate anything.

But then it turns out we need C to parse / request things via HTTP, something which is directly related to web-browsing, so why isn't Javascript capable of handling this itself?

Generally speaking, I am having difficulty understanding why some languages are capable of doing some things with your system and others are not.

3ngqk5,Best/easy way to learn Z-Notation?,"Hi. I have been studying my honours for software engineering in Namibia (a small country in Africa). 
&nbsp;

We had been given this semester a course called Formal Methods which focuses on Z-Notation. Problem is this subject was delayed due to a lack of a professor who could teach Z - Theory. Finally a professor was found, but it turns out he doesn't know how to teach. We are a class of about 16 students and none of us have  a clue what is going on in the classes. Sadly the lecturer doesn't seem to pick up on this as a problem. We have been trying to teach ourselves but we can't find any good online sources for learning Z-Notation. Closest we got was this book found at this link. 

&nbsp;
http://www.usingz.com/text/zedbook.pdf
&nbsp;

However we find this book very difficult to understand and seems to move very fast without giving us time to understand the concepts. I am hoping that maybe someone here knows where we could find a good source for learning Z-Notation easily. Exams are in under two months and we are in a bit of a panic.

&nbsp;

If this is the wrong place to ask can you please direct us to the right place we can ask for this information? I understand this seems a little late however we have even tried getting tutors in our country and even then they only have a slight understanding due to only having done some studies on probability and inference rules.

&nbsp;

Any help would be greatly appreciated by me and my colleagues.

38jkdw,"Why is it on stackoverflow, the C and C++ guys are helpful and nice, but the RubyOnRails guys are anal, dismissive and unwelcoming to outsiders?","I feel like reading the CPP/Java or anything else that isn't rails is a great way for a person to learn the deeper design of each language. Many guys in the C sections are like general purpose educators and love to debate and discuss various approaches to interesting or even boring problems. 

Then comes the RoR stackoverflow guys, any question asked is automatically voted down, then you're told that ""it's in the docs"" even when it's not. Or questioned on why you would want to do that or this. Also whenever I post self written code instead of helping me see a potential error the response is always ""There is a Gem for that!"".But I don't like using Gems unless needed since they often have lots of dependencies that can cause errors during development or even later down the line. 

I feel like the rails community kinda rubs me the wrong way, it's as if they don't like writing code or finding original solutions to their unique problem. And they seem very exclusionary as if they see newcomers as a threat.

I understand that keeping them directly in the source code is an issue, because open sourcing your code would expose the secret information. What about keeping secret information in a separate file from your program, never checked into source control, and reading the information in on program start? Seems that this method would prevent your secrets from being exposed unless your server was backdoor'd. Would an environment variable be inaccessible to a hacker who has backdoor'd your server, thus making it more secure?

Finally, this secret info must be stored somewhere in plain text, correct?

My favorite thing to do with code is to solve puzzles and think logically. So I thought I would do well in subjects like Physics and Calculus. I was so wrong, these subjects take the most time from me and I do poorly in them. 

I don't do badly in discrete math though, in fact, that with my data structures class are the only ones I do well in even with minimal effort. Discrete math just seems like a puzzle-based math that has many parallels to programming. I like to call it ""theoretical programming"". The sub-topics are so interesting that I wish to take an upper-level form of them, but can't without going through the Calculus series. 

I just don't do well with computational heavy subjects. Calculus isn't hard to understand, but since it's just so memorization heavy I don't do well in it. Since I don't understand why the deriv. of cot(x) is -csc^(2)x (not sth this basic but you get the idea), I'm bound to make mistakes. As for physics I seriously can't grasp it... I don't know why.

hao85l,What would be the easiest way to test the equivalence of a new language with the WHILE language?,"Hi everyone, for the last year I have been working on a simple 2D video game editor. Even though I have been able to implement any game that I have tried so far, I would like to theoretically validate its generality. My idea is to validate it by checking its equivalence with the WHILE language (is quite similar) or by proving that it is Turing Complete.

The games produced by the editor have these features:

* There is just one game object type. As an analogy of the agents in a multi-agent system.
* They share the same set of properties (geometric, rendering, physics, audio, etc.), and they can also store new properties (numeric and boolean) if needed.
* Each game object can have as many scripts as needed. They are executed sequentially.
* Scripts are defined as binary decision trees (with an IF-THEN-ELSE nested structure) composed by conditions and actions.
* Conditions are used to guide the script flow, and they rely on boolean expressions with relational operators (=, !=, <, <=, >=, >). There are no logical operators such as AND or OR. The editor provides just 5 different conditions.
* Actions are the elements that create or destroy game objects or modify their properties. Its operation is based on arithmetic expressions. In total, the editor has only 6 different types of actions.
* Also, the editor does not allow the use of complex data structures such as vectors or lists.

The differences between my language and the WHILE language:

* It has no loops. Instead, it relies on the continuous evaluation of the game loop. In this way, there is a global implicit loop.
* It has no SKIP command.

Until today, I have been able to complete the development of all the games that I have tried. Some of them are well-known arcade games like Asteroids, Blocks, Frogger, Lunar Lander, Pacman, Pong, Tetris, or MarioBros. I have not found any that I could not develop so far. I have even implemented the A\* algorithm.

With all this, what would be the easiest way to test equivalence with the WHILE language? I want to formally verify and demonstrate that my language allows me to make any game.",2020-06-17 09:54:52

dus2y1,Why isn't Intel/TSMC/Samsung using x-ray lithography?,"I don't know what I'm missing. We have the ability to do x-ray lithography with a 2.9 nm nitrogen plasma or something smaller, but instead fabs are all migrating to EUV lithography with a 13.5 nm tin plasma.

&#x200B;

This occurred to me again today when I was watching this video:

[https://youtu.be/3eTogq7rknQ?t=1376](https://youtu.be/3eTogq7rknQ?t=1376)

Around the 23 min. mark Mike Campbell says:

>All integrated circuitry is done with lasers. Actually, now it's using x-rays made with laser-heated matter.

&#x200B;

I mean, that's the way it seems like it should be done, but even if he has a new 2019 phone with a 7 nm A13 or Snapdragon 855 it's still made with EUV lithography.

&#x200B;

The spectrum goes visible => ultraviolet => x-rays => gamma rays

DUV = Deep Ultraviolet lithography (193 nm ArF excimer laser)

EUV = Extreme Ultraviolet lithography (13.5 nm CO2 laser‚ÄìSn plasma source)

EUV goes down to 10 nm, and soft x-rays are 10 nm down to 0.2 nm.

&#x200B;

X-ray lithography can be done several ways:

3.5 nm krypton laser-plasma source  
2.9 nm or 2.5 nm nitrogen laser-plasma source  
2 ‚Äì 0.2 nm (2√Ö) synchrotron source

...and e-beam sources which I think have several wavelength options are used in x-ray lithography.

&#x200B;

Intel's 10 nm node uses DUV lithography, and they're switching to EUV lithography in 2021 for the 7 nm node. Maybe they're being sneaky and they'll actually switch to x-ray?

Samsung/TSMC have already started using EUV. For the foreseeable future (down to 3 nm in 2023) everybody is using EUV lithography.

It sounds like EUV ‚Äî especially with advances in faster Inverse Lithography (ILT) ‚Äî can keep going for several generations.

And I keep hearing that quantum tunnelling is the big issue that's going to make die shrinks impossible, but then those problems always seem to get solved. For example, GAA FETs solve quantum problems at the 3 nm node.

&#x200B;

Eventually they'll be using x-ray lithography because they'll have to. Because physics. Then they'll use a plasma source with a higher wavelength than tin and they'll call it XRL instead of EUVL.

But why not do it now? Why move to EUV in the first place?

Retooling to a different wavelength source is a big expense, but then you can go for several generations with the same light source, so why is everybody retooling for EUV instead of going straight from DUV to XRL?

For example, DUV uses the same 193 nm excimer laser used in LASIK procedures. That's a good wavelength, because when you go shorter than 193 nm you have to pump the oxygen out of the room because oxygen likes to absorb UV <180 nm. So I assume if you're using a 13.5 nm EUV source you've already solved that problem.

Most of the 'innovation' I see ‚Äî and the struggles I hear about them overcoming ‚Äî have been related to trying to make 10 nm features with a 193 nm laser. It sure seems like they'd be making their lives a lot simpler by using x-ray lithography and eliminating the need for all that.

Thinking about all the effort being put into multiple patterning makes me wonder why they wouldn't just switch to XRL. LELE double-patterning. SADP with spacers. Now Intel is using quad-patterning with spacers, and Samsung is doing LELELE patterning! Doing everything 3 times is such a waste of time and money. Does Samsung just want 7 nm bragging rights?

&#x200B;

People have apparently been experimenting with x-ray lithography for over 30 years, but we're not bothering to use it for much. I think I saw that in the 1990s it was being used to make parts for uranium enrichment.

I see papers back to 1990 talking about XRL for 4.5 nm and smaller:

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016793179090122A?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016793179090122A?via%3Dihub)

And here's one from 1992 which specifically talks about XRL for large-scale manufacturing:

[https://avs.scitation.org/doi/10.1116/1.585945](https://avs.scitation.org/doi/10.1116/1.585945)

I found tons of papers from the early 1980s about laser-plasma sources for x-ray lithography. This one is from 1978:

[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978SPIE..135...46N/abstract](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978SPIE..135...46N/abstract)

&#x200B;

But ... again, most of the 'innovation' I see, and the struggles I hear them overcoming in lithography are related to trying to make 10 nm features with a 193 nm laser. It sure seems like they'd be making their lives a lot simpler by using x-ray lithography!",2019-11-11 13:02:23

cgl01g,Efficiency: Recursion vs Iteration,"Hi, I've been doing a lot of leetcode problems, and I've noticed that when my solution utilized recursion, it would not be efficient/fast enough (causing the program to exceed to the time limit). As a result, I changed my programs to use iteration, and they worked. Recently, however, I came across a problem that accepted the recursive solution but not the iterative solution (the iterative solution was too inefficient). When it comes to efficiency, is there a right answer between recursion and iteration?

Thanks in advance.

&#x200B;

Edit:

Thanks for everyone's responses; I really appreciate it.

For those interested, below is a link to the problem and screenshots of my iterative solution and the recursive solution.

bh9pr9,I feel lost,"I am a senior in high school and have taken several computer science courses. I really enjoy programming and working with computers however at the moment, I feel lost. I am currently taking AP Computer Science A where we use Java. In the beginning of the year, the labs and assignments were easy for me. I felt confident in my ability to program in this class until now. Recently the past couple of labs I haven't been able to complete. I end up just staring at my screen with no clue on what to do. I used to think I was ahead of my classmates for having more experience programming. I underestimated my classmates. Everyone else has been able to complete these labs and I don't even know what to do. All of this has made me feel incredibly discouraged in my ability to write code and solve problems. I want to go into cs in college but am feeling like I may not be able to. I wish to improve my computer science skills but I am lost on how to do that. I don't really know how to practice programming on my own time. Is there hope for me? I want to know how to improve, learn more, and regain my confidence. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your support. It has helped me a lot in just the day since I've posted this. I will take a lot of your suggestions into consideration.

a1a98x,How do basic Calculus concepts apply to Computer Science and programming?,"Hello all, I'm a freshman in college taking Calc 1 and majoring in Computer Science. I have a paper coming up in which I have to talk about how Calculus (especially Calc 1) relates to my major. So, I was wondering if you guys could help me with this question. So, far I have talked about how Calculus is important to develop problem solving skills that will be used a lot when writing programs and how having a grasp of Calculus and math in general can help you write more efficient code when it relates to solving a problem that involves math (I guess this is kinda obvious...)

I want to go into more detail and give specific ways that Calculus is used in Comp Sci, but I'm kinda stumped. I've been reading into it, and it seems like the main way in which I can relate the Calculus I've learned so far to Comp Sci is with optimizing algorithms by using big O notation which is related to integrals. Maybe I can talk about simulated physics (this uses Calc right?)

x96vws,"Considering the rising popularity of Rust, the development of Carbon, and all the attention being placed on memory safety, modules vs. headers, more concise and readable syntax, etc... why does D seem to get no attention?","tl;dr- D seems to have most of what people want from things like Rust and Carbon, and excludes many things that people do not like about C and C++, so why isn't D getting more consideration and attention?
 
-
 
I've been meaning to learn D since like 2006. Just never got around to it. The few times I've tried the compilers wouldn't work for Windows or Linux. But a little while back I saw the GDC compiler for D and decided to give it another shot. It worked, I've done a few small prototypes in D, and it's rivaling Object Pascal as my preferred language (don't laugh at me).
 
I tried to get into Rust several months ago, but it just rubs me the wrong way. On paper, the syntax sounds nice, as does memory safety, but in practice it's cumbersome and uglier to me than the hackiest C++ I've ever written. People are claiming (in hyperbole I'd hope) that Rust will replace C++, because it doesn't allow you to fall into the menory traps of C and C++ and provides a more readable syntax and productivity. I have doubts there. I don't think that I want to try to get close to the hardware with Rust.
 
Then we have Google over here, developing Carbon as a C++ replacement (maybe not their words), essentially producing an easier and safer C++ while still being verbose and powerful.
 
It's obvious that people just do not like C and C++. I like C++ and tend to dislike most higher abstractions, but I can totally understand why a younger generation of programmers who may never get close to metal or do any systems programming, and are expected to be productive right off the bat (and their employers) would prefer higher abstractions like Java, Kotlin, Python, etc... It's just easier to sit down, jam out some code and have it work.
 
So why not D? It has a memory safe subset, optional garbage collection, easier syntax, was developed with ""I don't like this about C++"" in mind, has the vast majority of features and functionality of most any other language people typically use, is well suited to really any area of programming (obvious lack of extensive 3rd party libraries keeps it from being especially useful out of the box, like how Python has morphed into a data science and AI language due to its wide adoption and 3rd party libraries), IT HAS MODULES, etc...
 
It seems like D should just about cover all the bases for the Rust people, the people looking forward to carbon, and the people who hate C++. Why isn't/wasn't D what Rust and Carbon want to be? Was it just not introduced at a time when people had a reason to care, like Rust and Carbon? What gives?",2022-09-08 17:43:48

jwisjb,When will we be accurately able to simulate sound in physics simulations?,"We've been able to simulate physics for complex 3D geometries for a while now, and technology for simulating light in raytracing has been getting better and more hardware accelerated.

Now more recently fluid simulations and tearing simulations have gotten much better :  and even [https://youtu.be/5ePD83StI6A](https://youtu.be/5ePD83StI6A) faster : [https://youtu.be/F0QwAhUnpr4](https://youtu.be/F0QwAhUnpr4)

&#x200B;

My question is, why can't we simulate sound yet? I've been googling simulated sounds in physics and can't find a single thing, why can't we simulate vectorized vibrations like we can light in ray-tracing? Is it too computation intensive? I think being able to simulate accurate sound for pennies dropping, cars driving, for friction of objects sliding across each-other etc and having these real-time unique sounds would be extremely useful.

Here are a few that I thought of myself:

1. not using version control and not understanding why it would be valuable

2. not understanding why you'd ever want anything to be immutable (e.g. ""Why would I ever make anything constant?! What if I want to change it later? It's more convenient and smart to just always leave everything mutable all the time."")

3. not understanding how to use boolean expressions in functions, and instead only returning true or false inside if-then-else blocks (This tends to indicate that the programmer doesn't actually fully understand how expressions work in the programming language, in my experience.)

4. thinking deep inheritance hierarchies are a good thing and a sign of high levels of ""code reuse""

5. not being able to think in terms of invariants and writing code in a ritualistic way to keep themselves ""safe""

The rules are that it has to be something ""indirect"" in some sense (loosely). It can't just be ""writing really bad broken code"" or ""not knowing the basic keywords of the language"" etc.

2j4hgv,How far will a compiler go to pre-calculate a value at compile time?,"Yeah, that's a really vague question, here's what I'm really wondering about. When I write code I often wonder what the compiler will do with it. I'm going to write my examples in Python even though it's not a compiled language, because I don't know any compiled languages.

So let's say I write the following code:

    a = 10
    print a

If this were written in C I'm sure the compiler would turn it into:

    print 10

Because the value of `a` will always be `10`, no matter what. There's no reason to devote a memory address or a register to a value that'll never change. But what about if I do something more complex like this?

    def make_a_list(arg):
        # function with no side-effects, make_a_list(foo) is always == to make_a_list(foo)

    a = make_a_list(10)
    print a

Is the compiler smart enough to know that `make_a_list(10)` can be run at compile time, and be completely removed from the program itself? Effectively turning the whole program into this:

    print [result of make_a_list(10) here, calculated and ready to go]

Also, if compilers can't do this, why not? They already know how code works so why not compile it and then run some snippits of the code, see what they return, and then remove the code after running it once?",2014-10-13 15:52:42

upt246,Should I give up on a CS major?,"Same background:  I am a second year college student currently majoring in CS.  When I started college CS was my major, then I dropped it in the second trimester, and picked it up again.  In that time in between I mostly took classes related to history and political science, so I suppose those would be my other options for a major.

Onto my dilemma: I think I did pretty well in my last CS class, which was based around Python.  If I remember right I got an 88 or 89 in the class.  I needed help from time to time, but unlike c++ it didn't feel like a foreign language to me.  That bring me to my current problem.  I am currently in a c++ class, which I did alright in at first, but these last 2 or 3 assignments have had me completely lost, often spending hours trying to finish them only to accomplish literally nothing in that time.  I also am constantly asking for help.  I need an 85 in this class to move on to the next one, and I probably won't get an 85.

I don't want to quit computer science, but am at my wit's end and quite frankly don't think I can do it, I'm not intelligent/competent/etc enough.  Should I just give up now or keep trying?  Do you think it's too late for me to change my major if I do give up?  Would repeating this class be the end of the world?",2022-05-14 23:28:46

m3od9c,Java for science?,"I know that popular choices for general scientific computation are Python, Matlab or C/C++. 

I can do some mediocre stuff in all of those languages, but:

1. Python is ""fast to write"", but the absence of data types makes it sometimes quite hard to modify more complex code, the absence of curly brackets make the code cometimes confusing (at least for me) and it is quite slow (I know that some libraries like numpy are fast, because they are C/C++)
2. C/C++ is really fast and powerful. It has lot of libraries and large community. But it is too time-consuming to write and debug (at least for me).
3. Matlab is... well... matlab. It is powerful and versatile, I admit that. But I find everything else just bad. The editor is terrible in my opinion. It is better than writing in notepad, but compared to some other IDEs (like IntelliJ Idea for example) it is just sad. The syntax is not complete disaster, but I can¬¥t say I like it either. Documentation is quite confusing and there is lot of stuff that is not documented at all. And not to mention that is is really expensive (I have university licence, otherwise I wouldn¬¥t use it at all). 

So I was wondering if Java is bad idea? Let me explain why I choose java: 

* I have a lot more experience in Java than any other language. Perhaps that is the reason that I find reading Java code clear and easy to understand. 
* I like that Java is strict (so I dont have to deal with mysterious problems only to find out that somewhere in the code I try to mupltiply string by float by mistake), but not too much to be too time consuming. That includes memory management. 
* I am really used to IntelliJ Idea and it is powerful IDE, so it is not negligible point.
* Community is also big and it has also lot of libraries. 

And of course I know that Java will not be as fast as C/C++, nor it will have as much libraries and prepared functions as Python or Matlab. 

I dont have any specific project or type of computation in mind, just overall scientific calculations. 

So do you think that Java is (un)suitable for scientific computation? If so, why? Thanks.

Most of the sessions include practicing on exercises and what I am really surprised of is my performance on them. I have strong difficulties in understanding them and haven't completed even a single exercise up to now. I provide a list of example exercises, that we are given:

**exc 1**. An integer sequence is defined as an = n2 + n + 1. Write a C++ function to check if a given integer x belongs to this sequence.

**exc 2**. Write a C++ function to print the first 20 shortest strings of the form (hh...h)*k times*(11..1)*2k times*, where k > 0.

**exc 3**. Write a C++ function to check if a string containing only '(' and ')' has a proper form with respect to opening and closing brackets.

**exc 4**. A diameter of a string array is the difference in the length of any of its longest and the length of any of its shortest elements. Write a C++ function that for a given string array calculates its diameter.

**exc 5**. Write a C++ function to check if the digits of a positive integer are sorted with respect to its decimal representation.

My questions are:  
\- Are these exercises really beginners? They seem quite difficult for me.  
\- My trainer claims that poor performance on such exercises can lead to inability to handle or even understand any real-case C++ tasks. Is this really true? Do such exercises really represent any real-case C++ tasks? If so, how?  
\- Can you give me any suggestions how should I proceed. I really want to learn basic programming in C++, but I find this course quite difficult and demotivating.

a8s45z,Computer Science or Computer Engineering?," 

Hello all, would really like some input. Note: I am only limited to these two majors due to scheduling issues, and I intend on going to grad school.

I'm at a university deciding between pure CS and CS engineering. For anyone unfamiliar with the difference, pure CS is all coding and CS engineering is half CS, half EE.

However, I also have a passion for math and would want to combine CS + Math somehow in my career. Some schools have a CS + math major, but mine doesn't. I was under the impression that CS involved a lot of math, but I spent a summer doing software engineering and it was all coding, no math. I know the AI/ML side of CS involves a lot of math. I am not too passionate about EE; i think it's interesting but it doesn't click in my mind. Coding and math click for me, and I am genuinely interested in learning more.

So here's my questions:

For those with a CS engineering degree, does your job focus on either CS or EE? I've heard there is no ""job"" that includes both, but prove me wrong.

If I want to combine CS + math (probably CS major, math minor), should I just drop CS engineering and be a pure CS major?

I chose CS engineering because I wanted to learn as much as possible, but now I'm pondering whether the EE portion would bode well for me. Has anyone felt this way? Will I be much better off focusing on CS and taking math related topics rather than learning about the hardware aspect?

Thank you. Sorry for the confusing in the thread; there's a lot of ideas bouncing around.",2018-12-23 05:13:51

He pushed back some, basically saying that if the function hierarchy gets too deep, it's difficult to debug and understand, whereas if the logic is all in the same place, it's easier to debug and understand.

I had never heard anyone push back against breaking functionality out into separate functions, and off the top of my head, I didn't really have anything to come back with.  I've thought about it over the last few days, and I'm still not sure how I can impart what I'm trying to.

I'm playing around with Unix timestamps on a MySql server, and when I do:

5cdvrn,How do people study how programming languages are used in practice?,"I recently got interested into parsing of programming languages and working on the syntax of languages led me to a number of questions. 

Designing a language is always a trade-off between expressiveness and readability. Some language designers decided to give a lot of flexibility (Scala, F#, Ruby, which all support several paradigms), while some others made the choice of making the language quite restricted so it is easier to read new code (Go, Java to some extent). However, for some very flexible languages, some syntactic sugar might not be used often in practice. 
Are there efforts to simplify the syntax of languages based on its usage? Do language designers have a systematic approach to study how the syntax of the language is used in practice? Or do they take decisions based on their own experience of the code they see in the wild?

4tk1xj,LinkedIn finds my new stranger flatmates in its suggested connections algorithm. How?,"Dear all,

Could someone explain this to me:

Last year I moved in to a rented apartment with totally random people who also found the flat on a housing ads website - we were total strangers. After a few weeks I managed to pop up on their suggested LinkedIn connections window. Neither of us searched for each other - it just happened (seemingly?) randomly.  

Today this just happened to me again - about 3 weeks ago I moved in to a new flat occupied by a total stranger and today she cropped up on my suggested LinkedIn connections window - I recognized her from a profile picture. Once again, I told her this and she is 100% certain she did not search me on LinkedIn; she cannot even spell my foreign name. I did not search for her either.

Is this just a very rare coincidence, or am I missing something in my online behaviour that enabled LinkedIn to indicate flatmates as suggested connections?

2j53d2,How can I improve my OS code? What direction should I take to implement paging?,"This is a very broad question, and is more of a request for feedback. I'm in the process of writing my own operating system, and have successfully implemented a physical memory manager. You can see my code here:

https://github.com/PSanf2/POS_C9

I believe my memory manager implementation will allow me to move into paging. I would like to know where I could make improvements, or where I'm making major mistakes, before I go further. Because this is my first time writing an operating system I'm learning as I go, and wish to avoid a mistake hindering my progress later.

With my OS I'm loading the kernel at the 1M mark, and using everything after the kernel for free memory. I'm not touching anything before the kernel, and writing off the wasted megabyte as ""GRUB space."" I've read about having your kernel set up in the ""higher half"" starting at the 3G address, and then using all of the memory below that, and after the kernel, for the paging. I understand that this isn't a requirement, but how much more difficult am I making things on myself by loading my kernel in the ""lower half?"" I'm writing my OS for a 32-bit system, and believe that the higher half setup has something to do with making my OS compatible with other programs that wish to run at lower memory addresses. Is this correct, or am I worrying about nothing? My memory manager is currently set up to start allocating memory from the first address after the kernel, and relies on external values from the linker and GRUB to determine the proper place to start. Should I rework my OS to use a higher half kernel, and have the memory manager start allocating memory from address 0, or 1M? Once the kernel is loaded can I reclaim the ""GRUB space,"" assuming I save the multiboot header information?

For my memory manager I'm using a doubly linked list to keep track of free memory. I'm doing this for the sake of simplicity, and aware that other data structures will provide a better algorithmic complexity. GRUB provides information telling me where my kernel ends, and how much memory I have available. Each node on the list has a ""header"" which I use to keep track of memory. The header on the first node is 256 bytes, and the header on each subsequent node is 64 bytes. The headers contain information telling me where the previous and next nodes in memory are, where the free memory associated with the node starts, and the size of the memory that the node contains. Allocating memory involves splitting an adequately sized node of free memory, removing the allocated node from the list, and returning a pointer to the first address of the allocated memory. The header always stays with the memory, even when it's removed from the free memory list. When I free memory, I give a function a pointer to the first address of allocated memory, back it up the proper amount to get to the header, and then put the node back on the list. From there I go over the list, and compact adjacent nodes. Basically, I have this: http://wiki.osdev.org/images/a/a4/Flat_list.png

Will I be able to use my memory manager to successfully implement paging? I understand that when I enable paging the way I use memory addresses should change. Is this an entirely logical process the programmer handles, where I translate the page index and offset into a physical address, or is the translation handled by the Memory Management Unit? I understand that to implement paging I'll need to define a page directory data structure at a 4K aligned address. I plan on implementing a new memory allocation function that will ensure the address returned is aligned properly by splitting an unallocated node at the proper place. My page directory will have 1024, 32-bit, pointers to page tables, totaling 4K in size. I'm thinking that I'll allocate 4K of memory at a properly aligned address, and that the pointer I get back will be what I give to cr3 for my page directory. The page tables will each contain 1024, 32-bit, pointers to 4K sections of memory. I'm shooting for this: http://wiki.osdev.org/images/7/77/Paging_Structure.gif When creating the page table entries, do I need to allocate the 4K memory needed by each page, or do I mark them as not being present in memory and wait until I allocate the page before allocating the memory? What's involved with allocating a page? Do I simply allocate memory for the page, and set a pointer in the page table to the allocated memory? Will leaving the headers on the allocated memory segments cause issues for paging? Do the starting addressed for each page need to be aligned at a 4K address, or can each page be place wherever's convenient for the physical memory manager? I understand the overall concept of paging, but the details are lost on me at this time. What kind of functions will I need to implement for paging?",2014-10-13 19:04:58

Context:

I made a discord bot under an alt Github account. I have a main Github account that I always use for my projects, but not for this one. Reason being, it was originally just a fun thing I made with a few ppl I met on discord and never met them in person. Of course, I wasn't comfortable with them knowing my identity (since I don't know theirs either), so for sharing code, we all used alt accounts.

Anyways, this bot turned from something meant for like a small 10 person discord server, to now 1000+ ppl playing it in over a 100 servers. I've done quite a lot of work on this and learned a ton, so of course I wanna put it on my portfolio.

Few reasons why I am conflicted with putting it on my portfolio:

1. My name is no where in the repo details/git username. How would a recruiter know I didn't just yoink some random person's project?

2. Since this started as just a random thing for fun, the git commits are not professional at all.. (lots of commits named like ""stuff"", ""hope this works"", ""lol"", ""progress""), and a decent amount of the code is a huge mess too..


I was considering not including the repo and just describing the project in detail in my resume/portfolio. However I normally always include the source repo... I'm afraid that if I don't include it, recruiters would be suspicious.

p2fjn7,"I'm trying to code the Discrete Fourier Transform in C, but I've had weird output. What's the problem?","Hello! I'm trying to make the DFT (and after that the FFT) algorithm from scratch in C, by only taking the complex mathematical formula and test it on some simple signals.

[Formula for the DFT](https://preview.redd.it/4xwx1ch6yqg71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8dc99c7904a69fa99f8bcaa50821d4ee762519f)

So far I have only tried on a generated 10,000 Hz pure sinewave, but already there I'm getting a weird problem, and I think that it's because there's something that I don't quite understand in how the DFT is supposed to work.

**Here's the** [**source code**](https://github.com/Speykious/fourier-despair)**.**

The weird thing that I'm getting is that when I compute the DFT of the pure sinewave, I get 2 symmetrical peaks instead of one on the real array.

[DFT plot of real part](https://preview.redd.it/15aoo91wtqg71.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=93091f12fbcc9ad71ff6585847868dc87e134862)

After that, I also discovered that I get 2 point-symmetrical peaks on the imaginary array:

[DFT plot of imaginary part](https://preview.redd.it/ct8gk4i7uqg71.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2998593d0a7df2591bd77b07fd5ab26623b604e)

It turns out that if I individually sum the real and complex parts into a single array, the last peaks cancel out *just a little bit*. At one point I had tested a case where they did cancel out, but this one isn't the case.

I was expecting to get only one peak representing the frequency of 10,000 Hz - but not placed at point or index 10,000 because I computed the DFT **back into the original array**.

I feel like that last bit is important: am I getting 2 peaks because of the size of the output array, 8192 samples, being the same as the size of the input array?

Finally, it could also be because of how I make the input. When I generate the sinewave, it's only an array of floats. I made the complex part being exactly identical to the real part, making the sinewave oscillate on the complex diagonal, which results in the graphs above.

A friend of mine who had tried and succeeded to make the FFT algorithm in C++ told me that the signal he tried it on was a *sine* on the reals and a *cosine* on the imaginaries. So I generated a ""cosinewave"" (?) for the imaginary part, and this time, adding the real and complex parts together results in the second peak **completely** cancelling out:

[DFT plot of summed up real and imaginary part of second attempt](https://preview.redd.it/3yzktlja0rg71.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=93479d1ba2da01b0b7cf3d2d4ad36941b96ba4e5)

But then,

* Why do I have 2 peeks?
* Why do they cancel out on this second attempt when I add them up?
* Clearly I'm doing something wrong here: what do I have to change to compute an actual DFT?

So yeah as you can see, I'm quite confused about all this, and reading around hasn't helped me much... Thank you in advance for your help!

# WAIT, I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING

MY DUMBASS BRAIN FORGOT HOW TO MULTIPLY 2 COMPLEX NUMBERS... THAT'S PROBABLY THE REASON WHY IT DOESN'T WORK D:

Turns out that I still get similar results with 2 peaks. It's a little different, but still not what I'm expecting. :/

I am leading an engineering team at a good company. I have been having issue making sure no one uses production setups (environment variables, ports etc) yet all development setup involving different services (elasticsearch, psql etc) have same versions across the team.

My main three questions are:
1. What kind of team setups you utilize for development, so that every one across the team have exactly same versions etc.Do you have a dedicated development instance (like a follower DB, sperate elastic search indexes etc) for such services you connect to while in development environment ? 
2. Are there any service i could utilize where I do the whole setup once and be able to share a prepackaged environment ( with all development setups already done) which I could give a new hire so he can get started asap (without maintaining documentations which need to be updated so will take extra time).

A video conferencing tool like Zoom or Google Meet seems an obvious choice for lectures, but private one-on-one discussions are critical to help individual students or groups without others listening in. Moreover, it's important to have an approach that has minimal overhead for the TAs due to high student-to-TA ratios.

i9owkb,Data Structure Playing Cards Prototype,"To the uninitiated, post #1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/ht5zmo/i_designed_a_data_structurealgorithm_battle_card/), and post #2 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/hzxxfi/followup_to_my_data_structurealgorithm_playing/).

TL;DR: I had a meeting with an HK-based artist and also started designing the gameplay. Need help with some design aspects.

So after gathering plenty of feedback from this community, I have something to move forward with, as far as gameplay goes. The card game will be 2-4 players, peer play, with the goal of, given a problem card, building the most efficient data structure while sabotaging other players. The player with the most remaining CPU/Memory budget (or whose data structure is the fastest) wins.

There are going to be at least 3 different cards (problem cards, data structure building block cards, and side effect cards). I started with the building block cards, just to see how it feels to construct data structures using cards.

There are basic element cards such as lone pointer, twin pointers, static array, dynamic array, and upgrade cards such as hash function, and tree balancer. You can construct a variety of data structures from these basic elements, and their resulting average/worst-case running time/space complexity will partly determine how good of a hand you have.

1. lone pointer x 2 = singly linked list
2. twin pointers x 3 = binary tree
3. static array x 2 = dynamic array
4. binary tree + tree balancer = self-balancing binary tree (AVL, Red-black, etc)
5. dynamic array + tree balancer = binary heap
6. dynamic array + singly linked list + hash function = hash map
7. linked list + twin pointers x 2 = skip list
8. dynamic array + singly linked list = VList
9. etc

[Data Structure Cards](https://preview.redd.it/7k51rslvtzg51.jpg?width=3041&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8dc92452d8704372c5ff2ceb70de817a05a937a)

The side effect cards would be something like:

1. cosmic intervention - random bit flip on your opponent's data structure. Can be countered with error correcting card.
2. stop the world garbage collection - causes your opponent to skip a turn.
3. the dining philosopher's chopsticks - causes any opponent using multi-threading to skip a turn and lose their multi-threading capability.
4. Huffman Compressor - card bearer can trade CPU for more memory.
5. etc

&#x200B;

The problem cards would be something like:

1. Build a mini Google search engine with ILR (insertion-to-lookup ratio) of 1:1000
2. Build a text editor with ILR of 1:100
3. Build a logger with ILR of 1000:1
4. etc

You can see how the ILR differences could benefit different kinds of data structure hands.

My questions are:

1. what other basic elements and data structure construction combinations you think should be included?
2. What other side effects/problem cards you think would be fun?
3. Do you think non-compsci folks can play this game? How could I make this game appealing to them?
4. Are you excited?

gj3bfy,What's the most time-efficient way to learn a new language?,"Hey guys. I ask this question because over quarantine I want to begin learning a new language (probably C# so I can get into game development on Unity), but each time I start with a new language I seem to waste so much time doing nothing in the beginning.

For example, before getting into Python a while back I had experience with Lua and Quickbasic. These both gave me the fundamental ideas of programming. But when I started learning through the tutorials, they all retaught basic things like nested loops, the difference between variables, if statements, and several other core concepts I already knew. I never wanted to skip over these parts since occasionally there was a new useful piece of information scattered in these simple tutorials regarding the new language, but it still felt overall like I was wasting my time in the beginning. Not to mention it was *very* boring having concepts I understood be re-explained to me in a different yet very similar language.

So my question is, is there a way to learn new languages other than the standard ""watch a tutorial, program with the tutorial, then start making your own projects""? Is there a project you do when learning a new language to get a feel for it and begin understanding the differences? Or maybe a specific tutorial you watch that is targeted towards beginners at the language but not beginner programmers?

Sorry that I'm complaining over something that's not that big of a deal. It would just help a lot if I felt challenged at the beginning rather than just being bored, counting the hours until I knew enough to actually go do a project on my own with the language. Any help is appreciated! Cheers!",2020-05-13 17:19:33

gbd5n3,Why Does My Small Game Cause Massive Slowdown While Much Bigger Games Do Not?,"This is something that has kind of baffled me for a long time.

So I have a little game I'm working on in C++ using OpenGL rendering. It's essentially a re-creation of Wolf3D. All it does at the moment is render a small map with a handful of enemies (which are literally drawn as billboards) in it you can kill. They don't fight back yet, all they do is walk around randomly when they spot you, and change direction when they hit a wall.

However, if I push the number of enemies up to about 20+, the game slows to an absolute crawl.

Obviously, my code is inefficient in some way, likely the collision detection between the enemies and the walls.

What confuses me is how can my code be SO inefficient that it slows to a crawl in such a small game, when there are VASTLY bigger games with seemingly INFINITELY more going on in them that can comfortably run on the same machine at over 100fps? 

Take a game like Doom Eternal, for example. The visuals are all handled by the GPU, of course, but when you consider exactly how much is going on in a given scene, how can it run so fast? It needs to handle updating all the enemies, handling collisions for all the objects in the scene, handling projectiles flying everywhere, handling AI updates and pathfinding, just a TON of stuff.

There's obviously something I'm missing here.",2020-05-01 06:38:49
f27oyf,What's a good data structure to store hexagon-constrained graph?,"I'm making a small game that will have a graph-like map. The game consists of roads (edges), and cities (nodes), and each connection angle is at a multiple of 120¬∫. Here's a diagram to illustrate what I mean:

&#x200B;

[Example diagram](https://preview.redd.it/vwcuahd0hag41.png?width=4966&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f8de50a5f70163b243f8fd41ddb36b2e2402fe)

Additionally, all the cities (nodes) must be connected, and the roads (edges) are undirected, making it a complete graph. It is also worth noting that the map of the game is infinite and not constrained by the image above in any way whatsoever.

I've made several games before, some with tiles, some with a free map, and even some with a hexagon-based map. These all have common data structures to be stored in, eg. 2d/3d array, list of objects.

But when trying to figure out a data structure to use for my game, I've been stumped so far. Using a graph would be simple (And good for AI too), but when it comes to transversing through it 60 times a second, it becomes very inefficient.

What are your thoughts on this? Is there any simple structure, or do I just have to maintain a list of cities and roads?

Also, here are some use cases for the map that I can think of off the top of my head:

1. Rendering/updating
2. Pathfinding
3. A way to find all the nodes of the graphs that have available connections (keeping in mind each can only have 3), to easily let the user place down new roads/cities

I planned on doing this as my major, however the first semester is coming to a close soon, and I still find myself struggling. I feel like when I am given an assignment, I don't know what to do. I usually understand what is needed like which loop to use, but I don't know how to apply it and do it correctly. I've tried asking others if this is normal, and usually, everyone is saying I'm fine, but I really don't want to go deeper into the rabbit hole if it isn't fine.  I am barely passing the class, and my quizzes and exams have been holding me back. I do have a good grade on my assignments only because I ask for a LOT of help. More than I probably should be asking on really all of my assignments.

dxhmsa,Is it okay to ask for help when stumped by a CS question?,"I was talking to two people in my class and the subject about approaches to learning came up. I emphasized to them that I do research first (i.e. look at the documentation, look over Stack Overflow questions, ect..) but that when I get really stumped I ask for help on a forum, from one of my peers, or from a teacher. One of them laughed and said that he has never asked for help on a forum. I asked why and he gave two reasons: 1) it would be a detriment to learning how to research and 2) that it wastes over people's time. In response to this, I had three counter-points.

In regards to forums, I countered that people don't HAVE to answer your question on a forum. They can simply ignore it and go about their day. In regards to other people, I am respectful of other people's time and wouldn't ask them a question if they were clearly swamped with work. My second counter was that I have genuinely learned CS concepts many times by asking for help when I have spent several hours or days researching something to no avail. To me, that is more efficient than wasting time struggling when I have really hit a wall. My third counter was that I didn't think it was bad to ask for help if the end result is the same as long as you have tried to research the question first and you aren't holding back the person helping you from getting work done.

(On a side-note: I don't understand why it is bad to have people explain a concept to you. The two I talked to thought of that as ""having your hand held"". To me, why is that in of itself bad? I still have to do the work of trying to understand when someone explains something to me before I can ultimately understand the concept).

So what do you all think? Is it okay to ask for help when you are stumped? Or should this kind of behavior be deprecated? Once again, I emphasize that I agree that doing research first will improve your ability to find information quicker and ultimately increase efficiency in solving problems. I just think that sometimes asking for help often clears up things for me.",2019-11-17 03:46:04

bgky88,Completely lost. Could someone help explain this question/concept to me? (Binary logic problem),"I'm currently starting an interview process with a company and they are requiring that I take an exam before conducting any interviews. They sent me a short study guide with examples of some of the materials that could be on the exam. I graduated college a couple of months ago, but I don't ever seem to recall learning this sort of material while I was a CS student.


Given that the only values A, B, and C can hold are 0 or 1, simplify the following binary logic problem: ((A OR B) AND (!A OR C)) AND !C 

A.	!A OR B AND !C

B.	A AND B AND C

C.	!A AND B AND !C

D.	A OR B AND C


Here is the correct answer that they provide, but I have no idea how to wrap my head around this problem. Any help would be appreciated!

The correct answer is C

This is a step by step process requiring knowledge of binary logic problems, a fundamental when it comes to computer and networking theory. The problem breaks down to:

(A OR B) AND (!A OR C) = !A*A + A*C + !A*B + B*C = A*C + !A*B +B*C

Then,
(A*C + !A*B +B*C) AND !C = A*C*!C + !A*B*!C + B*C*!C = !A*B*!C

In the above rational, * equates to AND and + equates to OR. ! indicates a NOT value, and a !A*A = 0. This is why that removes terms from the problem when next to ORs. The other options are flawed versions of the correct answer ‚Äì they are mathematical errors.",2019-04-23 20:01:37

Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt have a computer science background but I‚Äôll do my best to follow along with any technical explanation someone can give

Hi guys,

I come from a country with really slow internet and one of my biggest gripes is downloading really large files over my browser. When I have to download something that‚Äôs bigger than 2 GBs I end up leaving it on overnight and hoping the download completes the next day. In many cases, I wake up to find the download cancelled at some point in the night.

Fed up, I searched for solutions that would auto-resume failed downloads I left on overnight. I was surprised that such a seemingly simple function is not readily offered by any extension or built-in to a browser. I would think this is something people would need.

The solution I ended up using was a bit roundabout - I had to rollback my Firefox then install an old extension that allowed the auto-resume function. It worked without a hitch! I was able to leave things downloading overnight without fear of the download cancelling a quarter of the way through with no way of resuming it as I slept.

Until my Firefox auto-updated (silly me I forgot to turn it off). The functionality is apparently no longer supported in later versions of Firefox. And despite the fact there are several extensions that give this function for older versions of Firefox, none of them work with the current version. Similar story with Chrome and I was unable to find anything for Explorer and Safari.

This leads me to my question. Is there any reason why auto-resuming downloads is somehow not a thing anymore? Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but it feels like there‚Äôs an active effort to remove this functionality from current browsers. Is there a cybersecurity thing at play? I don‚Äôt understand why something so beneficial is seemingly blocked.

For now, I will go ahead and rollback my Firefox and disable auto-update to regain my auto-resuming failed downloads function. In the meantime, the fact that this isn‚Äôt a thing will continue to bug me.

Looking forward to anyone who can answer this question!",2018-09-02 04:10:56

I also have a Pluralsight account and a full stack ""sandbox"" development project I play with at home.  My company promotes me going to third party training and conferences.  I went to a Visual Studio Live! conference last year and it was OK and I am heading to a .NET Principles and Design Patterns course in a month or so.

Another such project was having to build a web server. Sure I had read about how HTTP works and thought I had a pretty good understanding of how the web works, but it wasn't until I had to build my own web server (though it was only a rather minimal one) that I truly appreciated everything that goes behind the scene every time I click on a link.

Below is a list of projects that I feel meet the criteria described above that I have attempted in the past (I'll update the list if I think of new ones):  

* chat server and client that supports multiple chatrooms, smileys, formatting, etc (chatting systems are part of a lot of social networks and video games, I thought it would be worth bettering my understanding of how they work, and the experience was very rewarding)
* 2D, multi-level video game (definitely made me appreciate all the hard work that goes into video games and is something I want play around with again in the future)
* basic web crawler (I wanted to better my understanding of how search engines work)
* conway's game of life (lots of fun playing around with algorithmic efficiency)
* RESTful service (implemented a RESTful URL-shortening service over HTTP)
* authorship attribution software (this was the doctoral dissertation of one my java professors, so he made us implement our own version of it, it was tons of fun and very different than most things I've programmed)

What do you guys think other some such projects might be? I'm thinking of revisiting some of the ones above in order to add more features/improve my implementation, but I'd also like new ideas of things to mess around with in the future.

I have a decent idea of how addition/subtraction works:

   * Another more advanced trick would be using the fact that adding 1 to a string of *k* binary 1s will result in a binary 1 followed by *k* binary 0s.
* For integer subtraction:
   * Abusing integer overflow by adding the flipping all of the bits of the second argument and then adding 1 achieves this. 
* For floating point arithmetic:
   * The exponent of 2 would have to be taken into account.
   * Negative numbers and subtraction however, I would imagine, are more complicated (probably not that much though).",2022-12-24 19:18:47

I'm currently working through Nand2Tetris Part 1 as well as the CS:APP textbook, and it is my understanding that CPU designers generally strive to minimize the hardware complexity as best as they can, since it's relatively expensive to try and fit more units/bus lines/whatever it may be into a chip. For example, instead of having a separate instruction for both integer addition and subtraction, the complier can just convert the number that is subtracting to a negative, then do addition on the two numbers instead. 5 - 8, for instance, can be converted to 5 + (-8). For more complicated operations like the ones mentioned in the title, how does the OS or complier convert this to a series of primative instructions that the processor can then read?

uj4o98,Computer Science Undergrad vs Graduates degree,"Hello,

I'm hoping this isn't a stupid question, if it turns out to be, I'll delete the post.

I've recently started working a job where my boss stated that it'd be highly unlikely that I'd advance to management without a computer, electrical, or engineering degree. After researching the different type of degrees, I found Computer Science to be the one I would most like to pursue.

I currently have a B.S. in Global Supply Chain Mgmt and when I've told friends that I want to pursue a Bachelor's in CS I keep getting asked the same thing: ""Why don't you just get a Graduates degree in CS?"" (This is coming from people who already have graduate degrees).

I did well with my bachelors degree, I finished with a 3.96 gpa and consider myself a fairly intelligent and hard working person, but my computer skills are lacking. I'm proficient in common office programs like Excel, but I've never done any coding. I don't feel like I have a strong foundation and the thought of taking a Graduate degree in a subject I'm weak in is intimidating to me.

So firstly, is this even possible, to go from a B.S. MGMT degree to a Masters in CS? Secondly, if its possible, is this a good idea or should I start with an undergrad in CS?

Am I just being given bad advice?

Thank you

tiwggn,"Do programming language design and theory advise against ""else""?","Some people think that the else part in ""if ... then ... else ..."" makes code nested undesirably. They claimed that it makes the code difficult to understand. So they prefer two ""if ... then ...""'s.

These include

* Computer Architecture/Systems
* Operating Systems
* Computer Networks
* Databases
* Compilers/Interpreters

To do this, I looked at several online resources such as [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), OSSU, [https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/](https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/) which are also mentioned in the FAQ. I also looked at several universities' available courses such as MIT, Stanford and Berkeley.

Almost all these resources either recommend very long books (such as **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces**) or are video-based. The books will take a very long time to read (e.g. 1 month for each book if done properly) and the videos I personally do not like because I find they are less effective for me than reading.

Hence, what I am looking for are short books (say, <200 pages) or just lecture notes which cover the most important topics, perhaps not going into as much detail as the long books do, similarly to video lectures. In other words, I am looking for lecture notes which are detailed (i.e. not slides).

        ordered_list = [comrades[0]]  # Start with the first comrade as ordered

        # Merge the ordered comrades and reeducation_camp
        return merge(ordered_list, reeducation_camp)  


But the property on random data is that for every 10x increase in elements, there is only an approximate ~3.3x increase in the number of iterations it takes.  
 
    For 1 numbers, iterations: 2.00
    For 10 numbers, iterations: 5.20

    For 1000 numbers, iterations: 59.00
    For 10000 numbers, iterations: 192.40

Furthermore, I also find that the lists get *more* orderly with iterations, almost resembling a normal distribution. The percentage of ordered elements as a percentage of comrades also is almost monotonic:  
   
    Iteration: 1 Comrades: 100 Ordered list: 5 Percent: 5.00

1acp4lm,Does anyone know this paper from IBM?,"When I was in college (which was a a while ago), a professor told us about a paper that came out of IBM in the 60 or 70s. Apparently a researcher had evaluated the success of patching the OS360 operating system, and discovered that, on average each patch introduced the same number of bugs that it resolved. So every time a patch came out, IBM was replacing the bugs the customers knew how to deal with, with new bugs that they then had to work around. IBM then decided this researcher's services were no longer required. 

I've never been able to find this paper. Everything I know is listed above. Googling for this is extremely unsuccessful. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Does this even exist? Is this just like a fairy tale that professors tell to young grad students? I checked the various cs subreddits, and this seemed like the best bet, but if you know another one that might be good to check, that would also be helpful.

197awqp,Were all 1930s computers limited in function due to the absence of a viable memory technology?,"Computer historian Colin B. Burke wrote in 2002 (p. 53 in [PDF](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jun/29/2002751411/-1/-1/0/MAGIC.PDF)):

>Electronic computation was having its birth pangs, and no one had a way to create a machine whose hardware could be made to imitate any process. A major reason why all the 1930s computers were limited in function was the absence of a viable memory technology.^(24)

The reference here is to Paul E. Ceruzzi's *Reckoners: Prehistory of the Digital Computer, from Relays to the Stored Program Concept, 1935-1945*, but the page is unfortunately not specified (Burke makes other references to books without a page as well). Since this book is available [online](https://www.ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/Reckoners.html), I partially read it (where I'ld expect such a discussion) and also manually checked each use of the word ""memory"", but only found a general observation that until the 1930s calculation and storing information were separate and a discussion why after 1935 ""social and economic conditions"" became ""really favorable for the computer's invention"".

If I had a subscription to Claude 100k or another long-context LLM I could have fed all the text of the book to it and ask it to find the claim in the quote, but I don't. You may try if you do, of course, but I personally consider it more likely that Burke just put a wrong reference without actually consulting the book (he might have confused in his memory a fact which he read elsewhere, happens with me from time to time) rather than that I have missed the Ceruzzi's substantiation of this claim. If someone read the whole book and could confirm or disprove my hypothesis, I'ld be grateful!

Still, the claim looks very plausible and I consider it improbable that Burke would made it without someone else making it before. Of course I tried to look it up on the web, in Google Books and Google Scholar, found a lot of descriptions of the development of memory technology but no connection to the general-purpose computing and the 1930s limitations.

So the main question is: do you consider the claim in the quote true, and if yes, do you know any references one could cite?

P. S.

Just to be clear, I'm not looking for a 1930s reference specifically!",2024-01-15 15:08:52
14cgu9b,Solving a variant of the Maximum Coverage Problem," Here's a problem I need to solve that I asked ChatGPT to formalize:

Given:

1. A finite set A of n unique elements. (n\~ 50,000)
2. A collection B of m subsets of A. (m\~ 230,000, each subset can contain up to 30 elements)

Objective:

Find a permutation P of A such that, when progressive subsets of P are created from left to right (i.e., \[0:1\], \[0:2\], \[0:3\], ..., \[0:n\]), the total number of subsets from B that are completely contained in these progressive subsets (are subsets of them) is maximized.

11m6w3m,How will we continue to get high quality datasets to train language models as their results enter the public domain?,"I did a reasonable amount of ML work at university for my dissertation projects, but I always relied on training data collected by other researchers. 

My understanding is that the datasets used to train LLMs are collected by scraping the internet, under the assumption that most content is accurate and representative of human language use. However, now that ChatGPT is beginning to be used by the public, a significant amount of the new data that is generated will be produced by an AI, not by humans, so new language models will be trained on the output of the previous generation. The proportion of content generated by AI is only going to increase as it becomes more mainstream.

How will training datasets account for this? Is there a risk of something like Kessler Syndrome for AI, where the amount of garbage data produced by current language models makes it difficult or impossible to train better language models?",2023-03-08 20:17:16

13sgyuj,"I'm confused: CPU caches, memory fetches, and data oriented design","I've been trying to wrap my head around data oriented design so I can leverage that for performance optimization, but I'm getting stuck trying to understand the considerations I need to take in regard to CPU caches, cache lines, how data is fetched from RAM, how the code I write influences whether or not the compiler will generate SIMD instructions, etc..., etc...

I'm not exactly looking for someone to spell it all out for me, because I know it's a lot, and how I implement anything is going to depend on what I'm trying to accomplish. Instead, I'm asking if anyone can point me in the direction of some material, be it articles, lectures, research papers, anything, that might tackle some of this in a way that is applicable to what it is I'm trying to accomplish. I've been off and on for months trying to read up on data oriented design, CPU architecture, how instructions are fetched and used to operate on data, how it's decided which data goes in which registers and how the compiler decides when to leave data in registers, how the compiler decides to vectorize the code and output SSE instructions vice any other sort, etc... I've of course watched through Scott Meyers' CPU Caches and Why You Care many times and tried to follow up with research on the things I don't understand. Mike Acton's Data Oriented Design and C++ as well.

That being said, what I'm trying to accomplish: A software triangle rasterizer run entirely on the CPU, no GPU need apply, written in C++. I've been playing around for a couple weeks with scanline and tile based rasterizers that allow for a limited set of pre-defined vertex attributes like color and texture coordinates. They're not fancy, they're slow, but they technically do what I want them to do. Now, I want a rasterizer that is performant enough to actually be useful, and because I'm limiting myself to the CPU, I have to optimize, and I need to consider all the things I've mentioned above and start over fresh with a new design concept.

If anyone can point me in the direction of material that might make some sense to me in the context of a rasterizer or similar, I'd really appreciate it. If the answer is ""you're going to have to just deep dive into each topic individually and put it all together yourself"", that's fine too if that's the reality of it.",2023-05-26 15:56:51
13ibpno,"In a lot of procedurally generated games, you‚Äôre able to specify what seed is used for the randomizer in order to guarantee you get the same random map, items, etc on any run with that seed. But doesn‚Äôt that also require every call to the randomizer happen in the exact same order every time?","Let‚Äôs say you have a game like Minecraft, where people reuse and share RNG seeds to play the same map. Minecraft is infinitely sprawling, so assumably the whole map isn‚Äôt generated at once. If the player moves forward enough to cause another chunk of the map to be generated, that should mean a series of random numbers are produced from the seed. But what if a different player had walked backwards instead? Shouldn‚Äôt the same numbers have been used as the player who walked forward, and leading to totally different numbers if player 2 ever did walk forward afterwards?

The same goes for games like binding of Isaac where there are random maps as well as random effects from things like certain items. If I use my random-effect item before opening a chest, it doesn‚Äôt change what I get when I open it, which implies there‚Äôs some more logic at play than just setting the initial seed of the randomizer.

So how are developers achieving consistency on repeat playthroughs with these seeds? Do they have many different randomizers in use at once? Is the ‚Äúseed‚Äù we input actually mixed with some string for a specific use case (e.g. ‚Äú[seed]_[chunk coords]‚Äù) before use to better ensure consistency?

127ihpl,Understanding integer to Floating point conversion,"I am understanding how integer to IEEE-754 single-precision floating point works. However I have come to a halt at a case of converting the integer `-1499283267`. I'll explain my working according to what I have understood so far.

1. We convert the integer to its absolute value.
```
|-1499283267| = 1499283267
```

2. Convert the absolute value to its binary representation
```
1499283267 = 01011001010111010011111101000011
```

3. Find the unbiased exponent by shifting the decimal point to the left just before the most significant `1`. We will call the resulting binary representation: ""not-normalized mantissa"". (Omitting the zero at MSB since it is the sign bit for both the integer and the floating point number)
```
1011001010111010011111101000011  -> unbiased exponent = 0
1.011001010111010011111101000011 -> unbiased exponent = 30
```

4. Add the bias of the target precision floating point number to the  unbiased exponent to obtain the biased exponent. For Single-precision, the bias is 127
```
biased exponent = 127 + 30 = 157
```

5. Take the upper 23 bits after the decimal point in the not-normalized mantissa as the normalized mantissa.
```
1.011001010111010011111101000011 -> normalized mantissa = 01100101011101001111110
```

6. The normalized mantissa will be rounded off. The mode `Round to nearest, ties to even` is used. The guard, round and sticky bits are the three bits directly to the right of the least significant bit of the normalized mantissa respectively.
```
Guard  = 1
Round  = 0
Sticky = 0
```

7. Since the bit vector of Guard, round and sticky bits, let us call it `GRS`, is 100, the normalized mantissa will be rounded up if the LSB of the normalized mantissa is 1, otherwise rounded down. Our mantissa will be rounded down.
```
rounded normalized mantissa = 01100101011101001111110
```

8. The resulting floating point binary representation will be:
```
sign  biased exponent  mantissa
1     10011101         01100101011101001111110
```

But when I go [here](https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html) to verify, I am seeing that the LSB of the mantissa is 1. Am I doing something wrong here?

EDIT: Mistakenly considered the sign bit of the floating point as 0. Changed it to 1",2023-03-31 11:43:01

12h1lsr,"What is definition of a ""microservice""?","Fowler (2014) defines microservice as a small service.

>In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.

This begs the question: how small is small? Can microservice be composed of other microservices or it's atomic?

SOA definition treats service as a self-contained functionality that can be composed of other services.

>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style that supports service orientation. It is a way of thinking in terms of services, service-based development, and the outcomes of services.1A service is a logical representation of a repeatable business activity that has a specified outcome, such as ‚Äúcheck customer credit‚Äù, ‚Äúprovide weather data‚Äù, or ‚Äúconsolidate drilling reports‚Äù. It is self-contained, may be composed of other services, and is a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù to its consumers.

If it's self-contained, how is microservice different from SCS (self-contained system)?

>Each SCS is an autonomous web application. For the SCS's domain, all data, the logic to process that data and all code to render the web interface is contained within the SCS. An SCS can fulfill its primary use cases on its own, without having to rely on other systems being available.

Can microservice contain its own user interface or it only encapsulates business logic and data storage?

117ryik,What should I focus as a beginner in machine learning?,"Hear me out, I know it's a tough call to ask, but we had been forced to put machine learning in our thesis which is not my forte in any sense. Considering we only have 3 months of development phase, I might find it impossible to finish the program with no background in machine learning at all. To be fair I have learned python on a programming level but that is it. Our current thesis is about a mental health clinic finder and a neural network chatbot.  
  
The next problem we had is the sheer amount of confidentiality that we have to go along because of the sensitivity of the topic and the data itself to be given that is usually becomes the dataset. It would become close to impossible locally to find datasets that any organizations or hospitals would give permission.  
  
The thesis would have its features:  
  
1.The chatbot would generally answer that are based on what they feel during the conversation between the chatbot and the user. What we need to find is basing off their symptoms, treatments and diagnosis on what they should actually do especially given by the fact that the pandemic happened. These instances commonly occurred due to isolations and the hindrances given likely increased stress and anxiety levels.  
  
2.Similarly to vaccine clinic finders that are already existing, this features the mental health clinics instead. It would use your location to find the closest clinics within your vicinity.  
  
My questions are these:  
  
1.Are international datasets allowed? Given by the difficulty of my team to find local datasets. Would the structure of dataset itself differ from the ones that are usually available like say, US for instance?  
  
2.Given 3 months of development phase is all we have to do the program itself, we were tipped to use API as a way to make things easier for our end. Of course, with that sense, it's not going to be cheap as well. However, they also said OpenAI's API is available, whilst Google offers both paid and free API for things like the Dialogflow and maps.

17uyvgk,Why RSS never took off,"It sounds like such an awesome technology that solves so many problems:

\- Its dead simple. Just an XML document with the description of a piece of content. Anyone can implement it.

\- Content creators would no longer be at the mercy of the 'almighty algorithm' of each platform, jumping through hoops in order to be seen.

\- Users could customize how they consume their content. Compartmentalize their interests (which is inexplicably tough in most platforms as far as I've seen), select the order each post appears in their feed and generally have much much more control over their timelines

\- We actively get power back from the internet oligopoly (i.e. Alphabet, Meta, etc) who intentionally make their platforms addictive, use our data, and hide behind incomprehensible user agreements.

Is it just me or have feeds become SO bad, featuring clickbaity thumbnails and titles, counting their words not to get shadowbanned over political controversies, asking/begging for 'like comment subscribe, hit the notification bell, share etc'. For instance think how noone could talk about 'the virus' during the early days of the pandemic. How Instagram (an otherwise photo sharing platform) is pushing hard on reels trying to be more like tiktok. How people on tiktok (the worse offender in censorship) can't talk about the middle-east. 

I don't think that creators will stop optimizing their content in order for it to be more viral. However I do think things will be much better if they don't have to the whims of those large corporations. And I think that we as content consumers would be far better of if we choose the content that we view instead of having said companies choose it for us. At the very least we will keep our own biases instead of being fed the biases of billionaires.

Rant aside, I do wonder. Why didn't we pick up on RSS feeds given how it solves all these problems? How is this old technology not everywhere by now?",2023-11-14 09:47:23
17lovtp,Gen Z and the advancement in technology,"I am currently undergoing an internship at a university in their robotics research lab and I recently had a conversation with one of the compsci professors about the advancements in technology and Gen Z ( to preface I am a Gen Z-er) and I thought what he had to say was interesting and wanted to share. Bare with the long post. 

He complained that our generations consistent use of software that made accessing technology much easier were making us technologically illiterate. We could get into programming/technologhy much easier than our predecessors but we understood the technology much less. He says that many of the CompSci students he taught lacked many fundamental principles of computer science and was baffled about their inability to code relatively simple algorithms (data retrieval/ creating files).

He argued thats these software were good in the fact that it closed the gap between the technologically illiterate and the technologically literate but it made the TL lazy and slowed the learning process and thus progress. He said that AI wasn't making this issue any better and was making people more reliant on technology we ourselves don't even properly understand, creating a sorta ""blind leading the blind"" situation.  AI algorithms trained on data that's cannot be properly understood by the engineers would not be good for society.

With CompSci becoming a more saught out career path by Gen Z (he thinks many people go into Tech/CompSci that shouldn't due to not being suited for it), he thinks that the overall technological advancements are going to slow drastically over the next 100 years.

Ignoring other benefits, why don't we use more than one read/write head to increase performance? Considering how complex computer systems can become, this extra head(s) doesn't add THAT much complexity. (instead of parallel drives in RAID, here we have parallel RW heads). Wouldn't this actually decrease the cost? (suppose we are using raid for performance only. it would cost much less to increase number of head than to increase number of whole disks) and even we can use such hard drives in raid and further increase performance (cases where balance is important so not using ssd)

edit - my thoughts:

conner implemented this idea badly + RAID were becoming cheaper then + today, installing a new head could cost almost same as buying a new SSD since SSDs are cheaper now. plus: two heads/actuators = more space + increased wear due to two heads",2024-01-19 21:43:56
18tb705,Difference Between Classical Programming and Machine Learning,"I'm having trouble differentiating between machine learning and classical programming. The difference which I've heard is that machine learning is the ability for a computer to learn without being specifically programmed. However, machine learning programs are coded, from what I understand, just like any other program. A machine learning program, just like a classical one, takes a user's input, manipulates it in some way, and then gives an output. The only difference I see is that ML uses more statistics to manipulate data that a classical program, but in both cases data is being manipulated.  
  
From what I understand, an ML program will take examples of data, say pictures of different animals, and can be trained to recognize dogs. It tries to figure out similarities between the pictures. Each time the program is fed a new animal photo, that new photo becomes part of the data, and with each new photo, the program gets stronger and stronger and recognizing dogs since it has more and more examples. Classical programs are also updated when a user enters new data. For example, a variable might keep track of a users score, and that variable keeps getting updated when the users gains more points.  
  
Please let me know what I am missing about what the real difference is between ML programs and classical ones.

I have been a little worried that in order to understand this, I'd have to collect a serious understanding of computer science. But you know what? Screw it, here goes nothing. Maybe someone here can explain this in an accessible manner that I can finally understand:

Why are processors even capable of working with machine language? Okay, sure something something transistors... Okay sure, something something binary...

Is there any way to do this but have it be accessible via a little webpage hosted on our server? For example, a user would go the URL, like they do now, but on the page is a search bar and there they can search keywords and it will bring up the links to the associated plans. Ideally, they would be required to input a building ID and then search for keywords in plans with that particular building ID.

19a24yk,Can someone explain the Dalmellington error?,"Context for those outside the UK: there has been a lot of controversy about a miscarriage of justice stemming from a software bug in the Post Office's accounting software, which was developed by a company called Fujitsu.

The bug caused duplicate transactions to appear on the system which made the so-called ""subpostmasters"" liable for paying money they didn't have. Rather than admitting there was a bug, the Post Office prosecuted these people, leading to wrongful imprisonment, suicides and financial ruin for innocent people.

18yb0o4,Do we use the Church-Turing thesis to argue about computability?,"So I'll be having an exam in Theory of Computation soon and I'm reviewing through all our stuff and also checking their reference solutions for the first time.

I noticed that whenever they perform reductions, they just casually claim that their reduction function is computable and don't invest much thought in actually explaining why it is computable.

Computability for functions was defined as:

    A partial function f: Œ£* ‚Üí Œ£* is Turing computable, if f = f_M for a Turing machine M

I.e., it is Turing computable because you can express it via Turing machines.

And the Church-Turing thesis was:

    The class of functions computable by Turing machines encompasses all intuitively computable functions

Which was explained as: Whenever we can somewhat write a program of something, just intuitively, then we claim it is computable because no one managed to disprove this thesis yet.

So whenever they make reductions and introduce their reduction function and then just claim it is computable and go on with showing that is a reduction, I assume you can do that if is already somewhat intuitively clear that you could probably code something that does what the reduction function does. I'd personally would still write that it is possible to code it or quickly explain how I'd code it but they just call stuff computable and go on. ",2024-01-04 11:31:39

It almost seems like tech companies are trying to force the obsolescence of optical media (presumably for control reasons)‚Ä† by refusing to develop more advanced forms of it (competitive with contemporary HDD and Flash/SSD memory) even when they are known to be possible, and even when they do, only releasing it to Big Iron computing rather than to the general public.

‚Ä†The control hypothesis seems more plausible as outside of a handful of video game systems with proprietary formats, virtually no software or media has been released on even other modern non-optical forms of removable media, like SD cards and USB Flash drives.

For reference, I've been programming since I was young, I learned a few languages and would write games and stuff with them at first, then programs that can automate tasks and whatnot, but now as I'm actually studying comp sci, I'm struggling to see the purpose. For instance I know time complexity is important insofar as not wasting too much time or resources, but I also don't even know really what software engineers actually do on the daily. I figured it was just optimizing apps or developing programs for companies or for customers or whatever but I don't know what knowing how to use Stacks or how Bubblesort works or how to use Master's theorem or how to use Dijsktra's or DFS or any of that stuff is necessary.

**Details:** The obj file contains  644 vertices, 1,849 edges, and 1,212 triangles.  The obj file is  99,446 bytes.

The obj file contains vertices, vertex normals, texture coordinates and faces (in this case only triangles)

Each vertex, vertex normal and texture coordinate consists of three positive or negative values with accuracy to four decimal places. Example: `vn 0.8797 -0.2611 -0.3975`

It therefore seems logical that all this data would need to be stored and given the amount of characters for each (at most 7 if you count negative sign, decimal point and 5 digits) you could determine the minimum number of bytes necessary to store this data.  I don't know how you would determine that, just seems it should be possible.

I can also imagine maybe using polar coordinates instead to possibly avoid the need for negative numbers and therefore save space?  You could also take advantage of symmetry in this case since his head is symmetrical.

Could anyone please point me to some resources where I could see proof that two's complement form an Abelian group?

Now, I get that (sum-x) should also cause an (negative) overflow, which will then cause that the result will be (sum - x + 2\^w), but how can I prove this? How can I prove that (sum-x) will cause an underflow in this situation?

13c8fly,What soft skills are valued when applying to computer science jobs?,"Hi all,

I've had a non-traditional path that has lead me to CS-basically had a healthcare degree (got licensed in that), went on to do a masters in clinical research. I worked for 5 years after that in roles where I taught myself a ton of skills ranging from research, data and a lot of programming. I was the most programming-savy person on my team and used my skills to automate tedious tasks that became extremely important especially for how things operated with COVID-19 in my organization. I also improved documentation practices and served as a project manager for a web app that was built by contract developers but that I heavily tested and did the documentation for.

In that meantime, I've also used time outside of work to strengthen my skills-I've used Python before, know C and in the process of strenghtening my JavaScript/Java skills. Had used a lot of R at my job which I realize is not a great dev language but helped me do a lot of things in terms of automating data tasks. Know the flask framework, in the process of learning react, node, vue/express. Have a GitHub portfolio with a couple of projects since 2018. 

I'd love to move on to a software engineering role in health tech in a couple of months after working on my portfolio-out of all the things I did in my career, using code to build things for people and actually be able to accomplish it has been gratifying. I know that without a CS background it's tough, but I'm willing to give it a try. I'm just wondering how hiring managers look at soft skills developed outside of the traditional CS skills and how much weight is put on that when looking for successful job candidates-especially because I'm looking in health tech, I'm curious to know how subject matter knowledge in healthcare would be seen.

12lvloa,Computer Science Applied in a Primitive Society,"A common hypothetical is ""What if X happened and civilization had to start over?"" Now the answer is less harrowing than  some might think and that is due to the fact that human knowledge stored in memory is greater than ever before. The greatest leap being in the field of computer science.

As readers here are likely aware, computational science and methods of computation are highly applicable regardless of whether or not you have a digital computer. Cryptography and hashing would allow data/message verification, secure signatures and banking systems, CRT and other algorithms permit distributed computation, and secret sharing etc. The issue here is that the forms developed in modern times are geared towards binary computers which would not necessarily be optimal or practical to implement for humans.

So the question is has anyone done work on how to efficiently implement analogs of modern methods by hand, or very simple calculation aid? The most obvious adjustment would be weaker standards as something like 32-bit encryption is more than sufficient to keep it out of the ability of humans for a while. (The radix would also more than likely be ternary-derived, although humans would have the advantage of greater arithmetic flexibility, unless you were using hardware arithmetic analogs).",2023-04-14 12:28:50
12ibd88,Often confusing terminology in the concept of reductions (complexity theory),"Hi all, I have been pretty confused about this in the past, and to be honest, I still might have a misconception; please see if what I have said here is accurate and if so, join the discussion on whether the terminology is confusing or not. 

If a problem A reduces to problem B, that means problem A can be solved using the solution of problem B. ‚ÄúReduction‚Äù here makes sense. Problem B must be at least as hard to solve as problem A, because problem B being computable implies problem A being computable (or problem A being non-computable implies problem B being non-computable). This is clear.

Now consider a polynomial time reduction from A to B. The algorithm (reduction) to compute A can use the solution to B a polynomial number of times (polynomial # of calls to a procedure that computed B, each we assume to take constant time as a blackbox), plus a polynomial number of other standard computational steps on top of that, thus A can be computed in polynomial time. 

*However*, suppose now that B has a polynomial time algorithm that computes it; in this case, problem A still runs in polynomial time (because a polynomial number of calls to a polynomial time algorithm for B plus a polynomial number of other standard computation is still a polynomial)‚Ä¶ but it can be ‚Äúharder‚Äù to solve A in terms of the polynomial being larger. It can be the case that the polynomial time algorithm for A is actually a less efficient (bigger polynomial, so the problem is harder), even though this *seems* to contradict the implication that if A reduces to B, then B is at least as hard to solve as A.

What we should be saying is that B is **asymptotically** at least as hard to solve as A. In the above case, actually A and B are as difficulty as each other asymptotically, no problem there. But it certainly cannot be the case that B is asymptotically easier to solve than A if A reduces to B. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this was immediately understood by everybody when first learning about reductions, but I think it‚Äôs valuable?",2023-04-11 06:47:34

12amg2p,I‚Äôm worried that the Computer Science classes for a BS degree are too advanced for my current level of understanding. Should I switch gears or stay the course and learn more foundational information on my own time.,"Hey everyone, I have a question that you all will hopefully have an answer to.

TLDR: I‚Äôm worried that the Computer Science classes for a BS degree are too advanced for my current level of understanding and I‚Äôm wondering if I can learn the basics from a CompTIA A+ book or other resource.

Wall of text version: Last year I decided to earn a degree in computer science, with the ultimate goal being to work in cybersecurity. Now, I can use a computer but I would say that I have no real IT experience or understanding of computers. I‚Äôd really like to learn more about the networking side, as I think that would give me good foundation to build upon.

I‚Äôm now 31, and I was in my late 20s when I started my college career. I have earned an Associates in Paramedic Studies, but the BS in computer science is the next step. When I took my entrance exam a few years ago, I did not pass the math section (namely because I hadn‚Äôt done any math in an academic setting for 10 or so years.) I‚Äôve since taken all the remedial math classes needed to get caught up and am moving on to Calc and Analytic Geometry 1 for the upcoming fall semester. Once I learned the material again the math has been going well and I‚Äôm not too concerned about it so far.

As far as the computer side, I‚Äôm worried that the computer classes will be too advanced for me and I‚Äôll have no clue what is going on. Looking at the other computer programs offered, like Information Systems and Technology or Information Assurance and Technology, the classes seem more geared towards beginners and the sort of stuff I‚Äôd like to learn. Some of them are:

CTS 110 - Network Essentials

CTS 120 - Introduction to Linux

CTS 140 - Network Security Fundamentals

CTS 234 - Windows Server

CTS 130 - Networking 1

CTS 131 - Networking 2

CTS 240 - Advanced Network Defense

CTS 242 - Network Intrusion Detection and Penetration Testing

CTP 114 - Python for Everyone

CTP 115 - Introductory Object-Oriented Program Analysis and Design

CTP 130 - Programming in PHP/MySQL

CTS 170 - Digital Forensics 1

CTS 216 - Network Forensics

CTS 222 - UNIX/LINUX System Administration

CTS 236 - Virtualization & Cloud

STM 213 - Professional Skills for STEM

Essentially, I‚Äôm worried that I won‚Äôt be prepared for the computer classes, and I‚Äôd like to learn what the classes I listed above offer but they are associates degrees. I feel like a BS in Computer Science degree will allow for more open doors in the future. Are these classes all things I could learn on my own time from something like a CompTIA A+ prep book, YouTube, etc?

Recently I've got an offer from JP Morgan Chase for a level 3 SWE role in the same area. The pay offered is 60% more than what I am getting at Goldman. Is it worth making the jump? How is engineering there vs. GS? I am afraid that with this big of a pay, there will be a big responsibility that I am not up to. GS has really been good to me but the pay there isn't great and technical development isn't where I'd like it to be. However we just got our projects for the year and that involves a lot of migrating things to the cloud and stuff maybe it would be good technical exposure?

For 7, I got C, based on the postorder traversal function:

    postorder(X):
    
      if X is not None:
        postorder(X.left)
        postorder(X.right)
        print(X)

For 8, I got C based on the ordering given by:

U<Q<X<W<P<V<Z<Y

1antyxz,Is it viable to scan all IP's to supply a search engine index? Also some rant.,"For my thesis, my professor wanted me to build a basic search engine that'll only index websites for a specific language. To start crawling we needed to decide on how the crawler will find the websites, so he instructed me to ""simply"" send ping to ALL possible IPv4 combinations, and index the page if we have a match (is the website crawlable, is it in the target language etc.), then find the external links on the website to keep looking for more valid sites to crawl.

I thoroughly made my research and could not find any clue on this method being used. All the search engine implementations suggest that the crawler should be instantiated using a set of well-known and authoritive seed URL's, then create a feedback loop to reach more websites and add them to the URL frontier.

When I wrote my paper using this method instead of the one he suggested, he vigorously objected it and said I should've used his method of scanning all the IP's, stating that even Google uses this method so it's viable.

&#x200B;

Our argument did go like this:

\- Professor: If you use your method you won't be able to find web pages that doesn't have any backlinks pointing to them, even though their content is good.

\- Me: That's the point? That means they didn't configure their SEO well. If they still want to be indexed, they can just send us a index request, just like Google does (using URL inspection tool).

\- Professor: That's just false. When you send a ping it'll index faster, and they index it even if you don't but that takes more time (I have no idea what that's supposed to mean, but I'm guessing he means Google is scanning all the IP adresses just like he stated before? I could not find any documents to prove this.)

\- Me: Okay, but when I build a prototype to test this method, I sent request to 1000 random IP's, and out of the 1000 responses, only 30\~ responded. And out of the 30 responses, most of them were not valid (not in the target language, temporarily down, redirection etc.), And the rest were just camera control panels or admin panels of different networks, which is not ethical to send requests and crawl according to my research.

\- Professor: It's ethical. It's not like we're trying to guess their credentials. We're just sending requests to them. And you have chosen random IP's so the result would be like that obviously. You should've narrowed down the IP list to include IP sections that only the country of the target language would use. (But the origin of the IP has nothing to do with finding pages to crawl?? The websites could be hosted on US servers or basically anywhere in the world... How will narrowing the range down to a specific geolocation help?)

\- Me: Okay, but still, it'd require too much unnecessary resources to scan all the IP's. The chance of finding a valid IP randomly is just near zero. Even if we eventually find one, we're still not sure of the quality of the website. It might not even have external links. So it's just a waste of computational power.

\- Professor: Of course it'll use lots of resources, what did you expect!

&#x200B;

There are tons of other issues in his method we didn't talk about, some of these include:

\- With virtual hosts, the same IP could have multiple websites. We have no way of knowing that just by knowing the IP address.

\- Some websites might use a different port, other than 80 or 443.

\- While domain name stays the same, some websites rotate their IP's or use different servers when one is down, so with this method we might not be able to reach the website as expected at any given point in time.

&#x200B;

So please, for the love of god, tell me if there's any actual search engines that uses this stupid method to crawl the web. I think my professor is just incompetent at this point. Or maybe I'm too stupid to understand his bright idea?",2024-02-10 23:46:41
1ampe99,Examples of optimisations (or other code) which use the fact that identical symbols must have the same value?,"I'm a PhD philosophy student writing about the nature of reference. I want to draw on some examples from computer science.

Are there any examples of programming which take advantage of the assumption that identical symbols must have the same value (at least under circumstances)? Or more generally, any programming which treat cases of the same symbol used twice differently from cases of different symbols being used (i.e. before evaluating either of them).

For example, suppose you're working in a language like lisp, and want an equality operator which takes symbols as its arguments, not names (or you want to define an equality macro) an implementation might go something like this:

    def eqs (sym1, sym2)
      if (sym1 == sym2) 
        true
      else if ((val sym1)  == (val sym2))
        true
      else
        false

If sym1 and sym2 are the same symbol, they must have the same value. So we don't need to check their values and compare them. If they're different symbols though, they might have the same *or* different values, so we have get the values and check.

Obviously this is a very contrived example. Are there are real examples which take advantage of this sort of technique?

But during the following week where i have to implement some of the same prior weeks fundamentals in addition to the newly learned fundamentals, i go completely blank on what i previously learned. Granted, i can swap to my last project and look it over real quick to remember, but is that how its supposed to feel (anxiously trying to remember without 'cheating')? I feel like usually in life when i learn something (i.e. drywall/construction; currently a general contractor looking for more tech type life) i can implement it indefinitely, especially less than a week later.

1750xtd,How do you reduce in polynomial time an NP-Complete problem to Two Subset Sum?,"Hi! I recently found this interesting variant of the subset sum problem that resembles the partition problem but with a slight twist. As input, you are given a set of positive integers, and you must decide if two different subsets have the same sum. In the partition problem, both subsets must be disjoint and divide the subset in two, so I was wondering if the problem remained NP-Complete when both properties were dropped. I was able to reduce the problem to a 0-1 program: \\sum\_{i=1}\^{n} 10\^{n-i}\*x\_i - \\sum\_{i=n+1}\^{2n} 10\^{n-i}\*x\_i < 0, \\sum\_{i=1}\^{n} a\_i\*x\_i  - \\sum\_{i=n+1}\^{2n} a\_{i-n}\*x\_i = 0, where the set is S = {a1,..., an} and x\_i ‚àà {0,1} for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ 2n. Encode both solutions as base 10 numbers and ensure they're not equal. Then, make both subset have an equal sum. By mistake, I performed the reduction in the wrong direction. Is there a polynomial time reduction from an NP-Complete problem to this one?",2023-10-11 00:35:33

15fe90d,How are closures supposed to interact with variable binding and resolving?,"I am currently reading the Crafting Interpreter book and I have a question about the [Resolving and Binding chapter](https://craftinginterpreters.com/resolving-and-binding.html)

The author gave this example to illustrate the problem with the implementation at that point in the book.

```
var a = ""global"";
{
  fun showA() {
    print a;
  }

  showA();
  var a = ""block"";
  showA();
}
```

The problem being that this prints

```
global
block
```

The argument the author is making is that, once the variable is captured as a closure, it should not be possible to change it, hence the second call to `showA()` should not give a different result from the first call.

The author makes the claim this is an issue to be fixed and the chapter is dedicated to fixing it.

But is this really an issue? If I run the JavaScript version of the code

```
var a = ""global"";
{
  function showA() {
    console.log(a);
  }

  showA();
  var a = ""block"";
  showA();
} 
```

I get exactly the output the author claims to be wrong. That is:

```
global
block

Is the author mistaken to claim this is a bug? Or the author is correct and JavaScript has this bug?",2023-08-01 14:30:51

11oqic6,Advice needed: pursuing CS research or taking a data handling opportunity at a prestigious lab for grad school?,"Hello everyone,

I am a senior computer science student at Florida State University, set to graduate in the fall of 2023. As an international student, I have been taking care of myself since 2019 and have had to work part-time as a server to pay for college and living expenses. While this job may not be relevant experience, it has taught me a lot as a person. Despite the constricted time between work and classes, I have maintained a GPA of 3.95, which may drop a few points by the time I am done.

I am looking to continue my education by pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at a top-tier university like UT Austin, Georgia Tech, University of Washington, among others. However, I have been rejected in more than 100 applications for SWE internships due to a lack of side projects, and research opportunities with CS faculty at FSU have also been difficult to come by.

Recently, I was offered an opportunity to work with chemistry scientists at the MagLab in Tallahassee, a prestigious laboratory worldwide. While the work is basic data handling in Python, they offer many benefits, including good hourly pay, which will allow me to quit my job as a server and tutor, and a lot of support for my education. However, I am unsure if this research will be relevant to improve my resume and help me get into a top-tier grad school. While it may be better than serving experience, it is not a CS research, and I won't be doing much. On the other hand, I could apply again for some research with the CS faculty, and I am confident that I could get something, but I wouldn't get many benefits.

I am torn between taking the MagLab opportunity or looking for CS research. While I am pretty sure I could get a research position with the CS faculty, I won't get much help from them, and they are known for just changing the name on a recommendation letter template they have. The MagLab, on the other hand, makes a lot of emphasis on wanting me to thrive and help me with my education. They are willing to help me a lot, and I see they care about me as a human being.

I am seeking advice on what to do. Should I look for a CS research position, or should I take the MagLab opportunity? Which one will give me better chances of getting into a top-tier school? I apologize for the long post, but I wanted to provide as much information as possible to help you understand the situation. Thank you in advance for your help

PD: I want to focus my MS in ML, so thats why i think data handling in python could be somewhat relevant, since I have been trying to train myself on Data Science (From what I understand, it is a good way to start my path in ML)",2023-03-11 17:59:31
11m2tmr,Lang based on Computability Logic? What might this look like?,"* [Towards Distributed Logic Programming based on Computability Logic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07036.pdf)

I'm interested in LP like Prolog so this seems interesting to me, but hoping to be clearer on how such a lang would work. They seem to be proposing an LP lang based on [Computability logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_logic) as opposed to ""classical logic"" like FOL. Here's a nice [overview of complog](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04513.pdf) but from the wiki, one thing I was curious about was

>**In classical logic, formulas represent true/false statements. In CoL, formulas represent computational problems**. In classical logic, the validity of a formula depends only on its form, not on its meaning. In CoL, validity means being always computable. More generally, classical logic tells us when the truth of a given statement always follows from the truth of a given set of other statements. Similarly, CoL tells us when the computability of a given problem A always follows from the computability of other given problems B1,...,Bn. Moreover, it provides a uniform way to actually construct a solution (algorithm) for such an A from any known solutions of B1,...,Bn.

What would this look like implemented as a programming language? I'm trying to imagine it compared to know I know from prolog. So in prolog

    foo(X) :- bar(X), baz(X). 

head is true if body is true, right? So this is that boolean logic they mention, but how would this be different? I tried looking at section 6 Examples but got kinda lost, however from what I can understand, it does seem very similar to regular FOL. Also how would the ""games"" between agents they mention come into play?",2023-03-08 17:45:12

Presumably, such a format would have required you to transfer the data off of it within a day of taking the photos, so as to not run out of power and lose the photos ‚Äî but most digital photographers transfer their photos to a PC as soon as they're done the shoot, so that would have worked out.

Is there some hard stop that developers use, say, ""Our training dataset features \*only\* images from before 2020 and the widespread availability of AI image generation engines.""

119d2fs,[Formal language theory and parsing] Could anyone explain a few definitions given in a textbook? (Concepts of Programming Languages [12th Edition] by Robert W. Sebesta),"I have had trouble finding information about several concepts/definitions relating to formal language theory, so it would be greatly appreciated if someone could explain these definitions I came across in the textbook I'm reading. I am not sure where to post this, so if there is a better subreddit for this question, I would appreciate it if someone let me know and I'll post this there instead.

&#x200B;

For some context, here's a passage from the textbook where the author lists the grammar symbols used in this section:

&#x200B;

>In this chapter, we use a small set of notational conventions for grammar symbols and strings to make the discussion less cluttered. For formal languages, they are as follows:  
>  
>**Terminal symbols**‚Äîlowercase letters at the beginning of the alphabet (a,b, . . .)  
>  
>**Nonterminal symbols**‚Äîuppercase letters at the beginning of the alphabet (A, B, . . .)  
>  
>**Terminals or nonterminals**‚Äîuppercase letters at the end of the alphabet (W, X, Y, Z)  
>  
>**Strings of terminals**‚Äîlowercase letters at the end of the alphabet (w, x,y, z)  
>  
>**Mixed strings (terminals and/or nonterminals)**‚Äîlowercase Greek letters (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ¥, Œ≥)

&#x200B;

With this notation in mind, I am having trouble understanding three seemingly related terms:

1. **Handle**
2. **Phrase**
3. **Simple Phrase**

&#x200B;

Here is a passage from the textbook where each of these terms is defined:

&#x200B;

>The handle of a right sentential form is unique. The task of a bottom-up parser is to find the handle of any given right sentential form that can be generated by its associated grammar. Formally, handle is defined as follows:  
>  
>Definition: Œ≤ is the **handle** of the right sentential form Œ≥=Œ±Œ≤w if and only if S => \*rm Œ±Aw =>rmŒ±Œ≤w  
>  
>In this definition, =>rm specifies a rightmost derivation step, and => \*rm specifies zero or more rightmost derivation steps. Although the definition of a handle is mathematically concise, it provides little help in finding the handle of a given right sentential form. In the following, we provide the definitions of several substrings of sentential forms that are related to handles. The purpose of these is to provide some intuition about handles.  
>  
>Definition: Œ≤ is a **phrase** of the right sentential form Œ≥ if and only if S =>\* Œ≥=Œ±1AŒ±2 =>+Œ±1Œ≤Œ±2  
>  
>In this definition, =>+ means one or more derivation steps.  
>  
>Definition: Œ≤ is a **simple phrase** of the right sentential form Œ≥ if and only if S =>\* Œ≥=Œ±1AŒ±2 =>+Œ±1Œ≤Œ±2  
>  
>If these two definitions are compared carefully, it is clear that they differ only in the last derivation specification. The definition of phrase uses one or more steps, while the definition of simple phrase uses exactly one step.  
>  
>The definitions of phrase and simple phrase may appear to have the same lack of practical value as that of a handle, but that is not true. Consider what a phrase is relative to a parse tree. It is the string of all of the leaves of the partial parse tree that is rooted at one particular internal node of the whole parse tree. A simple phrase is just a phrase that takes a single derivation step from its root nonterminal node. In terms of a parse tree, a phrase can be derived from a single nonterminal in one or more tree levels, but a simple phrase can be derived in just a single tree level.

&#x200B;

1ag8i80,Efficient sorting when comparison is the bottleneck,"I'm writing a commandline application for sorting files based on subjective, user defined criteria. So for example, let's say the user wants to sort cat pictures by cuteness. My application would repeatedly present two cat pictures to the user, and ask them to select the cuter one. This would be fed into a comparison based sort behind the scenes, resulting in a list of cat pictures sorted by cuteness

In this design, the comparison would be the most time consuming part of the sort, by far, so I need to choose an algorithm that minimizes the number of unique comparisons. I say unique because I could apply a simple dynamic programming trick and keep a map of comparison inputs to results, so that if the same comparison comes up multiple times, I can simply look up the old result instead of asking the user to compare the same pictures again

I've also thought about extending this to comparisons that are ""indirectly"" computable based on previous comparison results. So if I'm presented with two cat pictures `a` and `c` that I haven't compared before, but I have determined that picture `c` is cuter than some other picture `b`, and I've also determined that picture `b` is cuter than picture `a`, I can deduce that `c` is cuter than `a`, and avoid asking the user to compare them. I could probably also extend this recursively, chaining indirect comparisons in order to find redundant computations.

So my question is, which sorting algorithm should I use? Does my idea of finding redundant computations by comparing existing comparison results affect which algorithm would be optimal?

194hyl5,concurrency anti-patterns?,"I'm kinda in between projects so I've been spending a lot of time in support spaces helping people with issues I'm familiar with, and I've noticed some recurring bad concurrency habits in asker's code.

This got me thinking that there must be a list of **concurrency anti-patterns** out there somewhere, but searching for those really just turned up lists of **concurrency bugs** which are commonly caused by anti-patterns (ie deadlock, race condition) but aren't really anti-patterns in themselves.

So I figured I'd post here to ask what concurrency anti-patterns you guys have seen either in support spaces or in real projects, get a nice list going and maybe put some formal names on them. 

I'll start it off with the ones I've seen recently:

#Single Threaded With Extra Steps

**seen in**: from-scratch gamedev is where I see this

**the pattern**: You have two threads. One mutates some state, the other needs to process this state. At least one (usually both) of these actions is computationally expensive. These actions are the threads' respective core responsibilities. You share the state between the two threads, and use a mutex to protect this shared state.

**the problem**: Neither thread can work while the other thread is working. Best-case scenario, they act in lockstep - Thread A mutates while Thread B waits until the mutation completes, Thread B does its processing while Thread A waits for processing to complete, repeat. Worst case scenario - usually brought on by using ""unfair mutexes"" optimized for fine-grained locking scenarios - one thread winds up starved because it can't wake and lock the mutex before the other thread re-locks it.

**the (typical) solution**: Switch to a consumer-producer pattern and communicate updates of the state through a copy of the state. The producer thread has one copy of the state which it mutates, the consumer thread has one copy of the state it does its processing on, and somewhere there's a third version of the state which is either an update for the consumer to swap out its copy for or a stale version waiting to be cleaned up after the producer swaps in an update.

#Waiting on Your Own Promises

**seen in**: bounded threadpools exposing a promise/future API, or layers over bounded threadpools providing such an API

**the pattern**: you post a task to the bounded threadpool. This task then posts another task to the threadpool, then waits on completion. The second task may or may not continue this pattern. Sometimes there's some indirections (ie waiting on a task on another threadpool, which then waits on another task in this threadpool)

**the problem**: each task in the threadpool waiting on a promise that only the threadpool can fulfill reduces the number of threads available to the threadpool, not only reducing its concurrency but potentially deadlocking the entire thing which is usually when this gets noticed.

**the solution**: either use an unbounded threadpool or a continuation pattern for these kinds of tasks. Higher level solutions like FSMs and coroutines can avoid ""callback hell"" for continuations.",2024-01-12 00:57:46

17y8ifc,Request: Crash course on how ChatGPT / Stable Diffusion works for people with a CS background,"In a nutshell, I graduated with a degree in CS 8 years ago, and my concentration was actually in machine learning and AI. However, my career has taken me to automation work, not probabilistic models and deep learning, so I've found that my knowledge has atrophied quite a bit. 

I'm looking for an actual crash course on how these new forays into machine intelligence actually *work*. I understand, at a high level, how things like neural networks work, machine learning in general, statistics/probability, etc, but I'm finding that there's a lot of terminology I've either forgotten, or new industry terms and concepts that weren't covered in my coursework. 

An example is ""temperature"" in ChatGPT, which seems to dictate the ""creativity"" of the output. I understand that it's NOT creativity, but rather a mechanism that dictates how literal the response is based on the available model... but that's also just a guess based on what little reading I've done. 

Does any such material exist? I find that just Googling ""how does ChatGPT work?"" gives me material designed for people who never took collegiate mathematics, much less computer science.

\- How did webservers used to work in the 90's, and how did they evolve over time?  
\- How did PHP do things differently?  
\- How do other frameworks/languages deal with it? Can the methods they used be categorized into some approaches, or does it all boil down to the same thing? 

Any clarification is really appreciated!

17gj1hq,Relearn fundamentals?,"Hi guys,  
I'm not quite sure how it happened, but I've recently found myself in a computer science role despite originally aiming for a web dev lol. My first project was more web dev-focused so I felt okay, but now I'm diving into topics like acceleration and vectors/trig. I'm quickly realizing that a lot of this material is going over my head.

  
While I do have a degree in Math, it's been seven years since I was in school, and my last job was more admin than anything. I'm wondering if anyone can recommend books or courses that could help me get up to speed on some of these topics. Currently, I'm handling tasks as they come, but I ALWAYS feel that there's a significant gap in my knowledge.

  
I'm considering going through Free Code Camp's two calculus courses(close 20hrs I think) and then revisiting discrete and linear algebra. I'm not sure if I'm overthinking my situation, but I believe this could be beneficial in the long run? I'm genuinely excited about my career and am aiming to get a master's degree soon. So, investing time in reviewing these topics might be worth it regardless. Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

163zd1m,"Are my interpretations of what ""Spurious failure"" mean and Bus arbitrage does, correct?","I find very hard to look for this information on the internet since all concepts seem to be spread in their own independent branches of computer science..., it seems each layer of abstraction hides the fundamentals that... if I am understanding them correctly... are not that difficult to understand... and in fact bring a LOT MORE coherency to the entire concurrent ""race condition"" issue.

The Java documentation has 2 different types of atomic operations.

One under the category of ""strong"" the other under the category of ""weak""

The documentation states that ""weak"" atomic operations may ""FAIL SPURIOUSLY""

And this is what I believe is the reason why:

It boils down to the next statement:

**The LOCK prefix has no intrinsic retry for lock acquirement (spinning).**

What this means is:

After having reached the first position within the Bus arbiters non-FIFO queue, the instruction will read the LOCK, and will leave... or will read it as available and will enter it and LOCK it themselves.

But ONCE the instructions read it as ""LOCK-ed"" they leave... AND THATS THE END OF IT.

This means that it becomes a higher-level language responsibility to either RETRY to acquire the LOCK via a spin-blocking operation... or leave and continue.

I will try to explain my thought process of what the instructions do with JDK 7, which actually shows some behavior,

(As of now this is done ""natively""... by natively I'm not sure if this is done in C, C++ or maybe straight as a processor instruction... but as of today it's not done in Java anymore.)

        public final V getAndSet(V newValue) {
          while (true) {
             V x = get();
             if (compareAndSet(x, newValue))
                return x;
          }
       }

this is a ""strong"" compareAndSet"", a strong compare and set is an instruction that is DETERMINED to acquire the LOCK prefix (according to my interpretation).

This means that this operation at the time (JDK7) was a double nested spinlock (one higher spin and one lower spin).

Assume the first concurrent instruction (Thread ONE) has entered the BUS and the memory is LOCK-ed.

* The BUS will be LOCK-ed, and the BUS arbiter with its queue will be made available for any concurrent incoming instructions.
* Thread TWO: The first spinlock will read the volatile field (`V x = get();`) (which should be the same value as the one the first Thread (Thread ONE) read).
* 2 parameters will enter the native function, the volatile dereferenced read ""`x`"", and the newValue.
* The ""read LOCK"" instruction will enter the arbiter's queue and will find it to be locked.
* The instruction will leave the queue with a failure.
* a higher level, in this case I believe is C++, will acknowledge the failure and spin-retry to acquire the LOCK again... and again... in a spin-blocking operation. The contentious LOCK acquiring is what makes this a ""strong"" CAS atomic operation.
* The thread will lose its sequential consistency/position (race condition) during these periods of queuing and spinning, either it be because some other Thread acquires the lock while it is performing a spin, or because the Bus arbiter decides to give priority to some other instruction within its non-FIFO queue.
* Finally Thread ONE will free the BUS and our queued instruction will re-enter the BUS and LOCK it themselves.
* Then it will perform a ""compare""(which will obviously return false) and come back.
* Then the higher level (in this case Java) will re-try with its outer spinlock.

As you can see this is performing unnecessary tasks like retrying the lock acquiring to check for a compare task that will obviously fail, this is why as of now, everything is done differently (just with `LOCK+XCHG`).

Now the ""weak"" CASing enters the scene.

And the reason why the weakComapreAndSet ""fails spuriously"" is because there is NO native ""retry-acquire"" of LOCK.

If the instruction finds the BUS to be LOCK-ed it immediately leaves to the higher-level.

This is an AtomicIntegerArray example of JDK16:

       public final int getAndUpdate(int i, IntUnaryOperator updateFunction) {
          int prev = get(i), next = 0;
          for (boolean haveNext = false;;) {
             if (!haveNext)
             next = updateFunction.applyAsInt(prev);
             if (weakCompareAndSetVolatile(i, prev, next))
                return prev;
             haveNext = (prev == (prev = get(i)));
          }
       }

Here if the instruction misses the LOCK on the arbiter's side, it immediately escapes to the higher level and retries.

This makes the assumption that if we missed the lock because of contention, then the volatile read we previously did is no longer useful, so we escape to the higher level again... this is a good assumption.

If we consider the ""strong"" compareAndSet as a ""CONTENTIOUS lock acquiring mechanism"", then the behavior will INDEED return the LAST value (happens before) matching the ""strong"" memory model behavior, simply because it will check for memory consistency via spin-lock contention PLUS `cmpxchg`, BUT this does not necessarily mean that the ""weak"" resembles a weak memory model... the ""weak"" behavior is not even a memory behavior... it defines the difference between 2 different spin-blocking strategies!!

To sum this up, my interpretation obeys the next axioms given by the JavaDoc:

* ""strong"" compareAndSet has **""strong memory ordering semantics""** (because of how the spin-lock + [cmpxchg](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/cmpxchg) combo which provides memory consistency and NOT because of some native FENCING ([mfence](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mfence)) which is a true memory ordering mechanic).
* Spurious failures when referred as ""**the possibility that the method may return false even if the expected value matches the current value**.""... Since the failure is a result of contention met, NOT comparison failure.

Maybe the reason for the ""weak"" prefix, has nothing to do with memories, but instead just to make a distinction with the *other* **more contentious** comapreAndSet ...

Is my interpretation of the weakCompareAndSet correct??",2023-08-28 21:54:38

138ribv,Where to Start? Finance Edition,"Hello all, I wanted to make this post because the amount of material online for CS can be kind of overwhelming. I'm looking to learn the basics of coding (I'll expand on that in a minute) and think this community could give the best help.

&#x200B;

Quick background: 

* Sophomore at non-target school
* Studying finance and want to do investment banking
* Literally zero coding experience/exposure; I very naively think I understand what AI/ML *means*

&#x200B;

After discussing with many professionals both in the Finance and CS fields, it's clear that automation via AI/ML is coming. This may be all for naught and every white collar job is screwed, but I may as well upskill myself anyways. 

&#x200B;

What I'm looking for specifically:

There are AI systems being implemented into finance. Right now, that means that we *converse* with ChatGPT to carry out our asks. That *conversing* is merely so we have an interface to this technology. Soon, that can be automated to the point the LLMs it is trained on is all that would be required. So sure, the statistical methodologies and the code for this would be important to understand, but as that gets automated/pre-baked into a system, that won't matter *as much*. 

What's more important is understanding *how* data that AI surfaces (for a finance example, a predicted movement of a stock) actually got there. That requires a solid understanding of AI tools and ML methodologies rather than writing them yourself. 

The recommended path I was told to go on toward upskilling to prepare for this was Andrew Ng's Coursera course ""Machine Learning Specialization"". After diving deeper, it stated that to be best prepared for that course, a baseline understanding of basic coding (function calls, variables, for loops, if statements) should be met. Ultimately, I'm asking **where I can learn these basic things online?** I'm not going to be able to pick up a CS major/minor/any classes at all if I want to graduate in four years; obviously the best path would be taking college courses but I would like to think that what I'm trying to learn is not ginormously-comprehensive to the point that I can expedite/streamline by only learning what I want to learn.

&#x200B;

Feel free to rip this apart if I'm horribly mistaken with my interpretations of my conversations and the perspective I have to this, because I can learn from that too. However, I would really appreciate knowing where and how to start down this path. Thanks!",2023-05-05 15:05:53

on chapter 23 (algorithm of Kruskal and Prim) appears the following question:

>Suppose that a graph G has a minimum spanning tree already computed. How quickly can we update the minimum spanning tree if we add a new vertex and incident edges to G?

on this link:

    https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ajl213/CLRS/Ch23.pdf

the following solution is written:

> Exercise 23.2-7 We first add all the edges to the new vertex. Then, we preform a DFS rooted at that vertex. As we go down, we keep track of the largest weight edge seen so far since each vertex above us in the DFS. We know from exercise 23.3-6 that in a directed graph, we don‚Äôt need to consider cross or forward edges. Every cycle that we detect will then be formed by a back edge. So, we just remove the edge of greatest weight seen since we were at the vertex that the back edge is going to. Then, we‚Äôll keep going until we‚Äôve removed one less than the degree of the vertex we added many edges. This will end up being linear time since we can reuse part of the DFS that we had already computed before detecting each cycle. 

  
how did he used the fact that we had an MST calculated before?  
why would using DFS like so give us an MST?  
did he mean to add the edges and vertex to the MST we had (and not to G) and then using DFS will give us the new MST?",2023-04-29 14:21:50
12mi37t,Infinite looping between systems,"Let's say you have a pub sub data bus. Two systems A and B that you don't control are both publishing and subscribing to this data bus. System A and B both deal with the same field - for example a 2 letter US state abbreviation. System A publishes the state in lower case - ""ca"", System B as a subscriber picks up the state - does some work and then persists the state back to the bus as ""CA"". System A as a subscriber picks up the state - does its work and then persists the state back to the bus as ""ca"" and so on looping forever. 

How do you detect and guard against this scenario?

1. Do data translation on all fields - ie always store state in upper case. That may solve simple cases like lower/upper case, but other loops could still happen.  
2. Filter incoming updates that don't make a material change. Detecting that an incoming change is just changing the case on a state is easy to detect, but other changes are not so easy to detect.
3. Define a single owner system of each piece of data and only that system can make changes to the field. That defeats one of the purposes of the bus, it was specifically built to bring in the same type of data from different systems. 
4. Detect an unusually high number of changes to a resource - ie if a resource passing through the bus typically undergoes 20 updates through its lifespan watch for examples that get updated 100+ times and alert and lockdown the record.
5. Check if the incoming update is identical to a previous update and filter it. This could also catch legitimate traffic. What if we get a customer name as James and then they later change it to Jim and then back to James and then back to Jim.  All of these changes would be legitimate, but this strategy would filter some of the later updates.

12ljr58,"Feeling Lost, CS or Medicine?","Hey,

Freshman here about to finish his first year of college here and not sure what to do with my life. I'm currently deciding between pursuing either a career in computer science or one in medicine. A career in computer science sounds appealing to me as work-life balance is something I prioritize, but on the other hand there is a lot of parental pressure to pursue medicine and they make it seem like being a doctor is the end all be all of professions.

I came into college as a pre-med sort of blindly following what my parents told me to do but after trying it out for a year I don't know if I could make it through the 10+ additional years of training (undergrad, med school, residency) that it takes to become a doctor. I understand that doctors get a lot more respect and the professions holds a lot more social prestige than say software engineers but I'm not sure how much that really matters to me (even though my parents insist that I will end up caring about those things later on in life). In addition to this, my parents claim that if I do end up working in computer science I will forever have to deal with ""low-level individuals"" and I'll just be another person in the rat race and that I will never reach my full potential. The point that they drilled home the most though was that if I went into computer science as a software engineer I would likely be out of a job within 5 years, as the coding languages I learned would become obsolete and I would be replaced by ""someone willing to work 20hrs/day"" or some kind of AI. As a result, I would have to go back to school to either pursue a masters or an MBA if I ever wanted to move up which, according to them, would be even harder than becoming a doctor.

Despite this, I still feel like I'd be more equipped to manage the pain in pursuing a career in computer science as I simply don't know if I have the dedication required to go through all of the training necessary to become a physician.

However, and this is the kicker, my parents told me that if I were to switch my major to computer science they would no longer support me financially and that I would have to find a way to pay for my college tuition, among other expenses, myself (which is quite expensive as I go to a somewhat ""prestigious"" school).

I feel so lost right now and feel like I'm being forced to decide what I want to do for the rest of my life so early. Should I just listen to my parents and grind through the process of becoming a doctor even if my heart isn't in medicine? And is there any truth to their claims about computer science being an awful field to pursue? Any advice would be greatly appreciated,

11zm31g,Merkle Tree Blockchain Question - How do we know Merkle Proof contains legit hashes?,"I'm trying to understand merkle trees in the context of blockchain and am not understanding how it helps with transaction verification (verifying if a transaction is in a block).

The typical explanation is that merkle trees enable a SPV (simple payment verification) client to verify that a transaction is contained inside a block via a Merkle Proof (a list of hashes of the transaction branch). This reduces the number of hashes needed to be verified to Log N (where N = # transactions in block). Without a Merkle Tree, one would need to download all N transactions inside the block to compute and verify the block hash.

Maybe I'm an idiot, but this makes no sense to me. 

How do we know the hashes inside the Merkle Proof are legitimate? Wouldn't it be simple to just create a bunch of fake hashes that hash to the same root hash?

Like if someone is trying to prove to me they've made $100 by telling me they received $20, $30, and $50, how the hell is that any proof when I don't trust them in the first place. Me adding up the numbers they gave me doesn't actually verify anything unless I knew with certainty those numbers were correct. Since the SPV client doesn't have the transaction data and can't verify whether the transaction data being given to it is correct, I don't see how anything is actually being verified here.",2023-03-23 14:28:33

When it comes to writing simple code (i.e. creating a functioning calculator, etc.), I usually would be okay with that but when I did those free online tutorials (Codecademy) where I need to write code in order to solve a problem that is given, my brain would have a mental breakdown and would take me ages just to solve one of them.

Trust me, if you ask me I need more practice, etc., etc., it's useless, I am just not meant to be a problem-solver. I have practiced and practiced but always seem to be unable to solve any problems that are given to me. Even when it comes to Math, I always perform well in questions where the teacher gives like a question for us to solve (i.e. finding the derivative of \[math question\]) but questions like *""Sonya can paint at a rate of v(t) = 150 ‚Äì 4t square feet per hour, where t is the number of hours since she started painting. Can Sonya paint the walls of a 12-foot by 12-foot office with an 8-foot high ceiling in 3 hours?""* I would perform poorly on questions like these which I know Computer Science would have a lot of.

Should I pursue Computer Science or should I look at some other alternatives to major in?

If you could give your own experiences, that would be great! 

Thank you!",2023-03-19 16:41:28

1anjwfx,Pumping Lemma Proof's,"Let A = {w ‚àà {a, b}| every prefix of w contains at least as many a‚Äôs as b‚Äôs}.  
can s = a^(p+1)b^(p) be used to show this language is not regular? (Yes or no)

Why is the answer to this question ""NO"" instead of ""YES"" 

Instead of proving a language is not regular with the pumping lemma, in this question you have to decide whether or not a string can be used to prove the language is not regular.  
  
I saw the answer to this question was ""NO this string cannot be used to finish the proof"" the string a^(p+1)b^(p) can't be used since they split the language into xy^(i)z with x = epsilon y = a and z = a^(p)b^(p) so no matter what i value we choose the string is still in the language. 

Doesn't this only show it for one example?? There still could possibly be another way to split the string that results in being able to prove the language isn't regular. 

Assuming regular language and pumping length p My thought process was let x = a^(alpha), y = a^(beta\*i), z = a ^(p+1 - alpha - beta) b^(p) 

alpha + beta <= p and beta >= 1  
  
For this language we need number of a's >= number of b's in each prefix so  
  
alpha + beta \* i + p + 1 - alpha - beta >= p  
  
beta \* i + 1 - beta >= 0 If we let i = 0 and if beta > 1 we have a contradiction. So why can't we use it?",2024-02-10 16:18:51

190oq02,Is Multi-Stack PDA is more powerful than a CFG?,"So for Regular Languages, we used DFA/NFA/Œµ-NFA and showed equivalences.

We also learned about the equivalence between Pushdown Automata and Context-free gramars.

From an overall perspective, these automata exist to give us a notion (I guess?) on how a computer would recognize regular languages via regular expressions and context-free grammars. 

We use Pumping lemmas to show that a language is not regular or not context free.

Before applying pumping lemma, we can also use a bit of intuition. If counting is involved, it is most likely not regular. If ""sophisticated counting"" is involved, it cannot be context free because when you think about the PDA implementation with a single stack, it might get complicated.

But when I thought about this, what about PDA with Multistacks? Those guys are more powerful than the normal PDAs, are they thus also more powerful than CFGs? If so, what exactly is their purpose? Because if I'm not mistaken, PDAs exist to help to figure out a way to check for CFGs, but if Multistack PDAs are more powerful than CFGs, then they probably are used for a different kind of concept/language type?",2024-01-07 09:45:23

The question:

Problem 1-8 from The Algorithm Design Manual (2020), by Steven S. Skiena

Prove the correctness of the following recursive algorithm to multiply two natural numbers, for all integer constants c ‚â• 2.

    Multiply(y, z)
    if z = 0 then 
        return(0)
    else 
        return(Multiply(cy, ‚åäz/c‚åã) + y ¬∑ (z mod c))

I started my proof, and basically did it the same as [this stack overflow commenter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34504120/where-to-start-when-proving-correctness-of-algorithms). The only difference is, I'm assuming y, z ‚â• 1 as they are natural numbers. I'm linking their comment so I don't have to type out all the work I did in ugly reddit-math notation.

Unlike the stack overflow person, I'm stuck at the following step:

    by the inductive hypothesis, 
    Multiply(c ¬∑ y, ‚åäz/c‚åã) = c ¬∑ y ¬∑ ‚åäz/c‚åã

How does the inductive hypothesis hold when you call multiply on (cy, ‚åäz/c‚åã)? I understand it is fine for ‚åäz/c‚åã as ‚åäz/c‚åã < z, but c * y > y, so does the inductive hypothesis still hold? If so, can you explain it to me?",2023-12-31 10:28:18

I don‚Äôt know a lot about hardware in general, so I must be somewhat vague in my terms. But what got me thinking about this was a collection of presentations where some renowned programmers mentioned their desire to have programming languages that help them reason about performance in explicit terms. They would sometimes bemoan the requirement that they tune their code in arcane ways to get high performance, and how they often can only speak in probabilistic terms about things like cache locality.

16ckgyw,How do I teach myself cs?,"Oh boy, this one's a big one.
And btw before you click away I'm not talking about coding, that's something else.

I started at uni for cs a few days ago and I thought I was alright at it, built my own pc, play games every day and know a fair bit about some stuff here and there, but today I met someone my age (around 19) that showed me so much stuff and threw around so many words and other things, uni gave me a linux laptop that is arriving very soon and I'm a bit overwhelmed but also very very excited to delve into that world.
So turns out I know absolutely nothing, but want to know a lot more. How do I start? I'm sure linux will help me understand systems better but there are so many things i have no idea about but want to learn.
Do I just trust the process and expect to learn it all in uni? and if not, what books or resources would you recommend me?",2023-09-07 16:36:20

165zepl,Binary to character displaying on screen.,"Hello All,   
I have been wondering how all this works from binary code to having a character being displayed on your screen. I undrstand that the computer uses ASCII in order to interpret characters down to machine language. However, I dont deeply understand how it knows to interpet it going from binary to decimal to ASCII. Like how does it know that 65 is an A and it knowing how its drawn out. Does it just turn on the indivual transitors that draw out the letter to your screen?",2023-08-31 03:12:02

Only the explaining at 24:40 made some vague sense in the way I understood the words were English and the 1 it 0 in a binary notation of the title number can determine if it's in a row or column or band patterns.

But that is prisoner 1so I don't understand how prisoner 2s  figured out a random position on the board where a bit was flipped.

8x8 board bits are randomly flipped by the warden and he hides a key under one tile.

Prisoner 1 is allowed to flip 1 bit to indicate to prisoner 2 where the key is. Prisoner 1 and 2 can discuss strategy beforehand. In the video though they didn't discuss together 1 deduced the proper strategy to use and made the change and 1 looked up the correct strategy to play his part.

If Prisoner 1 flips a bit or doesn't flip a bit isn't that the same thing because the arrangement of bits is random. In this puzzle you have to flip something, I don't understand how what is flipped is determined and reversed if the board is random.",2023-08-23 23:29:59
15tzn91,What are the conditions necessary for a programming language to have no undefined behavior?,"For context, yesterday I posted  https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/161643/131435.  Part of what prompted me to ask that question in the first place is that, awhile ago, someone on the learnprogramming subreddit told me something about the reason C++ in particular has so much undefined behavior is because, for it to _not_ have undefined behavior it would have to use a much more restrictive language model, but they didn't explain what that meant exactly.  I had also asked on Quora awhile ago about why C++ compilers don't always throw errors when a program contains undefined behavior and at least one answer mentioned something about it being fundamentally _impossible_ to always detect undefined behavior at compile time and that this was related to the halting problem being undecidable.  

Those two things combined have me wondering about models of computing more generally -- my understanding is that all/most popular programming languages, including C++, are Turing complete, and since I was told the problem of detecting UB in C++ is _fundamental_ and related to the halting problem, I thought that perhaps _all_ Turing complete programming languages must have undefined behavior and C++ is just worse at hiding it than others.  But judging from the answers to my above-linked question, I was mistaken about that.  

So my question now is, what conditions need to be imposed on a Turing complete language in order to guarantee that all possible programs written in the language will have fully defined behavior determined by the language specification?  And, on a side note, does the answer have anything to do with the incompleteness theorems?  I ask the latter question because the idea of defining a language, for which all possible programs have fully defined behavior seems quite similar to the idea of defining an axiom system for which all possible theorems are provable/disprovable.",2023-08-17 21:01:28

15gjjmd,What exactly does it mean for a number to be uncomputable?,"I've been reading on Wikipedia about it which says that a number is uncomputable if there's no algorithm that can compute it to arbitrary precision in a finite amount of time.  The part that's throwing me off is, an algorithm in terms of _which operations_?  An algorithm is just a step-by-step list of instructions composed of some ""base"" set of allowed instructions.  If we're talking about a digital computer, ultimately that comes down to the logic gate operations, which are ultimately an approximate model of boolean algebra and of a Turing machine (""approximate"" because no physical computer can work with an infinite number of bits).  So does ""uncomputable"" just mean ""can't be approximated to arbitrary precision _by a Turing machine/via Boolean algebra_""?  That is, is a statement that a particular number/set of numbers is uncomputable really just a statement about the limits of the Turing model of computation and it's possible that some other model of computation could have algorithms for computing, to arbitrary precision, numbers that are normally called uncomputable?  Or is uncomputability something more fundamental?  Like, if a number is uncomputable, does that mean there's really no way _at all_ to compute it to arbitrary precision, regardless of the model of computation being used?  If, how would this even be proven?

Also, note that I'm purely asking about the mathematical theory here -- for purposes of this question, I don't care whether or not a number is uncomputable just _for practical purposes_, only in principle.",2023-08-02 20:17:09
15fwoyq,How comparable it is to play a video on its native resolution than playing it on a window with a different size?,"This is just a hypothetical question, I was just wondering about it and there are certain things I don't know how to answer. But I don't have anything I am working on that require a precise and formal answer.

Assume I have a 4k monitor and a video file with resolution of 720p.

If I play this video, assuming the window size matches its resolution, the area of the video will fit inside the monitor. I assume that each pixel of the video is being mapped to a single pixel on the monitor.

When I maximize the video to full screen, I assume that the OS or the video player maps each pixel of the video to an area of n pixels on the monitor. I assume that this will consume more resources from the CPU or GPU. You have to map each pixel, and you also have to update a larger area of the screen.

On the opposite side, if you resize your window to be smaller than 720p, you also have to map an area of the video to each pixel on that window size. But here you update less pixels on the monitor.

So I have a few questions:

When I am playing a video, how different it would be in these 3 scenarios? Proper sized windows vs smaller or larger ones. Does it make a difference or are these algorithms efficient enough that it doesn't matter? If a video is lagging, resizing it down would improve performance, or is it just a placebo effect?",2023-08-02 02:46:39

18y9a6g,How can you transform a PDA to a CFG?,"We never had an exercise on it but there is a theory sheet that mentioned how it roughly would work. I'm not sure if I should post images but according to the theory sheet, you write each transition of the PDA as a tuple and then there are 3 different ways how to derive a production rule for the Context-free grammar from that. Do you guys know any references where I can see someone actually doing this?

[https://imgur.com/PGyWcz3](https://imgur.com/PGyWcz3)

This isn't a homework question per see, you can answer if you want but my main question his:

**""How do you transform a PDA to a CFG?""**

And no, I don't want the intermediate approach, where you first describe the language that is expressed by the PDA and then make a CFG that expresses the same language. I want a direct approach that allows me to use what I know from the PDA, i.e.

    A = (Q, Œ£, Œì, Œ¥, q0, œÑ0, F)
    Q = states
    Œ£ = alpbaet
    Œì = stack alphabet (contains usually only Œ£ and the stack bottom symbol, for us #, in other books I also saw Z or $)
    Œ¥ = Tuples that describe transitions
    q0 = Initial state
    œÑ0 = Initial stack symbols (In some other books, I noticed that people place the stack bottom symbol themselves, we asssume it's there by default and remove it whenever we accept with empty stack)
    F = Accepting states (We either accept with empty stack or accepting states, both are equivalent but some work better depending on case)

From the looks of it, it is possible to just use Œ¥ to derive production rules directly from but I couldn't find anything about this online. Am I missing something or can someone elaborate how this would work?

The high-level idea is that a pushdown automaton ultimately tries to check the word by first placing some chars onto the stack and then deleting them. Partial computations can be stored in a production rule of the CFG.

18vdpzk,Hash table collisions: linked lists vs... another hash table,"Say you work at the register at a store and you need to store the prices of items. If you store them in a sorted list, you can find the price of each item in O(log n) time, which is fast, but finding items in O(1) time would be even better. So you decide to store them in a hash table, since that allows O(1) lookup.

Your hash table is simple - it's just an array of 26 boxes, and the hashing algorithm is simply to put things in each box based on the first letter of the item, ie

    0 = (Apple, $2)
    1 = (Banana, $1)

etc etc

Great. But what about collisions? A lot of textbooks will say ah just make the array contain instead of the items themselves, a linked list of items, ie

    0 = (Apple, $2) -> (Avocado, $3) -> (Asparagus, $2)
    1 = (Banana, $1) -> (BandAid, $5)

My question is, why do the textbooks suggest that? Why would you ever do that? Like yes if there are only very few items in each linked list we can find the item we want quickly, but finding an item in a linked list is still O(n).

If we already know hash tables are O(1), which is much, much faster, *why would we not make the original hash table contain more hash tables*? Such that when we want to look up Avocado, we first consult the original hash table to find the hash table (NOT the linked list) that contains all items that begin with A in O(1), then we ask A hash table for Apple and we get it in O(1).",2023-12-31 18:23:46

18m4mii,Graphs/Traveling Salesman Algorithms,"For a personal project this week, I wanted to try to work with graphs and algorithms related to them. 

Here is the background.

I have coordinate data for a bunch of nodes. I have created edges between these nodes, and the weight is the Euclidean distance between the two nodes. HOWEVER, I have only created edges between nodes that are 5 units apart or less. This graph is undirected, so the nodes will connect back to the one that connects to them.

Because of the way I've done this, I'm sure there are places where I essentially have isolated ""clusters"" of nodes (or in other words, separate graphs that are not connected to each other by any edges). I don't know if this will be a problem.

Here is the problem I want to solve.

I want to come up with circular ""routes"" that will hit as many nodes as possible in the shortest distance traveled.  
By ""circular,"" I meant that the route should end at the same node it started at.  
Once a node is hit, it cannot be hit again for a time (so you can't just go back and forth between 2). I will be measuring the passage of time by the distance traveled, but I'm sure I can figure that out alright.

To be honest, I'm not exactly sure where to start with this kind of thing. I've done simple graph traversal in college, but that was a few years ago and nothing as complex as I think this is.

Here's the biggest problem I think I need help solving:  
How do I make sure this algorithm ends? What happens if I get into a situation where my route goes into a loop that doesn't include the starting node? How would I tell this happens and how would I correct it?

18llkic,Sorting with strong sequential restrictions,"I have a problem where I need a sorting algorithm that meets specific criteria.  To avoid getting bogged down in the details of my actual hardware, I will provide a simplified model that I think captures the problem I'm trying to solve.

You have exactly two tape devices.  The devices have commands: READ, WRITE and REWIND.  When you issue a READ command, the tape device will start reading records from the tape and presenting them at fixed intervals (the tape moves at constant speed through the reels), ultimately ending with an EOF record.  Similarly, when you issue a WRITE command, you are expected to provide records to the tape at fixed intervals, until you eventually provide an EOF record.  REWIND aborts any currently executing operation rewinds the tape to the beginning.  There is no possibility of seeking - the only thing you can do is read records from beginning to end.  We can assume that tape reads and writes are perfectly reliable, and that records are all the same size.  We should also assume that the available memory is much smaller than the size of a tape (because otherwise, you would just read in all of tape A, sort it in memory, and then write it back to tape B).  You begin with unsorted records on tape A and a blank tape on tape B.  The goal is to produce a tape with sorted records.  What is the optimal sorting algorithm with these constraints?

Merge sort is generally considered the best sort for sequential access, but I can't see a way to implement it with only two tapes.  If we had three tapes, we could divide from tape A to B&C, then merge from B&C back to A, and so on.  But we don't have three tapes, we have two.

Bubble sort can be made to work.  Allocate a buffer the size of two records.  Issue a READ to tape A and allow the first two records to arrive.  Then, issue a WRITE to tape B and write the smaller of the two.  Continue receiving one record and writing the smaller of the two records in the buffer.  Once you get to the end of the file, repeat, but now read from tape B and write back to tape A.  As expected with Bubblesort, this is O(n^(2)) - you have O(n) tape swaps, each of which involves an O(n) pass through the entire tape.

Perhaps you can improve performance somewhat by using a larger buffer, using a strategy somewhat similar to shell sort.  Suppose you read (up to) 16 records and write the smallest.  Sorting 16 records in-memory is still O(1), preserving the real-time constraint, because 16 is a constant.  You can't do a true shell sort where you read half the list, because that wouldn't be a constant.  And this is still O(n^(2)), but likely with a smaller constant factor, so faster in practice.

That's all I can think of.  Is there anything better?",2023-12-18 22:29:59

17z98uj,"If the thermal problems with scaling frequency were solved or ignored, how would processors optimally look with current semiconductor scaling (""3‚Äì5 nm"" node), in terms of clock speed, core count, and overall performance?","By ""solved"" I mean a materials breakthrough significantly reduced the current leakage issues at present scales, and by ""ignored"" I mean some processor manufacturer decides to release ridiculously highly-clocked processors‚Ä† that consume more than a kilowatt and require a special aerospace-grade liquid cooling solution to avoid releasing their magic smoke in less than a second.

**An alternate, alternate-historical title for this question would be:** ""Aeropunk: New materials are discovered in the early-mid 2000s allowing Dennard scaling to continue to the present-day‚Äîwhat would modern processors look like, in terms of clock speed, core number, and overall performance?""

Obviously, increasing clock speed generally increases performance, but the performance gains aren't linear, due largely to the effects of having to *manage ever-greater effective latency*:

1. Increasing the frequency (while keeping main memory distance constant) increases the number of clock cycles the processor has to wait before it is able to have direct access to main memory, due to memory logic latency (AFAIK largely constant at a given process technology and scale) and the signal velocity. This means, to ensure it remains as effective, that *a core must become larger* (both in transistor count and with keeping a given scale, physical size) to fit larger, deeper caches with more logic for processes like pre-fetching, branch prediction/speculative execution, and still-deeper pipelines. This will reduce performance-per-cycle-*per-transistor*, starting to reduce the number of cores that can be placed on a given-size die and thus partially countering the effect of increasing frequency.‚Ä°
2. As frequency increases given constant signal velocity and process scaling, the maximum area of you can make a core before running into signal asynchrony and logic conflict problems *decreases*.
3. Thus, at some frequency, the size of an ""effective"" core hits the maximum size you can make it.
4. If you want to go even faster with a given process scaling and don't want race conditions, et cetera wrecking your logic, you are *forced* by daddy Einstein to reduce the size of a core even as its optimal size continues to increase, either taking away transistors from caching or arithmetic functions, leading to a dramatic drop in performance-per-cycle-per-transistor as the system is choked by either memory latency leading to inefficiently-used or even completely wasted cycles, or by a less capable ALU.

**So, rephrasing the question yet again...** With current semiconductor scaling, where would the wall mentioned in 3. be, and approximately at what frequency would peak performance for a given die size/transistor count be reached?‚Äñ About what performance would that result in, relative to what is presently possible?

Note that this is assuming not only current scaling, but also:

* Similar signal velocities. Alternative materials (such as if they could make gallium arsenide work with current scales) and logic families (such as the blazing-fast yet power-hungry emitter-coupled logic, which has similarly disappeared from computing although for a reason I cannot ascertain) may increase that, largely by decreasing gate delays, although fairly little progress can be made in that area unless we develop some wormhole ansible alcubierre shit, as average signal propagation is already at relativistic velocities.
* Current, largely 2-dimensional design. By smooshing a flat die into a 3D shape, the distance signals need to travel within a core *may* be significantly reduced, allowing clocks to go absolutely wild if the thermal problems associated with said frequency increase combined with decreased surface area to volume ratio can be suitably solved or ignored. (Especially in the latter case, you may end up with a processor-cooler setup that more resembles a nuclear thermal rocket than it does any existing setup, LOL.)

But I assume the natural inclination of people here would be to assume those factors, too.

(By the way, the reason why I've been using the term ""processor"" instead of CPU in this question is because I didn't want to limit its scope to just CPUs‚Äîinsight into GPUs or others would be appreciated, though I don't think it likely given the question's existing scale that it will be provided.)

‚Ä†Maybe to be used as ""serial accelerators"" designed to be used in small quantities in Big Iron systems to handle difficult-to-parallelize aspects of programs after serving as general-purpose cores during parallel operation or something. (Seriously, it seems to me that it would be worth it to have the occasional, say, single-core 20 GHz monster in a supercomputer, but it isn't done...)

‚Ä°AFAIK this is the largest reason why modern processor cores are as large and complicated as they are‚Äîyou don't need all those latency-management techniques if you can access all system memory directly in or nearly in a single cycle. Indeed, based on ***very*** limited infomation (I could well be wrong on this; [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/14mw2tb/where_can_i_find_performance_figures_particularly/) a question of mine asking for more info), it may be that performance-per-cycle-*per-transistor* peaked with certain high-performance 1990s RISC processors, as those included some circuitry for modern performance-enhancing instructions and techniques (native floating-point multiplication/division/root instructions, full pipelining, superscalar operations, sometimes out-of-order execution and SIMD, et cetera) yet weren't fast enough to need ballooned caches, et cetera.

‚ÄñThese are related but somewhat different questions, as they depend on how strong the relation between frequency and performance-per-transistor-per-cycle actually is‚Äîif it is strong, peak performance-per-transistor will occur before the ""wall"" mentioned in 3., while if it is *very* weak, it may actually occur somewhat after in the region mentioned in 4..",2023-11-19 22:43:18

**a. Delete the ith element of an array (1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n).**

When I was researching the answer, it said to take the ith element and swap it with the last element, then decrease the size of the array by one. While I understand that method in general, I don't understand why this method wouldn't happen in O(n) time. Aren't arrays fixed size? Wouldn't you have to copy all the elements of the array into another array of n-1 size in order to resize the array? I feel like I'm missing something here.

Edit: Thank you for your responses! I think I get it now(?) All we're doing is swapping the two elements and ignoring the one we ""removed."" That makes sense.

This is because of the error rate, even a very very low error rate of say, 0.08%, if used to compare and identify a user through a major database of facial information, will add up to a significant error.

However, recently, more and more real world application of face recognition to identify people has been popping up everywhere. See china and their payment systems where u just need to scan ur face to pay without even identifying urself first, or even palm or iris, etc. This is just one example, there‚Äôs many many others emerging recently.

So what happened in the recent years, how do they get around this problem?",2023-09-23 00:19:29

16lynpe,Papers relating to online optimization problem," Hello everyone,

  
I'm working on a university paper and could use your expertise. I'm researching an online optimization problem, and I'd love to get your insights.

  
Here's the scenario: We have a group of n individuals who need to travel from point A to point B. Every day, there are a limited number of buses available with a varying number of seats (m\_t) and corresponding seat prices (p\_t). On top of this, there's the option for individuals to stay in a hotel for the night at a cost of c\_t. While we know the total number of individuals (n) upfront, the daily bus seat availability (m\_t), seat prices (p\_t), and hotel costs (c\_t) are only revealed on each respective day.  
My goal is to find the most cost-effective way to transport everyone from A to B. I have some initial ideas on how to approach this, but I've struggled to find relevant literature or research papers on this particular problem. I've tried linking it to existing online optimization problems, but without much success.

  
Does anyone happen to know if this type of problem has a specific name or if it has been researched before? If you could provide me with names of papers or resources related to this problem or something similar, I would be very grateful!

To be clear, I am not looking for help with solving this problem, I am only interested in any related literature I could look into. Thanks in advance for your help!",2023-09-18 15:30:38

16d9gd7,A Seemingly Impossible Cryptographic Magic,"This is the scenario:

1. Server Key (always 40 chars)
2. Player1 Key (usually 20 chars) (selected as the first player in the current game)
3. Player2 Key (usually 20 chars) (selected as the second player in the current game)
4. Player3 Key (usually 20 chars) (selected as the third player in the current game)

After a plain `text-join`, an SHA-512 is returned. The first 13 digits of this SHA-512 are converted to Decimal (from Hex). That Decimal is passed through a function roughly as follows:

    function Transform(hash) {
        let d = parseInt(hash, 16);
        const e = Math.pow(2, 52);
        let r = Math.floor((100 * e - d) / (e - d)) / 100.0
        return r * 0.96
    }    


The return value of **r** is the gambling result. Needless to say, the house always has an advantage and I cannot understand the maths behind it.

Some other considerations:

An SHA-256 hash of the server key is published before a game. After the game, I verified all the hashes and they are all correct including the real result with the output from the `Transform` function. 

Now, my question is without having any control over the 3 players before the round starts, how does the house maintain a consistent advantage? 

P.S.: I have done some digging where I have taken the server key from a high-winning game and then added player keys from low-winning games, and there is no discernible bias towards anything.",2023-09-08 12:37:59

In my research I'm using a simple algorithm (COP) on a set of circuits, which marks the circuit's Inputs with an arbitrary number between 0 and 1 and then propagates them with these rules:

-  And gate: f(x,y) = x*y
- Inverter: f(x) = 1-x

So every gate ends up with a value assigned.

Afterwards I find how many of these values are shared between the two circuits.

The issue is that with doubles I seem to run out of precision pretty fast, so I'm using bignum rationals for arbitrary precision. The only issue with that is it can slow something that takes 6 seconds with doubles, down to taking multiple minutes and it slows down exponentially.

Is there a structure that could help with this? I don't even necessarily need the specific numbers, just so that the same structure in each of the circuits results in a value that can be compared for equality in the other circuits.",2023-08-26 03:15:44

15r0auj,Trying to understand asynchronous I/O,"5000 tabs later, is this model of asynchronous non-blocking I/O correct?

Take the select/poll APIs in Linux.

In normal non-blocking I/O, you would add the necessary file descriptors etc, and then have a blocking call to select/poll with a timeout of infinity or larger than 0. The program would do nothing else on the thread other than poll.

Meanwhile, in asynchronous non-blocking I/O, it would be similar to the Node.JS event loop? Whereby, there is almost like a while true loop, and you poll with a negative timeout so as to be notified of what is ready to process and then not wait at all, then in the rest of the while loop you could process other things not related to I/O, and then in the next iteration of the while loop, poll again, etc

The issue with it is that it is not concurrent I/O, as in, overlapped I/O, how would that be achieved?

NGL I feel like I've gone in circles trying to wrap my head around asynchronous I/O and how it differs. If anybody has any good resources on understand it outside of specific implementations like in Node.JS, I would be very appreciative.",2023-08-14 16:58:45

For example, if I say to you, I can prove to you I have hacked your phone and I won‚Äôt show you my hack or method but rather give you your phone password. Therefore you could infer that I would have hacked your phone and thus proving to you my initial statement without giving the knowledge away. However, what if I had seen you typing your password in your phone or asked someone who knows your password what it is and therefore not gotten it without hacking your phone thus not actually proving my statement and deceiving you.

Of course this is an abstract representation of a ZKP scenario but could the fact that multiple pieces of information lead to the same inference be a way to exploit ZKP‚Äôs?

14atlve,Very obvious way to develop a Desktop/GUI application like a web app?,"Hi all,

I'm a web developer professionally (although still Junior), but I'm interested in Desktop / GUI application development (as a hobby). I've never quite got the hang of traditional GUI programming. And as I understand it, that feeling is shared by quite a lot of people, as we've seen frameworks come out lately such as Electron, Tauri, Neutralino.js, etc.

GUI development for the web has a lot nice features that web developers like me have gotten accustomed to, such as UI frameworks like Svelte or React.

Anyways, I've been thinking about how I could program a desktop application as if it were a web application, so with a frontend UI layer and a backend layer that may be completely seperate, using REST API's to communicate. For example, using a Svelte frontend that uses REST calls to a predefined backend SpringBoot server, which has the ability to access the filesystem and all that stuff.

So, this means that you could hook up any frontend to any backend, and have a working GUI desktop application.

And... this doesn't seem too hard to do? As far as I can tell, you'd need:

* A web server that serves your HTML files
* An application that connects to the web server to render the UI (already exists, see Lorca / Neutralinojs)
* A backend server that parses the requests that the frontend sends, and acts on the OS.
* A way to bundle all of these components into a single executable / installer

This sounds so simple, that I feel like it needs to have a catch (bad performance? High memory footprint?), or someone has already done it.

So am I missing something? Is this a good idea or no? What do you think?",2023-06-16 10:47:58

I believe it could be a unique and engaging experience for computer science enthusiasts, as well as Minecraft redstone builders.

**Game Concept: Logic Gate Maker and Circuit Designer**

In this game, players would have the freedom to design and construct their own circuits using logic gates, wires, and components. The focus is on creativity, exploration, and customization, with the possibility of building complete computers if players have the technical knowledge and dedication.

The game would provide a 3D environment, realistic physics interactions, and high-quality graphics to bring the circuitry and components to life. Comprehensive tutorials and learning resources would be available to help players understand the fundamentals of logic gates, circuit design, and computer architecture. Similar in concept to the Minecraft Redstone builders who made computers in the game, this will give you the freedom to make anything and, design circuits and stuff with logic gates in a 3d world..

I'm particularly interested in hearing your thoughts and feedback on this concept. Would you find this type of game intriguing? Do you think it has potential? Are there any specific features or aspects you would like to see implemented? And, if you're a redstone builder or computer science enthusiast yourself, how would this concept resonate with you?

Any input, suggestions, or questions are greatly appreciated! Let's discuss and explore the possibilities together.

Looking forward to hearing from you all!

I should use an amortized analysis for the union operations n unions. Also tell me why n-1 unions take O(nlogn) in total. Please give the answer and justification as detailed as possible. Here are some hints my professor gave me: To implement the union-find algorithm efficiently, we can explicitly store the nodes in each component and their corresponding leader. This allows us to find the component of a given node x in constant time, as we can simply access the corresponding element in the component array using the leader of x. The time complexity of the union operation can be analyzed using amortized analysis. It has been shown that performing 2n unions takes O(nlogn) time, while an average union takes log(n) time. It's important to understand why n unions take O(nlogn) time and be comfortable with this analysis. In the context of Kruskal's algorithm, the union-find algorithm is used to efficiently determine if adding an edge will create a cycle in the graph. By keeping track of the components using the union-find algorithm, we can determine if two nodes are already in the same component and avoid creating a cycle. This allows us to efficiently find the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

I think that Huawei has lost lots of market share because of that, but if Samsung actually did it with the backing of another huge American company like Microsoft could they essentially cut off Google from it.

11mz9di,Quick question in regards to open data formats,"So from my understanding, open data formats are open for use and can be implemented by anyone, (so free, open, and proprietary)

They usually have specifications maintained by a standards organisation.

They are licensed with open licenses.

Closed data formats are trade secrets (so DOC, XLS, RAR, etc).

Advantages are: anyone can read them, governments often use them in their own open data initiatives, typically there are many freeware options to open, edit and use such data (a prominent example of this is libre office), you can freely change the software to meet your needs or find enterprise editions released by a known distributor (collabora office e.g).

The router gets your ipADDRESS from the ISP, then presumably it would subnet it, and I could go in there and create further subnets and eat more host bits.

Because the router is the first and principle user of that ipADDRESS, through it's client devices...? right?

Also, does the internal-network-interface not have the same ipaddress as the external one on the router?

11m9zfw,Looking for resources on one-way hash functions,"Hi folks,

I'm trying to shore up my own understanding of the underlying mathematics of one-way hash functions. In particular, I feel that my current level of understanding is that the one-way hash function produces a hash of some data in such a way that it's virtually impossible to predict what the original data was, and also that they're uniquely determined (i.e. collision-free, either completely or almost?).

I'm something of a math person (original B.S. is in math, and kept math up as kind of a hobby?) so I would hope to be able to answer the question of how it can be known that the values coming from the hash function are unique and also irreversible.

I understand the best explanation is likely very technical but I hope to at least be able to be convinced in an ""overview"" kind of sense that I understand it better. Are there resources around that cover this topic, but somewhere in between ""vague description"" and ""here are the proofs of all of these theorems etc. etc.""?

Assume NTP max drift is 250ms

    true time = 100ms
    node A local time = 100ms
    node B local time = 0ms


the following transaction will run into conflicted sequence


    transactionA arrive nodeA at (true time 100ms, A time 100ms, B time 0ms)
    transactionA commit by nodeA at (true time 110ms, A time 110ms, B time 10ms)
    nodeB gets transactionA replicated at (true time 111ms, A time 111ms, B time 11ms) BUT with timestamp (110ms)
    transactionB arrive nodeB at (true time 120ms, A time 120ms, B time 20ms)
    transactionB is commit by nodeB at (true time 130ms, A time 130ms, B time 30ms)
    
now there is a conflict in transaction time between transactionA and transactionB 



    transactionA commit time = 110ms (local of A)
    transactionB commit time = 30ms (local of B)


transaction A should be processed before transaction B , but because node B lag node A by 100ms transactionB is now considered to be processed before transactionA



Spanner have atomic clock that guarantees max time drift to be 7ms, and it waits this max uncertainty time of 7ms before commit. But how does that fundamentally solve the issue?

Imagine the following example

    true time = 7ms
    node A local time = 7ms
    node B local time = 0ms



    trxA arrive nodeA at (true time 7ms, A time 7ms, B time 0ms)
    trxA commit by nodeA at (true time 14ms, A time 14ms, B time 7ms)

    trxB arrive nodeB at (true time 9ms, A time 9ms, B time 2ms)
    trxB is commit by nodeB at (true time 16ms, A time 16ms, B time 9ms)


In this example 7ms wait doesn't solve the problem, trxB is still committed at 9ms (local nodeB time) trxA is committed at 14ms (local nodeA time)

The conflict of trxB committed before trxA still exist

1amo3e3,Need help understanding Opcodes,"I'm reading Code By Charles Petzold and I'm now in Chapter 17, I'm highly confused how Opcodes work in a RAM array, The books shows 2 RAMs which are the Data RAM to show the numbers and the Code RAM which stores the Opcode. I understand how addition works in a circuit as it's just multiple logic gates lighting up to produce results in Binary, it's basically just 2 switches which can either be closed or open and then the logic gates doing the work to show if the output has a voltage or not.

Opcodes are a mystery to me as they give out specific instructions, you can Load, add, store, and halt the calculation but how do the machines know to do this? How does a machine know specifically that a byte of memory in a RAM array should be transferred into a specific address, how does it know that it should store the results of the adder into the Data RAM? I suspect it's with logic gates also but the books indicates that you can use one RAM to store the Opcodes and Data which just makes me more confused because even if a 2-to-1 selector is used, how does the machine know how to process that specific instructions? Now the book does state in page 222 that it's not analyzing the machine code, it's just triggering various control signals in a unique way that causes the machine to do this, but I still have a hard time comprehending it as if the instructions and data are just in one RAM then how does it know to differentiate it?

    operations=get_operations(nums,result)
    
    print('original array: ',nums)
    print(""next greater element list:"", result)
    print(""Append and Pop Operations:"", operations)

i also changed the code so that it saves all ""appends"" and ""pops"" of indices of elements (not the elements themeselves) from the list in another list namely operations.

for example to make the ""next greater element"" list from this list: \[2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,5\] to get to ""next greater element"" list that is: \[3, 4, 5, 5, -1\] these are the operations:

first it appends element at first index ('append', 0)

then it pops it ('pop', 0) because next next element is bigger than element in index 0

then append element in next index ('append', 1)

then it pops it ('pop', 1) because next next element is bigger than element in index 1

then append element in next index ('append', 2) but because it's bigger than next element it doesn't get popped yet

then it append next element ('append', 3)

then it pops it ('pop', 3) because next next element is bigger than element in index 3

then it pops it ('pop', 2) because next next element is bigger than element in index 2

then it append next element ('append', 4)

then it pops it ('pop', 4)

so these are the operations: ('append', 0), ('pop', 0), ('append', 1), ('pop', 1), ('append', 2), ('append', 3), ('pop', 3), ('pop', 2), ('append', 4), ('pop', 4)

now there are other permutations of numbers 1 to n that if you want to make a ""next greater element"" list from them, they would have the same operations, although they may have different ""next greater element"" list.

the code i wrote outputs operations of a given list

My Question is:

How to write a program that inputs ""operations"" list and outputs the number of possible permutations that if i give those permutations to this code i wrote, it has exactly same ""operations"" list output

consider that we are given thoses operations, and want to count how many permuations of numbers 1 to n have those operations.

so i mean the input of the problem is the operations i described above (and of course some number n) and the ouput should be the number of permuations of numbers 1 to n that if you give those permutations to the program i wrote to find ""next greater element"" list, it will have the same operations as what the input operations are.

for example for this input: n=5 meaning that numbers are only permutations of numbers 1 to 5 and ('append', 0), ('pop', 0), ('append', 1), ('pop', 1), ('append', 2), ('append', 3), ('pop', 3), ('pop', 2), ('append', 4), ('pop', 4)

the program should output 3 that is the number of permutations of numbers 1 to 5 that if you want to make ""next greater element"" list from them, they would have the same operations as input. and those permutations are: \[1, 2, 4, 3, 5\],\[1, 3, 4, 2, 5\],\[2, 3, 4, 1, 5\]

now how can i do this? i think i should make a dynamic programming array for each index but just don't know how.

In the instructions I was given is also ""Documents standard: XML"". I have to explain the documents defined by Peppol and give some examples.

Basically, the purpose is to give academic opportunities to the user, which are within our area. The user can make an account and log in, and then it takes them to the filter screen, where there are three dropdowns:   
\- type of opportunity (scholarship, internship, research volunteering)  
\- age in high school (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior)  
\- career field (Healthcare, Information tech, engineering, media and design, environment/community, and other)  


So far, we coded an iteration where only one opportunity could be outputted based on certain factors e.g., If the user selects ""Senior"", ""Scholarship"", and ""Healthcare"", they'll receive a local medical scholarship they can apply to.  


We were wondering how to make the computer display multiple outputs based on the same factors (age, type of opportunity, and field) within a conditional. For example, if there were two opportunities which were related to ""Senior"", ""Scholarship"", and ""Healthcare"", how would our code look to display both outputs, not just one?

It's all into one ear, breaks the brain, and out the other ear. Finals are in like a week and this has me pulling out enough hair to make a wig. I need help, desperately. The Prof is teaching C++ if that makes any difference.

This is what i understand (or at least i think i do)To declare a pointer, it's something like int\* Pointer

Putting & in front of a variable gives that variable's address like int &Ad

Pointer = &Ad makes Pointer point to Ad

\*Pointer = Ad makes Pointer point to the actual value at Ad and you can change it as well

Setting a pointer to nullptr makes the pointer null

And that's it besides some basic examples of pointer errors. I got no idea how this, new, delete, ->, linked lists, etc works.

I've been having a back and forth with Chat GPT and I want to make sure i am not going off in a wildly wrong direction. The Call Stack is basically a stack of function calls that is meant to keep track of what functions we are running and what order we will get back to old ones in. If we call another function it goes on the stack. 

However, this is not the same as the runtime stack. This is made up of stack frames that contain local variable data. Everytime we add a variable in a function we move the stack pointer at the end by the amount we need. However, we will also move the stack pointer a lot when we come across a new function that we call to make space for its stack frame. 

These are two separate structures right? 

I see lots of info for the call stack but i don't see much for what chat gpt is calling the runtime stack. In fact, on wiki the call stack is said to have another name ""the run-time"" stack.

I am currently learning about compression of files. Thus far in class, we learned about a series of steps in order to compress a file: apply Burrows Wheeler Transformation, apply move to front transform, and then apply huffman code algorithm.

&#x200B;

For each of these algorithms, I can draw out what they do. However, I have no clue why applying those algorithms in succession yields a better result than just compressing via huffman alone. Can someone give me an intuitive explanation as to why applying those steps in succession will provide a better compression? Better yet, why do we even do the Burrows Wheeler/ Move to Front Transform?

&#x200B;

Note: My current idea is that it probably is because Burrows Wheeler will give us an encoding with more runs of similar characters, so the move to front transform will generate an output that has a lot of small numbers, but I am not even sure about how one would go from a MTF transform to a huffman tree (considering a MTF transform is a set of integers, not a set of characters/frequencies).

17ztf6p,Performance of traversing/operating on a bitmap vs. a plain old array of bytes.,"I've been trying to focus more on data locality and playing nice with the CPU caches. One thing I've been doing is moving ""flag"" members from structs and classes to separate arrays or bitmaps. So, instead of an object holding an ""in use"" int or bool, I'd have an array or bitmap somewhere that stores that value, so that I can iterate over the bitmap/array to decide which objects to operate on instead of iterating over a list/array of objects. The idea here is, of course, to fit more of what I actually want to look at in the cache and make decisions, reducing cache misses, before I start actually operating on objects.

What I expect is that for a large number of ""flags"", traversal of the bitmap should be faster than traversal of an array of bytes, where each byte of the array mimics each bit of the bitmap, either 0 or non-zero. Same concept, just 8 times more data to pull into the cache from RAM in the case of the array of bytes.

What I see, though, is that when reading values, the bitmap traversal is very slightly faster than array traversal, and when setting values, the bitmap takes about twice as long as the array.

When testing, I was using 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 300,000, and 500,000 indices. I tried placing the bitmap and array both in on the stack and on the heap, but the results are always the same, with the bitmap being \~2% faster for reading, \~50% slower for writing. I tried implementing the bitmap as an array of bytes itself, and by just malloc-ing memory for it.

The way I understand it, for smaller sets of values, maybe a couple thousand or less, possibly more than that, traversing the array should be quicker, simply because I'm not having to perform bitwise operations to get the value of bits. But, for larger sets, like that 500,000 large set up there, the bitmap should end up being faster, even with having to do the bitwise operations, because I can fit more in a cache line.

Considering for the bitmap that I would have to first find the ""index"" of the byte, word, dword, whatever, and then perform bitwise operations to read/write to the bits, I also tried reading or writing 8, 16, 32, or 64 values at once. This didn't seem to speed anything up, though.

I have not tried multi-threading my tests.

Is there something I'm missing here? I have a decent-ish 11th gen Intel i7 3.6ghz with 4 cores and 8 hardware threads. Cache lines are 64 bytes. Is it just the case that modern CPUs will be able to handle array traversal well enough that the bitmap traversal won't give any performance benefits except with much bigger sets that I tested with? Am I just wrong altogether and the bitmap is better used as a space saving technique on memory constrained systems?

I understand the meaning of stack and PC in the context of threads. As I can understand they both are specific to each thread. 

While I understand the meaning of stacks and PCs within the context of threads, as they appear to be specific to each individual thread.  I find it challenging to grasp their meanings when applied to processes (especially processes with multiple threads). 

For example, thread is a stream of instructions and PC points to the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched to the processing unit. I maked sense to have PC for each thread. Now  I'm unclear about the meaning of a process's PC when each thread possesses its own PC. 

One explanation I encountered on Stack Overflow suggests that the process PC represents the PC of the currently executing thread at a given moment. However, I'm puzzled about how this works when multiple cores are in play, and multiple threads from the same process are running concurrently.

This is where I'm unsure. To prove my claim, do I show that for all n>0 there exists some c such that this is true. Or is it for all n and for all c? 

Right now, I would solve it by showing (1+log(n))/n >= c\*(1/n) -> 1+ log(n) >=c which is true for all n if c = 1/2. Am I understanding this right?

To my understanding, multiplexing allows multiple signals to travel through a single medium effectively, like how air carries different radio stations to listen to while driving.


But let's say you're a internet provider, and you have an antena providing internet to a residential area. You then use a multiplexer to divide that residential area by sections and everything is good.


Cuestion is, **can you keep adding multiplexers and demultiplexers as you like to keep adding sections? Or does the bandwith of the medium limit the amount of signals you can add?** Maybe the bandwith of the medium affects other features of the signal, like it's latency, quality or time of response?

 \- How many disks can fail on the RAID 5 and 6 solutions? Online articles says 1, but most examples they use lowest amount of disks possible, and therefore say 1 disk for RAID 5, and 2 for RAID 6. However, if you combine a larger amount of disks, can you possibly lose a larger amount of disks?

 \- If you can only lose 1 or 2 disks (RAID 5 and 6 respectively), it doesn't seem like they are trustworthy enough solutions for larger databases. Are there other solutions that are more common? I assume RAID 1 isn't too common, considering it occupies half of the memory.

16fevca,Would it realistically be possible to study Computer Science at University without any prior knowledge? No knowledge of Maths or Coding.,"(Hopefully, this is still understandable to those who don't know the UK qualifications)

I got into a Top 150 university (Top 15 UK) and although very proud, I have come to regret my choice of degree being Communications.

For GCSEs, my 16-year-old undiagnosed ADHD self didn't pay attention in any lessons including my computer science lessons and the only semi-related knowledge I have is from Information Technology where I got an A\*. I didn't study A-level Maths or Computer Science.

I want to change to Computer Science as it's something I actually sort of find interesting and a much better qualification to have. I only chose Communications because I didn't know what to choose and didn't trust myself to pull off any STEM degree, and my selection was limited by poor GCSE grades.

My main worry is that I'll be getting marked against people who already have excellent Computer Science knowledge from their A-level qualifications and maths qualifications especially since I will be studying at a highly-ranked university. Additionally, although potentially an untrue stereotype, I reckon that most Computer Science students will be introverted and will spend more time studying and racking up their prior knowledge in comparison to other degrees which will only make achieving success in this degree harder. Is it realistically worth attempting without any prior coding knowledge or maths knowledge? Feel free to not sugarcoat the answer and be completely honest.

Use CBC to encrypt multiple blocks with successive hashes of the key (i.e. hash(hash(K)) to encrypt the second block) and pad the blocks as appropriate.

I couldn't figure out anything wrong with this algorithm, at least not using what was covered in class, but the professor replied that ""that algorithm would be easy to break using various methods of cryptanalysis that I encourage you to try and research yourself"".

161ftgm,Hardware limitations of handling dynamic sparse tensors: do GPUs suck at handling changes in sparsity?,"I'm a data science student, and I get most of my insights into computer science from ML researchers complaining about hardware / algorithmic limitations of specific operations used in models.

I heard recently that there are fundamental hardware limitations on handling dynamic sparsity in tensors

For background: by sparse tensors I mean switching from a dense data structure where every element of a matrix is involved in mathematical operations, to a sparse format where only non-zero elements are involved. Traditionally these methods require that the quantity and position of non-zero elements remains static. However, there would be huge performance benefits from the ability to dynamically apply the efficiency gains to tensors where the number of non-zero elements is always changing.

My impression from this researcher's comment is that there need to be fundamental improvements in GPUs for this to become viable; however, I can see that there is research into how this can be improved from an algorithmic perspective. For example:

[https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3563338](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3563338)

145d1mw,floating point numbers?? (from a cs beginner),"I feel really stupid asking this but after an hour of scouring Google I still don't understand floating point numbers. My understanding is that there are three sections of the binary code, the first bit is the +/- sign, the second is the exponent that has the base of 2, and the mantissa.

some of my questions are:

1. how can you have a negative power of 2? (for instance, 2\^-1 if the first bit is used to indicate the +/- sign of the original number, not the exponent)
2. how do you get the mantissa? is it basically the binary code of the numbers after the decimal point?

someone said this on the web: 

**Suppose we want to convert 0.375 to its floating-point representation.**

**0.375 = 0.011 = 1.1 \* 2\^(-2)**

how is 0.375 equal to 0.011?? so confused

**exponent = base + original exponent = 1023 + (-2) = 1021 = 01111111101**

When did 1023 become an exponent? or a base?

Correct me if i'm wrong, but my understanding right now is: 2\^exponent is essentially scientific notation, like 10\^exponent in math, but just replaced with 2 as the base, but they have the same function of moving the decimal point. OR my other understanding is that 2\^exponent actually multiplies the other number by 2\^exponent. let me know if what I said makes sense.

Anyway, I would be extremely grateful if someone could help me out on this! I couldn't find any helpful YouTube videos or websites on this and it seems like a basic concept I'm just not grasping :(",2023-06-09 18:35:14
1438byv,MERN or Other Stack for Personal Project?," Hello!

I am a college junior CS major and I'm working on some projects over the summer and am not sure what framework to use. I built a website for a class with the MERN stack minus Mongo DB (so Express, React, and Node) and Prisma DB, so I am pretty comfortable with it. The main project I'm planning on doing is essentially a task management system.

For my personal project, would it be best to use another framework like Ruby on Rails, or should I stick to what I know and use ERN? If I stick to ERN, would it limit my job opportunities to those that use MERN? If another stack would be best, which ones are the most useful/popular that I should consider using?

Note: The main project I'm planning is essentially a task management system. Ideally I would like to build the backend, then a frontend for the website, and leave the possibility of building a separate frontend for mobile that would use the same backend. Is this possible? If so, how difficult is it and which stacks would be best for that?

Thank you in advance!",2023-06-07 09:23:32

I'm about to graduate with my bachelors in Psychology. And after doing a butt load of data heavy research, shadowing and working as preproffesional counsellor at a psychiatric center, I learned a few things about myself

I realize I don't like clinical/direct support work and prefer dealing with data, I like brains but don't like hosptial's or wet labs. I'm pretty good with statistics and I've been learning python and R. So I've set my sights on computer science or data science (I'll likely do a complementary post in the data science sub) to merge my interests in cognition and what I like from my working enviroment. A path I'm thinking about to make this big pivot is to work towards being eligable for a CompSci masters through one of those bridge courses. I would be happy to work for a tech company or something within healthcare after. And if there's that researcher itch I can't scratch off I'll consider a doctorates to work. With the research I've done, computer vision seems fascinating and takes a lot of concepts from the cognitive neuroscience that I'm already familiar with. There's also bioinfomatics that I know is closer to data science but I've heard is still transferable if your compsci and have some domain knowledge which I would say I do.

Say you're interested in finding one and only one specific grouping of pixels that appears either within another image, in a standalone image, or even maybe as an emoji.  How would you do it?  

I assume this type of search doesn't exist, and that you'd need to build something. Search engines in general (I think) are based on finding an entire image that matches a given criteria that is assigned during indexing which sounds like it wouldn't work.

Assume you're only trying to find this group of pixels on the clearnet or surface web.  I found a couple of tools for scanning the internet pretty fast (ZMap, Masscan), but then you'd need to download a massive amount of data.  Exabytes?  Zettabytes? An AWS Ec2 instance maxes out at 25GB according to the ""User guide for Linux instances"".  Comcast advertises fiber at 100GB which is about 1EB / 120 days

You would probably write a pretty smart search algorithm since it doesn't have to be general, you're only looking for one specific grouping of pixels and tagging files where it occurs.  But still, that's a lot of searching to do.  Is that the real problem, or is it bandwidth?

134b3qo,Finding the Largest Base Using Binary Search for Converting a Number with Constraints and a Lower Bound,"Hello fellow computer science enthusiasts!

I'm seeking some guidance on a university assignment that requires the application of a binary search technique. I have already attempted the problem, but my solution is insufficient as it. Here's the problem statement:

Given two inputs, x and y, the objective is to find a number 'b'. The key idea is to convert the number x into base b, and the resulting number must only contain decimal numbers (0-9), without any other symbols (A, B, C, D, E, F, etc or digits > 9). This ensures that, if you didn't know the base of the converted number, it would appear to be in base 10. The number y represents the minimum value that the converted number (interpreted in base 10) can have. The goal is to find the largest number b that brings the converted number as close to y as possible without going below y.

I'm having trouble comparing numbers and determining the correct lower/upper bounds when the number at the midpoint can only be interpreted with symbols (or digits > 9). Any suggestions for further reading or advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated!

Here's my current thought process:

1. Start by initializing the lower and upper bounds for the binary search. The lower bound (l) should be set to 10. The upper bound (u) can be set to x, since the highest possible base for any number x would be base x.
2. Next, perform the binary search. While the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound: a. Calculate the midpoint (mid) as (l + u) // 2. b. Convert x to base 'mid'. c. Check if the converted number meets the constraints (only contains decimal numbers 1-9). d. If it does, compare the converted number (interpreted as base 10) to y. e. If the converted number is greater than or equal to y, update the lower bound (l = mid + 1), and store the current midpoint value as a candidate for the largest base. f. If the converted number is less than y, update the upper bound (u = mid - 1).
3. After the search, the optimal base b should be equal to the largest candidate value that satisfied the constraints and was closest to y without going below it.

I'm unsure about steps 2c and 2d, especially when the midpoint can only be interpreted with symbols (or digits > 9). Any help or suggestions on how to tackle this would be incredibly helpful!

Thank you in advance for your assistance!

12lujuo,Floating Point to Integer conversion,"I have fully understood the conversion of integer to single-precision floating point but having trouble in the backwards conversion (i.e. single-precision floating point to integer conversion). The former was easier since I there were a multitude of resources online. However, searching for the latter conversion has not been fruitful and am stuck.

What I have understood so far:
1. Separation of the sign, exponent and mantissa bits.
2. Convert the exponent to its unbiased equivalent by subtracting the bias (i.e. 127) from the exponent.
3. Concatenate the implicit bit of the mantissa to itself for forming the significand.

I do not know how to proceed after this. There are multiple things to consider.
1) If exponent is zero, the output will be zero (the mantissa is irrelevant since it is dropped. Please correct me if I am wrong about this).
2) If exponent `0xFF`, the output will either be `+ve/-ve infinity` or `NaN` depending on the mantissa.
3) Output for out of range negative input should be `-2^31`. For out of range positive input should be `2^31 - 1`. The minimum and maximum valid inputs are `-2^31` and `2^31 - 1`. I am having difficulty on how to determine whether the input floating point number is out of range.
4) Rounding the result. Actually, I am quite confused on when to perform the rounding operation during the conversion process. I would also need the `GRS` (Guard, Round, Sticky) bit vector to perform `RNE (round to nearest, ties to even)` but do not know how to determine that either.

I thought about graph clustering and partitioning but don't care about how highly connected a particular node is, and from my (elementary) understanding, these methods are not really well-suited for paths.

I thought about doing a variation of iterative deepening search that starts on every node that has 0 incoming edges (and terminates when the last explored node has a small number of outgoing edges with small edge values), but these first edges that the search encounters may have smaller values than edges further down the paths, so if I use a traditional search algorithm, it would have to recursively update the start node for some iterations to reach the goal state, which is a path with all edges having edge values larger than other paths in the graph. As an extension, perhaps node characteristics (such as number of outgoing edges and their edge values) could be used as a heuristic?  Also, the whole graph needs to be explored, and edge values are relative to each other so the comparison between different paths has to be relative.

11uy8zj,"Why are there only 3 main computing platforms (Windows-PC, Mac and Linux-PC?)","In the 80s and 90s, certainly in Europe and to an extent in North America which had their own variants, it wasn't unusual to see folks using Atari STs, Amiga 500s, Acorn Archimedes (running RISC OS), as well as countless other earlier platforms like Sinclair Spectrum, Amstrad - together with 286 and 386 DOS and Windows PCs and the Apple Macintosh.  There seemed to be a huge variety of home computers as well as PCs (not all of which were compatible with each other) and  there was Mac, there was unix and flavours of it.   There was a lot of experimentation and separate platforms.  Even in the portable space you had Psion with their Series 2/3 and Sienna which had their own completely unique operating system tightly bound to the hardware.

These machines were used by individuals but also by businesses, Ataris in music, Amigas in TV production, PCs of various obscure varieties doing complex calculations.  There was even Sun Sparcstations for complex graphical work.

All these systems were _platforms_, with their own dedicated hardware.  Sometimes they'd have common ports - all the above had some variation of a Parallel port for printing, but they were mostly completely separate.  Their cases were designed, their chipsets were designed, everything was owned and released and quite different between each firm.  Amiga's Workbench vs. Atari's licensed version of GEM for example.

They seemed be vertically integrated, customised for their hardware a bit like Apple's approach with the Mac and macOS.

Why has that diversity gone away, and why do we only have Windows PCs for the vast majority of all tasks, along with Macs and Linux - with Mac being the only 'platform' that maintains that tight combination of operating system and hardware design?

Is there not a market for a 'home computer' anymore?  Something that could run console style games, would last a good 5 to 6 years without needing to be upgraded and allow home and small business productivity work?

I can assure you this is not a coding question, it is purely algorithmic, but I will start with describing the code/project that my question stems from.

## Context

I have been working on a Minesweeper bot/solver project for a while, [here's the GitHub if you're curious](https://github.com/GeorgeD88/Minesweeper-Solver). I've gotten to a point where I want my bot to recognize certain patterns of tiles in a grid. After a quick convo with ChatGPT, it seemed apparent that subgraph isomorphism was exactly what I needed. The thing is, subgraph isomorphism is pretty advanced to the point where there aren't easy to understand YouTube videos or articles for it, like there are for topics such as the disjoint-set structure and minimum spanning trees.

I've been only able to find research papers and textbooks discussing it. Now, I was ready to take on this task and start reading away, but I realized I should ask others first about what's the best way to approach this, as that'll ensure I'm doing this efficiently and not making this harder on myself. At the same time, I may be wrong about subgraph isomorphism being what I need, so I would also like suggestions on what is the best algorithm for my needs.

&#x200B;

## Algorithm

Here's exactly what I'm trying to do. I have a grid graph, represented as a 2D array so that you can access it like coordinates, `grid[row][col]`. I have multiple patterns such as, a tile marked 2 directly adjacent to a tile marked 1, but the orientation can be whichever way: 1 below 2, 2 below 1, 2 to the right of 2, etc. I want to be able to scan my grid/board and identify all the places the patterns appear.

**EDIT:** I feel like I may have under explained, so I'm gonna add some things that I mentioned in the comments. I already implemented the regular solving in Minesweeper of counting tiles and revealing/flagging obvious ones. But on most hard boards, you get to a point where you can't use that simple solving anymore and you have to be more clever or guess. This is where this part comes in. Minesweeper players use logically combine overlapping information from surrounding tiles to rule out certain tiles that absolutely have a mine or are absolutely empty, and that extra information they gain allows them to go back and regularly solve more tiles. The minesweeper site has a [whole list of these patterns described in great detail](https://minesweeper.online/help/patterns). What I want to do is be able to scan a group of unsolved tiles and determine any patterns there are that I can act on to reveal more information to hopefully be able to go back to regularly solving.

&#x200B;

## Questions Summarized

Now that you fully understand what I'm trying to achieve, here are the main questions/asks:

\- Please suggest the easiest yet best resources to learn Ullmann's subgraph isomorphism algorithm for a complete beginner to this concept, then suggest the best ""regular level"" resources.

\- Is subgraph isomorphism what I need to achieve what I'm looking for? if so, is Ullmann's the best subgraph isomorphism algorithm for the job? *keep in mind I'm working on a (somewhat large) grid graph, and searching for multiple very small target subgraphs/patterns (up to 5 nodes).*

1ap6qmd,How To Optimize A Branch-And-Bound Optimization With Constraints,"I'm working on a program to find a subset of items that maximizes the total value of those items while meeting several constraints on various properties of those items. I've implemented a recursive branch-and-bound algorithm that works on inputs of small sizes (input array of size ~15, subset of size ~6 or so), but if the input array size is >20 or so then the algorithm never finishes running. The target dataset I have is ~1000 items, so would need to greatly improve the efficiency.

The items have the following properties:

    class Player {
        public:
        std::vector<POSITION> positions;
        POSITION position;
        std::unordered_map<CATEGORY, float> category_zscores;
        std::string name;
        int cost;
        float total_zscore;

        Player(const std::string& name,
                const std::unordered_map<CATEGORY, float>& category_zscores,
                POSITION position, const std::vector<POSITION>& positions, int cost)
            : name(name),
                category_zscores(category_zscores),
                position(position),
                positions(positions),
                cost(cost) {
            total_zscore = getTotalPlayerZScore();
        }
    };

And the branch and bound algorithm is pretty simple implementation:

    void findBestTeam(const std::vector<Player>& players, std::vector<Player>& current_team, std::vector<Player>& best_team, int index) {
        
        // First verify that current_team passes constraints on total cost, team size, minimum positions and minimum zscore sums
        if (!checkConstraints(current_team)) {
            return;
        }

        // If current_team has met all constraints and is full roster size, then check if it's a new best team
        if (current_team.size() == TEAM_SIZE_LIMIT && getTotalTeamZScore(current_team) > getTotalTeamZScore(best_team)) {
            std::vector<Player> temp; 
            for (const auto& player : current_team) {
                temp.push_back(player);
            }
            best_team = temp;
            return;
        }

        // If reached end of players array then return
        if (index == players.size()) {
            return;
        }


        // Recursive call without including the current player
        findBestTeam(players, current_team, best_team, index + 1);

        // Recursive call including the current player
        current_team.push_back(players.at(index));
        findBestTeam(players, current_team, best_team, index + 1);
        current_team.pop_back();
    }

Where checkConstraints() does some pruning as well as enforcing constraints that any full roster must have at least x players at each position, etc. 

How would I go about improving the efficiency of this algorithm? I've thought a bit about dynamic programming in this case, but I'm unsure if there are enough overlapping subproblems given the constraints that must be applied. Will branch-and-bound approach ever work for a problem like this? What class of algorithm could solve this efficiently?

Appreciate any advice, has been years since I've taken algorithm courses and this side project is my first foray into something like this :)",2024-02-12 18:17:59

Say you are a businessman and need to visit a huge number of new clients as quickly as possible. After you meet with a client, you will know when you'll need to meet them again. This time will vary both between different clients and between different visits to the same client. The number of clients that you are able to visit in a period of time will vary and there are going to be stretches of time when you won't be visiting any clients.

You don't want to visit clients that you've already visited way earlier or way later than the time you agreed upon on your latest meeting. At any point of time, how do you go about deciding whether you pick a new client to visit or pick an old client for a re-visit - and which old client if so - in order to minimize the time needed to visit all the clients while respecting the schedule agreed with already visited clients as close as possible?

1afjkng,Need help in understanding the concept of a counter,"So I'm very new to Computer Science as I really want to learn, I'm currently reading Code: The hidden Language by Charles Petzold and I'm stuck at chapter 14 understanding flip flops, in my understanding a flip flop is a circuit where it retains information or provides memory to the circuit without human intervention, as long as it has a voltage then it can retain that information and it can output the information that was kept.

I'm in page 176 and am very confused about the diagram of the frequency dividers being shown in the book, the books indicates that this is for an edge-triggered D-type flip flop and in my understanding, this type of circuit will only show an output when the Clock is transitioning from 0 to 1.

Picture of the Diagram: [Frequency Divider](https://imgur.com/zgBZ2Pp)  
Picture of the circuit of the Edge-triggered D-type Flip Flop: [Edge Triggered Flip Flop](https://imgur.com/3G6Hk3X)

In the Diagram shown above it indicates that the leftmost Clk (Which I assume is an oscillator attached) is connected to the first the first frequency divider and is the Q-bar of that first divider is the input Clk of the second divider. What I'm very much confused here is if the state of the circuit is neutral that means that Q-bar and D are both at 1, since they are both at 1 that also should mean that the other Q-bar outputs of the following dividers and D inputs are at 1 when neutral right? If that is the case then that means that Q2 and Q3 should be lighting up and this is the part where it gets confusing to me, if the circuit is neutral and the leftmost Clk has no input to it, that means that the 2 dividers from the right will lit the lightbulb up showing an output immediately even though the initial Clk is at 0.

In the picture of the circuit above it shows it's neutral state and I'm really just confused with what's the book explaining and showing. The book also does show the result of the diagram of the Divider above and this is what it looks like: [https://imgur.com/YKhRBMT](https://imgur.com/ykhrbmt)

In the results shown it does match out with my understanding that the Clk will only produce an output when it transitions from 0 to 1, what I'm also confused is why is Clk-bar shown instead of just the Clk? I assume that Clk-bar is also connected to a light bulb to show the counting of the binary numbers but I'm not entirely sure how this all relates to frequency.

Basically my questions are why are the results of the diagram above looks like this [https://imgur.com/YKhRBMT](https://imgur.com/ykhrbmt) when the circuit in their neutral states will light up the bulbs in Q2 and Q3. I know my understanding of this is wrong and just need clarification about the whole thing. Thanks for the help guys.

As the size of the page is increased, each individual page will contain locations further and further from any particular recent reference and therefore the principle of locality will be weakened which will make page fault rate rise.

but I cannot understand the reason why increasing the page size weakening the locality

larger page size means the range of data which will be contained by a page also will be enlarged.

Isn't then the page fault rate should be decreased

So I'm just trying to understand the proof behind 2\^n >= n\^4. My professor went from that to 2\^(n-4log\_2(n)) \* (2\^log\_2(n))\^4 >= n\^4

From what I understand, the following is happening: n^(4) / n^(4) is being multiplied to the left side to manipulate it like so

2\^n \* (n^(4) / n^(4)) >= n\^4

To get it into logarithmic form and respecting the basic rule that n = 2^(log\_2 n) , the fraction is transformed

2\^n \* (2\^log\_2 (n\^4) / 2\^log\_2 (n\^4)) >= n\^4

By rules of exponents, a division calls for exponential subtraction like so

2\^n-log\_2 (n\^4) \* 2\^log\_2 (n\^4) >= n\^4

When dealing with exponents in logarithms, the exponent is moved to the front, leading to this form

2\^n-4log\_2 (n) \* (2\^log\_2 (n))^(4) \>= n\^4

If yes, why do I need that a loader does this? **Isn't it sufficient** a **relative** address (generated by compiler) and then **MMU hw unit** just adds the program base offset in real memory to reach the **physical address**? Why a virtual address is needed and a relative insufficient?

I can imagine this with relative (generated by compiler) addresses, but I can't imagine with virtual/logical (generated by loader) addresses...

19eigvf,Confusion about Two-level Page Table with TLB,"Text:Consider a virtual memory system with paging, in which the Bytes are addressed. The system has a TLB (Translation Look-aside Buffer), on which a ‚Äùhit ratio‚Äù of 99% is experimentally measured. The page table (‚Äùpage-table‚Äù) is created with a two-level scheme, in which a 32-bit logical address is divided (from MSB to LSB) into 3 parts: p1, p2, d, respectively of 10-bit, 11-bit, and 11-bit. No additional data structures (such as hash tables or inverted page tables) are used to speed up access. Illustrate the layout of the page table and its overall size for a P1 process having a virtual address space of 100MB

Answer:The percentage of times a particular page number is found in the TLB is called the hit ratio. **Note that 100 MByte<128 MByte = 2\^27 Byte** and that pages and frames have a size of 2Kbyte = 2\^11 Byte (obtained from d: 11 bit). Assuming that each entry in the page tables uses 32 bits (4 Byte), a second-level page table will have 2\^11 cells (11 from p2) and size 2\^11 \* 4 Byte, **while a first level page table will have 25 cells (only 5 bits out of 10 of p1) and size of 2\^5 \*4 Byte are needed.**

I don't get the bold statements.

1. What is that 128MB? Where does it come from? Why is it important?
2. Why the first level page table will have 2\^5 table? Why only 5 bits are needed?

19efyq2,Book recommendations for non-IT manager working in IT company,"Hi everyone! 

As the title suggests, I have recently started working in a managerial business position in an IT company that develops digital services and features for a famous automotive brand. However, my background is not in IT nor my past experiences have been.

 Therefore, I feel like I lack knowledge to understand basic office chatters and to fully comprehend multi-lateral sessions as well. I have asked colleagues to show me how products are built and I have done research to try to educate myself. However, I would like to ask you if there are any books you recommend for people in my context.

Additionally, if you have any general tips I would be happy to take them. It's worth mentioning that my role does not involve the direct management of software developers or engineers; rather, it centres around internal practices and profitability.

Thank you!",2024-01-24 12:27:56

Myself and this professor are working alongside games industry veterans to organize this contest, with the grand prize being charitable donations to the schools of the winners.

  
I want to know, how are extracurricular programs of this nature usually brought to the attention of schools? (I.E. The Future Cities Program) Are there any resources for getting in contact with CS teachers en masse?

1990x9x,Equivalence classes of reducibility congruence relation over the semi-decidable subsets of the natural numbers.,"We're given the following reducibility relation over the subsets of the natural numbers:

A < B if and only if there exists a total computable function f(n) such that (any natural number n is in A if and only if f(n) is in B).

We can now define the following congruence relation (which is also a relation of equivalence):

A = B if and only if (A < B and B < A, where < is the reducibility relation given above).

If you restrict the congruence relation over the set of decidable subsets of the natural numbers, you can pretty easily find it has exactly three equivalence classes: 1) just the empty set, 2) just the set of the natural numbers, 3) all other decidable subsets of the natural numbers.

If you restrict the congruence relation over the set of semi-decidable subsets of the natural numbers, however, things get quite a bit more difficult. Without a total computable decider I don't know how to decide whether two semi-decidable sets are in the reducibility relation with each other.

The questions I have are 2:

Are all semi-decidable, but not decidable, subsets of the natural numbers in the same equivalence class?

Is the number of equivalence classes finite? If yes, which are they, if not, how can the set of equivalence classes be enumerated?",2024-01-17 16:39:12
198cttd,Accident reports to unified taxonomy: A multi-class-classification problem,"Hello!

I'm here to brainstorm possible solutions for my prompt engineering problem. I plan on using an LLM to label / classify accidents according to a predefined taxonomy, maybe someone can help ;)

**Core Data**

I have \~4500 accident reports from paragliding incidents. Reports are unstructured text, some very elaborate over different aspects of the incident over multiple pages, some are just a few lines.

**My idea**

Extract semantically relevant information from the accidents into one unified taxonomy for further analyses of accident causes, etc.

**My approach**

I want to use topic modeling to create a unified taxonomy for all accidents, in which virtually all relevant information of each accident can be captured. The Taxonomy + one accident will then be formed into one API call. After \~4500 API calls, I should end up with all of my accidents represented by a unified taxonomy.

**Example**

The taxonomy has different categories like weather, pilot experience, conditions of the surface, etc. These main categories are further subdivided, e.g., Weather -> Wind -> Velocity.

**Current State**

Right now, I am not finished with my taxonomy, but I estimate that it will roughly have 150 parameters to look out for in one accident. I worked on a similar problem a year ago, building a voice assistant with GPT. There, I used Davinci to transform spoken input into a JSON format with predefined JSON actions. This worked decently for most scenarios, but I had to do post-processing of my output because formats weren't always right, etc.

Currently, my concerns and questions are:

* With many more categories now (150) compared to my voice assistant (14) and a bigger text input (the voice assistant got one sentence, now a whole accident report is up to 8 pages), GPT uses different categories than those defined in the taxonomy, or hallucinates unpredictable.

* How to effectively get structured output (here in the form of a taxonomy) from GPT?

* Would my solution even work as intended?

* Is this a smart way to approach my goal?

* What are alternatives?

For any input and thoughts, I am very grateful. Thanks in advance!",2024-01-16 20:22:24

It is also using triangulation and I believe is a 2 approximation solution if that might be at all helpful.)

Obviously, I'm not forgetting the existence of GNU/Linux, but the solution of ""Just use Linux"" isn't quite satisfactory. In the same manner, stuff like Windows Server Core isn't the same as it's just a GUI command prompt window with the inability to open applications outside of itself.

I'm quite partial to DOS because I've spent the vast majority of my life using Windows and DOS. I prefer the sort of paradigm they go for over that of Linux based systems. I like the extra freedom you generally have in where things are installed to and how they're laid out, as well as just overall preferring that sort of style in a personal computing sense.

Linux systems are great for servers, but it's much less necessary to have something with the robust multi user model and permissions of Linux in a system only one or a few people will use. DOS basically just lets you do whatever you want with it, and that level of user control is very appealing. 

A lot of times, I see people move over to Linux based systems not because they like it, but because it's the next best option over the bloated and ever-increasingly unusable Windows. While I don't entirely agree with all the premises put forth in it, [this article](https://mikegerwitz.com/2016/04/gnu-kwindows) made me wonder why we don't see things that just build upon the underlying Windows kernel. It's common for people to move onto Linux just to have to fight their programs and games to make them function on the platform.

Personally, I'd really like a system where I basically have a Windows cmd shell with some basic task switching to enable multitasking. It'd be great to be similar to DOS in having an autoexec.bat and config.sys to take full control over what you load and don't load. A large benefit of this is the ability to natively run Windows applications without needing the full extent of Windows.

Of course, the people who would enjoy this sort of thing are a minority in computing, but I always wonder why I see absolutely nothing about it. It would make sense that Microsoft may make this kind of thing impossible due to trying to protect their kernel, but things like Wine on Linux exist so I'd imagine it to be theoretically possible. I wouldn't be surprised if someone tried to do something like this before, but most things in the nature of similar stuff like FreeDOS are only focused on legacy programs rather than adapting the experience to modern systems.",2023-11-30 09:24:30

185oaon,Optimizing a print path (Travelling Salesman Problem),"Hi there, I work as a developer in a biotechnology startup. We're building a 3D printer and I'm writing software that takes 3D models, slices them and generates a print path for each of the slices. We've got the base functionality of that working alright, but I've been wanting to optimize the print path that gets generated from the slices. I'm not really from a computer science background so I'm struggling a bit.

As far as I understand, this seems to be related to TSP, and after doing some googling I figured that some sort of genetic/evolutionary algo would be a good fit here. I implemented it and I can see that it produces solutions that  not only aren't more optimal than just ordering the print lines by their X coordinate, it increases total print times by nearly double.

My question would be, how would I go about improving my solution (or maybe there is a better approach for this exact problem)? What kind of heuristics should I be looking into, given that:

* Our slicing algorithm produces a list of lines (that are within 2D space, each point of the line having both an X and Y coord.) that are ordered by X ascending.
* The amount of lines produced by this is non-deterministic, depends on the parameters of the slicing and could easily be within thousands.
* Each line needs to be traversed only once.
* We're looking for the most optimal solution that could be calculated within a sane amount of time (half an hour would be ok)

I'm writing this in C#, so any resources, samples or discussions about this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",2023-11-28 05:11:56

17zdg74,How JVM process works under linux operating system?,"I have been reading the book ""Understanding the Linux Kernel"" to learn about how multithreading works under the hood. They talk about processes, lightweight processes, and user threads when it comes to concurrency. Now I have a few questions while mapping them to JVM. (I asked this in r/javahelp  but seems like they are not interested in it)  
  
In Linux, when a program needs to have multiple threads of execution within the running program, each thread of execution is implemented as a lightweight process sharing the same address space. Such lightweight processes that share the same address space are recognized as a thread group. In the Java context, can we map thread-group -> JVM, lightweight processes -> Java threads (not virtual), and address space as the place where heap is implemented?  
  
In Linux, a process can have multiple user-level threads running within it. But unlike lightweight processes, the OS kernel cannot actually see or schedule those threads. They share the CPU time of the underlying process (or the group of lightweight processes) and are handled by a scheduler lurking inside the process itself. Again, in a Java context, can we safely assume those user-level threads as virtual threads or green threads?

Say I have a server thread handling a request. It creates a CompletableFuture to perform the work asynchronously (including sending the response), and then detaches itself from the request to handle the next one.

17qz1bl,Clustering Algorithm To Identify Similar JSON-Formatted Logs,"Hello everyone,  
  
I am working on a project where I need to define parsers for a set of various JSON-formatted logs. I am in a discovery phase where I am first looking to determine the broad 'buckets' of logs in the dataset. One approach I've taken is to classify the logs into 'buckets' based on whether or not the JSON objects have identical sets of keys. Specifically, I enumerate all paths in the JSON object, deduplicate the list, then sort alphabetically - I refer to the resulting list as a 'fingerprint' of the log. I wrote some python to run that against a sample of 4.5m logs and got 319 unique fingerprints - way more than I expected. What I've found is that many of the unique fingerprints are supersets of others - for instance I might have \[AB\] \[ABC\] \[ABCD\] and \[ABCD\].  
  
In most cases, I don't care about the extra keys for the purpose of writing my parsers. What I'm looking to accomplish is to cluster fingerprints together such that, for each cluster, I can identify the set of keys for which all other fingerprints in the cluster are a superset. In the example above, that would be \[AB\]. My dataset also includes clusters which aren't reachable from others, e.g. \[XY\] is a distinct cluster from \[AB\]  
I'm using python, and I have a partial solution using networkx, but the solution is a bit messy. I envision a set of trees such that each node is a fingerprint, and its children are supersets of the parent. To accomplish that I'm populating a digraph with each fingerprint as a node, iterating through all pairs of nodes (a,b) to add edge (a > b) where b is a superset of a. I've then tried various methods to remove cycles (e.g. using the networkx Edmonds algorithm and using the nx.simple\_cycles attribute). Finally, I grab a list of all nodes without a parent and spit them out as my candidate fingerprints.  
  
Unfortunately I end up with a number of fingerprints which aren't strictly supersets of any others, but differ from others by only a few keys. In these cases, I suspect a simple set intersection would give me the subset of keys I am looking for. However, when I eyeball it there are still a rough handful of different 'buckets' represented, so taking the intersection of all the remainders would yield an empty set.  
I'm self taught and have some gaps in my knowledge so I think I'm at the edge of what I can figure out without getting wrapped around the axle. Is there a better way for me to approach this problem? Am I close?  
  
Thanks in advance!

17qn3cd,Two party communication problem with DES,"Assume there are two participants in a communication Alice and Bob. They have a coin and flip it. They play a game where the point is given to Alice if both Alice and Bob land the same thing, and Bob gets a point when they land different things. However they play in a strange strategy:

1. Alice flips a coin. Now she has either head or tail which equals x. She encrypts x with random key k she chose, so we get y = DES(k, x)
2. Alice sends y to Bob
3. Bob flips a coin (generates his own x) and sends the result to Alice
4. Alice sends key k to Bob (!)
5. Bob gets x = DES(k, y) and matches is with his x.
6. If Alice's x equals Bob's x, Alice gets a point. Otherwise Bob gets a point

Now the question is - can Alice cheat and modify the key in step 4 so she can always win?

My feeling is that she can always calculate the key k so it always decrypts into Bob's x after he reveals it to her. This could be due to them working with only two values of x={head, tail}. However I do not know how to mathematically describe this.

I am trying to figure out a way to search for dictionary terms (like the Oxford dictionary words). Imagine you are on a dictionary website searching for English words (although I will be applying this to a variety of non-Indo-European languages), and you don't know how to spell it exactly. It should have autocomplete and do fuzzy spell checking as best it can, somehow. That is, **how do you search for a specific keyword**, given you might misspell it in a variety of ways.

The [SimSpell](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell) algorithm uses deletions to determine edit distance of the input query word compared to a dictionary of correctly spelled words. The Double [Metaphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone) algorithm (or other phonetic algorithms) convert the words to phonetic versions (phonetic ""hashes"" basically), and you then search based on the input phonetic hash matching the dictionary of phonetic hashes.

Is there a way to combine these two approaches? Or is there a better way to improve on finding dictionary terms altogether?

I am imagine combining these by doing something like this:

1. First check if the input word exists in the dictionary, and return that if so. We are done.
2. Otherwise the word can be misspelled (edit distance vs. phonetically spelled incorrectly, like ""queen vs. kween (phonetic) vs. quen (edit distance)""). See [this issue](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell/issues/25) for how SimSpell returns incorrect results for ""kween"".
3. So try both phonetic query and SimSpell query, and get list of candidates.
4. Filter out unique candidates, and sort by word frequency (if you have that info).
5. Return top n results. Maybe group them to tell the user ""these are spelling variants"" and ""these are phonetic variants"". Not sure on the UX there yet.

Does that sound good, or is there a better way? Perhaps, how do other production systems solve this (maybe separate AI solutions from non-AI solutions, as I don't have the scale like Google to probably do an AI solution).",2023-11-06 05:41:03

Specifically regarding infixes, they start by saying:

> The most difficult in the spellchecking, is the representation of internal word changes with affixes, for example the verb ŸÖ#$ ŸÇÿßŸÖ => ŸÇÿßŸÖÿ™ÿå => ŸÇŸÖÿ™
> - Qam=>qamt ( add suffix ‚Äòt‚Äô)
> - Qam =>qmt (add suffix ‚Äòt‚Äô and strip the ‚Äòa‚Äô).
> - Qam=>yqom ( add prefix ‚Äòy‚Äô and swap ‚Äòa‚Äô into ‚Äòo‚Äô)
>
> To represent this case we must add different stems to dictionary which increase its size and make affix rules more complex. 

So that got me wondering, **what _can't_ hunspell do?** (And other similar/derived tools like ASpell). Not in terms of necessarily the spellchecking/morphology analyzing _algorithm_, but even just in terms of the data model, what doesn't it capture, what can't it capture? Could you provide an example or two of things that it can't support. Hoping to collect the things it can't do to gain a better perspective on next steps.",2023-11-04 15:16:49

17masrk,Example demonstrating how the SymSpell Symmetric Delete Spelling Correction functionality works?,"I read through [this great article](https://wolfgarbe.medium.com/1000x-faster-spelling-correction-algorithm-2012-8701fcd87a5f) on SymSpell, but still didn't see a clear example of how the deletion functionality works. So I asked ChatGPT and it said:

> Symmetric Delete spelling correction is a key feature of the SymSpell algorithm. It's a technique used to efficiently find corrections for misspelled words by considering all possible deletions of characters from the misspelled word and searching for those deletions in a dictionary. Here's how Symmetric Delete Spelling Correction works:
> 
> 1. **Preprocessing:**
>    - Create a dictionary of valid words. This dictionary contains a comprehensive list of correctly spelled words, and it can be based on a large corpus or a predefined word list.
> 
> 2. **Symmetric Delete Data Structure:**
>    - For each word in the dictionary, generate all possible combinations of deletions of characters. These deletions can be of any length (from 1 character to the length of the word).
>    - For each deletion, calculate its hash code or some unique identifier.
> 
> 3. **Hash Table or Trie:**
>    - Store these hash codes or identifiers in a hash table or a trie data structure. This data structure allows for efficient lookups based on the hash codes.
> 
> 4. **Spell Correction:**
>    - When you encounter a misspelled word, generate all possible deletions for that word. For example, for the word ""helo,"" possible deletions could be ""elo,"" ""hlo,"" ""heo,"" and ""hel.""
>    - Calculate the hash codes or identifiers for each of these possible deletions.
> 
> 5. **Lookup in Symmetric Delete Data Structure:**
>    - Search the hash table or trie for each of the calculated hash codes from step 4.
>    - If a hash code is found in the data structure, retrieve the words associated with that code. These words are the valid words that can be created by deleting characters from the misspelled word.
>
> ...

I still am not grasping it fully. I am also looking at [this JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/dongyuwei/SymSpell) to start. Here is my understanding so far:

1. You have a dictionary of words spelled properly (word list).
2. You individually delete all possible characters (until you get down to 0 characters?). Or do you delete only max 2 characters in all combinations? This is different from what ChatGPT is saying, but I think it's wrong.
3. You store these deletions alongside your dictionary word list, and link back to the dictionary word.
4. Then I don't see clearly what's next...

So how do you test that a word is misspelled? You just take the input/query word, and test it against your hash table, and wallah you are done? Or do you need to delete up to 2 possible characters from that for some reason, and compare it to your hash table?

So how do I spell check the word in the end now, given I have precomputed all my possible deletions up to 2 missing characters per word (if that's how it works)?",2023-11-02 18:56:19

I am currently in the class RTV3405 Media and Society, and I am looking for someone specific as part of my final capstone project. According to the rubric, which I will link a screenshot of, I must identify one **professional who is currently working in the communications field that best reflects my academic major or interest, which is computer science.** This individual SHOULD NOT be a student, a UF professor, or a UF professional. 

I must reach out to this professional by email, telephone, or Zoom to gather information about the following:  
1. **Their career path**. That is, an overview of education, professional experience, and upward mobility that landed them where they are today. Please ask for a photo of the Professional in their current work environment and a photo of their professional business card or LinkedIn Profile. These items will be incorporated into the text of your paper as APA Figures. **(I will make this part optional)**  
2. Using your Course Text AND out-of-class resources, identify ONE current issue or topic affecting the Professional's field today, other than COVID. **Develop 5 pertinent questions to ask this Professional for their platform on this current issue or topic.** The questions and the information you gathered will be incorporated into your paper presentation, either in the narrative portion of your paper OR as an APA Style Appendix.  
  
The topic I decided to choose is **artificial intelligence**.   
**My five questions are:**  
***1) Do you have any personal background knowledge or hands on experience with AI?***  
***2) Do you think AI is a positive or negative influence today? Why?***  
***3) Do you think society is ready to be as exposed to AI as they are today?***  
***4) How do you see AI affect you in your daily life?***  
***5) What change would you make, if any, to the direction and pace in which AI is headed? Do you think we should stop trying to develop AI, or encourage its development?***  
  
For the purposes of this project I understand that many people would not be comfortable sharing any personal information, so **I wont be asking for any pictures if you don't want to share those**. I will just omit that part of my paper. I will, however, **need proof of credentials, such as a LinkedIn page, personal website, etc.** I am not soliciting any personal information besides what is asked of me in the rubric. This project is due Dec. 3, so timeliness is important to me.   
I am coming to Reddit to ask this because I don't know where else to go; I've already searched LinkedIn for a professional that meets the criteria for this project, and the one person I could get to respond to me stopped communicating because he did not think the portion that asks about the professional's upbringing and photo was pertinent to the five questions, which is why I am only making that part optional. I understand that this is kind of hard to do because it requires talking to a stranger online, but I'm hoping I can find a computer science communications professional who will answer my five questions. If this is not the best place to ask for help, anyone who could point me to a better place would also be helpful to me.  
I would be so appreciative of anyone who fits the criteria that is willing to participate. The entire first part of my paper will be a biographical about you and your contact info will be referenced, so all of your contributions will receive credit. I will also show you the finished product if you'd like once I finish the paper.

17cwjiy,"Difference between ""memory location,"" ""memory address,"" ""pointer,"" and ""contents""?","In an assignment, there was a table:

One of the questions stated the following, ""A **memory location** can store an **address**. We call that memory location's contents a ""**pointer**"" since it's an address that ""points"" to another memory location."" **\*\*\*SEE CORRESPONDING TABLE BELOW THAT I WILL REFERENCE\*\*\***

&#x200B;

|ADDRESS (hex)|CONTENTS (binary)|
|:-|:-|
|0x0321|0001 1111 0000 0101|
|0x0320|0001 1111 0100 0110|
|0x031F|0110 1010 1100 0100|
|0x031E|0110 1000 1101 0101|
|...|...|

I am a computer science student who understands the core concepts involved in programming, such as that a reference variable is a variable that stores a pointer, or address, to an object in memory of which we, analogously, may observe the ""contents"" of. Yet, amazingly, having contained my mind to the table above that they provided, reading that statement confused me. What am I confused about? Well, to start:

1. It states, ""A memory location can STORE an address"" . . . hold up a sec, isn't ""memory location"" and ""address"" the same thing? What apparently is the difference? And when I Google the difference, why do images show them as the same thing: the code in the left column in the table above (e.g., an image on Google may a similar table above showing ""0x0321"" as a ""location,"" another may show it an ""address,"" making the two seem synonymous)? If the images are not accurate, and there indeed is a difference, then what is ""memory location"" since they say this thing apparently ""contains"" the ""address,"" so if I look at 0x0321 as a concrete example above, what is this ""memory location"" thing that's containing it? Or is the 0x0321 the ""memory location""? Or is the ""memory location"" a ROW containing the ""address"" and ""contents""? I hope this series of questions illustrates my confusion
2. ""Pointer""...okay, is this the same thing as ""address"" (again, my whole discussion here is with respect to the table above since it's important for me to be concrete here so that I understand well whatever explanation is resorted to me)? My CS knowledge tells me YES, but they are saying that the ""pointer"" is ""an address that 'points' to ANOTHER memory location""... what??? I thought a ""pointer"" is an address (e.g., 0x0321) that 'points' to the contents (e.g., 0001 1111 0000 0101). Is that NOT the case??? When I read, ""pointer is an address that 'points' to ANOTHER memory location,"" that statement mentally sounds like this to me when looking at the table: ""0x0321, a pointer/address, 'points' to another pointer/address, such as 0x031E, rather than a content, 0001 1111 0000 0101.""

Such confusion does become problematic, especially if I read questions such as, ""What are the contents of the **memory location** that the **pointer** above is pointing to?""

And no, I do not want to resolve to AI to explain this to me (if I try, it will definitely end up applauding it for confusing me further ;). If I can get anyone's insights into explaining the difference CLEARLY and CONCRETELY in detail (with respect to the table above) in ""memory location,"" ""memory address,"" ""pointer,"" and ""contents,"" I would be very grateful. (P.S., I know, even I'm laughing at myself for getting confused at what otherwise seems extremely trivial concepts, but ah well, life shows confusion and complexity in small things sometimes). Thanks!!

2 -> 0 Weight = -0.537  
  
2 -> 1 Weight = -0.047  
  
I am confused about how the first iteration works. If we consider the source node as node 0, then during the first iteration, dist\[0\] = 0, dist\[1\] = 0.429, dist\[2\] = 0.543.  
  
Now here is where I get confused, as the algorithm checks the edge 1 -> 0, the distance of 1 is now knowm, as it has just been updated. Does the algorithm now have to update the distance to 1 again? (this is still during the first iteration).  
  
Also, doesn't this imply that the order of adding edges to the graph actually matters from a coding standpoint? Because if I added the 'outgoing' edges from the source node last, then the distance to each node from the source would be unknown up until that point.

With writes it seems simple enough. Send the value you need written to the message queue for the owner Actor and move on; no blocking required. With a read though, the querying actor needs to wait for a response, thus having to park until it receives the response.

I understand the graph theory that lets us show the greedy choice property is true (that the minimum weight edge crossing any cut of G is in some MST of G). So in Prim‚Äôs, when we have some cut (S, V(G)-S) we can choose the lowest weight crossing edge. But this only guarantees that it is in SOME MST. How do we guarantee that the sequence of choices we made, let‚Äôs say e_1, e_2, ‚Ä¶, e_k (all least weight crossing edges during running of the algorithm), are all part of the SAME MST, namely the one we are creating?

Do we even have to show that? Once you create a spanning tree/when the algorithm terminates, you know that every edge in your spanning tree belongs to some MST, does that somehow imply that the edges taken together as a spanning tree is minimum?

So is greedy choice property + optimal substructure enough to prove correctness? Or do we need that invariant I mentioned above? 



I know you can prove an invariant in Prim‚Äôs Algorithm: what you are doing in each iteration is actually building MSTs that spans S? And this combines with optimal substructure.

Algorithmic trading is the use of computers to execute trades according to a set of pre-defined rules. It can be used to automate a variety of trading strategies, such as trend following, mean reversion, and arbitrage.  
There are a number of potential benefits to algorithmic trading. It can help traders to remove emotions from their decision-making process, and it can also help them to backtest and optimize their strategies more effectively. Additionally, algorithmic trading can be used to execute trades more quickly and efficiently than manual trading.  
However, there are also some risks associated with algorithmic trading. For example, if a trading algorithm is not properly designed or tested, it can lead to significant losses. Additionally, algorithmic trading can be complex and time-consuming to set up and maintain.  
Despite the risks, algorithmic trading is becoming increasingly popular among traders of all levels of experience. There are a number of different algorithmic trading platforms available, but many of them are expensive and difficult to use.  
I'm interested in developing a new algorithmic trading platform that is both affordable and easy to use. I'm also interested in making the platform accessible to a wider range of traders, regardless of their skill level.  
Questions:

**Claim:** (L^(+)\*) = (L^(\*)\+)Basically for any regular language L, the Kleene Closure (Star Closure) of the Positive Closure is equal to the Positive Closure of the Kleene Closure.

I do get that the claim is true, and I can prove it by showing that one side is the subset of the other and vice versa (holds both ways). I considered taking any arbitrary string 's' in either of the sides, then breaking it down into substrings, as 's' would be made from substrings from the former language, and that each substring would exist on the other side, and taking the + or \* would take all possible concatenations of the substrings. Hence one would be a subset of the other and vice versa.

I am confused as to how I can prove this formally, as my assignment won't be graded unless I have given formal proof.

16jsk1x,Intersecting regular expressions - stuck.,"Hello all, I have a question that needs solving, and I \_think\_ I know how to solve it. However, my solution goes on for pages and the weightage for the question is really low, so there must be some ""easy"" way I'm missing. Here's the question:  
For the languages defined by the regular expressions (10 U 0) ‚àó (Œµ ‚à™ 1) and (0 ‚à™ 1) ‚àó0, construct a regular expression for the intersection of the languages.  
Here's how I approached the solution:  
1. Convert the given regular expressions to their equivalent NFAs (since I did not find a way to do intersections directly).  
2. For the newly created two NFAs find their intersection:  
3. Intersection Q will be cross product of both states set.  
4. Alphabet remains the same, i.e. {0, 1}  
5. Start state is the tuple of start states of the both machines, if q01 and q02 are start states, the start state will be (q01, q02).  
6. Final states will be F1 X F2.  
7. Transition functions need to take into account the epsilon transitions. For every transition function:  
del1(q1, alphabet) = q1' and del2(q2, alphabet) = q2', the transition function for the final machine becomes:  
del((q1, q2), alphabet) = ( del1(q1, alphabet) U q1, del2(q2, alphabet) U q2) if there is an epsilon transition on the state, otherwise we remove the union terms in the above formula and everything else remains the same.  
I tried to solve the question with this approach - the NFAs have 8 and 11 states respectively, and their cross product is too much to handle on paper. Is there a better way to do this?",2023-09-15 23:38:24

I have a project to develop techniques and build tools that address the issue of property validation in legacy systems using dynamic runtime verification.  
  
The project aims to use formal verification techniques in operating systems to ensure correctness and security. Most existing systems are too complex for traditional formal verification, so the focus is on practical methods, such as runtime verification. They plan to leverage eBPF, a Linux subsystem, to build tools that guarantee specific properties in the kernel with minimal overhead. The initial focus will be on simple data structures like linked lists in user-space applications, with the possibility of extending to more complex structures like hash tables and radix trees if time allows.

16djqyy,How to implement Sinusoidal Positional Embedding?,"Hi fellow computer scientists,  
so I've been researching a little about transformers and meanwhile I had to understand sinusoidal positional embedding. I have found two implementations for this:

&#x200B;

1)

    class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.dim = dim

    def forward(self, noise_level):
        count = self.dim // 2
        step = torch.arange(count, dtype=noise_level.dtype,
                            device=noise_level.device) / count
        encoding = noise_level.unsqueeze(
            1) * torch.exp(-math.log(1e4) * step.unsqueeze(0))
        encoding = torch.cat(
            [torch.sin(encoding), torch.cos(encoding)], dim=-1)
        return encoding

&#x200B;

  
2)

    class TransformerPositionalEmbedding(nn.Module):
    """"""
    From paper ""Attention Is All You Need"", section 3.5
    """"""
    def __init__(self, dimension, max_timesteps=1000):
        super(TransformerPositionalEmbedding, self).__init__()
        assert dimension % 2 == 0, ""Embedding dimension must be even""
        self.dimension = dimension
        self.pe_matrix = torch.zeros(max_timesteps, dimension)
        even_indices = torch.arange(0, self.dimension, 2)
        log_term = torch.log(torch.tensor(10000.0)) / self.dimension
        div_term = torch.exp(even_indices * -log_term)

        timesteps = torch.arange(max_timesteps).unsqueeze(1)
        self.pe_matrix[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(timesteps * div_term)
        self.pe_matrix[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(timesteps * div_term)

    def forward(self, timestep):
        return self.pe_matrix[timestep].to(timestep.device)

  
From both implementation I understand that the maximum sequence number (timesteps for Diffusion models) is not relevant for the computation of the embeddings. However, after testing both approaches I found they compute different embeddings for the same position/timestep with the same embedding dimensions... shouldn't it be equal? This is getting me confused, because now I don't know which implementation should I consider...  
Thank you :)

162vcmt,Calculating the time it takes for a packet to transmit,"Okay the question is:  


A file of F KB is to be transmitted from A to B. There are N links (and N ‚àí 1  
routers) each of speed R KB/sec between A and B. To transmit any packet, a header  
of size H KB is required to be added to the packet payload. Suppose that the links  
and the routers are congestion-free (i.e., no queueing delays) and propagation and  
processing delays are negligible. Answer the following:  
  
If the file (of size F KB) is divided into P > 1 equal-sized segments and each  
segment is packetized individually (by adding the header), then how long does  
it take to transmit the entire file assuming that the packets are sent successively  
without any delay in between consecutive transmissions?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was my thinking:  
I tried splitting it up like so  
  
((F/P)+H) - new length of each segment,  
  
((F/P)+H)/R - time taken for one segment to go from A to first router.  
  
N\*((F/P)+H)/R - time taken for one segment to reach B.  
  
P\*(N\*((F/P)+H)/R) - time taken for all segments to reach B.

This is however wrong and the answer is:  


>!(N + P - 1) x ((F/P)+H)/R!<

Œ©(A, S1, S2) = Œ± * F(A(S1), A(S2)) - Œ≤ * T(S1, S2) + Œ≥ * (H(S1) + D(S2)) + Œ¥ * H(S1, S2)

We might represent each operator as follows:

	1.	F(A(S1), A(S2)) = Œ£ (A(S1i)* A(S2i)) for i from 1 to n. This is a typical approach in signal processing where the function F models the interaction between two systems. In this case, we are taking the dot product of the mathematical models of the systems (A(S1) and A(S2)).
	2.	T(S1, S2) = Œ£ |S1i - S2i| for i from 1 to n. The tare operator T can be a simple absolute difference between the system states, summing over all state variables. This serves as a penalty term for incongruous details between the systems.
	3.	H(S1) + D(S2) could be expressed as the integral over time of the state variables of each system, representing the total harmony or dissonance within each system. So H(S1) = ‚à´ S1(t) dt, and similarly D(S2) = ‚à´ S2(t) dt.
	4.	H(S1, S2) could be expressed as the correlation coefficient between the two system states over time, ranging from -1 to 1, as a measure of their combined harmony or dissonance. So H(S1, S2) = corr(S1(t), S2(t)).

Where:

	‚Ä¢	Œ©: Represents the universal comparison operation
	‚Ä¢	A: The mathematical model of a system
	‚Ä¢	S1, S2: Two systems in question
	‚Ä¢	F: The mathematical function modeling the interaction of two systems.
	‚Ä¢	T: The tare operator, accounting for incongruous details between S1 and S2
	‚Ä¢	H: The harmony operator, applicable to a single system or multiple systems
	‚Ä¢	D: The dissonance operator, applicable to a single system or multiple systems
	‚Ä¢	Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, Œ¥: Coefficients adjusting the impact of each term in the equation
	‚Ä¢	i: Index of the system‚Äôs state variables
	‚Ä¢	t: Time
	‚Ä¢	n: Total number of state variables in the systems

This principle suggests that the comparison, contrast, and analysis of the interaction of any two systems can be undertaken in a comprehensive mathematical framework, potentially allowing the prediction and manipulation of various facets of reality.

15kyf3t,How much slower is an Efficiency core vs a Performance core in Intel architecture?,I have looked for some charts showing this sort of data but could not find them. Likely that is because I was not finding the correct google searches. What I am wanting to better understand is the difference in time to complete computations between these two types of cores in modern Intel architecture. For example if I had a single threaded application that was calculating the nth prime number how much faster would the performance core complete this task. If someone has a link to something that shows this or has a percentage or something that would be very helpful. I would write an application and try and test it myself but I do not currently have access to a system with that hardware.  ,2023-08-07 21:55:44

They want to publish a book/manuscript with me based on my research. I told my academic advisor about this and at first they thought it to be a great opportunity and offered to mentor me through the whole process. However, my advisor followed up with another email saying after they checked the publisher more carefully, they do not believe it to be high quality and I should skip this opportunity. I checked De Gruyter out for myself and they appear to be a decent publisher. In fact, they are one of the oldest scholary academic publishers in the world and have been around for 249 years.

Any suggestions welcome !,"I have an idea for a knitting program and would like some input since my computer science/programming skills are beginner at best. I was a mechanical engineering major and have some programming experience with matlab and python but most of it was pretty specific to the assignments and projects I was working on at the time. A lot of what I know from school is not applicable for what I want to do in this knitting program. 

My idea for the basic program would be a GUI with a grid. Each square of the grid would be editable by the user and would have options for different knitting stitch types. From there, it would take that information and create a image of what the knitting pattern would roughly look like. For this, I would just need to take the knitting stitch selected in that cell and possibly the surrounding cells and from there it would select the appropriate photo. It would also need to stretch the photo into a rectangle with height/width ratios that match the knitting stitch dimension that the user inputs.  In the end, it would output a grid of photos of knitting stitches that would all line up to approximate what the actual knit piece would look like.I have a lot of ideas for how this idea could be expanded but this is the basic concept I want to start with. 

What is the best programming language/s to accomodate the GUI interface that I‚Äôm describing? 
Is there an easy way to store symbolic information? Should I instead represent each stitch as a number? The information I need to store is essentially a large 2-D matrix with a different symbol in each. There‚Äôs also often repeated patterns that may be able to be stored in a way thats more compact than having a huge matrix with repeated patterns of stitches over and over. 

Also, if you have any suggestions for topics I should look into or exisiting programs that would help me out please let me know. I cant find too much information on anything similar but its most likely because I dont even know what to look for. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated ! Let me know if theres any portion I should elaborate on to make my idea more clear.",2023-06-14 17:40:18

I just  want to write a 2D version of my dream game, which would be based on  BTMUX (a text based Battletech MUD that I used to play in the 90's).

2. Could someone use Creative Commons libraries in a piece of proprietary software? I want anyone to be able to use,  and develop the fantastical physics libraries that I plan to write, for  free, in any for profit, or not for profit, piece of software that they  might want to produce.

While going through the literature, I noticed that the authors disable turbo boost when performing similar benchmarks. I have a couple of questions regarding this:

* Why is it necessary to disable turbo boost when measuring clock cycles for benchmarking purposes? What impact does turbo boost have on accurate measurements?
* I have observed that when turbo boost is disabled, my CPU's maximum frequency is limited to 2GHz. However, when turbo boost is enabled, the CPU occasionally exceeds the 2GHz limit by a small margin. This brings me to my second question: Is disabling turbo boost alone sufficient for accurate clock cycle measurements, or should I ensure that the CPU frequency remains constant throughout the benchmarking process? If maintaining a consistent frequency is important, how can I achieve this?

The paper says that 'ret' (i.e., variable shown in above code) has an abstract value T, i.e., its value could be 256 (retrieved from line#6) or 257 (retrieved from line# 7). Because of this problem with the value of ret, the authors could not determine whether the assertion on line#19 will work. Hence the authors used the technique of look ahead analysis discussed on page 792. But this technique discusses about path prefix and path suffixes.

So I have been looking at this problem:

Given a CNF instance, s, return 1, 2 or 3 such that:

If 1 was returned then: #SAT(s)<1/2

If 2 was returned then: 1/4<#SAT(s)<3/4

And if 3 was returned then: 1/2<#SAT(s)

Note that on some instances more then one answer is acceptable, in those cases, it doesn't matter which answer is returned.

First, my question is weather this problem is in P? (Formally you'll need to slightly modify the definition, but I mean, can this be solved with a polynomial algorithm?)

Second, if it is not, given an Orcale to this problem, could I solve MAJ-SAT? In this case, if more then valid answer was possible, you can't assume anything about how the oracle will decide which of them to return to you.

125nwdg,What to do after creating a new data structure?,"I've been working on a new data structure which has the capabilities of both a prefix tree (trie) and a suffix tree simultaneously, and I believe it is implemented in an optimal manner (i.e. it isn't just a prefix tree and a suffix tree separately under the hood). I would be a bit surprised if this structure were not actually created / implemented before, but if this is the case, I'm wondering what someone generally does once they actually create a new data structure in this manner.

In terms of implementation, it's essentially a graph where each node is a character and each word which was added to the structure is represented by a graph in the path. Unlike prefix trees, suffixes, and in some case, infixes (substrings), share common paths, and this structure can have two root nodes, one for the prefix entry and one for the suffix entry (front and back).

My questions are:

1. Does this kind of data structure actually exist?
2. If not, is this something worth writing a brief paper and publishing somewhere? Would this be an academic publication or nothing more than a blog post somewhere?",2023-03-29 13:19:31

This is a proof that for every parse tree with root A and yield w there exists a leftmost derivation from A to w. I don't understand the second sub-induction over the indices. The indices of the yields of the child trees are w1,...,wi. I'm confused about the base case because the base case used is zero, which is not an index of any w.

What is the property P(N) of natural numbers statement we are proving with mathematical induction there?

Could this part of the proof be proved as a separate theorem stated as, ""If A‚ÜíX1‚ãØXk and X1‚Üíw1,...,Xk‚Üíwk, then A ‚Üí w1‚ãØwk""? (here the ‚Üí means leftmost derives)

Then you could do induction over i in the statement

P(i) = ""A leftmost derives w1‚ãØwi Xi+1‚ãØXk in i steps""

The base case then would be A ‚Üí w1X2‚ãØXk which is true by the fact that if A ‚Üí BC and B ‚Üí D then A ‚Üí DC which, as well as in the inductive step, could be proven by the definition of leftmost derives?",2023-03-28 13:01:41

122f0l2,Should I use polymorphism / Strategy pattern in my VMTranslator program? Request for advice on design.,"I'm making a VM translator, for simple instructions (push constant 4, pop local 3) as part of the course ""Nand2Tetris"".

The suggested implementation is as follows:

Modules:*VMTranslator* with main method. Creates an instance of Parser and CodeWriter. Takes .vm input file, outputs a .asm file.

*Parser* which parses the relevant (no whitespace or command) lines and ads the commands to a list of commands. It has a field with the current command, a hasMore() and advance() and a .getCommandType() as well as a .getArgA() and .getArgB() method.

*CodeWriter* which has a writeArithmetic() for arithmetic commands and a writePushPop() method. (this part of the project only concerns itself with a subset of the functionality of the VM).

I made the Assembler in a similar fashion, so this time I was wondering if I could introduce an Command interface, which has a .getAsmCode() method, and concrete classes such as ArithmeticCommand that implement this interface. This way, I can just do something like this:

    // ommitted some things for sake of readability  
    class VMTranslator {     
        public static void main() {         
            Parser parser = new Parser(""foo.vm"");         
            CodeWriter codeWriter = new CodeWriter(""foo.asm"");          
            Command c;         
            while (parser.hasMore()) {             
                c = parser.advance();             
                codeWriter.encode(c);         
            } 
        }  
    
    class CodeWriter {     
        FileWriter writer;       
        public void enconde(Command c) {         
            writer.write(c.getAsmCode())      
        } 
    } 

The real translation logic is now inside each of the concrete classes that implement Command.

Is this a good option?

Edit: if I do it the first way, it's certainly possible but I end up with either many else if statements (when more instruction types are added) or switch case statement. But on the other hand, the amount of instruction types is known so I'm not sure if that still means that it violates the open closed principle.",2023-03-26 07:55:40

I am a student at the University of Glasgow and I am currently recruiting participants to evaluate the tool I developed for my honours project. The tool is called JSONTalk and it is a summarising tool for JSON files.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of JSONTalk in helping individuals understand and analyse JSON files. The study should take around 15 minutes and participants will be asked to answer a series of questions based on 3 different screenreader transcripts of JSON files.

Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will be given the opportunity to download and use JSONTalk to help them answer the questions, while the other group will be answering the questions without the tool. Everyone clicks the same link, and the allocation will happen automatically.

You do not need to have much JSON knowledge to participate, however, some programming background is required. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at [**2463548h@student.gla.ac.uk**](mailto:2463548h@student.gla.ac.uk).

11abzb5,Understanding how to create a Google map that searches as you move the map,"I'm working on a project that involves a feature that's very similar to the AirBnb 'search as you move' functionality.  


Initially I read through the Google maps Embed JavaScript APIs. However, in this scenario, I would need to make a database query that returned all map markers to the client. Then, on the client-side, determine if the marker was within the bounds of the map object. As the number of markers grows, this doesn't seem scalable.  


Proxying traffic on the Airbnb website, I see that it makes calls to [maps.googleapis.com](https://maps.googleapis.com) as the user moves the map. This seems to be returning new markers for the client to display. So in this scenario, Google actually has the marker data for the map used by AirBnb.  


Looking through the Google Cloud console, under maps platform, the only things I see when you create a map are to style how it looks. So fundamentally I don't see a way to do what AirBnb is doing.

keep in mind ive only ever read some stuff on things like this, and only implemented SMA, so please correct me if it seems like im misunderstanding anything / misusing terminology. also this isnt really needed for the game im making, im just thinking that this would be a cool thing to do because im interested in optimization (though not confident in my math, which is why im turing to metaheuristics / simulations).

18c03a4,Frustrations with AI Assistants for Complex Coding Projects,"As a developer, I often find chatGPT and other AI coding assistants fall short when working with larger, multi-file projects. The need to manually upload each file is cumbersome. File size limits constrain real-world codebases. And the lack of persistent memory across sessions means having to constantly re-explain context.  
What if there was a tool that could ingest your whole code repository in one go? Not just as plain text, but in a way that understands code structure like functions, variables, and relationships. It would maintain memory on all those details between sessions, so prior context on a project is never lost. And it would integrate right inside existing IDEs like VS Code for a seamless developer experience.  
This context-aware, stateful foundation could enable more intelligent suggestions, error checking, and autocomplete as you code. So rather than just a chat window, it acts like a supercharged AI pair-programmer that learns your code.  
Before embarking on building something like this, I'm curious:  
Are there pain points with chatGPT and other assistants I'm missing? What has been your experience?  
What other capabilities would make a tool like this more useful?

17uflw6,Graduation project,"Hi, I'm writing this post because I will soon have to present my high school graduation project. The project consists of an ideal eco-sustainable hotel in which my classmates and I collaborate, each having their own sector.
Ex: Art‚Äî> Works to visit in our area
Economy‚Äî> Costs and tourism company
Mathematics‚Äî> Data graphs about tourism
Ecc..

I will take care of the IT sector and will have the task of creating a platform that will simulate a hotel website. I remind you that the hotel is sustainable and is located in the area near the school.

Premises: I have no knowledge of programming but I like technology, that's why I chose this sector. I found ""WebFlow"" as a site creation engine and then I would like to transform the product into an html file without publishing it online, so that it has all the functionality of a site, but without any expense.

Now let's move on to my expectations: I would like the ""site"" to contain information about the hotel but also about the creation of the site itself which aims to have minimal environmental costs and promote tourism in my area. In fact, I would like the site itself to have its own value and to have content about which I can say something during the presentation (since I will have to present it during the oral test).

Now I ask you for help to give me ideas and practical advice regarding these points:
- Do you think ‚ÄúWebFlow‚Äù can work? Will I be able to download the working html file without having to publish it? If yes, how?
- What content should I add to the site to make it interesting, complete and consistent with my presentation? (Digital eco-sustainability, tourism, territory).
- How can I give the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa sustainable site? I mean for example by saying that I would publish it on servers with low energy consumption... or other ideas?

I am implementing the Edmonds-Karp algorithm in Java. I've already written a good part of it, but gonna start over. My implementation will be done in 5 steps. This is also how the code will run:

1. Build a graph representation of the flow network. Probably a class each for nodes and edges.

2. Build a new residual network graph. Maybe a class each for these nodes and edges as well.
3. Make a BFS method that searches the residual network and returns an augmenting path (probably as a string).
4. Make a method that uses the augmenting path found to update the system.

5. Make a method that calculates the min cut.

Loop steps 2, 3 and 4 for as long as is needed.

----

My questions:

* Is the final residual graph all I need to figure out the min cut?
* In the BFS: When I have reached a node N in my priority queue, and I am evaluating which of N's neighbours to add to the queue, how exactly does that work? Should I add nodes or edges? Do I just add all outgoing edges with spare capacity and all backward edges that has some flow > 0 (that haven't already been added)?
* What exactly is my queue to exit the 2-3-4 loop as describes above? Is it when the BFS finishes without finding an augmenting path to the sink?",2023-10-20 14:51:06

15qgg4s,How long will digital computing last? (Speculation welcome!),"Hi all, I'm a data science student aiming for a career in ML research. I'm becoming fascinated by how binary or discrete encodings can be used to analyse information more efficiently.

I have a hypothesis that, because digital computers naturally encode information in binary, it might be more efficient to use ML models that primarily use combinatorial representations rather than continuous ones. Although it still seems like we're quite far from knowing how to do this well, there's already some emerging research that seems to be pointing in this general direction (e.g. compression methods such as sparsity and quantization).

That brings us to the question of how distant analog computing is - the point of focusing on discrete representations might become redundant if game-changing advancements in analog computing are \~10 years away. I don't know a great deal about computing research, but I've heard there's plenty of work being done in this area.

It's easy to imagine that analog computing would have a range of benefits for some applications, but I'm not sure how far away these types of capabilities are, and what would determine the scale of their impact.

Up until now, I didn't know which path (frontend or full stack) I wanted to go down, however the placement (work experience) year I have just completed has presented me with some options I didn't think of. I have been doing frontend (very basic HTML, CSS, Figma, form work) work at the placement but I became aware that the backend team were using ASP.NET Core. Upon doing some research, I think this has answered my question for me. I want to do full stack work and I like that C# and ASP.NET Core is all within the Microsoft ecosystem, and is receiving lots of support which would in theory make it too big to fail. 

However now I have more dilemmas.

1. How can I effectively learn C# and ASP.NET Core while studying my final year in which I will also be learning Laravel, advanced JavaScript, and a frontend framework (likely React)?

2. Is this even the right path for me? I love the idea of creating a backend to go with the frontend and having the skillset to create a fully working app. However, I have 0 experience with JavaScript frameworks such as React, I only know vanilla JavaScript at the moment and even with that I only know enough to print to console, manipulate the DOM, and create functions. This makes me think I don't even have enough experience with frontend to make a decision that I want to do full-stack over frontend. It feels like I only just started to walk with front end development and now I want to fly with full stack, and I completely missed the running part (front end Frameworks like React). 

3. Is this a non traditional route? I hear so many people go down the HTML > CSS > JS > React/Vue > NodeJS > PostgreSQL route and become full stack or frontend that kind of way, but I never hear of people leaping to C#/ASP and doing ""real"" programming. Whatever that means.


4. Furthering on from that point, are there less opportunities for me as a barely junior developer if I decide to go the C# and ASP.NET Core route? I'm looking at job sites and I don't see many employers wanting ASP.NET Core developers, much less employers wanting JUNIOR ASP.NET Core developers. It all seems to be React React React, noSQL noSQL noSQL, Node Node Node, PHP PHP PHP.


I apologise for the word salad. My brain is just frazzled right now thinking if I'm making a mistake going into what seems like a niche technology, and foregoing the Laravel and React routes.

I understand where the updates server and router go, but not really sure about the difference between the NAC server and AD server and where they go or don‚Äôt, and why the remote access server and .1x switch goes where they go.  Can anyone help out with an explanation or some links for further research?

The full question:
An organization has an aging network infrastructure and is currently accepting proposals to upgrade the network.  The design is somewhat flexible; however security is the highest priority.  Using network design skills along with your security knowledge, you will evaluate the best placement of devices and create a logical network diagram that addresses the following needs:
All types of client access must be authenticated and validated to a health policy.
Authentication services should be located with other private company assets.
A remediation server should allow non-compliant assets to obtain updates, but have no other network access.
A single firewall appliance should enforce distinct routing and security polities for each segment.
Wireless and wired clients should be able to communicate with each other.",2023-06-01 10:45:38

However, other products I see appear to be HDMI sticks that are set up to run emulators / roms and even accept controller inputs in some instances while providing other USB slots.

I have a good background, but mainly in web development. Are these other devices just running a custom OS? If that is the case, if I were to buy a box of ""smart TV"" Android 10 HDMI sticks, how do I go about reprogramming them?

My ultimate idea is fairly basic, just that the device would have media on it which would maybe have a menu, or even just automatically run through a determined sequence (music videos). I am guessing this wouldn't be too difficult to pull off.

The initial roadblock I see is that I really have no idea the general procedure for trying to alter such a device - are other manufacturers just hijacking Android at some point and reskinning it, or rolling their own OS, which I feel is doubtful?

If it is as simple as just reskinning and limiting a custom version of Android, where do I get started and is anybody aware of documentation related specifically to reprogramming HDMI ""TV Stick"" devices?

Thanks in advance :). I had this idea many years ago, but the cost of these same devices was much higher then (and even prior, they didn't really exist). Now that the price has become manageable, I want to explore the idea again.",2023-03-09 05:01:54

17ilthk,Is there a known algorithm that solves this problem related to transforming strings?,"Suppose that we are given two arbitrary strings, each with the same length N. N can get arbitrarily large but it will definitely be a finite number. The two given strings may or may not be the same and they are composed of some random combination of the 26 letters of the English alphabet. The idea is that we want to have an algorithm that will get us from the first string to the second string. The rules are as follows:

1) Numbers can be added or subtracted to each letter in the string mod 26. Thus if we wanted to add 5 to each letter in the string ""ftawy"", we will get the string ""kyfbd"". If we wanted to subtract 1 from each letter of the string ""pquas"", we will get the string ""optzr"".  If you do not want the string to change then you simply add 0 to every letter of the string. The important thing here however is that the same number has to be added/subtracted to all letters in the string. You can't add 3 to one letter, subtract7 from another letter, add 2 to another letter, etc.

2) Strings can be permuted one character at a time. Thus if we have the string ""skiopw"" and we wanted to move the ""i"" to the first position, we will end up with ""iskopw"". 

In each step we can either add/subtract a number to every letter in the string or we can move one character to a different location in the string. Of course there are some practical things to consider, such as for very long strings realistically they would have to be put in files and there would be some overhead when it comes to reading all that data in. There is also the fact that some strings cannot be transformed into some other given string. For example the string ""aduiod"" cannot become ""hhhhhh"" no matter what simply because the number of repeated letters is different. For the benefit of the user it might also be helpful to see how exactly the computer transforms the string, as in the exact steps taken to turn the first string into the second string.

All that aside what I would like to know is am I just restating some problem to which an algorithm already exists and is well understood or is this problem not a standard algorithm taught in a algorithms course?",2023-10-28 20:03:18

Maybe each project would be a single ip that you can ssh into. Your S3 files would show up as files in the system but you can mount files from other ""systems""/projects. Your users show up as users, your user groups, then for the processes which are also files, those would be like the AWS lambda. VMs would be like EC2. 

Then an entire company would be able to ssh into a single ""server"" and create cron jobs to run processes which would actually be creating lambdas/workers in the cloud using cloud formation/etc.

            System.out.println(q);

I was asked to write a program that given a value k and a queue of elements reverses the order of the first k elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order. Through trial and error I arrived at the right code, although I don't get why it works.

For the sake of lucidity let the original queue be \[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90\]. After the first for loop queue = \[50, 60, 70, 80, 90\] and stack = \[40, 30, 20, 10\]. Why is stack =/= \[10,20,30,40\]? My thought process was remove() removes the first element of the queue, and that push added elements to the end of a stack. So the steps would look something like

1. queue = \[20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90\],

stack = \[10\]

1. queue = \[30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90\]

stack = \[10, 20\]

1. queue = \[40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90\] stack = \[10, 20, 30\]

etc.

Then after the while loop, the queue is \[50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 40, 30, 20, 10\]. What I don't understand here is why is the queue not \[50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 10, 20, 30, 40\] here? My thought process was that pop() removes elements from the end of the stack, and add adds elements to the end of a queue. So the steps would look something like

1. Stack: \[50, 60, 70, 80, 90\] Queue: \[40, 30, 20, 10\]
2. Stack: \[50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 10\] Queue: \[40, 30, 20\]

12gz391,"What is definition of an ""object"" in ""object-oriented""?","OOP languages are usually defined as having 4 following properties: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. I argue that none of them is necessary neither jointly sufficient by providing counterexamples. I also provide alternative definitions that don't succeed in capturing an essence of objects.

**Object as Encapsulation:**

GoF (1995) provides classic definition of an object as encapsulation.

>Object-oriented programs are made up of objects. An object packages both data and the procedures that operate on that data. The procedures are typically called methods or operations.

But encapsulation is found in non-OOP modular languages like Modula-2 where module encapsulates data/state with logic/behavior.

**Object as Inheritance:**

Inheritance allows code reuse by sharing implementation details. But some OOP languages like Go and Rust lack inheritance.

**Object as Polymorphism:**

There are different kinds of polymorphism (ad-hoc, parametric, subtyping) but in current context it's subtyping (Cardelli (1985) calls it inclusion polymorphism). Since Simula 67, first object-oriented language, introduced subpying, it's natural to view it as an essential feature of OOP. But System F<: also extends polymorphic lambda calculus with subtyping relation (defined as either preorder or partial order) so it's possible to have subtyping in purely functional languages.

**Object as Abstraction:**

Abstraction allows information hiding. There are different kinds of abstraction (e.g. functional abstraction in lambda calculus) but in current context it's data abstraction. CLU, object-oriented language, introduced abstract data types. But System F with existential types also allows information hiding thus enabling abstract data types in purely functional languages like Haskell.

There are few alternative definitions treating different properties as essential.

**Object as Component:**

Cardelli (1998) defines object-oriented approach by analogy with concrete objects in simulation.

>The object-oriented approach to programming is based on an intuitive correspondence between a software simulation of a physical system and the physical system itself. An analogy is drawn between building an algorithmic model of a physical system from software components and building a mechanical model of a physical system from concrete objects. By analogy, the software components are themselves called objects. In its purest form, the object-oriented approach recommends that every system be developed according to this analogy.

This definition aligns with encapsulation definition although it equates object-oriented approach with component-based programming. But component is language-agnostic and can be implemented using functions, procedures, modules, objects. services etc.

**Object as Dynamic Dispatch:**

Cook (2012) defines object as dynamically dispatched behavior.

>An *object* is a first-class, dynamically dispatched behavior. A *behavior* is a collection of named operations that can be invoked by clients where the operations may share additional hidden details.  *Dynamic dispatch* means that different objects can implement the same operation name(s) in different ways,  so the specific operation to be invoked must come from the object identified in the client's request.  *First class* means that objects have the same capabilities as other kinds of values,  including being passed to operations or returned as the result of an operation.

This definition aligns with polymorphism definition although there's an additional implementation requirement in the form of dynamic dispatch. If static dispatch implementation of subtyping is possible then dynamic dispatch is not an essential feature.

**Object as Reference:**

Objects act similar to entities in entity-relationship model where entity is a unique object. OOP languages have mechanism for referencing unique objects using keywords such as *this* or *self*. But non-OOP procedural languages like C also implement references in the form of pointers.

Perhaps this definition can be hardened by defining object as first-class reference. In C there's no primitive pointer type and precise data type of *void\** is unknown. Languages like C# and Java maintain a distinction between value and reference types. But I'm not sure if it's true for C++ and other OOP languages.

I've looked into using Azure Cognitive Services, and I found that I could use the Computer Vision API to detect the boundaries of objects in the images, including the walls and furniture. However, I'm not sure how to proceed from there to actually count the number of rooms.

I'd like to know if anyone has experience with this kind of problem and can suggest a solution or tool that could work. Maybe there's a different AI service that's more suited for this task, or maybe there's a way to process the object boundaries to infer the number of rooms.

15q364z,Why can't email spammers be stopped?,"Email servers can detect when an email account sends out and receives hundreds or thousands or more of emails in batches from one account. So why can't all email servers just block the batch and cancel the account.

Spammer spoofs email address is irrelevant because the email servers still send and receive the email regardless of the from email address.

For example spammer has a list of emails and starts sending batches. Email server that received the request to send more than (let's say 50 emails) blocks the send and notifies the sender not to send the email and disables the account. 

Another example spammer owns email server that sends the batch so the receiving email server blocks the batchs. 

Like Gmail and Hotmail email servers should easy detect spammers. All emails are limited to 50 emails a day and if that email account is sending more than 100 a week then permanently block.

For companies that some people want their spam like Groupon then add to world approval list. The only way to get on world approval list is apply and get thoroughly investigated.

Also end the option to spoof email addresses and fine spammers because they can be traced back to which email server sent the message then which account on that email server sent the batch of emails.

1b73j13,How to consume X percent CPU time?,"Hi,

A colleague and I were discussing during lunch how to create a program that consumes a given fraction of CPU time on a modern OS/architecture. 

It is easy enough to create a program that uses approx 100 % CPU time ( while True: pass ) or approx 0 % CPU time (sleep $inf), etc.

But lets consider that we want to create a program that uses approximately X % CPU time. X can be varied, but lets assume 10 %.

There are some rules:

 * Program should aim to consume X % CPU utilization, and when it gets to that target, it should stay there. 
 * The actual work that the program performs does not matter. It can be some trivial loop, fizzbuzz or whatever.
 * 1 CPU core available - in other words, you cannot just assume you have 10 available CPU cores and just use one of them 100 % to get a total of 10 % CPU time. We want 10 % CPU time on a single core.
 * This must run in a modern OS like Linux and on a modern virtualized platform. This means that the VM may suddenly be migrated to a faster hardware. So CPU core speed is not constant. A modern CPU may also do various frequency scaling.
 * ""htop"" or similar program must show the procress as consuming X % CPU time.
 * The program itself must adjust its CPU demand to approximate the target CPU utilization. You cannot just use some OS feature like cgroups to limit the CPU consumption.
 * The program should be self contained and take no input data. (ie., you cannot make a network server and just have an external program observe CPU utilization and send an increasing amount of requests until utilization target is reached.

I would love to hear how you would approach this.",2024-03-05 11:59:31
1bd66ro,How to minimize the number of moves to sort an array by adding and subtracting ONLY adjacent numbers by 1,"The problem is

You‚Äôre given a list of integers, each integer represents the height of a lego tower made of bricks, you have n towers of contiguous tiles, where the i-th tower is composed of f(i) blocks of equal size stacked on top of each other. 

The objective is to rearrange the towers in descending order in such a way that for all i it is true that f(i)‚â•f(i + 1). But we can only make moves of one (1) piece between the closest adjacent towers.

we have to return the minimum number of moves required to rearrange the towers with the previous condition.

So for something like this

in: 4 3 2 0 4 1

out: 2

because you take one away from the tower of height 4 located in  f(4) and give it to the tower of height 0 in f(3), resulting in: 

4 3 2 1 3 1

then you take one away from tower of height 3 located in f(4) and put it in f(3)
resulting in: 

4 3 2 2 2 1

which satisfies that each f(i) >= f(i+1)

So my question is how do i find the subproblems to solve? because the only solution i‚Äôve found is something of o(n*2^n) 

I‚Äôm not asking you to solve it just give me something because i‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôve heard it can be solved using a bottom up dynamic programming but i‚Äôd like to see other possible approaches. ",2024-03-12 19:31:01

I am an entry level IT guy/programmer and I ran into a confusing situation this past week.  I work with one other industry veteran who I've learned a lot from, but I feel like they mislead me this week and I'm needing clarification.

This started with my manager recently implementing a pfsense firewall.  I have done very little with firewalls and didn't really do anything with the installation or configuration of this one.
It happened that a coworker couldn't access a link that was going over a non-standard https port. I showed my manager if he'd show me how he'd want me to go about this, I knew it has to do with the change and we just need to open up that port.  He asked, like a good teacher wanting to test a student, what I thought.  My response was to allow outbound traffic for that domain over that port. He immediately said no, like I didn't understand it at all. I trust him, so I assumed I misunderstood something.
He instead had me add that port to an alias group so that this port was completely opened up for outbound traffic - I don't remember if it was just for https/http, or all protocols.  
That day ended, but the next day he asks me if I can explain firewalls since I was confused the prior day.  I basically say, it polices in/out bound traffic based on ports (I left out IPs since I felt stupid from the prior day).
He says, ""yes, but there's one other major/important function - do you know what that is?""
I'm unsure.
So he hints at network address translation. Which is the answer he was looking for.
We talk a little more and I ask, isn't NAT a function of routers, not firewalls?
He says, sort of..  and that routers are firewalls in a sense.

I'm two years into this field and don't want to feel like an idiot.

1bfnhco,Why do algorithm/code practice sites use a restricted definition of a bitonic sequence?,"In looking at a number of algorithm and coding practice sites such as
leetcode, geeksforgeeks, etc. there is usual a problem that is roughly
""implement an O(N) algorithm to find the longest bitonic subarray of a give
array"".  The given definition of bitonic sequence, though, is a truncated one:

A sequence X: X(0) < ... X(k) > ... X(n-1); k: 0 < k < n-1.

This definition excludes monotic sequences and sequences that are monotic
descending, then monotic ascending.

The original definition of bitonic by Batcher is: ""We will call a sequence of
numbers bitonic if it is the juxtaposition of two monotonic sequences, one
ascending, the other descending. We also say it remains bitonic if it is split
anywhere and the two parts interchanged."" [Batcher, 1968; ""Sorting networks
and their applications""]

The wiki page for ""bitonic sorter"" uses a compatible definition: ""a bitonic
sequence is a sequence X: X(0) <= ... X(k) >= ... X(n-1) for some k: 0 <= k <
n, *or a circular shift thereof*"" [italics added]

The inclusion of splitting (rotation) clearly permits monotonic ascending,
descending, and descending then ascending sequences to be bitonic.

**Question:**
Why do these sites all use the truncated version of the definition?  Is it a
toy problem just to make the implementation easier, or is there some extremely
common use of the bitonic nature of the sequence that rules out rotation in
practical circumstances?",2024-03-15 20:21:21

1b9cac9,What do you think about the use of AI in programming?,"In the past month or two I've started including an AI Programming assistant into my workflow for a few tasks. Mainly for generating code that is just repetitive and tedious, such as initializing an array with values where I might provide a simple list of values and say turn this dataset into an array and be presented with just that, and also for answering questions I have about a library I'm not familiar with. In this case I may make a simple request that I might otherwise do a Google search for. 

For example I might ask something along the lines of, 

""How do I create a control, such as a label, and add it to a Windows Form at a specific place during runtime?""

The AI will then generate some code that I treat as an example of how to use that library, or as though I was reading another person's code. 

Of course because it's AI generated it requires some scrutiny with the documentation to ensure certain things like the function or methods presented actually exist within the library or the version of the library I'm using and then that's it's usage actually matches how it's supposed to be used in the documentation and there aren't any notes like ""You can do this in UVW situation, but you shouldn't because XYZ"".

1br6f99,Web dev when you don't have technical experience on your team,"I've been wondering about these two things on how web dev is done irl

1. In the past, when cloud providers weren't a thing, were all websites hosted on ones own equipment in-house? Even if it was some personal project website. So you'd have to have your computer on 24-7 for people to use it, and register your computer's IP with the website domain through some process?

&#x200B;

2. In modern day, almost every new small business needs a website. But most small businesses are probably built by people without tech experience. I'm curious how they usually do it. I'm sure most won't have the time to pick up web dev, so they'd probably use some tool like Wordpress. How commonly done is this, and what's the scope of stuff that can be achieved with this? Is it only for displaying static content or can you have more complicated logic?

The other option I assume would be outsourcing to some freelancer. But once the freelancer is done with the website, who maintains it? The freelancer can't be expected to maintain every site he builds or they would soon be bogged down with maintaining all the sites and have no bandwidth to pick up new clients

1bn7py4,Data structure or algorithm which can handle misspelled words,"Was thinking about this problem:

**You have a dictionary containing every word in the english language, over a hundred thousand words. You're parsing through an online forum, and want to keep track of the occurrence of each word. The problem is, some words are misspelled and are off by one or two letters, but you still want to record their occurrences. As a further complication, some ""words"" aren't even words, just meaningless garbage text. How do you efficiently track the frequency of each word in the dictionary?**

My immediate instinct would be to use a hash table, where if an input is spelled correctly we can instantly record its occurrence. Otherwise, we would iterate over the entire dictionary with some kind of sequence alignment algorithm, trying to find a close match to the input word.

The issue with this would be it's incredibly slow if there are a lot of misspelled inputs, over 100k comparisons each time in the worst case. Maybe you could order the dictionary by frequency, where more frequently used words are checked first. That still wouldn't improve the performance in the case of garbage text however.

Create an ER diagram in Modified Chen (MC) notation -including entity types, relationship types, attributes, cardinalities, and keys (create surrogate keys if natural unique identifiers are missing)-for managing air travel data1. Please, use the digital tool draw.io for designing the ER diagram. We recommend draw.io since it has a toolbar for ER elements (among others). There are multiple correct ways of modeling (alternatives, and level of details), however the diagram should capture the essential information of the following discourse:  
‚Ä¢ Each flight is described by a unique flight ID (an integer), flight number (e.g., PG0529), flight status and the scheduled date and time for both departure and arrival. The flight status can take one of the following values: 'Scheduled', 'Cancelled', 'Arrived', 'On Time', 'Delayed', or 'Departed.  
‚Ä¢ Each airport is described by a unique airport code (3 characters), a name, a city, a timezone and coordinates, which is composed of latitude and longitude. A flight departs from one departure airport and arrives at another arrival airport.  
‚Ä¢ Our dataset also contains information about the aircraft. Each aircraft is described by a unique aircraft code, a model name, and a range, an integer which denotes the maximum distance the aircraft can fly. A flight uses one aircraft, and an aircraft can be used in multiple flights.  
‚Ä¢ A booking is described by a unique booking reference, which is a string of 6 characters (digits and Latin letters), the time and date of the booking, and the total amount (price) of the booking, which is an integer.  
‚Ä¢ A booking corresponds to one or more tickets. Each ticket is described by a unique 10-digit ticket number and an 11-digit passenger ID.  
‚Ä¢ Each ticket corresponds to one or more flights. A ticket-flight pair is described by the fare condition ('Business', 'Economy' or 'Comfort'), and the amount paid for this ticket on this flight.  
‚Ä¢ In addition, we have information about seats in different aircraft. Each seat is described by a unique seat number, e.g., 21F. Each aircraft has different fare conditions for its seats - 'Business', 'Economy' or 'Comfort. Note that the same seat number can have two different fare conditions in two different aircraft. For example, the seat number 7F is 'Economy' in Airbus A319, and 'Business' in Airbus A321.  
‚Ä¢ Finally, boarding pass, issued for a certain ticket, specifies one flight and one seat number. Please restrict yourself to using the following annotations for cardinalities: M, MC, C, 1.

1bczjuh,What would be a good approach for this project?,"Hello, I am a sophomore student in an university majoring computer science. I have been assigned a project on the topic of 'Utilizing Image Analysis with AI' for a duration of six weeks. The project I have planned is an attendance management program through the analysis of classroom images. (This is specifically limited to the classrooms at our university.)

Our university's classrooms are rectangular rooms that can accommodate 36 people. Additionally, there are four cameras of adequate quality mounted at each corner of the ceiling. The field of view of each camera is such that it can cover approximately 70-80 percent of the entire classroom at once.

In simple terms, the plan is as follows: during the lecture, calculate the actual number of people in the classroom through camera images, and compare it with the actual number of attendees. If there is a discrepancy in the attendance numbers, a notification will be sent to the professor. Of course, there is a flaw that cannot be detected if the number of people who did not attend the lecture but are marked as present equals the number of people who attended the lecture but left early. However, considering the relatively short duration of the project and that it's at the prototype stage, I am willing to overlook this limitation.

I foresee two major obstacles:  
1.Can the camera recognize people from behind?  
\--Since our university is a local institution in East Asia, where almost everyone has black hair, there is a concern whether it can accurately distinguish people if someone's hair happens to overlap with the black shirt of the person behind them.  
2. Can it recognize and count duplicate individuals across multiple cameras?  
\--Some individuals might be visible on multiple camera feeds simultaneously, and with each camera's view and angle being different, it's essential to accurately account for this to avoid double-counting.

I have done quite a bit of theoretical study, but I have little practical experience, so I'm not very familiar with the performance of general AI models that are publicly available for use. While I predict that the performance of current AI models might mean that the first issue isn't a major concern, I'm not yet sure which specific models would be useful for this task.

To overcome the second obstacle, I have devised the following solution:  
While it may be challenging for cameras to determine the 3D positions of objects, during class, most students are seated, and their head positions are slightly higher than the desks. This implies that if we were to draw an imaginary plane passing through the xy-axis at the height of the heads, all heads would exist above this plane. Therefore, assuming the z-axis is fixed, the position of heads in camera images can directly correspond to their positions on the mentioned xy plane, allowing for a mapping function to be written that stores the position of each 'head'. Through these coordinates, we can filter out students who appear in multiple camera images.

I am not sure if this idea is an efficient solution, or even a feasible one, as it is still in the planning stage and merely conceptual at this point. I would like to seek advice on whether there is a better (or simpler/easier) method.

1bbyor5,Resolving connections between items like Dijkstra but with additional weight for each link?,"I'm searching for an algorithm to connect items, which is similar to Dijkstra, but with a considerable difference.

The items are placed into columns in which they have an order (but different heights). Each item can now be connected to another item, which will be visible as a link. Each link should be as short as possible (best case). When a link goes through a column, it will ""make space for itself"". This is a problem now, because this might increase the value for other routes, for which they than might take a different route. To increase the complexity, those boxes could be moved on their y-axis, but not changed in order. Are there algorithms I could use to solve this? Currently I can just come up with adjusting Dijkstra to take the optional addition by other links into account, and create a way of having weights which are non-fixed values to indicate that the y-position of that item could be changed if it is favorable for minimizing the overall length of paths.

1brrhp1,"Since exact-3-cover and Positive Subset Product are both NP-complete, how do you reduce exact-3-cover into subset product without having collisions in the transformation that would a cause false positives when using a subset product algorithm?","My variant of Exact-3-cover has a list S **without duplicates** and C a collection of  arbitrary combinations of S represented as 3-lists again **without duplicates,** and no 3-lists are allowed to exist if that don't belong to S.  Our elements are whole numbers.

We can easily transform S into  N distinct primes and easily transform C into it's corresponding primes as well.

I've done this before and ensured that the transformed products made out of the 3-lists were all distinct. However, I'm not sure if it's possible to use a subset product algorithm to solve exact-3-cover without possibly giving false results. Because, let's say there were two 3-lists that shared a prime number but had different products. The subset product algorithm would wrongfully return True but no exact-3-cover would exist.

There has to be a valid reduction between these NP-complete problems, and thus my subset product algorithm must work for exact-3-cover. I would be baffled if there wasn't a proper many-one reduction.

Edit: I already have an iterative version of Depth Field Search and backtracking algorithm for Subset Product (w/o duplicates) combined with memoization and pruning optimizations that sets a maximum combination size. This would allow me to have a more efficient solution for Exact-3-cover once I find the proper reduction.

Edit 2: I find the problem structure of Subset Product easier to manipulate. If I could exploit that structure then I can find a more efficient algorithm for any variant of exact cover.",2024-03-30 20:29:31
1bqswkt,Could a website such as Reddit or FB reach a point where it is difficult/impossible to financially support its data storage?,"As a beginner computer science major, I have a rough understanding of how certain things work. But of course, the more you learn the more questions you have. 

From what I understand, websites are stored in massive data centers with thousands of terabytes worth of storage. When storage runs low, I assume they just purchase more storage- or perhaps attempt to optimize their existing data in a way that grants them more space. 

Will these massive companies continue to expand their storage indefinitely, or will they hit a point where it is no longer feasible to expand- such as due to sheer physical size or increased electricity costs? Will we see a time where sites like Reddit aren‚Äôt able to pay the bills with ad-revenue and ‚Äúpremium membership‚Äù offerings, and instead require all users to pay a subscription cost just to access their service?

This question came to mind after thinking about the massive amounts of ‚Äújunk‚Äù posts/comments/images on social media sites and the fact all that data is for the most part still accessible; and thus, still taking up space in the site‚Äôs database.",2024-03-29 16:03:27

1bqfqea,question: why proving the P vs NP problem isn't as simple as this?,"why is it that difficult to prove P to be equal or not to NP? i was thinking about it, and out of curiosity i thought about it this way. to be honest i didn't study the concept at depth so that might be the reason why i'm not seeing it. it shouldn't be as easy, and i'm not really expecting to solve the mysteries of science and the universe, nor this either, and even less without knowing as much about the topic lol. but in any case, take a look if you may:

as far as i've learned, P = NP means that a problem that can be checked quickly in polynomial time can also be possibly solved quickly in polynomial time. this means, that if a problem that can be checked quickly in polynomial times exists, and this problem gets to prove itself to be impossible to be solved quickly in polynomial times, would mean that P must not be equal NP. then, if that problem exist, and proves to have only one possible solution, which would solely be an increasing and proportionally complex and thus slower solution (for example, brute force, which increases difficulty while the complexity of such system increases, proportionally increasing the time it would take for it to be solved) then that would be enough proof that P is not equal NP in such system, meaning that while it is possible for complex NP problems to be eventually turned into P problems, still, there would be the existence of such wall or limit in the ways such problems can be solved.

here comes my thought experiment: the parallel universe detonator.

imagine an isolated system which can only output two possible answers: 1 and 0. this system is isolated by some sort of physics law, imposed by the universe where it is located itself. this system is at a parallel universe completly separeted from ours, only an instantaneous connection between the two universes can be made when a special condition is reached, said connection would send one and only one bit of data to a second machine located at our universe which once data is received it instantly detonates a bomb at our planet destroying the planet itself. the threat of such natural condition being reached in that universe can happen at any moment unless it is desactivated.

the computer must resolve this problem:
in such isolated system, there's only two buttons and this way, only two possibilities. by pressing the correct one the system would be disactivated given the output: 1 to its display, that would show that the system has been sucessfully disactivated (yay). by pressing the wrong one, the system would reach its condition sending a bit of data to the detonator in our universe, displaying a 0 in its display. if the given number of wrong buttons increases to 100 leaving only 1 right button, it would leave only 1 out of 100 possibilities to solve such problem. since the computer has only one try and it wouldn't be of any help to press the most probable button there's only one way left to solve the problem due to the limitations of the system, the only possibility left would be to randomly pick a button, hence being only possibly solved by using brute force. meaning that if this cannot be solved in any other way around, P must not equal NP.

does my conclusion makes any sense or hint at anything at all? i know it wouldn't be as easy since someone should already have come up with something similar but why doesn't it just explains or makes any sense of it?

dtzumu,i hate syntax-reserved punctuation,"
one fine day i was commenting on reddit and i wrote a couple of punctuation symbols expecting them to be displayed but instead... they were caught by the markdown software. this is bad. this means there are strings i cannot display as i wished. ""use a backslash to escape them!"". yeah but then what if we want to pass the string to several nested bash-like programs? 
ever found yourself putting over 9000 backslashes in a command line? 
how can i empower an editor to have markdown functionalities WITHOUT reserving any punctuation? 


a very not human readable idea: we write using only odd string positions and we fill the even positions with _. a ‚ò≠ in a even position functions as delimiter (like a double quote) for the beginning of a new formatting mode declaration, which ends when the same mode is declared again by the same pattern (kind of XML tags). 
example:

hello-*world*

... becomes... 

-h-e-l-l-o--‚ò≠i‚ò≠t‚ò≠a‚ò≠l‚ò≠i‚ò≠c-w-o-r-l-d‚ò≠i‚ò≠t‚ò≠a‚ò≠l‚ò≠i‚ò≠c

it's like a way to attach metadata to a file where needed without reserving escape sequences/characters. 

an even less human readable would be to put two space delimited numbers ahead of each string. the first would be the length of the description of the current format mode, the second would be a counter of words before the next format mode change. 
example:

19 17 one two three ... ok nineteen? one two ... club seventeen 

19 53 1 2 3 ... 19 1 ... 53

i don't even know how to call what i'm attempting to so, and surely i don't want to resort writing with lambda calculus like combinators for the sake of minimality.

kbspv8,Why has software development taken such a shitty direction in recent years?,"I used to write software. Some of the shit I wrote was rather complex too. Grabbing RAM from console emulators to compare, hex edit, and make gameshark codes back in the day, etc. Wrote a MIPS assembler/disassembler too. Did a little save editing in the 360 era but hated trying to crack checksums. I even used a library someone made to adapt my gameshark tool to straight up PS2 hacking via the broadband adapter. Everything I wrote, I did with ANSI C and Win32 API calls. Not totally platform independent, but not riddled with dependencies like shit is now. All my programs ran on any version of windows without needing any bullshit extra frameworks, libraries etc as well as running under Wine on linux.

Honestly, software nowadays is written by lazy assholes who can't really code. Everything is dependencies on top of dependencies, and it's ridiculous. Nothing is a self-contained app anymore on Windows or linux. Every time I need to install a new app, I'm stuck figuring out how to install something else it depends on in linux or updating some bullshit framework on Windows. It's disgusting. I'd probably still be running Ubuntu 10.04 if Chrome and FF browsers weren't all cunty about dependencies and were compiled as compeltely self-contained apps like they should be. I still remember when Firefox was new and it was like 6MB. That's how far back I go. I started with Windows 3.1 and DOS. Win 2K/XP were my bread and butter, and many others refused to give them up. I made peace with Win7, but I've mostly been running linux the past 10 years. Refuse to run Win10.

An example for you, I downloaded the linux (debian) version of a relatively simple app called SaveWizard yesterday. Naturally, it wouldn't install because of bullshit unmet dependencies. It wanted some shit called ""mono-complete."" WTF is that??? So I try apt-get install the shit, but that's not good enough. It says it needs a newer version, so I have to Google the fucking thing to find out how to add the official repository, then install it. Then I can finally install the app I wanted. If they didn't code like assholes, the Windows version would run in Wine like the software I used to write.

Direct X is just as bad for PC games. They don't just require DX10 or DX12. No, each game requires a very specific set of DLLs. You always find yourself missing like a DX10 DLL from March 2012 etc. For fuck sake. OpenGL never seemed that ridiculous, but everyone insists on using DX.

Unfortunately to do so i need a Mac (i know about Xamarin, but i can't get it to work on my laptop, and i will still need a mac at some stage anyways)

I've been contemplating on selling my old laptop and buying one of the new Macbook pro's. I would dual boot it to run Windows 10 aswell as OSX.

Would this be a good / or bad idea from a developers point of view, and if so why?",2017-08-14 08:36:04

4o3fq7,My goal is to work at Google next year. I'm looking for study partners for interview prep.,"I find that study partners help me to maintain a better study schedule and have more fun. 

I recently completed a BSc in CS. I will begin a MSc program in September in Bay Area. I have 2 months of free time now that I will be dedicating to interview prep (+30hrs/week). My goal is to be an intern at Big N next summer.  My IRL friends from CS department don't share a similar goal which is why I'm here. I'm mostly free all day and I can probably arrange my schedule according to yours. 

I'm looking for one or more of the followings: Brainstorming, improving thought process, competing with each other, helping each other memorise/learn/troubleshoot things, mock interviews at pramp. I'm open to suggestions. I'd like this partnership to include some friendship as I believe it is important to have more fun and also to maintain a sense of duty to help each other.

n7g68z,"Suppose that P = NP, and that I have a constructive proof","What to do now? Say for example that I even managed to apply it to the 3SAT problem, so that it could essentially be solved in O(n), aka in polynomial time, what is the next step?

I understand that logically it would be to write a paper and publish it, but here comes several of my problems, where they mainly start off this that I to some extent just don't want it completely out there, just for anyone and everyone to be able to see the proof, since if I understand correctly, this may turn this discovery from a helpful one to a hurtful one.

I am sure you of all people on Reddit would know both sides of the coin, and that we wouldn't be able to reap the benefits of this discovery without unfortunate malicious side products, which is why I am not completely certain that just posting it online would be the best move.

Nevertheless, when I thought about it a bit more I discovered that, don't all discoveries have that same property? That they could all be maliciously exploited? Sure they may not all have the same magnitude, but they still do have it, and what was the result? We still published them, and I believe that its because the benefits out weigh the negatives, and that we only think about it with P vs NP, because the negatives are actually well known, more prone to usage, related to all of us, and will affect almost everyone.

I guess one could say that its simply a major trolley problem, where our issue lies in that both tracks have so many people we can't even see which has more so that we could even take that into consideration. Its not like the numbers make it easier, but if we were to go with the same logic as that, we choose the most beneficial route in saving the most number of people it would help then. You could also say that we shouldn't publish at all, i.e. stop the train, but wouldn't that just delay the train? The train is inevitable if it is the case that P=NP, its just a matter of time before someone could prove it, in result sooner or later we will face the same issue once again.

So kind of like a TLDR summary, if it was that I have a constructive proof that P=NP, applied to the 3SAT problem, how could I publish it in a way that we could benefit the most from it and decrease the number of ways it could maliciously be used?",2021-05-08 03:23:06
cjqt9a,Am I to bad? Real coding?,"HI everyone. 

I have been studying C# for about 2 years now in our equivilent of a high school. Now I am going to go a all programming course fulltime for half a year, with about 15 weeks for internship after that. I have been wondering for a while now what the expextatons are on a Junior developer, since I was top of my class after theese 2 years but still feel like I can do ""REAL"" programming. I feel like my solutions are dirty, I use alot of libriaries instead of doing stuff on my own. I still only know the basics of classes and I feel like I am missing so much when not using them to their full extent. Do i have to be worried? 

And now to my second question, how does a ""real"" project look? I get that all of the code is commented (hopefuly) and that there is more code overall, but how do you learn the style of code, and such. I am also wondering where I can read up on this kind of stuff and how I can code in a more professional style, and then take on larger projects without getting a big spagetthi with meatballs like code.

y0yldw,"First software project as a solo dev will be aimed at companies and universities, is it even possible to obtain customers with little to no reputation?","Had an idea recently that I have been doing market research on before deciding anything serious, and was recently thinking about who I would be marketing the software towards and how to market it. The software I plan to build will be more so aimed at companies and universities (regardless of size) and I am worried that since I am a solo dev, and this is my first project, getting any traction will be tough.

Obviously, no matter what project you start out on, your level of reputation in that field plays a huge role on how successful it is. What I'm worried about is that I'm not marketing towards the individual. If you are creating a game, for example, the average user cares a lot less about your background than if the game is fun or not, but if a company/university is looking at a buying a piece of software, I'd imagine there would be a lot more digging on the credibility of the creator first. I would highly doubt that many, if even any, companies out there would buy a piece of software from a solo dev's first project.

I apologize for being so vague about the project. It may not be a good idea at all, I get that, but I don't know how in depth I want to go online. Regardless, thanks for any and all help, just want to know if I should even pursue a piece of software at this target audience.",2022-10-11 03:36:44

d1sp21,Any advice on getting my head around Python even after doing VERY well in 2 C language classes? After taking and doing very well with the C language I am struggling to see how Python isn't a language for dangerously insane individuals.,"I found C or C# to be intuitive and very easy to use. I received A's in both courses. Frankly, I thought it was easy.

Now, I find myself taking Python as like an intro to programming class because of an issue with the school. 

No big deal.

But now, it's week 3 of the course and I HAVE NO IDEA what's going on.

I could do all sorts of if then loops, query information, we even used access and whatnot to build little databases but Python really seems like a language built for dangerously insane people. 

Clearly joking but what's the deal here? I thought python was supposed to be the basic of the basic. It's not that it seems ""hard"" persay but it just seems like crazy nonsense.

Has this happened to anyone else that have switched languages? 

We are loading stuff into the command line but then still having to manually type mainFn(""string"") to load into it after the program has been started.

I don't get why you wouldnt just prompt for the input. Store the input, then manipulate and print it. 

Is python harder to get your head around for someone you? I can make python do what I want but even the spacing in this language is offputing to me.

I really don't mean to bitch. I'm sure the language ha it's uses.

Would a different compiler help me? We are all just using JES right now.

Anyway, thanks for any advice!",2019-09-09 15:50:10

**Stranger:** Just at the top of my head. It can be shortened.

**You:** 9/10 no indents :P

**Stranger:** If you want to do fizzbuzz over a range, I have a one-liner for you. \[print(fizzbuzz(i)) for i in range(0, 100)\]

**You:** oh

**You:** thats a list comp right

**Stranger:** Yes.

**You:** hm

**You:** do you have a goal in life?

**Stranger:** def fizzbuzz(i):  
if i % 15 == 0:  
return ""fizzbuzz""  
if i % 5 == 0:  
return ""fizz""  
if i % 3 == 0:  
return ""buzz""  
return str(i)

**Stranger:** Oh.

**Stranger:** def fizzbuzz(i):  
if i % 15 == 0:  
return ""fizzbuzz""  
if i % 5 == 0:  
return ""fizz""  
if i % 3 == 0:  
return ""buzz""  
return str(i)

**You:** ok

**You:** right on

**Stranger:** def fizzbuzz(i):  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄif i % 15 == 0:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn ""fizzbuzz""  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄif i % 5 == 0:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn ""fizz""  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄif i % 3 == 0:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn ""buzz""  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn str(i)

**You:** ayyy

**Stranger:** .  
def fizzbuzz(i):  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄif i % 15 == 0:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn ""fizzbuzz""

‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn ""fizz""  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄif i % 3 == 0:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn ""buzz""  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn str(i)

**You:** why return the string at the end?

**Stranger:** Because fizzbuzz returns the number if it's not divisible.

**You:** ah.

**You:** silly me

**Stranger:** If I didn't turn it into a string, it could cause problems with Python's strong typing.

**Stranger:** And it would make it more annoying to add type information. E.g.

**Stranger:** def fizzbuzz(i: int) -> str:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄif i % 15 == 0:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn ""fizzbuzz""  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄif i % 5 == 0:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn ""fizz""  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄif i % 3 == 0:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn ""buzz""  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn str(i)

**Stranger:** As opposed to

**Stranger:** .  
from typing import Union  
def fizzbuzz(i: int) -> Union\[str, int\]:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄif i % 15 == 0:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn ""fizzbuzz""  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄif i % 5 == 0:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn ""fizz""  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄif i % 3 == 0:  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn ""buzz""  
‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄreturn i

**You:** ah. so your first solution was best

**Stranger:** I'm sure it can be code golfed. But that solution is clear and simple.

**Stranger:** With no hidden gotchas from the dynamic typing. Unless of course a non-integer is given.

**Stranger:** But adding type annotations can help with that.

**You:** never heard of type annotations

**Stranger:** Ok.

**Stranger:** Thanks for sharing.

**You:** have you made anything you are proud of?

**Stranger:** No.

**You:** if it wasnt for the sass just then i would think you a computer

**Stranger:** Computers can be sassy. print(""Of course you'd think that."")

**Stranger:** Seems nonsensical.

**You:** fuck

**Stranger:** Maybe you were thinking of the word ""comprise"" instead.

**You:** ...

**You:** how many bananas comprise the peanut jar?

**Stranger:** Probably none, but I don't know what peanut jar you're talking about.

**You:** ok i have decided you are human

**Stranger:** Great!

**You:** because an ai would probably know a definition of compose that fit the sentence

**Stranger:** Pretty sure anyone could work out that was bad English.

**You:** the sentence wokrs

**Stranger:** Nope. If you said ""How many bananas does the peanut jar compose of"" you might have a ponit.

**You:** works.

**You:** hm

**Stranger:** I used to be into chat bots.

**You:** He has an interest!

**Stranger:** There was a really great site that had a bunch of chat bots that you could download and play around with. Some with nice gimmicks (like an alien with its own symbolic language), others more serious in attempt.

**Stranger:** And I also used to be interested in the Turing test competitions. Not sure if they're still ongoing.

**Stranger:** Working out nonsensical test sentences is literally bot writing 101.

**You:** hm

**You:** do people reliably detect when they're speaking with a chat bot?

**Stranger:** Yes.

**Stranger:** It's easy to create a false positive, but false negatives are hard.

**You:** did you attempt to create a false positive earlier?

**Stranger:** Yes. Played you like a fiddle.

**You:** now you seem pretentious

**Stranger:** Ok.

**You:** :)

**You:** do your emotions compel you

**Stranger:** Compel me?

**You:** cause most of your actions?

**Stranger:** I can't believe an AIML bot is still winning the Loebner prize. What a fucking disgrace of a computing niche.

**You:** are you deliberately changing the topic to make it seem again as if you are a machine?

**Stranger:** No.

**Stranger:** I'm just bored of your shitty questions.

**You:** At least I am trying

**You:** what have you asked of me?

**Stranger:** Nothing.

**You:** why is the aiml bot a disgrace

**You:** please share your brilliance with little me

**Stranger:** It's just a bunch of patterns and responses.

**Stranger:** It's not brilliant to know AIML is shit.

**You:** i am expressing my anger at you by implying you think yourself above me

**Stranger:** Ok.

**You:** i think you act mechanical to avoid a more difficult truth

**Stranger:** Meena is probably the most interesting think that's happened to chat bots lately.

**You:** alright then why is that?

**Stranger:** It's using state of the art machine learning.

**Stranger:** Choose a topic.

**You:** from which category?

**Stranger:** Choose a category.

**You:** nature

**Stranger:** Choose a topic.

**You:** birds

**Stranger:** What about birds?

**You:** are geese superior to birds with a lower population?

**Stranger:** I don't care about geese.

**You:** are birds perfect?

**Stranger:** No.

**You:** I am once again doubting your humanity

pkkimd,Is it possible to create a wallet app with not a lot of investment or bank tie up?,"So what I had in mind is that when you create an account and deposit the money. You deposit the money into one common account. Let‚Äôs say the apps name is Bank. 

So person x opens an account and then deposits $10 to bank account. 

Now to the user, they are able to see it as having $10 in their account and they can purchase anything with it. There is shop c who also has an account with us. They currently have a balance of $100 which is again in the Bank account.  

How will the transaction occur? 

Let‚Äôs say person x wants to buy coke for $2 from shop C. He goes to the shop and scans the QR code and says paying $2 from his $10 balance. 

Now since I get a notification saying person X wants to spend the $2 he has which is in the Banks account, I simply show the shop having an increase of $2 in their account. 

Here all the transaction is superficial as it all occurs through the common account they have. 

If the any party wants to withdraw or cash out they can simply transfer it back the same way they deposited. Essentially creating a shared wallet for everyone. 

Is that possible to create or is it way too hard and it‚Äôs better to get payment gateway? Trying to avoid the payment fee they charge. And this seems like a neat simple idea.",2021-09-08 22:16:14

I've been programming since freshman year, passed the AP CS exam with a 4/5, held at least a 95% in all of my computer classes (AP CS, Java II), and spend part of my free time messing with a BeagleBone black, so I'm already familiar (at least, I think I am) with some of the concepts of Computer Science. I enjoy programming, and would be completely fine with working with electronics. The school I'm planning to go to has a pretty decent CS program, but also offer classes in programming and data science. 

This is where my problem is. I don't know if I want to go into CS or programming, and I have no clue as to what exactly data science is. 

If I get a degree in Computer Science, what jobs am I open to? Is Data Science something I can minor in, or just take classes in, and would those classes help me land a job in the future? Should I go into a program that would allow me to get a job with embedded systems (And what degree is that, even)? Networking has interested me as well, so should I become a SysAdmin?

I'm wanting a couple pointers and resources to help guide me to finding what would be best for me. I'm not asking anyone to decide my future education for me. It's just that there's a lot of talk about these topics, but nobody has ever explained to me what any of these pathways lead to.

I work with Ubuntu on my desktop computer and although I don't understand all the inner workings of it, I know how to manage its performance in light of its hardware capabilities. I also know that it will keep performing the same as it does today in a year from now (as long as I keep it secure and updated).

But with my Android phone, or with Windows back in the day, there's always this progressive degradation that carries on until I can't work with it anymore. My Android was responsive and fast when I got it. Now if I make a typo in my google query it takes 10 seconds to fix it because my touch gestures lag all over the place and I end up hitting the wrong button as different context menus pop in and out of the screen 1 second later than they should have. I think ""sure, maybe it's having trouble releasing memory. I better restart it."" But that doesn't help. With Windows, the trick was to do a fresh reinstall of the OS.

But why? What is actually degrading over time? Why is it persistent between reboots? Is this some sort of planned redundancy trick? Or is there some aspect of the hardware/software I'm overlooking? If so, why doesn't my Ubuntu machine progressively degrade in performance to the point that it becomes unusable?",2022-08-13 17:20:49

10rzi43,How do you quickly search databases that are hundreds of millions of records?,"I am new here and so far I've downloaded one database of 100 million records and another database of 200 million records (the recent twitter hack). I thought that exploring these databases would be a good excuse for me to learn MySQL. So far it's been a major headache and I've spent probably at least 20 hours at it and have gotten next to nowhere. I've used ChatGPT to guide me through the process, and it has worked wonders in getting me as far as I've gotten, but I encounter error after error and have troubleshooted at least 50 different problems so far. So at the moment I'm stuck with using a large text viewer, but that will take over an hour to run a single query.

In trying to get the files to load into a MySQL table, the most common problem is with the way the databases are parsed. Whatever delimiter is used in the file always appears somewhere in the data as well. The other common problem is that these files contain weird characters that MySQL can't handle. I've even used python to try to clean the files, but that also sends me down a rabbit hole of error after error after error. 

So before I put a lot more time into this, am I even headed in the right direction? I figured MySQL is a good tool to know and is meant for large databases. But is it not appropriate for databases in the hundreds of millions of records? I want to be able to search a name or e-mail and not wait more than a minute or so for the query to finish (and I know MySQL will allow me to do partitions and other time saving tricks). I don't really have an interest in using these databases in scripting. My main interest is just running simple queries on them. So are there better tools that aren't too difficult to learn or expensive to use?",2023-02-02 20:11:10

nwh3db,Why am I so bad at programming?,"Hi!

I started programming around last year, and I feel like I am going nowhere. 

I started with python, and thought I was going somewhere as I made some basic projects (link to GitHub below), but then I kept getting these moments of self doubt mixed in with some ‚Äúprogramming highs‚Äù. 

I then took a break around 3-5 months ago because I had school, and then started as soon as school ended. I decided to learn web development, as I had picked up an interest in that, so I learned flask (python web micro framework). I thought it was going good. I made some apps after completing the flask mega tutorial, but then had some a moments of self doubt as I looked at other apps made by other people and wondered why I couldn‚Äôt do what they were doing. 

I felt like I had achieved nothing, as I had little to show for my progress. I then realized that I had to break up flask into parts (database, server, forms, etc) but I still felt like I didn‚Äôt learn anything. I read the sqlalchemy documentation and tried applying it with flask sqlalchemy, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out many to many relationships. So I decided to enlist some help from online, and looked at other examples, but after basically stealing the many to many schema from the documentation and modifying it to make a followers-following database, I felt like a cheat.

My question is, I have a windows 10 laptop. I want to change it over so that I can use longer file paths instead of naming all my nested folders ""1. aa 2. ab"" or ""000001 000002"" with a .txt or spreadsheet at the bottom that explains what each one is) 

I also have a number of external hard drives, some bought in the last 3 years, others are 10-15 years old and used infrequently and so have lasted. I also have an desktop which I still use sometimes which I think may still be on windows 7.

Do I create any compatibility issues by making life easier using longer file paths? Does a HD alone 'care' or does it depend on the system of the thing it's plugged into? If I plug an external HD into an older device or a phone for example, what does it do with the longer file names?

cjico0,Can you learn computer science from scratch?!,"Hello all,

I'm having a early life crisis lol. I don't want to get stuck in my current workplace forever (grocery store customer service management) but i have no other experience and I have no college experience. I've been really thinking about going to college to get a degree which should help me out in finding another job. One problem though, is that I'm not so sure what I want to do...Sooo, I've never really had any interest in computers, how they're made, how to program them ect...they were just..there. But in doing research I've found that Computer Science would be a good choice to go to school for. Tons of jobs and high paying. My boyfriend works in this field and suggested that I take a few Code Academy classes to see if I'd be interested in it. I chose the web development path on Code Academy, I'm not very far into it but so far it seems fun and interesting and I can understand it well enough. I know there are 2 year degrees for web development but I also know a 4 year degree in computer science can get me into web dev and plenty of other things. Soooo, going back to me not knowing anything behind the scenes about computers and previously being pretty indifferent to them my main question boils down to this: Can anyone learn computer science from scratch or do most people in that field grow up loving computers, taking them apart at young ages, coding in middle school, ect. I'd imagine that the classes teach you everything as if you've never gone beyond searching the web but I'm not so sure. Is that the case? Would I be ok going to school for computer science as long as I'm dedicated, pay attention and take notes? I hope I've worded this well enough.",2019-07-29 22:14:49

Hi everyone. (Warning: I am not english,my mother language is hungarian) For CSS practice i randomly chose a tumblr blog and attemped to mimic its look without the actual tumblr functionality,just to see how am i going with my knowledge. Its not mine or not my friend's,i don't even understand what language is it written,just to make sure its not a trickery for getting views. Here's the blog: http:// jojokillah. tumblr. com/ .I inspected the source code of the page,and it was obvious from the start   that there's a header image,below that headings (1 and 3).  The body has a background with an image,then another div with a black coloured background and a thick gray border and paragraphs inside of it ending with an unordered list with custom bulletpoints.  I made the style and the more easy stuff like fonts and colors but i totally got clueless about how to force all blog posts in two thin columns with a space between them and spaces on the sides. Im not even sure if this project makes any sense without functionality,because i don't even understand the most of the source code.  I get that the black area is a section.The two rows are divs with some random id from numbers.The class is called ""post text masonry brick"".I guess the id is calculated by some background automatism.The positions of these 'masonry bricks' (i have no idea what that means) are all absolute and none of them has the same position properties,so i see no point in manually add posts and chance their position accordingly to the original page if i don't understand the concept of whats going on.  I put some code here :  {CODE} <section id=""blog"" class=""clearfix masonry"" style=""position: relative; height: 12943px;"">  			 				<div class=""post text masonry-brick"" id=""178085184539"" style=""position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px;""> 					<h2><a href=""[http://jojokillah.tumblr.com/post/178085184539/ennek-soha-sem-lesz-v](http://jojokillah.tumblr.com/post/178085184539/ennek-soha-sem-lesz-v)√©ge"">Ennek soha sem lesz v√©ge?</a></h2> 					<p>Lorem ipsum.....<br></p>

9qvlxe,Is there an app for it? (Kiosk app?),"Here is what I'm trying to do. Any direction would be greatly appreciated:   
    
I'm working on opening a brick and mortar store. This brick and mortar store also has an online store. Instead of having my brands and products displayed behind a glass showcase, they will be hidden from plain site.   
    
There will be 8 work stations with different types of products. Instead of having the products present, there will be an Ipad at each station.     
    
The website for the store will have real reviews of each product, prices, etc. Let's say I have 24 brands with 3 on each Ipad.   
    
The customer walks up to the station that is labeled (so the customer knows what station to go to) and can research every brand at each work station.   
    
I was thinking that maybe......the Ipads use an app that only allows the Ipad to go to certain urls on the website.     
    
The Ipad will need to display a set of buttons that makes navigation easy. And it needs a button ‚ÄúHome‚Äù that can be activated after each person is done with the station, or pressed to start a new session.   
    
I'm not sure how good I explained it so I will use a shoe store as an example.   
    
Lets say I am opening a shoe store (for ease of explanation).   
    
This shoe store has a website where there are real user reviews. One station is labeled ‚ÄúBasketball shoes‚Äù. One is labeled ‚ÄúHiking shoes‚Äù, and so on.   
    
A person walks up to the Ipad at the station labeled ‚ÄúBasketball shoes‚Äù and has a ‚ÄúHome‚Äù screen that has 4 options (Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Under Armour). They click on ‚ÄúNike‚Äù and are shown all the shoes that Nike offers for basketball (with real reviews). This way they can find real user reviews, prices, etc.   
    
I will also have 3 Ipads that contain all the brands for people that want to browse many brands/styles at one. This also doubles as a resource for my employees to help out customers.   
  

It would be cool if the customer could swipe a club card and leave reviews as well. If there is a swiper at each station then the customer could even check out at each station and pick up their purchase at the front counter.   
  

I'm guessing I'm not the first person to think of this idea so I'm guessing there is already some sort of software that does these simple tasks without the need for hiring programmers.

5nv0x0,Need help with a Web and Internet Programming assignment.,"A little backstory, I was worried about my GPA for scholarship reasons and heard the professor teaching this online course was not great at his job, but was an easy grader. I figured since I needed the GPA insurance and I have always wanted to get into programming of any type, why not take it? It's only a three week class anyway (online Winterm).

Last week we learned HTML, and I found it quite easy. Now we're working with PHP and his PowerPoints aren't  nearly as helpful as they were with HTML. Anyway, to the assignment.

We were supposed to use an earlier assignment that consisted of a form that submitted your address and switch the action to a new PHP file. We were then supposed to get the information using the $_GET array and print it off. Here's where I'm stuck. I already don't understand PHP, so that doesn't help, plus, I've never been great at programming in general, which makes it even worse. I've tried finding information on the class page and I can't find anything, I've tried looking up information and I can't find anything.

Here's the kicker...
It's due tonight at 11:59.

ANY help is GREATLY appreciated, thank you!",2017-01-14 02:27:44

I want a good high paying career, but everyday computer science seems to be less niche and more main stream. Would be hard to make the big bucks  if everyone and their dog is trying to get a job in the field. Not to mention how billions of other people all over the world have access to the same information we do. Everyday there is more competition. I'm thinking long term, salaries might not stay high. I constantly think about paths to be successful and stay relatively niche or valuable in order to get the best job. For example, if there were very few people that could run a cash register, stores would pay good money to someone who could, but if everyone can run a cash register, they are practically worthless. Sometimes I look at hardware engineering because that seems to be more niche and harder to drown the industry. I also think about getting into data science. What do you guys think is a good career path with this in mind?

I know this is kind of a pessimistic view, but I think it has happened to most industries and I'm worried about the long term life span of the job treatment and salaries.",2022-08-04 02:34:37

1212off,Bypass school's proxy,"Hi tech savvy people. I'm a 20 yo dude studying in an engineering school. This semester we had the chance to choose 2 of our courses (which might not sound like a lot of choice for people studying in other countries i reckon) and i happened to choose a general course on network architecture models.
Be aware that no prior knowledge was required to take that course, so we're learning the basics: what's an ip adress, what's dns, how does a client and a sever communicate etc

So, I missed some classes and kinda lost track on the given project which was to code (in C) a client and server that would act as a chat. Instead of listening to the teacher, I started messing around with the schools pc, an old piece of tech powered by intel pentium 4 and running openSUSE 15.0. As i tried to download minecraft (yeah told you i wasnt listening) I got an error: no route to host 192.168.0.254 port 3128. That's when the fun all started.

I didn't know what that meant so I asked chatgpt and ended up spending the entire day learning and trying to find a way to download that game. I learned about dns, firewalls, yast, and so many useful commands on bash like ""vim"" or ""cat"". I actually learned way more in a day than in the last 2 weeks of this course.

Here's what I found out: that no route to host error is actually the proxy server. This was sensed by chatgpt, port 3128 being usually used for proxy servers, and when i ran the command line ""sudo yast2 proxy"", the http proxy adress was indeed the one from the no route to host error.

One question that I still have in mind is how on earth is it possible for system administrators to set a pc to access the internet and look for almost anything on google, BUT at the same time make it virtually impossible to download ANYTHING on that same pc, and I mean anything. No command update in the terminal, no photo video or game, wherever it comes from you'll get the same no route to host error from the same server.

So at the end of the day I managed to change the proxy to one i found on a proxy list on the internet. There might be some wild security concerns in doing that, but let's just hope nothing bad happened. The thing is, even though i dont get that no route to host error anymore, i now get a ""timeout error"" everytime i try to download something. Any solution to stymie this issue ?",2023-03-24 23:23:27

Around 2006 we entered an era where dual core CPU took over as the most common CPU type of PCs. Dual CPU systems had existed for a long time before that, but they weren't mainstream.

Currently we are in a stage where dual core is still the de facto standard, but quad core has acquired reasonable amount of foothold. Most of the quad core are found both in high-end systems (engineering, servers, gaming), and in the low-end systems (for example the Intel Atoms and Pentium N4200). The medium-grade systems are typically dual core. If you today go into an electronics store and just request a basic laptop or desktop, you will likely walk out with a dual core.

Will we at some point enter an era where dual core becomes as rare as single core today, and quad core becomes the new baseline?",2018-06-25 11:34:20

We play strategy games together age of empires, civ 6, and stellaris, and talk trash and talk about politics which we disagree with heavily and about tech and stuff. 

He told me computer science career, yeah well they pay next to nothing.

Things like chatgpt will do the job of a computer programmer in 5 years. They'll be 100% replaced.

I do have a small programming background mostly in robotics (FANUC) to be specific. And PLCs. 

I've also written some stuff in python but I'm not a wizard with code or anything.

Am I going to actually take the cert tests? Idk. But I do study the curriculum just cause I love computers. 

Also I'm into industrial controls and stuff, which a lot of PLCs are networked and stuff so this knowledge can be used for my current manufacturing job. 

Well I also just want to become a good computer programmer, I started doing the odin project and getting into building websites. I think it's fun to do this stuff. 

Well after hearing what he said, idk. What if I'm just wasting my time? 

I've used chatgpt though and like, dude it got into an argument with me over how to calculate percentages. It kept giving me the wrong answer and I knew it was wrong. It eventually noticed its mistake and corrected itself. But something that can make a mistake calculating a percentage of a wage increase (that's literally what it was lol) should not be trusted with writing clean code. 

But it's a beta, it'll eventually just replace every programmer on earth. 

Then I argued if it can do that, it could replace any job then. 

Idk, according to the bureau of labor statistics, web developers will be increasing by 23% in the next 10 years. That's faster than average and I've looked at tons of jobs. 

Cyber security is seeing a big increase as well, tech jobs in general.

10okrje,Need a small advice about programming?,"HI,

&#x200B;

I have a question to ask but before that I want to give little bit of context about my self. I am an average guy. I have done my major in computer science. I didn't have passion for anything. I start coding in my clg. during that time I spend lot of time in internet and surf the internet all day long. I start understanding the things about computers.

During those time I hoped on lot of things and try to learn my things but never completed one. For example I learn python, C, C++, spend some time with flutter and play little with android. Mean to say I try to introduced my self each and everything present out there. So you can say I have decent understanding about some things that are related to programming and stuff. 

I don't know its a quality or not but I consider it as a quality that I can look things and try to came up with a solution of the problems in front of me with knowledge and skill I am having. For instance, i recently joined as a technical support in a company. My daily job is to look the incidents and try to troubleshoot them, if they are not solvable by then pass to developers, sending report to the customer etc. Its more like a non-tech kind of role. So, I know basic python and bash script. So there is one report which we have to send every month to our customers. So what I did I wrote a script and which automatically send that report on 1st of every month to our customers.  This kind of small stuff I was talking about.

Parallelly I indulge my self in a training which teaches Linux, docker, k8S, etc. which is going good. I am referring and reading lot of books related to the domain.  Also write blog or small tutorial on the concepts which I am learning. So for learning wise i can say everything is going good.  

But as I reading and learning  stuff there are ideas start following in my mind for example like one time I was reading something about load balances. And I want to implement a small piece of idea which something like this "" suppose we have 3 server which are connected to a load balancer, now we send a request to those servers along with a dictionary of username corresponding to those three server for example {server-A:""1234"", server-B: ""ewfa"", server-C:""wehfiwh""} . Now what I was thinking when load balance get this request and decide which server among servers A,B,C it will send the request then along with request that variable which came as null earlier got populated with corresponding server name"".  This is a small piece of idea and i don't worry if it is a relevant or not but I just want to ""CODE IT"". But I couldn't.

I am here to ask a simple thing if it is possible what ever idea no matter how big or small it is but I am able to code it and implement that idea using code. I know somethings may be technology specific like if there is a small mobile app i want to make then I have to learn some specific tool but I am asking in general how and what should I learn to able implement with code what ever going in my head?",2023-01-29 22:31:22

s4hmct,"inode based file system, What is the maximum size of a file in the file system"," 

Hey I started studing Computer science and in one script stuck at this questions

could someone explain how to tackle this?

&#x200B;

1.What is the maximum size of a file that could be handled by single indirect and double indirect?

Block size is 2K

Address size is 4 Bytes

12 slots for direct disk blocks

One slot each for single indirect and double indirect.

\_

2. What is the maximum size of a file that could be handled by single indirect and double indirect?

Block size is 4096 bytes can contain 1024 block references.

12 slots for direct disk blocks

One slot each for single indirect and double indirect.

my try:

Block size is 2K = 2\*\*11

Address size is 4 Bytes = 2\*\*2

in one block are (2\*\*11/2\*\*2)= 2\*\*9 pointers

12 slots for direct disk blocks

One slot each for single indirect = 2\*\*9

and double indirect. = 2\*\*18

Maximum file size

( 12 + 2\*\*9 + 2\*\*18 ) \* 2\*\*11 = 2\*\*29 \~ 536 MB

\_

2.

Block size is 4096 bytes can contain 1024 block references

12 slots for direct disk blocks

One slot each for single indirect = 1024 = 2\*\*10

and double indirect. = 1024\*\*2 = 2\*\*20

Maximum file size

( 12 + 2\*\*10 + 2\*\*20 ) \* 2\*\*12 = 2\*\*32

( 12 + 1024 + 1024\*\*2 ) \* 4096 = \~ 4GB

This is just a ""fun"" problem, it's not for ""homework"" because I'm not taking any classes. 

&#x200B;

**True randomness is being used in the algorithm.** 

&#x200B;

* U is a universe of natural numbers from 1 to X in ascending order.  (eg. |U| = 3k, where k = len(U)//3. ) 
* `N =  (6^(-k) (3*k)!)/(k!)`  possible exact-3-covers from `(3k choose 3) 3-lists` 

&#x200B;

This algorithm creates exact-3-covers by shuffling the list and then dividing it into lists-of-3.

While Loop Algorithm

1. Randomly shuffle |U|= 3k.  
2. Divide |U| into lists of 3.
3. Sort the values in the new 3-lists in ascending order. 
4. For each 3-list,  sort them in ascending order based on indice  `cover[m][0]`. (eg. `sorted(cover, key=lambda parameter: parameter[0])` )
5. Halt when all possible N solutions have been found. (Appended to a new-list, when list reaches the length of N the algorithm halts)

&#x200B;

You don't know when the algorithm will halt in a while loop, because of the randomness.

Is it really undecidable for knowing when my algorithm will halt?",2021-06-08 22:13:59

mkdp7m,How is the proof for the Halting Problem being unsolvable valid? (Explanation below),"Hi, so I have been reading on the halting problem and how it is impossible to solve.

[https://youtu.be/macM\_MtS\_w4?t=233](https://youtu.be/macM_MtS_w4?t=233)

In this video, and in many web pages I have read they give this scenario

There is some program H which takes inputs P (Some arbitrary program) and I (Some arbitrary input of P)  and returns True if P will eventually end with given input I, and false when it loops forever.

Now we have another program H+  which goes like this:

If H(P,I) is true, loop

If H(P,I) is false, end 

Now, we do H+(H+,H+)

And there is a logical contradiction here,   because if H+ halts on input H+,  then H+ loops forever

If H+ loops on input H+, then H+ halts. Therefore it is a logical contradiction.

My issue with the proof is this

The H+ program inside the H+ bracket is different than the H+ before the brackets. I will look at the function again.

H+(H+,H+)

You have the 1 outer H+ and the 2 inner H+. The inner H+ that is the program takes **one set of inputs** whilst the outer H+ takes **2 sets of inputs** , that being the 2 H+, hence it can't be a logical contradiction when the 2 H+'s have different inputs. 

And it doesn't even make sense anyways, setting P= H+  and I= H+ doesn't even make sense because H+ is supposed to have 2 inputs not 1.",2021-04-05 05:42:52

I'm stuck between my 'safe choice' accounting, which I think I have the brain power to achieve or what I think I will enjoy doing, which is Web development.
I've started taking some Codecademy courses, but I started with the Javascript path first. This is where I start to doubt myself and whether I have the brain for this or not. Now, I have no prior experience with coding, computers or anything like that. I'm doing this Javascript path to see if I have what it takes. Often, I get pretty stuck and have to look at the hints or ask my boyfriend for help...like often.

I think I grasp the general concept of things, but I find myself wondering if I have what it takes. I'm about halfway through the course but I still don't know if I could make something from scratch on my own. Sometimes I forget how to make functions or the correct syntax for like...everything.

lq0n9a,Is 32gb of RAM a good investment?,"Hello everybody,

I am not asking for laptop recommendation, but my MacBookPro (late 2013 model) battery just died and I decided it is about time to maybe upgrade (I will be getting the laptop fixed though because it will still be a great back up laptop). Anyways, this has me thinking about RAM and the memory requirements of the future.

As many of you know, we try our best to use a little memory as possible, but it seems as time goes on applications just want more and more of it. When I got my laptop over 7 years ago, they recommended 4gb of RAM and stated I wouldn't need more than that. I ended up getting 8gb and hot damn that was good choice. Today, 8gb is recommend as the bare minimum with 16gb being the safe bet.

Yes, I do know that some can do with 4gb, but that ain't me and never will be. I got vscode, slack, email , MSword  and 30 chrome tabs open ya feel me?

Anyways, my new laptop or desktop will probably be with me for another 7+ years. Looking at how memory consumption has increased, does anyone here think 16gb will be able to handle the memory requirements for various open applications in 2028-2030? I am thinking it will be fine, but by then it may be the recommended bare minimum. Then I question if 32gb a good investment? What is everyone's thoughts on the future of RAM?",2021-02-22 21:35:36

Some possibilities I can think of is by using other software, like a browser, to phone home and send information on their behalf (since it'd be whitelisted in most firewalls), or by using one of the Windows default services, like BITS.",2021-01-18 14:37:52

For this operation to work I need a way to read the data that the controller sends to the console in real time (within 1 second) and without introducing input delay to the console's normal operation.

My first thought was Bluetooth; the controller would send its data to the console for normal operation while a copy is sent to a 3rd party device. However to my understanding, Bluetooth doesn't support 2 Master devices.

Any ideas or advice would be appreciated.

kbiszv,Calling all Basketball Fans! Time to digest the NBA using analytics and programming!,"Hey guys,

Been learning tons of programming recently and thought as we head into the NBA season I would do something about each of the games played and how players played that night. I plan to use basic charts/graphs with R in order to show different stats and why a team won a game or why a player ended up having a great night! Whether it be +/- or TS% or literally any stat that can be found after a game, I think we all could really use this information for all our talking points instead of just talking with our emotions. Anyway, I know the analytics world is starting to really take a rise, but I want to take it slow and make everything more simple instead of complex. Many analysts try to find the complex route to get answers but when it comes to basketball, the stats and data really and simply show the flow and pattern of the game. Should be a fun ride!

I will be posting all of this daily on Twitter. The link will be below and a follow would be really appreciated!! DM me with any questions or recommendations as well!

aqayst,Minor in Computer Science is it worth it?,"Hello, I am currently a Sophomore at my university studying BIS (Business Information Systems). I'm currently taking classes in HTML/PHP, Python, and C. These have been the most entertaining classes I've taken in my entire educational career. I still enjoy however, taking business courses still want to get that degree. However, with advising coming up I was wondering if getting a minor in Computer Science is worth it for me. 

> A minor in computer science consists of Introduction to Computer Programming (CSE 1284), Intermediate Computer Programming (CSE 1384), Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms (CSE 2383), Discrete Structures (CSE 2813), and nine hours of approved Computer Science courses. 

I've taken CSE 1284 so far planing on taking CSE 2813. I've already cause with my major I need to take up to 9 hours of CSE. I'm just unsure if its worth it given my major is kind of in the computer science world, but its not that much coding which I do enjoy. Thanks in advance for the help!

apgh6z,an iOS app project as a beginner.," Greetings

*( essentially, the main question is below in* ***bold****)*

&#x200B;

I do hope I chose the right subreddit for my post.

&#x200B;

I have started studying computer science on my own. Studying CS50 on [edx.org](https://edx.org) and I am currently on Week 2. I do follow the lectures and whatever. I do more research than probably is required, ( I guess! I don't know!) I study the concepts presented in the lectures in more detail, for example sorting algorithms... I try to implement them in C and play around and see what each does.

&#x200B;

But that doesn't matter. What matters is that... I want to start a project, and I believe that starting doing something is a great opportunity to learn by doing. That is actually what I've been doing all my life! Learning by doing, learning by trial and error. Heck, I even learned English this way. Tried to learn how to drive a motorcycle this way, now I have a titanium plate in my leg.

&#x200B;

So my idea for a project is to create something of a simulation of a typewriting machine for iPad, like a notepad, but more old-school looking with a feel to it. I do not care if such a thing already exists or it has any monetary value or potential. I just want to do it.

&#x200B;

You ask me why do I bother asking for guidance? Well, it is a little tricky, as I do not own any Apple products apart from my beaten down iPhone 6s. **How do I write an app for an Ipad? As I know you need to have access to a Mac in order to test and compile your code. Is there a way around this?**

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading and thank you for any tips.

ap9aqn,How can I become a good software engineer in 6 months?,"Hello everyone,  


I really need your help. At the moment I'm studying mathematics and although I'm in my fourth year now I have little to show for. To be honest, I somehow managed to pass my first exams in calculus 1 and linear algebra 1 and my logical thinking got quite good through the math practice I had, but in these first three years I didn't really take it seriously and failed a lot of tests.  I only passed the tests from my first semester and that's about it. (After the third time I took these courses).  


So now in my fourth year I finally managed to build up a good work ethic throughout this year and while this is definitely a plus I really don't know how to go on now. Now I would have to cram all the stuff I didn't learn in the last year(yep I still learn the stuff from the first year) into 1-2months and I'm quite sure that, even though I work about 10-12h per day, I won't make it.  


I don't want to quit maths, because it's actually super cool and if I learn and take it seriously like I do now, I actually don't have too many problems with it. It's just that I'm 23 and I started studying at 19 so I feel super old and sad about all that time ""lost"".  


Sorry about all that, I needed to tell somebody and almost cried earlier about this stupid situation.   
Here is my actual question:  


I could start again with mathematics in october 2019, which would result in me actually getting this right. But I need a way to make good money while doing something that will benefit my career and which fits with mathematics so I turned my eyes to programming. The reason I want this is because I don't want my mom to be paying my bills and my studies any longer, because without my stupidness and laziness she would not have to pay anything anymore.

Also I actually like programming and computer science.  


So now I have about 6-7 months to become self sufficient and a good software engineer and I'm willing to put in 80 - 100 hour work weeks and a lot of rejection and frustration to make this work.  


How can I become a good software engineer and how can I test myself (like exercises etc.) to become really good?   


I think data science and machine learning would fit pretty good with mathematics, but I don't really know as I have no experience with this stuff.  


Thank you for reading(:  


PS: I do have some experience in python, but not a lot.  


TLDR: How can you become a good/great software engineer in 6-7months?

I'm really excited to learn, and I'm excited to dive into this, but I have no idea where to start and how in over my head I am.  Anyone with a bit of experience able to give some advice or chat a bit?

1.The Blip Blob New Year celebration started on a Tuesday. Prompt the user for how many days have passed since their celebration start day and display the name of the current day. For example, if 2 days have passed, then you should display Thursday to the user.



For example:

Input	Result
2	Thursday
4	Saturday
6	Monday
7	Tuesday
8	Wednesday

2. Write a program that asks the user for a year between 1800 and 2018 and displays to the user the message ""Leap Year"" or ""Not Leap Year"" based on their input.  You may assume that the user will only enter valid years. 

Note: To determine if a year is a leap year, it must be divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is divisible by 400.


For example:

Input	Result
1800	Not Leap Year

rzymqn,Are FAANG/Big Tech Interviews fair??? Thoughts?,"I‚Äôve been in the industry for 3 years as a software engineer now (although I‚Äôm still technically in school for my MS).. and I‚Äôve never seen the market so hot in terms of hiring for CS students /Software Engineers . I, as well as my friends, had so many recruiters reaching out to us for interviews - and many of them FAANG/Big Tech companies. So I figured I didn‚Äôt have anything to lose when I decided to do 10 interviews over the span of 6 months. It was a whirlwind, but man, it was a struggle to remember all of those Data Structure/Algorithm fundamentals without LeetCode + AlgoExpert.

I had interviews at Meta, Google, Reddit, Microsoft, Amazon, and LinkedIn. And it was SUCH a mixed bag. Honestly, i used to think you had to be a genius at getting into these companies (and you obviously have to have some sort of willpower/intelligence), but after this process, It‚Äôs definitely all about preparation and reacting to failure. They expect you to try 2,3,4 .. even 5 times before actually getting in. By the time I got to my tenth interview (MSFT), which I ended up getting an offer (yay!), I had essentially failed my way to the top. My mock interviews had just been REAL interviews‚Ä¶ bumbling through speaking out loud, preparing for certain concepts (easy/medium/hard) by difficulty months in advance, doing practice ‚Äútests‚Äù, practicing my elevator speech etc. they‚Äôre testing you on literally how far you‚Äôre willing to go in order to get the role. Anyways, I‚Äôm curious about other people‚Äôs experiences interviewing with FAANG/Big Tech companies - What are your thoughts on this process? Is it fair to expect people who have already been working in the industry to be subjected to DS/Algo type questions?

I‚Äôve also documented a lot of my experiences with this on YouTube - hopefully this will help clarify the process for anyone that‚Äôs just starting out  ([my YouTube channel](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCYQvAPEWa3ibT0_FcjqYa8g)",2022-01-09 18:58:30

ggjnfd,Why is the internet so slow on computers that are just a few years old?,"Let me give an example of what I mean. Back in 2014 I had a friend in college who had a Samsung Ativ 500t. It was a Windows 8 tablet/laptop hybrid with an S-pen. I was able to play with it back then and it seemed to run fine. It obviously wasn't a powerhouse with it's intel atom processor and 2gb of ram but it could go online, play Youtube and Netflix just fine, load heavy websites like The Verge and CNN with no problem. It was a capable computer for basic tasks. Then in late 2019 I saw that exact same computer on ebay for about $30. I figured I could use it as a basic laptop for watching videos in bed or  for browsing the internet on my couch. But when I tried to do that, the internet ran so slowly that it was unusable. No matter which browser I installed, I could barely get any websites to load and when they would, it would take a minute or more. I also tried swapping out the version of Windows. Windows 8 was slow, Windows 8.1 was slow, and Windows 10 was unusable. No matter what I tried, the computer could barely handle internet browsing or syncing email or really anything that required any online component. 

And if you go on youtube and watch videos of people trying old tech right now, like old iPads or smart phones, ones from fairly recent years like 2014 or 2015 barely work for basic online tasks now. My question is why? Why was something like the Ativ 500t perfectly functional 5 years ago for internet use but today it barely works today? How much has the internet and websites changes in just a few years to the point where a $700 laptop or tablet from 6 or 7 years ago is about as useful as a doorstop in 2020?",2020-05-09 17:29:49

4fcxfp,[A Levels Cambridge Computer Science] Bit Streaming,"Media Server -> Data Flow -> Low watermark [Buffer] High water mark -> Data flow -> Media player
  
(with the control data going back to media server at the start).
  
I can post a picture of this if this looks confusing.
  
Anyways, this isnt part of the question, just posted for understandings sake.
  
---
  
Consider a bit streaming scenario for a video where the following values apply:
  
The buffer size is 1 MiB
  
The low watermark is set at 100KiB
  
The high watermark is set at 900KiB
  
The incoming data rate is 1Mbps 
  
The video display rate is 300 Kbps
  
Assume that the video is playing and that the buffer content has dropped to the low-water mark. The media player sets the controls for data input to begin again.
  
Calculate the amount of data that will be input in two seconds to the buffer and the amount of data that will be removed from the buffer in the same period of time.
  
Repeat the calculation for 4,6,8,10,12 seconds.
  
From this data estimate when the buffer will have filled up to the high water mark.
  
Assuming that the incoming transmission is halted at this time, calculate how long it will be before the buffer content has again fallen to the low-water mark level.

I'd also like to get the schematic design of an ALU, one that I made a year ago for class. I'm not too interested in hardware of computing, however, the ALU does consist of my favorite two things: math and cs logic. I've been considering this one for about a year.

The texts (it turns out there were two sent in quick succession) from her were most definitely not intended for me, and to compound my quandry right now, these SMS no longer show up in my Blackberry. My housemate has complained about her phone (which is an iPhone - I think) having strange habits and exhibiting some evidence of tapping or interference. She has often told of her friends remarking on or being startled by such phenomena during conversation or in general but apparently it is nothing debilitating. I cannot recall if she has told of a specific scenario similar to this, as she has many anecdotes. I would ask her myself but the SMS was rather private, regarding a topic that is very sensitive and really only rumour at the moment. I suspect it was to her boyfriend, who has the same given name as me and is also my housemate. There are too many variables and it is *actually* doing my head in.

qso69c,Is it possible to 'look up' without a look up table?,"I don't even know if this is possible but I'm trying to figure out a way to produce a very particular pattern given a number. for trivial cases you might do something like this:

\`\`\`  
table = {  
1: \[0,1,1,1,1,0\],  
2: \[1,1,0,0,0,1\],  
3: \[1,0,0,1,1,1\]}  
chosenPattern = table\[n\]  
\`\`\`  
But I have a situation where there are trillions and trillions and trillions of patterns. they are not in a look up table, but they are ordered, like binary. So I guess my question is if I have some crazy big number like \`n = (10\^36) + 274\` can I derive that particular pattern? Like, how would you derive it for the binary pattern, computationally, what's the algorithm?

I know this question is wonderfully clear, but I'll add edits if you want.

EDIT: people have asked if there is a pattern, what is it. Well it's an ordering, and binary too is an ordering, so it's a lot like that. This is why I am wondering how do you drive a binary representation of a huge number, how do you compute it given some other representation of the number like scientific negation on base 10? 

To be specific about the exact pattern, in question it has to do with a all the possible perfect hash functions. Perfect meaning no collisions. So if you have a hash space with 3 possible outputs A,B,C (and you feed them into the hash function) A>B>C>A or you can have A>C>B>A. For a hash space of 4 nodes there are 6 perfect configurations. I want to order those configurations and then given N produce the right configuration of the hash space on demand. As the space gets larger, the possible configurations gets really large by P=(N-1)!.",2021-11-12 23:48:10

ncii2k,Is python really that much easier than C?,"Hello everyone, I am currently doing cs50x harvard classes. After weeks of solving problem sets in C, python problem sets are basically re-writing the C code to python. 

The thing is, I know and have read that python is much easier than C. I did all the solutions in C by myself, and most of the problems I had were because of missing semicolon or something not algorithm-related. 

Rewriting same solutions in python was VERY challenging for me. I honestly dont know why, it seems like python syntax is so straightforward that I had a hard time implementing it. For example, for loop in both languages seems SO different, I had trouble using it normally.

Is this normal? I thought maybe this is because of a time factor, getting kinda accustomed to C made it hard to switch languages, even if it is much easier. What would you suggest?",2021-05-14 20:43:10

jynx2z,Can't get myself to believe Halting Problem is real,"First let me state my background knowledge going into this. I have read literature on formal logic. Specifically, some of the books from open logic project. forallxyyc, sets, logic and computation. I have also read Book of Proof. I understand what a proof by contradiction is, especially in the case of mathematical proofs given as examples in the Book of Proof involving infinitely many primes and that the sqr\_root(2) is irrational, etc.

I looked up the halting problem from many different sources and can't seem to convince myself that undecidability is proven. The typical proof is given in the form:

&#x200B;

>assume we have a function H(p), produces either true or false  
>  
>I will now prevent H(p) from observably producing true or false by doubling its effort using H\`  
>  
>H\`(H(p))  
>  
>H(p) is impossible

This seems like bullshit to me. A contradiction is when you assume a premise A is either true or false, obviously. You introduce another premise B **that is already proven to be true**. Premise B is an instance of premise A being false. That is, the existence and truth of premise B, excludes the truth of premise A. Given that premise B is indeed proven to be true, assuming premise A to be true is a contradiction.

The above H and H\` predicates are totally made up. H\` is premise B in my example. If H\` is not a nonsensical premise and has been proven to be true, then it could contradict H. But H\`, has not been proven to be true, it may very well be false. It's just introduced into the proof as true by force of will. If I accept the proof for the Halting Problem as it has been presented to me, then I must accept any proof of the form P(x) is false if I can arbitrarily invent a P\`(P(x)).

&#x200B;

>assume you can jump into the air P(x)  
>  
>I will now prevent you from jumping into the air by doubling your effort P\`  
>  
>when you jump into the air, jump into the air P\`(P(x))  
>  
>you can't? therefore you cannot jump into the air

*I never lie; I never tell the truth.* Is not a contradiction. Just nonsense. Prove first you never tell the truth. Then you can introduce it into a proof to show it will contradict the first. **Let me make one thing clear, I do not confidently believe the halting problem is fake news. I know I am wrong somehow. I went through all of this to describe my confusion. So now tell me why I'm wrong.**",2020-11-22 02:33:58

d3fxu3,Solving my variation of Factorization in 2^O(n) time? Is that good?,"&#x200B;

# Introduction

&#x200B;

First of all, this is the INPUT transformation script. This is O(N). I'll get to that one next.

Integer Input- A

`-7`

&#x200B;

>Here, the tallies are bounded by the bit length of each integer above.  
>  
>A simple arithmetic expression does the math for the integers to the **right** of the tallies.  
>  
>Example **Tallies + X = INPUT**  
>  
>**INPUT - TALLIES = X**

Integer Transformation Input B-

`1111 + -11`

Originally, this linked script was used for transforming inputs for Subset-Sum into my variation. But, this time I'm using it for my variation of Integer Factorization.

O(n) time converter. [https://repl.it/repls/BlindDarksalmonDecagon](https://repl.it/repls/BlindDarksalmonDecagon)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Algorithm

I think the algorithm is **2\^O(n).** Because, the script counts the length of the tallies. This should take log time for counting the tallies. While it takes 2\^n time for factoring the sum of the input.

 It takes 2n time for factoring the sum of the input. Counting the tallies takes O(n) time. The idea is that regular factorization would be more exponential compared to its input. While my variation is less exponential because of the tallies.

&#x200B;

    # REMEMBER YOU MUST USE THE O(n) time CONVERTER
    
    
    def getFactors(y):
        # Create an empty list for factors
        factors=[];
    
        # Loop over all factors
        for i in range(1, y + 1):
            if y % i == 0:
                factors.append(i)
    
        # Return the list of factors
        return factors
    
    # Call the function with a given value
    print('OMIT SPACES!!!')
    yy, aa = input('For Y, give input transformation eg. 1111+x ').split(""+"")
    y = len(yy) + int(aa)
    X = int(input('Enter target integer for X: '))
    
    alist=getFactors(y)
    names = alist
    
    
    if names.count(int(X)) > 0:
    
      print(""yes"")
      print(names)
    else:
      print(""no"")

# Question

When only using input transformations from the O(n) converter linked; Is the algorithm **2\^(O(n))** time? There's definitely an O(n) in there for the tallies.

&#x200B;

* Best case is O(n) time by bit-length, if we ignore the use of the converter script. But, I'm only interested in worst-case.
* **Stick to positive transformations, because it doesn't do negative integer factorization.**
* **Is this algorithm asymptotically considered to be more efficient than the general algorithm?**",2019-09-12 22:54:49

afx4c2,Confused CS Freshman,"I am a CS freshman at a good university in my country ""Turkey"". Our universities curriculum is much harder than the other universities for CS.  First semester just finished and the topics we covered seems like much more for a semester.

&#x200B;

I am not new to programming. In highschool i learned some java and made lots of ""noobish"" programs with it, so i was familiar with how basic algorithms works.

&#x200B;

We are using linux for all things.

&#x200B;

We covered ""assembly language"" using a emulator, it's not like a real assembly language but it was good for first 2-3 weeks for understanding algorithms, computer architecture. They made us do a factorial program, string reverser program and some little homeworks like making a division algorithm in assembly. However the assembly we used was something called ""simpsim"", kind of a emulator so it was lacking basic operations like dividing, multiplying. It only had addition operator so all other operation was builded by us, students as homeworks.

&#x200B;

Than we started to learn ""C language"" and it was more than a introduction. We even covered pointers and linkedlists. The final exam was nearly like a C final even though we had a course book there wasnt any questions from book. It was all c questions and some cpu architecture questions.

&#x200B;

We was following the ""Brookshear's computer science introduction"" book for the whole course although it was not followed %100. They taught us all the chapters cursory. We was much focused the programming-algorithm-data.

&#x200B;

In C we also covered file I/O and ""Structs"" and . Some of the homeworks was:

\-Organize a random pile of data (like name, surname, email, id) and made a new organized file especially using pointers with structs

\-Implement all linkedlist features like pop, push, add anywhere...

All the homeworks we used dynamic memory allocation, that was mandatory.

&#x200B;

Right now the hardest thing i made in C is that popular game ""2048"", in console of course.

I also made some other basic things like making a database that contains person structures and can be edited by admin panel and saved locally. (Using all pointers and structs) In console.

TicTacToe (So hard lul)

I implemented all the popular sorting algorithms like, bubble quick merge..

Made my own library for manipulating arrays in C (I tried to optimize as much as i can it works fine) it has some functions likes rotating 2d arrays flipping 2d arrays..

&#x200B;

Even though schools course was hard, the teaching capabilities of professors was not as hard as the course..

&#x200B;

All the things i made this semester is self taught for me. School just asked me (and other students) to do things. It was all homeworks through this semester.

&#x200B;

As expected success rate is very low, only a few can survive.

&#x200B;

So my situation is i feel like university giving me nothing and also feels easy. All the things i learnt this semester feels like self taught. although university is free in Turkey, time is not.

&#x200B;

So i was all confused for CS major as general. It feels like i can learn all of the things by myself. I feel much superior than my colleagues. 

&#x200B;

I was thinking changing my major (even though CS always been my goal) or taking double major.

&#x200B;

Am i getting something wrong, or just my university being ""strangely"" hard?",2019-01-14 15:55:19

2x6rm9,How to deal with discrimination from group-mates?,"I'm actually asking this on the behalf of my girlfriend, because I'm not entirely sure what to do in this situation. This may be more of a general purpose academia problem, but it *is* taking place in a CS department, and CS in particular has a bit of a sexism problem.

She's in an upper-level HCI course, and the two classmates she's been paired with are terrible. She's shown me their emails, and the discourse seems to follow a consistent pattern of shutting her out - they'll dismiss her ideas, as well as her input to their ideas.  This wouldn't be such an issue if her two classmates weren't treating this as a blow-off class, and seem perfectly happy getting a C-.  They aren't willing to meet to discuss their project, but paradoxically they don't trust her to do much work or take her input. 

It's getting pretty ugly, and the professor doesn't seem willing to evaluate her previous work independent of the group, or let her complete the course individually. The idea of staying in class with this group is really weighing on her, since she's had to present their ""work"" to the rest of the class (which her teammates usually slapped together the night before). Before this course had started, she was already talking to a prospective supervisor to do a master's degree in HCI, but this situation has put that in jeopardy.  We're in a department that pays lip service to supporting women and other minorities in computing, so I'm surprised there doesn't seem to be any measures in place to handle situations like these.

I'm not trying to access files that are only accessible through our work systems (those that are stored on our internal servers). Only things that are on the Microsoft Exchange account (my excel documents are stored on Onedrive, assume the same is true about emails).",2022-07-30 10:12:29
pj960t,What will my employability look like in the field of CS with only a masters in CS?," Hey guys,

I'm currently in my final year of at university and have been looking at computer science masters for the past few months and looking at what this would entail and it interests me a lot (as I am doing Biology currently). I've managed to find several universities that would take me for a masters in CS if i do well in this final year, but i was worried about what kind of employability I may be looking at with only a masters in computer science. When compared to someone who may have a degree in CS already I feel as if i couldn't compete with them with only a masters in CS since my degree is in a irrelevant field. Would I struggle finding work in the CS industry?

That may be true, but having a physical robot performing an action in the world is a huge challenge on it's own.

237por,Shouldn't Computer Science be called Software Technology?,"That term seems to make a lot more sense. A science seems much more low level, and more about things we observe. (Although I guess it could be argued that we can observe something we create and study it).

We created computer hardware using science, like physics and chemistry. We create computer software using ANY kind of science. At first it is physically based science combined with statistical and mathematical science to control hardware, but as more layers of abstraction get added you can use any kind of science on there.

It really doesn't seem like a science. Math and Statistics I would argue are like a science because they deal with information phenomena, just like physics deals with physical phenomena. 

Computer science is subject to so much change it seems, unlike other areas of science. Maybe it should be called a science, but it's harder to argue for than the others because it appears to be the most subject to change by whatever technology we develop. It's a higher level of abstraction than the other kinds because it's built upon them. We can change the underlying technologies and sciences and we could create a new science just like that. That sounds similar to neuroscience and biology, which could also change a lot.

I'm a second year student in college CS major (in a shitty country) , I started reflecting about myself and what was going on in the last year and this year of college , and I realized that I didn't learn shit in college , be it because they didn't teach us properly and the things are outdated or I didn't take it seriously because I felt like I'm not gonna use it or it won't help me in a real job .  
but tbh the education system here is pretty f\*cked up especially in my city , so I thought that if I continue like that , I'll be freaking depressed and sad in the end of my 5 years of college , because I didn't learn shit about CS it's just basic things , also we do a lot of theory and not really much practice like doing small projects and shit , but If I decide today to stop giving a f\*ck about college and my grades in college and start learning real CS from zero (ofc from good resources online ) , and follow a specific field that I love ( like app dev with react native or cyber security) , I'll be much happier in the future and content about what I did and who am I.

ukoeuy,"is understanding ""literals"" relevant to Python?","Hi all. I really struggle understanding programming, because there's so much vocabulary, and I get really frustrated with how redundant and contrived some of it seems to me. I'm a smart guy, but I have no patience when someone starts ""speaking"" a programming language to explain a programming concept.

Right now, I'm trying to understand why a string literal, literally the string of characters, is not just called a ""string"". So far, the answers I've found are ""it's Java"" and ""it's the data in the variable"", and it's ""the initialized variable""... Which to me, just sounds like ""it's the string"", ""it's THIS string"" and ""it's irrelevant and I shouldn't have mentioned it""

Is there any actual reason to call something a literal, specifically in the context of python? Or is it just a synonym for the actual string/integer/whatever in question? Is the string literal, literally the string, and if so, who decided that? Does Merriam Webster know about this?",2022-05-07 22:48:29
p2qcu9,Why do developers of utility apps on GitHub seem to think their users are as intelligent and experienced with programming as them?,"Long version of the question:

Why do developers who make extremely useful utility programs and then put a lot of effort into sharing them with the world on GitHub not then follow through with making intuitive and simple download/install/usage instructions for the majority-non-programmers who'll be otherwise clueless about it when trying to install and then use their program?

I've seen this many many times in the last decade of finding little useful applications here and there, and I don't get how programmers and developers of these extremely-useful apps will then suddenly run out of their genius when it comes to making something accessible to any-old-idiot (like me) who intends to use the app.

For example, I discovered a useful MP3 audio player for a Nintendo Switch called TriPlayer, (and I've done a lot of mod installations before for games and have done a fair bit of game development, so I'm not clueless about this kind of stuff,) but for something as simple as an audio player app for a Switch, why are [the instructions confusing, vague, and use phrases like ""should be self-explanatory""](https://github.com/tallbl0nde/TriPlayer/wiki/Basic-Usage-&-Tips) when referring to something that is absolutely not self-explanatory?

I just wanted to download a .zip file, extract to the root of my SD card, and then put that in my Nintendo Switch, then launch something called TriPlayer, and then listen to the music that's on my SD Card. Wouldn't the maker of this application have worded their instructions to accomplish this incredibly simple end-user procedure in a lowest-common-demoninator, any-idiot-could-do-it, steps 1-4, in-order sort of way?

I've already moved the SD Card back and forth while trying to understand the ""Self-explanatory instructions"" on how to launch this TriPlayer application so I can just listen to music while I play a game.

So, this is just a mere example. I'll probably just have to give up, but back to the original question:

Why make such great apps and then go post about them on your websites and forums inviting users the internet over to come and use your awesome utility, only to then write up your readmes/wikis/instructions in ways that assume your users know as much as you about the application, how it was made, or how it integrates with other computer-y stuff?

This is a pattern I've noticed many times over the years, it's not just a one-off occurence. I'm not meaning to be insulting or rude, but I just want to understand why this seems to happen a lot, especially with utility applications hosted on GitHub?",2021-08-12 00:56:00

I am going to buy a personalized license plate. I have been a professional computer programmer for the past 20 years.  I live in NC.  I have a degree in CS.  The license plate can have max 8 characters in it. I have two personal requirements for the license plate:

1. Somewhere in the plate, it must contain the word ""JEDI"" (I am a huge SW fan.)
2. I will use the 4 remaining characters to let people know what I do for a living: computer programming. Here are the two personalized plates I have come up with so far: ""JEDICODR"" or ""CODEJEDI"". Of these two, which one do you think would be easier for drivers to recognize what I am trying to express via my license plate? Please only choose from one of these two. (Unless you have a really good one that I havent thought of, and unequivocally meets ALL 3 REQUIREMENTS for the personalized plate I am trying to create. If you cant think of one that doesnt meet ALL 3 requirements, please dont post it, and risk derailing the thread.)",2021-06-09 16:49:19

jmyddf,What do you think about the state of modern moderation AI's?,"Like with Facebook and Reddit? Their false positive rate seems to be really high to me, and since it involves being put in the penalty box that makes for a really bad user experience. I have a friend in Facebook jail for saying the ultra controversial ""men are pigs"" for hate speech. My husband got put in Facebook jail for something very similar. I've had many friends just talking about normal gay stuff get put in Facebook jail for ""hate speech"". I got put in Reddit jail for laughing at a sub's insane prickly posting rules on \*another\* sub. The latter, I'm pretty sure it was their butthurt mods brigading, but even that shows the deficiencies in the system. (i appealed and won, fwiw, but it still resulted in a couple of days in jail). 

For all of the talk about social media and free speech, I do support platform's rights to decide what they do or don't tolerate, but if they can't scale it properly then it does nobody any good. At least with Reddit it can be scaled to subs which is a much more tractable problem, but users? It seems to me that nobody's up to the job.

Because if I do 172.16.0.0/23 I get 510 hosts per subnet. But I get 128 subnets which leaves me about the same as 172.16.0.0/22 but the range of addresses is completely different:

172.16.0.0/23 range is: 172.16.0.1 - 172.16.1.254

172.16.0.0/22 range is: 172.16.0.1 - 172.16.3.254

gtfdas,I am thinking of a new file type,"Hello folks,

I just thought about a new file type. I don't know if that's useful or if it's possible or efficient. I'll share my thoughts on it, please feel free to share your opinions.

So, Imagine this file like an array of images. Double-clicking on this will open the thumbnails of all the images in it, you can scroll, view the file you want. Like an interactive file(Is this possible?). Another perfect example would be a folder of images. The only difference here is, replace the folder with a file type. So, this is one file now, instead of multiple files inside the folder. So, after this, there won't be multiple folders of images under your ""Pictures"" folder, instead, they will be replaced with multiple files of this type.

It would be greatly useful to people who share a lot of images.

gcyjni,Image resizing with Interpolition methods," 

**Resizing image**

To resize your image, you may use and interpolation method from one pixel grid to another. Image resizing is necessary when you need to increase or decrease the total number of pixels.

Interpolation works by using known data to estimate values at unknown points. Image interpolation tries to achieve a best approximation of a pixel's intensity based on the values at surrounding pixels.

You will resize your image using an interpolation method that you prefer. You are expected to increase an image size n to n\*2 and n\*4. Repeat your experiment using a different number of neighboring pixels. Submit three materials: Data (image), Code and Project Report

Your project report must include:

1. Introduction ( give literature )
2. Method (describe your algorithm)
3. Experimental Results
4. Conclusion
5. Appendix ‚Äì (Your Code)

Note: For those who will implement in Matlab. Use imread () and imwrite() functions to load image data.

ayffqx,What is the best way to learn programming as a 12 year old?,"Hi there, I would like to have some of your advise. I am a 12 year old (7th grade) kid that lives in Europe. I would call myself a technology ***genius***. Bear with me tho, I am not here to brag, actually I am here for advise.

&#x200B;

I live in a pretty rich compound but not fairly rich myself. Everyone in my school has these epic apple computers (I think 13-inch). When I was in 4th to 5th grade I was like the go to person for help with technology, even sometimes better than the technology department. In the beginning students would go to our teacher for help if they break their computer, and the teacher redirects them to me, and later on they would just call my name straight away.

When I was little, still in 2nd grade I moved to another country in the EU, to that rich compound I was talking above. While I was still in the other country, I was ***addicted*** to technology, yes, technology, not video games. I wasn't really fascinated tho. My family had one of those very old windows XP computer and I ***mastered*** it. I could do anything on it in a reliably efficient method. This might not be fascinating to you but bear in mind, I was still in like kindergarten/1st grade and I was already ***teaching my own parents*** of how to use the computer.

Later, once I moved onto the rich school and ***somewhat richer country*** I became addicted to minecraft, I mean, I wasn't a pvp god or like the survivalist. But later on, once I had played for like a year or something and everyone else's head start to the game didn't matter much anymore my real skill started to shine. I was ok at pvp since I didn't really enjoy pvp, I liked more pve and I mastered it. Now enough about minecraft (that sounds stupid xD) let's get to the point. About 4 years ago (4th grade) I started coding minecraft plugins with no prior knowledge of java which was a big mistake. I stopped but I still continued learning how to code. Now, 3 years later I recently started learning java and minecraft (I still played minecraft through all those years...) and I really dedicated myself (tho minecraft coding this not what I need advice with).

Now I am sitting here at home thinking what will become of me in the future. I have just read two articles, [one by a 13 year old](https://education.media/why-school-isn-t-so-useful) (he is in 7th grade tho) and another one by a [Harvard professor](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/ed/15/01/whats-worth-learning-school) about how school isn't useful. In many articles I read before, but didn't pay much attention to they told me to follow my passion.

Now this is the part where I need your help. I would like some good and productive advice. Many people are telling to just get done with school, some to follow your passion, some to drop out and get drunk, and I think I have chose my path. Can everyone who reads this in the comment write like a paragraph (or how much you think is right, more or less) on how I can use my passion to 100%. I am looking to learn alone, but doesn't have to strictly be. I have a budget of infinity and beyond, I have around 500usd of allowance and my birthday is soon enough and I think that my parents would be very happy of using my money for education and not a new gaming pc so I can get more money from them.

If anyone could link some courses, sources, contacts, anything really I would greatly appreciate it since it's my passions. It also doesn't have to be long, just do what you think is right.

Said another way: after working on production support or development on a complex system, how does one 'zoom-out' of the code and situation specifics to convey to a non-technical audience what's going on?",2014-12-21 08:38:41

1y3afk,Can someone help with this?,"Say n students decide to cheat on a homework; to do so, they divide
up the n problems one to each person, and all sit in a circle to
work on the problems. Each student goes ahead and works on his
problem, thereby getting p(i) points on it. Next, each student
copies all the answers from his neighbors (remember they're all
sitting in their circle still). Unfortunately, there's a loss of
information in the copying process. Thus, when student i gets the
answer to problem j, his answer is only worth  p(i)/(d+1)
points where d=j-i(mod n) and d is between 0 and n-1.  Give an algorithm to compute each individual score.

hcrl8i,"(Why) Are Windows and Google generally seen by computer geeks as ""bad""; dishonest/non-transparent OS?","If you are interested, I wrote my personal experience with Microsoft OS and Google softwares(?) (Chrome + Gmail's menu tools). I still have ignorance as a bliss when it comes to computer/software stuff in general, and in case I'll lose it anytime soon, it will be interesting (at least funny) to see an impression as this one, which will certainly sound very naive to most of you in this sub.

So, just a few months ago, I had the knowledge of the stereotypical *parent*, at their 50s or 60s, failing to do very basic stuff online. Due to social isolation, however, I started working and attending classes from home, and thus getting to know more my personal (computer's operational) system. Until then, I've always used the default settings and that'd always felt enough.  

During this last dozen of weeks, socially isolated for the most part, I started getting closer to my the tools and everything that could make my life easier while doing my things on PC. I really like the feel of going through my opened windows with Alt+Tab, similar thing in Chrome with Ctrl+Tab, on the browser I learned Ctrl+W, Ctrl+T... Then I learned you could add a Shift in the middle of the window/tab navigating combinations. Wow, it felt really good. Those, Ctrl+Shift+T on Chrome, Windows\_key+D to minimize everything. When recently I came across the command prompt, which I see as something like 1st-2nd generation Playstation-like cheat codes, I felt kind a little like a hacker I guess lol.  

Well, working basically with writing stuff, I discovered how Google sheets and docs were better than Office software shit in most aspects. I also found some small tricks that makes life easier when writing on PC: ctrl+'arrows' will jump entire words, shift+'arrows' will select things, maybe a few more of those.  Seeing my phone notes as a file on my Gmail was almost scary but at the same time very welcome. I am honestly very surprised and fascinated with the level of the things you can do to make life easier.",2020-06-20 18:51:41

odyqej,"Why so many programming languages and programs and environments etc? I feel like I need to learn Python to run one thing, Ruby to run another... It's driving me up the wall!","TL/DR: I'm pissed at all of you programmers out there... please explain!  ./Run rant.bat 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I had to post this here because r/programming are too e1it3 to even allow the basic function of creating a post without making that post a title and a link only...  and that's kind of the crux of what I'm getting at here - It seems like there is almost this assumption that ""Duhhhh... everyone knows how to run programs in Python/Ruby/Sql/Unix!"" 

I mean, you can take your pick from that list but the irony is, its almost as if the assumption is that everyone just knows them all. It's frustrating as a normal every day non programming person who is trying to say, work out the basics of running an Sqlite statements or commands etc and the wording of even the most basic tutorial is totally lacking any human understandable explanation...  

Or you find some script or program on GitHub that sounds really fucking useful for solving a complex or otherwise time intensive problem.... if only you were a Ruby or Python expert ... or even understood just how to run it... because the readme's are like an alien language to every day people...

It's just as complex trying to understand the original problem because in order to install and run the app, you need to learn another language, being taught by an alien who thinks in 7 dimensions of time and space, who uses another language to describe the language they are trying to explain. 

It's a never ending loop. 

Seriously, why can't we just write all these things in one universal language? 

I understand the usefulness and purpose of something like an Sqlite database - but why does it need to display or table everything in needlessly overcomplicated or just plain illogical labels or outputs?

Like - why not just tell me the time and date in a normal, human readable format instead of displaying something like 38473839322.0494030, which apparently refers to how many seconds since the second coming of Satan 2000 years ago multiplied by milliseconds since the Hippy Revolution of 1970? Which isn't accurate enough for the existing Unix time reference, neither of which were good enough apparently for Apple, who prefer to count their seconds in different atomic time frames from the day Ronald Regan declared war on drugs or something... 

I mean... fuck guys... its easy... time and date is something we use every day, just use the reference point as the time and date set on the device you're viewing the database on, Give me a simple ss-mm-dd-mm-yy format... 

Why not just call a table header ""Contact Identifier"" or ""User Reference Number"" instead of some weird nonsensicle abbreviation?

Why not have the SQLite database understand commands from one universal language that all other programs use, or even offer a simple GUI for those of us who don't know why the pragramma is false at line 1 of 300 that we copy pasted in from the instructions that were provided by some half computer half human terminator like machine of a unit who obviously thinks in some weird way to the rest of us for that to make total sense for a start, let alone accept it as a completely logical way to achieve something. 

Why install Python on my Windows computer so I can run some program that was obviously designed to help resolve an issue that some monkey like me couldn't wrap his head around to begin with? I mean... the reason why I can't work it out to start with is because I have no idea how to compile a python script and run its values against an epoch referenced python ++ pragramma written in Ruby because Diamond was too simple for whoever wrote it... Just give me a damn EXE file and let me just fkn' send it baby!

4y7cr8,Creating Full Mirrors of Websites,"Hi all, the recent shutdown of the torrenting site [kickass.to](http://kickass.to/) and the effort to mirror the site in response (see [here](https://proxyportal.org/kickass)) has led me to ask the question: how were all of these mirrors created, and so quickly?

As far as I understand, the server side parts of Kickass (the actual torrent database, search functionality, etc.) were never made public. I'm aware of cloning techniques for static websites which involve simply downloading all of the static files used, but I'm not sure how that would apply for situations like this.

Does anyone know if the server-side stuff for Kickass was just made available somewhere? Did each mirror re-implement existing functionality? Even if they did, where did they get their database from? Note, the same thing happened for thepiratebay when it got shut down, and I'm pretty sure even more recently for Torrentz.

2l2jqf,Finding a pattern in test question answers,"To get a fishing license in the country I live in now, I am required to sit through 30 hours of class, and then take a 60 question test several weeks later. I have already done the classes and am studying for the test now, however it may be nearly impossible for me to pass since the questions are in a foreign language that I don't speak well.

This got me to thinking, is there a way to find a pattern in the questions which might help me make better guesses on the questions I don't know? There are 700 questions in all, of which 60 are chosen for the test. Each question is multiple choice and has 3 possible answers: a, b, or c.* We have been given all the questions ahead of time. 

So, might it be possible to find a pattern such as every question where ""f"" appears before ""o"" in the sentence has an 85% chance of having b as the answer? My guess is that there is no random pattern that would exist that would be more than even 1 percent in favor of a particular answer... but maybe I am wrong, and I am a little bit desperate, and looking for ways to procrastinate from studying these questions, so it's worth asking. If there is a possibility, how might someone go about trying to find this?

*technically there are actually 6 possible answers: a, b, or c ..or.. a&b, a&c, or b&c. However, with each question, we are told whether to fill in one or two bubbles, so a and b&c could be considered to be the same, etc.

49osep,Which kinds of forking can be done fast in parallel?,"Forking can be as simple as adding 1 to an int. Depending on how many of its low bits are already 1, it will change more bits. Multiply takes longer for the same reason recursively. Multiplying small integers is faster than multiplying big integers, with the same total bits.

When programmers say forking, they usually mean a big change in memory address. That is slower than multiply, but they're both forking.

Somewhere between are things that happen at closer addresses or are somehow optimized for common hardware. If I read an int from an array and jump to that memory address,  it will be fast if that part of memory is already cached, which it will be if its near something I read andOr wrote recently.

3uwlbw,[Java] Parametrizing Generic Types in Arrays,"(Freshman CS major with moderate programming experience)

I was studying my textbook today (Data Structures and Algorithms, by Michael Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael Goldwasser), and I came upon a section involving generic types. 

My textbook says that although you can declare an array parametrized by generic types, you cannot technically instantiate a new array with generic types. You must instantiate a non parametric array (something I've been told basically to never do, are there any other good uses for non parametrized structures besides this example?),  and then cast the array to the parametrized generic type.

What is the reasoning behind this convention?

39z0lq,Trying to understand how to get a program to find 2 numbers that will match from the set of base 3 and an offset,"How can you use 2 numbers from a set of exponents of 3 (or zero otherwise) to add up to any number that equals each other?

This should hold true for random (not from set with base of 3) offsets on 1 of the numbers.  

For example:

an offset of 9 would be an easy example.  the first number (from the set of exponents of 3) would be 0, and the second would be 3^2 which gives 9=9.


another example:

13 would be zero added to 13, then 1+3+9=13=13.

another example:

7 would be a little tougher.  7+3=10 and 1+9=10 so 10=10.

I'm brute forcing these at low values of course for example purposes.  What method would fit to do any value, large or small?  No guessing obviously.

2rifc5,Should I switch to a BA from a BS?,"I'm currently pursuing a B.S. CS degree, but I feel like the extra requirements are really starting to take a toll on what I want to do. The B.S. degree is far more stringent in terms of breadth reqs like electrical engineering classes and stuff. I've already taken most of the math and natural sciences, but I still have some general engineering classes to go. 

If I were to switch to a B.A. in cs, I would basically just have the comp sci class requirements to fulfill and it would leave me with a lot more time to pursue other things. For example, I find that I have so little time to focus on my own side projects (websites, games, apps) during the semester because I'm so busy trying to finish all the work the engineering curriculum demands of me. I feel like if I switched, I could focus on honing my programming skills more instead of wasting time and effort on say, digital circuits or statics, things that I'm not really interested in. I would just generally have more free time to do other things besides drawn out lab reports that don't pertain to programming at all. I guess my motivation for the BS is a BS seems more marketable to employers, and it certainly has been beneficial to my pragmatic thinking skills, but there's simply too much crap. I want to be a computer scientist, I want to program. Any advice?

Edit: I'm a sophomore, btw. 
edit2: Just did a comparison of the BA to BS requirements. Definitely going with the B.S. Writing this post was necessary though. Thanks all who read and responded. ",2015-01-06 13:22:06
20ixql,Proper way to add debugging?,"Let's say I'm programming in Java. What's the best way to add debugging?

I have a few ideas that I'll label:

1) Use command line arguments to run debug code
- Essentially for this I'll have a bunch of if statements in certain parts of the code to see weather or not we are in debug, or trying to debug some special case. I would think this is not the right way to go about it. Firstly you have a bunch of if statements everywhere which may slow things down. That's one thing I wanted to ask actually **if this is done in the industry, is the performance hit by doing this deemed negligible?**

2) Use variables with the 'final' keyword declared somewhere at the top of the program. I would assume this would make make the if statements compute at compile time, to save on performance. **Are there any downsides to this?**. I was thinking a potential downside would be affecting how much you have to compile each time. I'm not sure if there is a problem here. I'm assuming this is why a debug build would be made, and that's the reason that debug builds and release builds are different, so that one could save that extra bit of performance.

So a general question I had related to all of this is: what's the point of command line arguments? If I were to take an educated guess, I would say that they are not used for debugging purposes but for the users of the program? **Do developers have a need to enter command line arguments in their own program for themselves?**

**Another question**: if a 'final' variable in java can be modified once, what's the point? I thought the point of the 'final' keyword in java was to compute things in compile time. If you set it during run time, how is the knowledge that it's final help? What about command line arguments that initialize the final variables.

nvrtt7,question about halting problem,"If we think about conservation of energy we can build a set of ""all energy"" M which is finite. 

Now we can define two sets inside M: unsable energy (N) and usable energy (U). 

since N+U=M -> N and U are finite too. 

If we define the halting mashine (H,G,F) is a mashine that is cabable of using all the usable energy (U) and transforming it to unusable energy (N) we have to come to the conclusion that no matter what H gives as a result G will always halt because it can not run infinitely. There is simply no energy left. 

I am refering to this [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halteproblem#/media/Datei:Halteproblem.png](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halteproblem#/media/Datei:Halteproblem.png).

Would this not violate the proof?

Since a few weeks I have this idea for a new business. In order to make this even more successful I am wondering for the following.

Would it be possible to convert a drawing into an order? So, people will create their own kitchenplan on the website of a big Swedish furniture company. After they have done this they go to my website to get a quotation for custom made kitchensfronts.

What competitors do now is that people need to send their kitchen drawing in PDF format to them, an employee will make a quote and send it back the the customer.

My idea was to automate this. So people will go the website, select their wished frontdesign,  upload their drawing and then the software will detect what the sizes etc of the front / panels are and converts this to a quote.

So, does anyone knows if this would be possible? 

Hope anyone can could help me out here!

m9pqoq,"I was recently accepted into a full-stack web development bootcamp. I have a free month before it begins, how can I make best use of this time?","Hi guys, a few weeks ago I was accepted into the Coding Bootcamp Praha based in Prague, it has an excellent reputation, and while I am excited, I am aware that these courses are typically intense, so I want to be as well-prepared as I can be going in.

The preparatory modules that the bootcamp specifically recommended were freeCodeCamp's Basic HTML, Basic CSS, Basic Javascript and a couple of Codecademy's modules on PHP. However, I recently completed Harvard's CS50 course, which gave me an excellent introduction to programming principles, so it wasn't too difficult to use my prior knowledge to get through all this stuff in a few days.

So that leads me to my current position, my bootcamp starts in a month, I have an empty calendar up until then and I'm trying to figure out how to make best use of the intervening time. I have a few ideas, none of which are very fleshed out:

1. Sign up for one of the web development courses on Udemy, [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) or [Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) seem to come highly rated and I would imagine I would certainly learn some useful stuff that would help me on my course.
2. However, looking at the [syllabus](https://codingbootcamp.cz/syllabus), I can see a lot of different technologies which don't match up with what is used in the Udemy courses, so another idea I had was to find more specialised courses on the technologies which feature most prominently in the bootcamp syllabus (Laravel and React in particular seem to receive a lot of focus, though React *is* covered in Angela Yu's course).
3. Or maybe I should do some kind of Frankenstein of the two and use the overall course as a general guide while learning the bootcamp technologies and trying to use them to complete the projects? (Though I feel like this would be pretty tough).

As I mentioned, I don't have any particularly well-fleshed-out ideas about what I should do- I would probably end up doing one of these options if left to my own devices, but I thought it best to get a second opinion. I would like to know what I can be doing for the next month that will put me in the best possible position to perform well at the bootcamp or maximise my chances of getting a good job afterwards.

Couple of extra notes: 1) The staff seem very friendly, and I am sure they would be happy to provide me more specific details if I ask them. 2) I have a mild preference for a structured environment, which is perhaps why I lean towards these online courses, however, I am open certainly open to considering suggestions of a different nature, if anyone thinks that will serve me better.",2021-03-21 05:54:05

`N = Any integer in decimal notation`

You must supply inputs for `X` as well. But this was shortened for clarity.

Facts

* `X` can be an algorithm that solves an EXPTIME-complete problem
* `X` can be an algorithm that solves an EXPSPACE-complete problem
* `X` can be an algorithm that solves an NP-complete problem
* `X` can be an algorithm that solves a PSPACE-complete problem.

* Edit: X can be any algorithm for any class of decision-problems. 2EXP, 3EXP, and so on....

***Read this three times.***

>The algorithm for this decision problem will output YES on an *algorithm that solves an* ***EXPSPACE-hard*** *problem* in the worst-case. If `N` is large enough to allow you to solve the **EXPSACE-hard** problem. (Assuming the answer is YES for the EXPSACE-hard problem)  
>  
>This means there is no PSPACE algorithm for this decision problem. Because PSPACE != EXPSACE. Neither is there a polytime algorihm.

eng3pz,Whats the BigO of modInverse (inverse of modPow) of 2 certainly prime integers?,"The bigO of modPow is at worst number of bits of the mod power 4 (where multiply is at worst number of bits cubed, and algorithms claiming lower bigO for matrix multiply maybe did not derive their operators which are said to have cost 1)), using exponent by repeated squaring and modding every square.

I'm considering making an infinite dimensional manifold topology of blockchain and trying to simulate a vibrating string (including double-slit and delayed choice quantum eraser ability, though slower) in realtime (few times the lag of mouse movements but not lag of sound vibrations), where modPow vs modInverse by each prime goes forward or backward distance 1 in the dimension named by that prime, and measure proofOfWork on each such result of modpows (each representing a vector in an infinite dimensional space) so instead of a blockchain its a manifold of each proofOfWork being like quantum foam consistent with an all paths integral that if you modpow various dimensions in various orders and modinverse mixed in with that to return to a moment in your own past the proofOfWork there is exactly equal regardless of the path you took to get there. So in that context I'm concerned about the efficiency of modInverse, cuz if its very expensive then time will flow more one direction than the other and be unable to close the loop though still able to represent chaotic open manifolds.",2020-01-12 00:34:50

public Robot(Point startingLocation, int startingDirection) //Note: 0 = North, 1 = East, 2 = South, 3 = West

public void turnLeft()

public void turnRight()

public void move()

public Point getLocation()

public String getDirection()

The turnLeft and turnRight methods change the direction but not the location. The move method moves the robot by one unit in the direction it is facing. The getDirection method returns a string ""N"", ""E"", ""S"", or ""W"".

I think the user is supposed to make the robot change directions and move.

    import java.util.Scanner; 
    public class robot { 
    public robot (Point startingLocation, int startingDirection) //Note: 0 =  North, 1 = East, 2 = South, 3 = West 
    { 
    } 
    public void turnLeft() 
    { 
    } 
    public void turnRight()

    } 
    public void move()

I just need to make a list of schools that are ""safety"" and ""reach"" for me since I already have a dream school*

I have a BSc in IT (Hons.) from an American university that is not well-known. I have a pretty strong GPA (3.98), solid LORs, research experience in Natural Language Processing that will likely lead to publication, and lots of internships & development experience. I have won 4 hackathons & also received scholarships from top tech companies to fund my undergrad education. I am pursuing a minor in Mathematics, and studying probability, statistics, linear algebra, etc.

My dream is to get into the University of Toronto. However, I am afraid the fact that my undergrad degree is in IT and not CS will hurt me. I have never studied algorithms in a classroom setting. I have only taken some MOOCs on them. I know grad schools only care about your academic and research achievements, and I only started doing research in my Junior year of college.

Is it impossible for someone like me to get into a competitive CS **thesis** Master's program? My IT coursework focused on software engineering, databases, programming languages, OOP, and data structures, and I have all the math I need for ML from my math minor. even though most of my experience is in industry, I really want to do research.

My name is Mike and I'm currently at a community college in my first semester if computer science. This being said a little background on me is I was originally getting my certificate in culinary arts which i finished. (2 years of wasted time) I learned after working in the field while also going to school that quite frankly the job sucks due to high hours and not being justly compensated in the money department.  Im 23 so kind of a late start but glad I realized culinary wasn't for me. Coming out of High School I wanted to go into CS but didn't want to do the General Education due to lack of motivation. Now at 23 and seeing all the people i went to highschool starting  their careers its kind of gave me a kick start. 

All that being said I was wondering if you guys had advice on a couple things.

1. Is getting a mac putting myself at a disadvantage going into CS or is it a preference thing seeing as you can run linux on apple machines . (Can you dual boot like windows machines?)
2. Should I try and self teach my self some languages to have a step ahead.
3. Any programs as far as computer science at four years that I should look at
4. ANY ADVICE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED!!

Preface, I *may* be in the wrong subreddit for this, and if I am I apologize.

 

To start, I graduated uni with a degree in biology and a minor in cs. As it turns out, I'm not a big fan of lab work, and/or relying on grants. I know C++ pretty well, visual basic, and have some python knowledge, and I somewhat know how to use github, that's it. Currently learning SQL, then JavaScript.

What exactly do I have to... do? I don't quite know what requirements I need, or what kind of experience or knowledge I'm missing. I'm worried i may not even know what I'm missing.

If anyone could help me with things that I can do to:

1. Further my cs knowledge (in languages, processes, general things I need to know, etc.)
2. To actually stand a chance at getting a software engineering job

Am I even able to get a software engineering job without a cs major or am I screwed?

8x1cor,I am going from an IT minor to a Computer Science major. I want to prepare for it as best as possible during this summer. Care to help me construct a plan?,"Hello guys,

I am going from an IT minor to a Computer Science major. I made this decision because I love computers, I love the science behind them and I love learning most of all. *My graduate research thesis is related to Artificial Intellligence*.

However, *I feel slightly overwhelmed*. Although I did have some math in my IT minor, I forgot about 50% of it and the Computer Science undergrads had a lot more math than I did. I also didn't have any physics courses. My programming abilities, are, I'd say, average at best - I can implement a linked list or some sorting algorithm, but I tend to have more bugs with algorithms like quicksort or mergesort. Also, if I have to do a backtracking algorithm or something with graphs on a complex graph data structure, I get a bit lost (that is, I need some time to figure it out). While I know that an average computer science student probably forgot most of what he had learned (if he didn't review periodically) and he didn't learn as comprehensively as the curriculum planed for him to learn, he probably heard more concepts than me and has that moment of recollection when someone mentions something he heard on a lecture or read about in a book.

So I decided to use this summer time to prepare. I see two possible strategies:

 - prepare in advance for the upcoming classes by reading the literature related to those classes (classes like Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition etc.)
 - focus on filling in the gaps in my existing knowledge as much as possible

I decided for the option 2 (that is, ""focus on filling in the gaps in my existing knowledge as much as possible""). I decided to focus on math and programming, alongside getting used to Linux and reviewing computer networks, operating systems and computer architecture and putting all of the aforementioned topics in my Spaced Repetition System (Anki). My summer curricula is below. It is based on books, since I will be self-studying. I calculated that for each category I need about 16 hours per week (approximately), since this is usually the time ""burden"" courses require from students.

**Calculus:**

 - read and solve exercises from *Calculus: Early Transcedentals* by *Stewart*; if I need to, brush up on some precalculus concepts (but there's no need to read the whole precalculus book if I only don't know how to complete the square, for example)

**Algorithms:**

 - read and solve exercises from *The Algorithm Design Manual* by *Skiena*; if that is too complicated, then read the same algorithm explanation in *Grokking Algorithms*

**Other computer science related things:**

 - install and learn how to use Linux
 - review computer networks 
 - review operating systems

I plan to work 7 hours on workdays (1 hour is my lunch hour) + some small amount of hours each weekend (3-4 hours). It would all amount to 40-45 hours a week. So that's a *minimum* which will *constantly be exectuded*. I know that hours don't gurantee success, but I want to make sure I am investing the required time.

As I'm writing this now, a part of me wants to maniacally study everything under the sun I'm interested in - calculus, linear algebra, probability, physics, biology, statistics, algortihms etc. But I know that if you try to do too many things at once you don't do any of them well. And besides, I'd also like to have some days where I spend time with family, physically exercise or go out. I could structure my summer routine so that I encompass everything I'm interested in, but I believe that this tactic (of selecting only a few items) is better. In the best-case scenario, if I do indeed finish with studying these topics before the start of my new semester, I can just add in a new topic I'm interested in in place of the old one.

Some questions for you:

 - do you think it is better to spend this summer reviewing and learning the fundamentals or is it better to read the literature I'll have in the upcoming courses in advance?
 - do you think I choose the most important topics as the ""fundamentals""? (if you think that 2nd approach is the better approach)
 - do you think that this approach (focusing on a few things, then if I learn them substituting them with new things) is better than trying to learn all the things I'm interested in at once (and then devoting smaller time chunks to those things)?
 - any other tips you'd have?

I think that a good plan is important to have, but it is worth nothing if it is not executed upon. So leave your remarks so I can start executing as fast as possible!

Thanks in advance!",2018-07-08 13:14:38

8m00jr,Route-finding problem - avoiding collisions,"This isn't technically homework, but it is a university extracurricular so it's not really a 'real world' problem.

I have some python and C skill, but algorithms is very much a secondary skill of mine. I have to make two robots navigate between arbitrary points in a room. They aren't able to detect each other on-the-fly.

They communicate with a central hub which has to formulate the routes and pass it on to the robots. The routes must be the quickest route from the start point to the finish point without directing two robots to occupy the same space simultaneously.

The floor is divided into a grid (think chessboard). Some tiles will have obstacles sitting on them.

I'm thinking about using dijkstra's route-finding algorithm and treating each tile as a node. The only difference between a regular implementation of dijkstra's algorithm and this case is that the node-to-node distance would change every 'step' of the optimal route calculation because the other robot may be occupying a square...

69fuk0,Is the handling of a (large) PDF a taxing action for a mobile device?,"I know that showing a PDF is nowhere as complex as running a taxing game or a scientific computation , or even computing all the scripts on the FB home.

Nevertheless a large pdf, say made out of page scans, seems to me quite a task to handle (compared to, say, writing an SMS) although already the [ZT180](http://www.slatedroid.com/wiki/index.php?title=Wiki:ZT-180_FAQ) was able to handle some quite neatly back in 2010.

I mean if the PDF is large (say 30+ mb) then the access to the memory is not a little. A PDF, for what I know, is shown as 2d vector image, so the user actually scrolls a 2d image (like in a browser). Therefore if one is scrolling a lot to get to a certain location (say from page 1 to page 70), I would assume that the action would be intensive enough to saturate at least one arm core that runs around 1 Ghz.

I'm not aware that the GPU can help to process the PDF (like handling it as a 2d texture), aside from showing it.

Am I wrong to consider handling PDF taxing - for the CPU - more than interactions like writing on whatsapp or taking a picture?",2017-05-05 16:49:02

62a6hy,Quick question?,"I have an hp pavilion g7, if I add an external ssd will that speed up my CPU, or am I all the way off on my understanding of whats happening. Also, It runs on an hhd and I'm also thinking about replacing that with an ssd if it speeds up my CPU. My goal is to improve rendering times solely. I'm usually only ever using 2.5g out of my 3.5g of ram, will up grading that help any. (I have not seen 3.5g of ram anywhere else on the internet so I don't know if Im even reading that correctly.) So, as a recap will a new ssd help with CPU or faster rendering time? Does CPU have anything to do wth render times? Will upgrading memory help any. Or will upgrading both memory and an SSD be the best option? 

Bonus question, If i did replace my hhd with an ssd and I also had an external ssd could I raid them for better speeds or do I just not know what I'm talking about at all?

Or even better could I just get multiple external ssd's, raid them together, save all my pertinent applications and files that have to do with video editing and rendering, and keep my HHD.

xfxhsw,"I'm a theoretical physicist, and feel algorithms are out of place and data doesn't exist","I have a PhD in theoretical physics and never got on with experimental physics. I've spent several years in software engineering.

This is going to sound weird, but intuitively I don't believe in data, and algorithms seem out of place, like _how_ you get to the answer is irrelevant. Practically speaking, I find algorithms easy to learn and use, and see how they make things faster. But I still don't intuitively understand why they're involved. It's like computation itself makes no sense to me.

I strongly feel there is a good reason to feel this way, one founded in mathematics, logic or even philosophy, but I don't know what it would be. It does remind me of how quantum computers don't compute things in the ""this then that"" fashion that digital computers do, that they - and correct my hand-wavy understanding if I'm wrong - just ""coalesce"" on the answer.

bunalu,Do you guys use your keyboard more over your mouse? Does over-reliance on mouse often indicate the user is of average computer proficiency?,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right sub. 

My company has hired IT professionals to migrate our systems and train us on how to use the new system. This training consultant mentioned that one of the ways he predicted before we even started that I‚Äôll learn the new system faster is because I know how to navigate my computer with my keyboard, whereas most office workers rely on the mouse a lot. His prediction is true.

His rationale stemmed from the history of the mouse. He said 

> the mouse was designed/invented to make machines more accessible to the average person. Back then computers were command line/terminals so you mostly interacted via keyboard. So by balance of probability, people who overuse the mouse tend to be average computer users. 

> **Conversely, those who have gained proficiency with keyboard navigation tend to also be people who have had more experience with computers, and are more likely to either have an interest in, or a mind for, computer work and/or efficiency.** At least in the specific technical field that I am in.

11z6sfv,I am You when you were first starting out...,"Hello comp sci experts. If you could think back to the days when you first started out, do you recall what it was that got you hooked? I hear a lot of stories of people who fell in love with comp sci because they wanted to make simple games in their free time or had an idea for an app that would automate tasks and free up their schedule. Next thing you know, they're moving from one advanced concept to the next.

I am brand new to computer science. I have a background in creative production (audio, video, graphic design, Adobe apps) and have been in the broadcast industry for about a decade.

With comp sci's steep learning curve in mind, I have a programming project idea that I'd like to implement to get my feet wet. It will tie in my creative skills in an attempt to help me to stay motivated to conquer the curve. I also plan to take on foundational academic study (via Havard's CS50 or something similar).

My project idea is to create a GUI that presents a ""timeline"" of sorts, one which is fully interactive. For example, a user would be able to interact with the UI in a variety of ways:  


* scrolling through, zooming in/out
* sorting the data based on a number of variables of their choosing
* view images/video embedded in the timeline
* reading text entries stored across the timeline
* etc...

On the back end, my beginner's guess is that I'd need to know database programming/admin and to learn front end programming/design. Sounds more like a Full Stack Web Dev path rather than, say, Software Dev. Being a newbie though, I'm not really sure. I'm also not 100% certain I want to transition into Web Development in the future per se, but this project at least seems like a realistic goal to begin with.

**My big question:** Which discipline(s) of computer science would a ""Timeline"" GUI project which is built on a database fall under? What are the specific things I need to know (best languages and tools, key comp sci concepts to know, specializations to learn about) in order to complete this project?

156rxs4,Why this Code Editor does not exist yet?,"I'm currently using Visual Studio Code for programming because it's currently the best option I've found for myself. But I know a way to make a code editor much better than the ones currently available and I honestly don't understand why nobody made a code editor like the one I'm going to explain next.

&#x200B;

First think, what happens when you open a web page? You start at the top of the page. The same thing happens with text files, if you open a large source code, you start at the top of the file then scroll down to continue reading.

&#x200B;

The catch is that you scroll down a lot more than you scroll up, as there is a immense bias for most of the content to be down when you use a computer or phone.

&#x200B;

Coming back to code editors, what happens if you have a class with lots of methods? You'll need to scroll down and up a lot, or at least split the class into multiple files and risk adding unnecessary complexity if the class makes more sense with all the methods inside it, if you don't do that you will have to deal with scrolling problem.

&#x200B;

How can this be improved? Well it is so obvious I can't believe why no one has created a code editor like this yet, so I am here just to say it. Just realize that methods in a class work like sets, the order doesn't matter, it does not have to have a sequential linear structure, if you swap the order of two methods in a class it won't make any difference in most programming languages. This is different from lines of code inside the methods, where sequential linear structure is important.

&#x200B;

If you place 10 elements in a one-dimensional structure, to move from the first element to the last element you will have to travel at least 10 of distance, but if you place the elements in a two-dimensional structure such as a circle in a bidimensional space, it is possible to move from one element to the other at a greater speed because there is more space to arrange them side-by-side.

&#x200B;

In other words, my proposal is a code editor in which methods are ""floating"" in a two-dimensional space, represented by rectangles, each rectangle contains the code inside it in the same way as any other code editor. That way a class would be visualized in this editor as a collection of rectangles in a space, each rectangle has the method's code, you could also collapse / expand the methods by double-clicking on its header to focus on what is most important, and you could see clearly and with much more space all the methods of the class as you work, and be able to quickly collapse the method you're working, move to the next, and expand another faster than scrolling in one dimension.

&#x200B;

There is no code editor quite like this, usually code editors are represented either all code as text or as blocks to be connected (visual scripting). Now what I said is something different, a new way of working with code.",2023-07-22 18:47:42

15e7cff,Do we really have to take infinite recursions so seriously?,"\[preface to the question\]

""This statement is false.""

It certainly LOOKS like a truth-functional statement!

So is it true or false?

The true answer is: *It doesn‚Äôt matter.*

If Bertrand Russell has trouble sleeping at night because he knows a barber who, that night, will shave everyone who doesn't shave himself, then he might as well have slept. Because come sunrise, the barber either will or will not have shaved himself.

What have you got if you write ""This statement is false"" on a card and its subcontrary on the other side?

A card with ink on it. There's nothing to figure out. **THAT‚ÄôS ALL THERE IS.**

Existence not only precedes essence, existence IS essence. There ISN‚ÄôT anything else.

Godel did work so clever that I giggle with delight. But all he proved was that it‚Äôs possible for talking monkeys to use infinite recursion and construct incomplete formal systems.

Godel and Russell might as well have saved time, cut out the middle man, and just assert:

TRUE = FALSE.

**Why is the incompleteness theorem  anything more than a curiosity in the back page of Scientific American?**

Its like a walk down the street and you punch a hole in the street, and then complain that the manifold has holes in it.

**Why can't we say arithmetic is complete except for statements involving infinite recursion?**

Yes, of course we could SAY it. And it would be true. But why isn't that sufficient? Why do we make  such a big deal out of formal incompleteness in computer science?

15fjze6,"Is Turing completeness really important? Especially these days, when we're so abstracted from the hardware.","I think everybody looks around them and sees other people celebrating some of this cannonical CS stuff, and they figure they have to do it too, or look unprofessional.

Turing-completeness is an overblown concept, in my opinion. Back when the Word Perfect macro language was primitive, I observed that it was Turing-complete. That meant I could write any program in it. OBOY! I can make WP sing and dance!
 
But I realized that in order to write arbitrary software, I would have had to construct a separate virtual machine implemented in the skimpy WP macro language that could barely implement a Turing Machine.

See, that's not the same as saying that that WP macros is as powerful as any special purpose application language in the world. But that's what we're telling kids in computer science.

See?

It's like a science fair demonstration that ants can do computation by lining up dead ants and using them as bits in a model computer.

I'm not saying his results aren't important; I'm saying they're not the be all and end all of CS like they're being portrayed. Other than being interesting, I don't see the concept as having any utility.

Frankly, I think the romance of the Turing story might have something to do with it. He was a tragic gay martyr hero who killed himself when the government arrested him for being gay.

But he was also a loner hobbyist who built circuits out of metal that involved using the chemical cyanide. He didn't leave a note. No one thought he was going to do it. He didn't suggest it to anyone. He didn't act all bummed out. He was working in his lab that night, and I think it's likely that he just got careless and got some of the stuff on an apple.

That doesn't make him any less of a martyr, because he was persecuted by the government for loving somebody. In my house, we celebrated Stonewall 50. But He famously wasn't ashamed, which is the correct attitude.  And not many people kill themselves for that, even back then.

In any case, I don't think there's a reason to call Turing the Hero Father of Computer Science, when many others like Boole did so much more basic work and others who followed him established the theory of computer programming.

12dlmmy,Do you ever skip any parts of Scrum?,"Hello everyone,

I am currently conducting my thesis in computer science, where I examine with the negative parts of Scrum. But now I would need your help! I would love to hear about your experience with Scrum, negative or positive.

Although Scrum is often seen as something positive from a business perspective, it can be unmotivating for many software developers. This has its consequences and can lead to teams using Scrum only partially or not following the Scrum guide, which, among other things, means that efficiency is negatively affected.

Are you working with software development? Do you perhaps use Scrum at your workplace? Or have you previously used Scrum? What is your experience with Scrum? Which parts of Scrum do you most often skip? And what are the underlying reasons for this, accorning to your experience?

I would be incredibly grateful if you wanna share your experience with me here in the forum, or even better if you would participate in my survey. It only takes a few minutes to participate!

13uw7i7,Forced to go to college over Uni,"Alright so basically, in grade 12 I set my mind on computer science, It was what I wanted to major in but what held me back was the math. I don‚Äôt know what school is like where you are but in Ontario we have 3 levels for each class Workplace, College, University. self explanatory but the level you took is what pathway you‚Äôd most likely take. In grade 9 I took everything a Uni level and around second semester I feel into some deep deep depression, it was just stuff from my past and it caused my grades to slip, especially in math. moving on to grade 10 I took everything Uni level expect math, I took that at a college level and continued to do so until grade 12. With that being said I don‚Äôt know if any uni‚Äôs would have accepted me with college level math on my transcript. I told my mum about computer science and after going to the mosque and talking to some auntie, that auntie told her to send me to college first as it would be better on my resume and experience wise so at the end my mum forced me to go to college first like I was out with my friends and she literally applied to it for me without telling me it‚Äôs not something I was interested at all but she told me i‚Äôd be better. I am currently at my first year in college and it‚Äôs for Networking- Switching and Routers and imma transfer to a bachelors of comp sci after these 2 years (it‚Äôs only for a diploma) I was going through a rough mental state and feeling lost so I reached out. I was debating transferring after my first year which was this april because I don‚Äôt feel like this is where I wanna waste another year and I want to go to a university already to actually do what I want to do because I feel like i‚Äôm wasting my time here so I rather go to a uni for 4 years and not waste another day here. I know I can‚Äôt get into a top CS school program like Waterloo or UofT  as they don‚Äôt accept transfers. but I can definitely try for York University or Ryerson, not a big name but it‚Äôs a CS major regardless and it‚Äôs competitive. i‚Äôm in some dead college, definitely struck my ego. It‚Äôs like idk what to do rn, on one hand my mum wants to me finish this and I‚Äôm a year in with a year left so I feel like a year woulda been wasted plus a drop out on my record, it‚Äôs shit. But on the other hand This isn‚Äôt what I want to do at all like there are some CS classes but a lot are useless too. It‚Äôs stressful cos this combined with so much family pressure going on im actually stressed out. I feel like I sold myself short, even if I wasn‚Äôt accepted I rather know that and have that closure then thinking about what could‚Äôve been. I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm complaining but with everyone talking about the competition in computer science nowadays, I feel like I won‚Äôt make it in the field or I‚Äôll be left behind as all my other high school classmates keep elevating.",2023-05-29 14:19:06

1360f7l,LC3 assembly program which calculates the sum of all odd numbers or all even numbers stored between x3200 and x32FF inclusive. The program will use LC3 input/output to determine whether odd or even values are being summed.,"Program Details

Your program will start at x3000 in memory and sum all odd or even numbers stored at memory locations x3200 to x32FF. Please note that while the autograder will populate these memory address with data values, when testing your program, you will need to place these values into memory manually. I recommend doing so by modifying the memory values via the simulator rather than using assembly code. Because the range of values is so large, I recommend placing a few values at the start of the memory range and a few at the end leaving the middle addresses empty. This will allow you to both confirm that your program is covering all necessary memory locations and also produce a result which is easy to verify. When run, your program should start by printing out the following message: ""Please enter a 1 to sum all odd numbers. Otherwise, all even numbers will be summed\n"". Your program will then use the KBSR and KBDR to capture the users‚Äô input. As stated in the prompt, if the input value is a 1, the program should output the sum of all odd numbers. If the input value is not a 1, it should output the sum of all even numbers. The final sum will be stored at memory location x3300. Once stored, your program will halt the machine using the HALT command. You must place any .FILL pseudo-ops after your HALT command. Placing .FILL pseudo-ops before the HALT will cause the data stored at those locations to be executed as instructions. This can cause your code to produce unexpected results

Bonus: for outputting the calculated sum to the console as a decimal number. The expected output for this portion is: ""\nThe sum of values was: "" followed by the numeric value. The LC3 can only output ASKII characters so you‚Äôll need to convert your calculated sum into individual ASKII characters for the 100s, 10s, and 1s places. You can assume that no sum will be larger than 3 digits. In order to do this conversion, I recommend using the LC3 to determine the size of each digit, then convert each digit to the associated ASKII character. Please note that leading 0‚Äôs are expected, so if the sum is 45 the output would be: The sum of values was: 045 Development Notes When testing if a number is odd or even, please remember that a number can be negative or positive and to account for that in your program. Also note that if you use the user stack, you will need to initialize R6 with the stack pointer value first. The user stack should always start at xFDFF per the LC3 ISA. For developing and testing your assembly program

I recommend using the online LC3 simulator at: https://wchargin.com/lc3web/ .",2023-05-02 21:11:17

13uw5ky,Forced to go to college instead of Uni,"Alright so basically, in grade 12 I set my mind on computer science, It was what I wanted to major in but what held me back was the math. I don‚Äôt know what school is like where you are but in Ontario we have 3 levels for each class Workplace, College, University. self explanatory but the level you took is what pathway you‚Äôd most likely take. In grade 9 I took everything a Uni level and around second semester I feel into some deep deep depression, it was just stuff from my past and it caused my grades to slip, especially in math. moving on to grade 10 I took everything Uni level expect math, I took that at a college level and continued to do so until grade 12. With that being said I don‚Äôt know if any uni‚Äôs would have accepted me with college level math on my transcript. I told my mum about computer science and after going to the mosque and talking to some auntie, that auntie told her to send me to college first as it would be better on my resume and experience wise so at the end my mum forced me to go to college first like I was out with my friends and she literally applied to it for me without telling me it‚Äôs not something I was interested at all but she told me i‚Äôd be better. I am currently at my first year in college and it‚Äôs for Networking- Switching and Routers and imma transfer to a bachelors of comp sci after these 2 years (it‚Äôs only for a diploma) I was going through a rough mental state and feeling lost so I reached out. I was debating transferring after my first year which was this april because I don‚Äôt feel like this is where I wanna waste another year and I want to go to a university already to actually do what I want to do because I feel like i‚Äôm wasting my time here so I rather go to a uni for 4 years and not waste another day here. I know I can‚Äôt get into a top CS school program like Waterloo or UofT  as they don‚Äôt accept transfers. but I can definitely try for York University or Ryerson, not a big name but it‚Äôs a CS major regardless and it‚Äôs competitive. i‚Äôm in some dead college, definitely struck my ego. It‚Äôs like idk what to do rn, on one hand my mum wants to me finish this and I‚Äôm a year in with a year left so I feel like a year woulda been wasted plus a drop out on my record, it‚Äôs shit. But on the other hand This isn‚Äôt what I want to do at all like there are some CS classes but a lot are useless too. It‚Äôs stressful cos this combined with so much family pressure going on im actually stressed out. I feel like I sold myself short, even if I wasn‚Äôt accepted I rather know that and have that closure then thinking about what could‚Äôve been. I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm complaining but with everyone talking about the competition in computer science nowadays, I feel like I won‚Äôt make it in the field or I‚Äôll be left behind as all my other high school classmates keep elevating.",2023-05-29 14:16:53

So if someone would want to participate, then please dm me and I will send the questions/survey as a .word file or as a message (if you prefer that).

*The interview and all the information mentioned will remain confidential and will not be shared publicly,  it will only be shared with the professor of the subject.*

*Questions are translated from Dutch to English, I tried to rewrite it as good as possible.*

- After thinking, I will share the questions here already (so you know what it is about) and then if you want to participate (and help me out of course) you could send me the answers in a dm.

- My apologies for repeatedly asking about values and competencies, it is of the requirements for the interview.

1b2mut8,What is this set storage method based on?,"A few weeks ago I came up with a concept while working on a software project, one that I ultimately didn't use but found interesting. I'd like to post it here and see what kind of math it is related to, and if it has any particular name. The full idea is outlined below, but to summarize, it's a method of storing common elements in such a way that there is no redundancy in storage and individual storage sets / buckets can be combined to produce the original sets, or unions of those original sets, without any duplication.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say I have a few sets of elements **A, B,** and **C** with elements (in lowercase letters)**:**

* **A** = \[a,b,c,d\]
* **B** = \[b,c,d,e\]
* **C** = \[c,d,e,a\]

I want to make sets **X1, X2, ..., Xn** such that each element from **A, B,** and **C**, is stored exactly one time between **X1...Xn** (unlike **A, B,** and **C** where letters are present in two or all three). Furthermore, I should be able to reconstruct **A**, **B, C,** and any union of the three by combining one or more from **X1...Xn** such that there are no redundancies / duplicate entries.

To do this, I would follow the procedure:

1. Find the first set **Y** such that, for all original sets **A-C**, **Y** is either a subset or there is no intersection between **Y** and that set.
2. Assign that subset to the next **X** set (**X1** the first time, **X2** the second, etc.) and remove it from all original sets.
3. Go back to set 1 and repeat until no common subsets exist. Then, assign the remaining (if any) to the last **X** sets.

So for the example sets **A-C**:

* **X1** = \[c,d\], **A** = \[a,b\], **B** = \[b,e\], **C** = \[e,a\]
* **X2** = \[a\], **A** = \[b\], **B** = \[b,e\], **C** = \[e\]
* **X3** = \[b\], **A** = \[\], **B** = \[e\], **C** = \[e\]
* **X4** = \[e\], **A = B = C =** \[\]

Now, we can reconstruct each set:

* **A =** X1 & X2 & X3
* **B** = X1 & X3 & X4
* **C** = X1 & X2 & X4

From a programming perspective, I would also note the link between each **X** set and the original set **A-C**, so when it's time to union sets, like **A & B**, I could easily do so.",2024-02-29 00:44:49
1b2lf5l,Does The Flow Coming Through An Edge In A s-t Flow Network Have To Come From The Source s?,"You are given a flow network with edge capacities and edge cost with a source node s and a sink t.

Note that this may decrease the cost if those are negative cycles, even though the flow is not coming from S. Also, these solutions do respect the conservation of flow condition.

&#x200B;

Two instances of probably the same question. I want to show that I can alter a set of (potentially) infinite sequences such that the elements of the set remain distinct. I am worried that my reasoning breaks down in some way when it comes to infinite sequences.  
1. I introduced a lemma showing that you can choose an index and add any element after that index to each sequence containing an element at that index without making any of them equal. I want to use this lemma in a proof where I construct a new sequence by inserting a new element between each pair of existing elements. Can I apply the lemma infinitely many times in constructing this new sequence?

2. I also need to do a proof that involves mapping the set of sequences to new sequences where no element is always (across all sequences) followed by the same element. I can pretty easily write an algorithm to perform this process on a sequence and show that the resulting set is bijective with the original (the sequences have some other properties I can leverage), but again, is there some aspect of infinite sequences that renders are argument like this invalid?

An undirected graph has 24 vertices denoted by A‚Äô, B,‚Äô C‚Äô, D‚Äô, E‚Äô, F‚Äô, G‚Äô, H‚Äô, I‚Äô, J‚Äô, K‚Äô, L‚Äô, M‚Äô, N‚Äô, P‚Äô, Q‚Äô, R‚Äô, S‚Äô, T‚Äô, U‚Äô, V‚Äô, W‚Äô, Y‚Äô, and Z‚Äô respectively. {M‚Äô, Z‚Äô}, {M‚Äô, Y‚Äô}, {L‚Äô, W‚Äô}, {K‚Äô, V‚Äô}, {J‚Äô, U‚Äô}, {J‚Äô, T‚Äô}, {I‚Äô, S‚Äô}, {H‚Äô, R‚Äô}, {G‚Äô, Q‚Äô}, {F‚Äô, P‚Äô}, {F‚Äô, N‚Äô}, {E‚Äô, M‚Äô}, {E‚Äô, L‚Äô}, {D‚Äô, K‚Äô}, {D‚Äô, J‚Äô}, {D‚Äô, I‚Äô}, {C‚Äô, H‚Äô}, {C‚Äô, G‚Äô}, {B‚Äô, F‚Äô}, {B‚Äô, E‚Äô}, {A‚Äô, D‚Äô}, {A‚Äô, C‚Äô}, and {A‚Äô, B‚Äô} are the edges in this graph. Assume that depth-first search does not include any vertex more than once along any path, and the same is true of depth-limited search. Each edge is equivalent to two operators, e.g., the operators corresponding to {A‚Äô, B‚Äô} are A‚Äô --> B‚Äô and B‚Äô --> A‚Äô. Answer the following questions based on this information.

The graph looks like this: [https://imgur.com/a/EBdvO93](https://imgur.com/a/EBdvO93) 

And I have some questions about the following questions:

1) If A‚Äô is the initial state and V‚Äô is the goal state, how many states will depth-first search visit in the worst case?

2) What is the lowest depth limit that will allow depth-limited search to find a path from any of the 24 states to any of the remaining 23 states?

3) How many vertices other than D‚Äô and V‚Äô is depth-first search guaranteed to visit if D‚Äô is the initial state and V‚Äô is the goal state?

4) If B‚Äô is the initial state and V‚Äô is the goal state, what is the lowest cutoff needed by depth-limited search for solving this instance?

Is the answer for question 1 just 24 because that's the amount of states (vertices)? Or am I misinterpreting that question? 24 makes sense to me because DFS starts at the starting state (in this case A') and in the worst case would check a wrong state first and traverse that path fully, then back up until a branch is found, and check that (wrong) branch and so on and so forth until V' is found).

I don't really understand what 2) and 4) are asking. 2) sounds like its essentially asking the height of the tree to me, which would be 8, from V' to \[W', Y', Z'\] because that's the ""lowest depth"" from the 2 farthest away states. I'm not sure what 4) is asking though because it sounds like its kind of asking the same thing as 2) but like in reverse? Like just asking for the shortest path (if it picked the right path right away?)

Is the answer for question 3 just 1? It's only guaranteed to find K' along the path?

Sorry if my questions are stupid, I just want to make sure I'm understanding the wording correctly and that my knowledge of DFS is correct. Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",2024-02-27 04:03:04

1awjpgr,Which algorithm solves this graph problem?,"I am looking for advice on which existing algorithms solve the graph problem I am trying to solve.
I have broken down my problem into a sort of graph traversal, and am not sure what is the best method to generate the results.

First, I will explain the problem. Here is an [example graph](https://i.imgur.com/axfc9n3.png).

Any graph that is given to the algorithm has the following properties.

It must be:

* acyclic
* directed (the direction in my example image is always downwards)
* composed of nodes which are either two colours (S and A in my example)
* the graph has a single root S1
* every node has exactly one parent, except S1
* any S node has edges to **one or more** A nodes
* any A node has edges to **zero or more** S nodes

The algorithm should find every valid selection of the graph. A valid selection is a set nodes where there is exactly one A node
present in every S nodes set of children, and every S node is present.
That is, a selection is a subtree where from every A node the tree must include every
child S node, and from every S node the tree must include exactly 1 child A node.

For the example graph above, [this image](https://i.imgur.com/HyHDgpt.png) shows every selection. S nodes are visually excluded here, but we can say they are all
present in the subtree.

If it helps, here's an example of where this is useful. Imagine we were trying to list every possible outfit for a person. S nodes
could be the places on the body where one would put an article of clothing: `{head, neck, torso, feet}`. And A nodes would be choices
for that article. For example `head -> {hat, visor, bare}`, `neck -> {scarf, bare}`, `torso -> {shirt}`, `feet -> {shoe, bare}`.
In situations where there is more depth you could say a torso with a shirt might have a `sweater` or `no sweater`, etc.

Please let me know any resources or algorithms that solve this problem. Thanks!",2024-02-21 18:40:55
1aw8kcl,Does anybody else find AI content detectors to be really sketchy and misleading?," So I was just working on a writing assignment today and for shits and giggles I decided to pop it into some GPT content detectors to see what they said. I do use ChatGPT all the time, but didn't for this particular assignment.

I was somewhat surprised to see that 4 out of 5 detectors that I popped my paragraph into were extremely confident that it was written by a GPT model, including one (ZeroGPT) which was 100% confident. So I started popping in previous assignments which I had written, and was surprised to see that many of them were detected as AI generated content too.

The idea that these content detectors will soon be employed by teachers around the world who don't understand how they work to levy accusations of cheating against students frankly scares the shit out of me, and its very clear that the LLCs which are publishing these tools intend for them to be used this way. I'm not even convinced that the use of AI language models should even be considered cheating in many cases.

So that brings me to the second part of what scares me, which is the irresponsible way that these tools are marketed. The first time I was introduced to many of these tools they typically called themselves ""AI content detectors"", which seems pretty accurate. Lately I am noticing an increase in the use of aggressive wording on some sites, and a lot more labeling the use of generative NLP tools ""AI plagiarism"" (this wording is used by Writeful, ZeroGPT, GPTZero). But plagiarism is stealing another person's work and passing it off as your own. How can you steal from an inanimate tool who's whole purpose is to do exactly what you have done with it? Fortunately most sites still don't use this accusatory nomenclature.

But thats a bit of a pedantic question of when the tools are appropriate to use and I would rather let people form their own opinions and draw their own lines on what constitutes plagiarism. Whats **much** more concerning to me is the downright misleading claims of accuracy that some of these GPT content detectors are claiming.

ZeroGPT seems to be one of the worst offenders. They are clear about positioning their tool to be used in academic circles to evaluate student's work, and state clearly that they want universities to use their tool at large scale to detect what they call ""AI Plagiarism"". Their website claims ""we developed ZeroGPT's algorithm with an accuracy rate of text detection higher than 98%"". And yet their algorithm was 100% sure that my handwritten paragraph was generated by a language model as well as misidentifying several other things I've written over the years. They call themselves ""The most advanced and reliable ChatGPT detector tool"".

Guys, this scares the shit out of me. Way more than AI generated content does. These kinds of misleading and downright false claims are not acceptable. Students are going to get kicked out of school because of crap like this.",2024-02-21 10:06:33

If this is true and if we ignore jumps/branches for a moment, are the address values of each individual instructions (from these 4 fetched) preserved somewhere in the pipeline or are they lost because the program counter increments by 16 bytes? What if some 4-byte instruction from the middle of these 16 bytes tries to reference the current value of the program counter? I would assume that the instruction will expect the value of the (virtual) memory address of that specific instruction and not the start address of the 16-byte block, but how is this achieved if the program counter does not increment by 4 bytes?",2024-02-20 21:31:47

>Scalar Time provides an eventually consistent state of time. This means there may be places where the recorded time differs between processes but, given a finite amount of time, the processes will converge on a single view of the correct time.

I want to know if I understood it correctly - they mean to say that we lose consistency because the time stamps of each process are not indicative of whether an event preceded another? 

How would consistency improve if we used vector time to denote the logical time of events in that specific example

1auocg8,Is a single if statement technically AI?,"AFAIK, AI is defined as pretty much anything that we make a computer do that would require a human to use intelligence if they were to do it.

Following from that, simple video game NPCs that do stuff like checking distance to an objective and decide which coordinates to move to are AI. There may be the AI purists that insist on ""artificial intelligence"" being ""truly intelligent"", but I think most people would agree that this counts as simple AI.

But how low does it go? Is a single if statement technically already AI? A human would need to evaluate the situation, right?

Does it need to be 'complex' in order to be considered AI, and how complex does it need to be?",2024-02-19 14:18:10
1au52jp,Why is it said that one physical core appears as two cores to the OS when discussing hyper-threading?,"I was reading about the concept of hyper-threading as a form of simultaneous multithreading and I have some picture in my head about how it works, however I would like to clear all possible confusions. 

I read that the architecture state (that is, general purpose registers and interruption logic) is duplicated on a single physical core, but that execution core is shared among two threads. If I understood correctly, the consequence of this duplication of the CPU state along with the interruption logic is that OS now sees these logical cores as two separate physical cores.

My question is - what is meant by this ""appearance to the OS"" and how does the CPU state duplication exactly achieves this appearance of 2 cores?  

I mean, OS is not being run on some main core, my understanding is that scheduler is run on each core, so how can it ""see""/""conclude"" that there are two cores instead of one? Or do we mean that it appears as two cores because we have two program counters and each of them can jump to the scheduler whenever timer interrupt happens?",2024-02-18 21:14:55

the metaphor doesn't have to explain the whole stack, hardware, os, etc, it could describe a subsystem as well.

1atr3g7,Does Cook‚Äôs Theorem Not Amaze Anybody Else?,"Thinking back to school, I‚Äôve always wondered why nobody else found this theorem to be deep, amazing, impressive, etc. rather than just ‚Äúan important result that is useful to us because it allows us to prove problems are NP-complete easily‚Äù.

I mean the statement of the theorem itself and Cook‚Äôs proof without even considering how useful the theorem is, at least in my opinion, is inherently beautiful and kind of mind-boggling.

Is the common attitude among mathematicians and computer scientists not the same? Or was it just the people around me while I was studying. I recall at most *one* of my CS professors sharing this sentiment‚Ä¶maybe.

Just as a quick reminder of if you call the theorem something else, *Cook‚Äôs Theorem: The Boolean SATISFIABILITY problem is NP-complete*. Proving this would mean proving that for *any* language L in NP there exists a polynomial time transformation/mapping reduction from L to SAT‚Ä¶ without having a known NP-complete problem to reduce from. 

NP has such diverse languages, and indeed there are an infinite number of them, so very abstractly proving this statement with Cook‚Äôs gadget that restricts variables in such a nice way to force it to correspond to some accepting computation of a non-deterministic Turing Machine on some input (and the converse) is cool. 

Cook *created* the class NP-complete too in his paper, so it‚Äôs not like it was obvious anybody even knew such a problem must exist at the time.",2024-02-18 10:24:54

I tried (3) first because it had A in the middle and I could verify that (3) is possible. But when I tried (1), I could also find a tree for (1) . The tree is below. Unless the question was erroneous, only (3) can be possible. If so, my tree should be wrong. But I think its pre-order is A B D E H C F G and its in-order is D H E B F G C A. What is wrong?

Assume that breadth-first search does not revisit any vertex along any path.

If A‚Äô is the initial state and V‚Äô is the goal state, how many operators will be on the path found by breadth-first search?""

What is this exactly asking? Does the usage of the word ""path"" mean that after the search found the shortest path to the goal? Then how many operators? Also, the question states that each edge is equivalent to two operators, so does that mean the answer to the question is just the amount of edges from A' to V' multiplied by 2?

1aro2m1,Can someone point out the error in this proof of undecidability,"I was reading through the proof of the halting problem (specifically this one, in the proof by contradiction section: [https://brilliant.org/wiki/halting-problem/](https://brilliant.org/wiki/halting-problem/) ). But I can't understand why this logic doesn't follow to other machines (or functions) too.

Take the function **a** for example. **a** is the equivalent of the machine *A* in the linked proof. It takes two arguments, a function **f** and integer x. If **f**(x) = x then **a** returns true. Otherwise, **a** returns false.

    Pseudocode:
    
    a( Function f, int x )
    {
        if( f(x) == x )
        {
            return true
        }
        else
        {
            return false
        }
    }

Then we also have function **b** to represent the machine *B*. **b** takes one argument, a function **g**. **b** calls **a** with arguments **g** and **g** encoded as an integer. If the result of **a** is true then **b** returns **g** encoded as an integer plus one. Otherwise **g** encoded as an integer is returned.

    Pseudocode:
    
    b( Function g )
    {
        boolean a_result = a( g, encode_to_int(g) )
        if( a == true )
        {
            return encode_to_int( g ) + 1
        }
        if( a == false )
        {
            return encode_to_int( g )
        }
    }

I think this results in a similar paradox to the one created by the machine *A* in the linked proof when the function **b** is passed as an argument to itself.

Assuming **a** returns true in this case: the encoding of **b** plus one is returned, meaning **a** could not have returned true.

Assuming **a** returns false in this case: the encoding of **b** is returned, meaning **a** should have returned true.

And a function cannot return two different outputs for the same input.

The only difference I can see between this and the halting problem proof is that the function **a** is decidable (I think) so there must be a an error in logic, right?

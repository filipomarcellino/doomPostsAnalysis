And thank you all for the encouraging comments and support, I don't have many people I could talk to about this in real life so I want to let you all know this means a lot to me, and that I hope this never happens to anyone else.


Basically long story short is I was told I'm not suitable at my role. Coach thinks it's not worth undergoing an improvement plan. Feedback was I can tackle the projects but not hitting all the bars at my level.

166ati7,Australian Tier List,"Inspired by teamblind, thought i'd create a tier list of companies for fun. These can get quite controversial in the states, but hopefully not in Oceania since our market is much slower and smaller. 

My metric is **Brand** (How good it looks on a resume, or how well it's known), **Compensation** (Salary, and stocks) and **WLB** (Mostly word of mouth). The companies inside the tiers are in no particular order. For companies not included in the list and not missed (known companies but with no tech presence), i’d place them between tier 6 (WITCH companies have negative brand, pay and WLB) and tier 5 (Tech Presence > no Tech Presence).

&#x200B;

* **Tier HFT (Or Tier 0, not really CS):** Jane Street, Optiver, IMC Trading, Citadel, SIG*
* **Tier 1 (Big tech):** Atlassian, Canva, Google, Amazon*, Square*, Snap*, Slack*
* **Tier 2 (International Tech):** TikTok, MongoDB, Airwallex, Tyro, Adobe, Culture Amp, Wisetech, REA Group, Salesforce, Cisco, 
* **Tier 3 (Good):** Rokt, Commbank, Macquarie Group, WooliesX, Domain, SEEK, Sportsbet, Honeywell, Zendesk, Immutable, Carsales, Mastercard, Dovetail, Mutinex, Buildkite, Xero
* **Tier 4 (Mid):** Quantium, Airtasker, Freelancer, SiteMinder, NAB, Telstra, Optus, Westpac, Slalom, MYOB, LEAP dev, OctopusDeploy, ANZ
* **Tier 5 (Consulting):** EY, Deloitte, PWC, KPMG, Accenture, Thoughtworks, NRI, DXC, Intuit
* **Tier 6 (WITCH):** Wiipro, Infosys, TCS, Cognizant, HCL

Lastly, these are just my opinions, and i'm obviously going to miss out on some companies, so just comment and we can slot them in. 


*Counts as a 0.5. I.e It doesn’t exactly fit in the current tier but this company could probably be the top of the one below.",2023-08-31 13:12:40
19f44q5,"Embarrassed that I can't find a job, it feels like a dead end","Hey all, just wanted to share my frustrations and vent a little about my current situation. It has been quite a shitty year to say the least

I graduated mid 2022 with a CS degree from a go8 uni (Sydney) with decent grades (Distinction \~82 avg) + 1 internship and couldn't secure a grad job at the time. I've been searching for a job since then, posting my resume for feedback several times, building a portfolio of 3 projects and even doing 62 leetcode questions in that time. I've applied for well over 800 roles from internships to mid level out of desperation and out of those 800 applications I've done 7 interviews, which all took me through 3-4 rounds before failing

There are literally no jobs left for me to apply for. I've applied to every single job on every job posting site you can think of including Linkedin, Seek, Indeed, Gradconnect. I've even applied interstate across every role I could find in Melbourne, Brisbane and am willing to move if i have to

Now I feel like I barely have time to study for these interviews. To make ends meet I've started delivering for ubereats and menulog. It's not an ideal but I feel like i have to do it just to get by. The constant pressure from my family asking about my job search progress is starting to weigh on me. It feels awful to disappoint them day after day and I can't help but question if I made the wrong career choice

Anyone in the same boat or did I just choose the wrong path?

v1rgy8,"My Recent Job Hunt - 1 YOE, 2021-2022","Hi! This is a write up of my recent job hunt. I'm doing this because:
1. This is a fantastic market, and there is no reason we should be competitive and hide interview experiences and offers. Let's work together, I would love to see some similar posts!
2. I totally underestimated myself before I started this process. This is a post for my past self, and I hope it helps someone in a similar situation.

All offers are first-year only and are after negotiation.

## Context
**Time period:** September 2021 - May 2022

**Background:** 1 YOE at a big 4 bank. CS ungrad.

## Atlassian, Canva
Rejected at resume stage.

## ANZ
**Role:** Junior Engineer, ANZx

**Interview process:**
1. 2x Hackerrank technical interviews. Started with some generic behaviourals.
2. System design interview.
3. IQ/Personality test.

**Thoughts:** 
- Technicals weren't too bad, easy side of a Leetcode medium in difficulty.
- IQ test last was strange. I doubt you can actually fail the process on it.
- Smooth and positive process, apart from the IQ test which took forever.

**Offer:**

| Base | Super | Total |
| ----- | -----| ------|
| 91,000 | 9,000 | 100,000 |

## Afterpay
**Role:** Junior Engineer

**Interview process:**
- Technical interview. Leetcode easy-medium.
- Behavioural interview with the team.

**Thoughts:**
- Heard it's a very senior-heavy company. I was probably lucky to get an interview.
- Short process, I think they hadn't quite established how they wanted to go about interviewing a junior.

**Offer:**

| Base    | Performance Bonus  | Super    | Total      |
| ------- | ------ | --- | ----- |
| 100,000 | 10,000 | 10,000    | 120,000 |

## Macquarie
**Role:** Software Engineer

**Interview process:**
1. Generic technical questions, plus a Leetcode easy.
2. IQ test.
3. Final interview with generic technical questions.

**Thoughts:**
- The first interview also serves to match you up to a specific team, which is the team that interviews you in the final round.
- I got asked tons of questions about projects I've done and generic software engineering concepts.
- Little emphasis on live coding, the IQ test was a bigger part.
- The background check was insane. Be prepared to share about as much personal information as you need for a security clearance.

**Offer:**

| Base | Super | Total |
| ----- | -----| ------|
| 110,000 | 11,000 | 121,000 |

## Amazon
**Role:** Software Development Engineer - Fresh Grad (SDE1)

**Interview process:**
- Technical phone screen.
- Interview loop: 3x technical interviews (with behaviourals at the start), bar raiser interview (behavioural).

**Thoughts:**
- Phone screen interviewer was from Seattle, which was cool.
- Amazon seems to be growing in Australia. Had some great interviewers.
- Technicals were all leetcode medium.
- The interview loop behaviourals were 15 minutes at the start and were based on the leadership principles.

**Offer (first-year):**

| Base   | Signing Bonus | Stock | Super    | Total   |
| ------ | ----- | --- | --- | ------- |
| 144,000 | 27,000 |  3,000   | 14,000    | 188,000 |

- Recruiter phone screen.
- 2x technical interviews.
- Interview loop: 2x technical interviews, Googliness (behavioural) interview.
- Team match interview.
- 2x technical interviews for an uplevel.

**Thoughts:**

- I got put forward for an L4 uplevel by my recruiter, and had to do another couple of interviews.

**Offer (first-year):**

1410kpj,My experience and numbers from a recent job search,"Hi all,

Thought I would contribute to this forum with my experience looking for a new job in the current market and some numbers from offers I received.

**Current situation:**

I work at Xero as a Senior Engineer with around 6yoe. Current total compensation is 145K base salary + 10% in company shares + super, which adds to \~175K. I decided to look around since I've been at Xero for a while and I'm not enjoying the vibe after the layoffs that much. There's also a tech restructure coming up in July and wanted to sharpen my interview skills in case of more layoffs.

**Prep:**

I started learning algorithms and data structures properly mid-last year as I was never too good at them. I slowly read most of the chapters of The Algorithm Design Manual by Skiena, with a bit of leetcode on the side but not too intensive. I wanted to focus more on having a solid foundation rather than memorizing leetcode solutions.

I've also been reading Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann over the last 6 months.

I've always done well in behavioural interviews so didn't do too much prep for that.

I set my LinkedIn to Open to Work around early April and got contacted by recruiters. I only responded to opportunities that sounded interesting and did not apply to any jobs directly.

**Interviews:**

* Airwallex:
   * First round was with a recruiter, we chatted about the company and my experience
   * Second round was a interview with a Staff Engineer. We chatted about the project I'm currently working on, but I feel like he wasn't even listening lol. Then we solved a simple coding exercise (leetcode easy).
   * Third round was a coding interview with two Staff Engineers. I bombed this interview on a leetcode medium lol.
   * Outcome: Rejected, quoted TC was 220K. The whole process was filled with red flags so I wasn't too bummed out.
* ANZx
   * First round with recruiter
   * Second round was two one hour interviews with two ANZx engineers, 15 min behavioural and 45 min coding. Level of coding questions was leetcode easy-medium-ish.
   * Third round was another interview with an ANZx engineer, 15 min behavioural, 45 min software design. This was a weird interview, was asked how I would implement a system (both pseudo code and system design). I found it confusing as I didn't know how deep they wanted to go with each question, but I passed.
   * Outcome: Verbal offer at 165K TC, I rejected as TC is lower than my current.
* Small consultancy:
   * First round with recruiter
   * Second round was a live coding session with two of their consultants where we extended a piece of code, no leetcode style. There was also some question about testing, architecture, CICD.
   * Third round was a behavioural interview with senior leadership.
   * Outcome: Offer letter at 176K TC. I rejected as TC was the same as mine (though more cash) and I'm not sure if consulting is for me.
* WiseTech global:
   * First round with recruiter
   * Second round was all online, no human interaction which was weird
      * Online Hackerrank assessment with 2 leetcode easy-mediums, 1 SQL question
      * Cognitive assessment
      * Personality assessment
   * Third round was a technical chat with two engineers. Chatted testing, architecture, CICD and about my current project.
   * Outcome: Offer at 196K TC. Still debating whether to take this or not, there seems to be a lot of internal tooling and legacy tech which makes me worried my skills will stagnate and the TC jump + lost vacation days from Xero is not big enough to compensate.
* Atlassian:
   * First round with recruiter
   * Second round was two one-hour live coding interviews. Leetcode easy-medium, can find similar questions online
   * Third round was system design, can find similar questions online
   * Outcome: Passed both interviews with strong hire at P40 (mid-level), hire / lean-hire at P50 (senior) and they don't have any mid-level roles atm. Still waiting to hear if I'll keep interviewing for the next rounds or just leave it at that and continue later when more mid roles open up.

**Conclusion:**

All in all happy with my progress. I think preparing slowly (almost 1 year) and focusing on fundamentals really helped. I think for now I will stay put at Xero and try my luck again next year if the market picks up, or if I hear back from Atlassian.

1admu7a,Tips on getting into HFT/Atlassian/Canva Grad Programs,"Hi guys

  
My preschooler  finished pre-school last year and is going to be starting Kindergarten in 2 days  


I want some tips on how I can get him ready for grad programs at Atlassian/Canva/Big Tech and trading. As he is only 5 years old, I think it would be wise to give him a head-start to enter these lucrative careers. Early bird catches the bug haha.  


I have already bought him books such as [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com.au/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), [Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com.au/Algorithms-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X). I read 2 pages out loud to him during his bed time and I have been doing this for 2-3 months now. However one issue I am having is explaining concepts such as Time Complexity, Big O notation and Space Complexity in terms he will understand.  


I am thinking of telling his kindergarten teacher to be more comprehensive  when teaching mathematics.  


I also bought him a new computer and installed the latest IDEs such as Intellij/VSCode, but should I be using something more simple such as BlueJ or Scratch to get him accustomed to syntax of modern programming languages.

Soon I will introduce him to Leetcode and Competitive Programming, I am thinking for his 6th Birthday I will gift him premium leetcode subscription, so he can get a drift of how online assessments operate for these big companies.  


But before doing that I will make sure he has a fundamental grasp on algorithms.   


From a social standpoint I am trying to organize some networking sessions with hiring managers at Atlassian and Canva but for some reason when I dm them on linkedin asking for a catch-up they simply read me on leave :(  


2024 is going to be a big year so this is how his day looks like:

\- Wake up 8:30am, Go to school  
\- Finish school 3:00pm  
\- Finish school homework 3:30pm

\- Begin Harvard CS50 on programming. 4pm - 6pm

\- Complete programming excercises 6-7pm

\- Algorithms/Clean Code bedtime story 7-8pm  
\- Dinner 8-9pm

\- Bedtime 10pm  


What are your thoughts on this regime?

12feuzc,First Year Student Resume,"Hey!

I’m an international student doing my first year of Computer Science at Monash. I’ve made a little bit of a mock resume to 

1. Kind of inspire myself to work towards the person that this resume presents
2. Maybe start applying to internships and gain experience

I just want to get some advice and tips on things I could add to this resume to make me the ideal candidate. I’m planning to work on a big side project that I can use to show employers when I finally apply for internships probably beginning of second year.

Am I on the right track towards getting my foot in the door? What can I do to stand out even more? Specifically, what technology to learn?

1acuufq,My recent job hunt as a grad,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share my recent job hunt over the last few months. The market is **brutal** for new grads/juniors, there are barely any roles for us and the ones that exist have hundreds of candidates. I managed to secure a few interviews so I thought I might share anyway in case my experience provides any insight, though interviews do seem to be getting harder

**Context**

I graduated Dec 2022 from UNSW with a HD WAM and 2 internships at mid sized companies. I worked as a grad for a large company until I got laid off mid 2023. I've been job hunting since then and just started another grad role last month.

I ended up joining the ASX200 company but it was a bit of a paycut from my previous grad role, which paid me 85K + super.

**Big tech (2 companies)**

Role: Graduate software engineer

Interview process from what the recruiters told me - Rejected at OA for both:

1. Recruiter phone call
2. Hacker rank OA - 90 mins/5 questions
3. Technical interview (didn't make it to this one)
4. Technical interview 2
5. System design interview
6. Behavioral

Thoughts

* Both companies had pretty much the same interview process. Questions felt similar too
* The hackerrank was suprisingly alot harder than what I had to do for my internships/previous grad role. I used to get asked a combination of Easy/Medium but for both of these companies their hackerrank had 1 Easy/2 Medium/2 Hards. I haven't studied many hard leetcode questions before this so I was not adequately prepared

**ASX200 Company**

Role: Graduate software engineer

Interview process:

1. Phone call with recruiter - behavioral questions
2. Technical interview - 1 Hr
3. System design interview
4. Behavioral with hiring manager

Thoughts

* Technical interview was interesting, it wasn't a leetcode question but they asked you to build an MVP. Followed up with technical questions about scaling/optimizing.
* I tried negotiating to match my previous salary but they wouldn't budge

Offer:

75K base + super

**Big4 Bank**

Role: Graduate software engineer

Interview process:

1. Phone call with recruiter - behavioral questions
2. Hackerank OA - 60 mins/3 questions
3. Hackerrank OA - 60 mins/3 questions
4. System design interview
5. IQ test

Thoughts

* Hackerranks weren't that bad, mostly medium leetcode questions with an easy question to warm you up.
* Haven't had to do an IQ test before so this was new to me. The test itself wasn't too bad but had alot of questions so took quite a while to get through
* I also tried negotiating for this, they wouldn't budge either

Offer:

73K base + super

**Small company (\~40 employees)**

Role: Technical consultant

Interview process:

1. Phone call with recruiter
2. Technical interview - 2 hours. Mostly technical questions with a tiny bit of coding
3. Behavioral with hiring manager
4. Meet the team

Thoughts

* I decided to expand my search in case I couldn't find any SWE roles
* Interview was pretty easy and smooth
* JD mentioned that this role was pretty technical and the recruiter told me there are internal pathways to a normal SWE role so I gave it a shot

Offer:

65K base + super

orpobx,Job hunt as Sydney grad during COVID + Resume used: 2 offers received,"Hi all, I just wanted to share my experience of finding a job as a grad during COVID-19. I hope this is helpful.

Degree completed:

I graduated Nov 2020 with a partly non-CS degree. I majored in IT, so I did complete a few CS courses, like DS&A, SQL, learnt Python and Java. I also did a few units of first year Math (failed some) and business (also failed). I did pretty badly in first and second year, but worked hard in the later years to try make up for it. My WAM probably ended up somewhere around 60.

Mental health note: Uni work is challenging coming straight out of high school. Deciding what you want to do at 18 is not ideal. I struggled and felt like I was lost the first few years. Try and find a good support network, and remember the uni has resources available.

CV context:

After my first years I didn't want to show my battered transcript, so I focused mostly on extracurriculars. (I was so embarrassed to show my transcript I'd stop filling out applications if sending in a transcript was mandatory.) I did one internship, but that was not technical at all. It was at an infrastructure company where I worked on slide packs and misc tasks. I showed my interest in tech through volunteering at tech conferences and teaching kids how to code. Out of the items listed under experience, only 2 were paid. We met weekly or monthly for the other items on the list.

[\[... severely redacted resume ... \]](https://imgur.com/a/zCwkAUA)

Applying to jobs:

This is the resume I used to apply for jobs starting in Oct 2020. I received offers in July 2021. I also did cover letters for almost all companies. [Here's an excerpt.](https://imgur.com/a/iB8lHc6) 

Edit on LC, Language, Github Projects, Learning:

On LC: The OAs I did do were LC easy-medium. I still struggle with LC easy esp if I've taken a week or longer break from it. I still don't know Graphs or Trees very well, but I'm pretty familiar with Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, Queues + Stacks and Linked Lists. LC has an explore section where you can learn these topics and I spent some time there too. Algorithms (Searches, sorts etc) - I also tried to implement/do them at least once, whether it be through LC or another learning platform.   


Language: I stuck to one language the past year: Java. This meant I only applied to roles that had Java listed as a language or had a requirement like ""must know at least one programming language e.g. Python, C#, Java"". This meant I applied to less roles overall. I couldn't apply to those that had explicit requirements for certain languages and I didn't want to use the time spent learning those languages when I could be advancing in Java or practising LC. However, I'm still not entirely confident in Streams.  


Github projects: I have two. One is the three-hour take home task from Company A (mentioned below). it has the Java fundamentals: Reading and Writing from a file, Exceptions, Data types, Data structures etc. It doesn't feature a database or GUI, Spring Boot or web component. The other is a command line program that I completed on HyperSkill. It was a cinema seat manager, that printed out a matrix of available seats and the pricing for the seat number the user entered. Very basic but showcases fundamentals too. Company A never looked at it, and I'm not sure if Company B ever did.

Learning: I aimed for around 4-5 hours each day, 5 days a week. I wasn't working so I treated it like an actual job. I tracked my hours using an app and calendar.

[\[ here's a list of what positions I applied for, when and outcome \]](https://imgur.com/a/gclkRnQ)

Offers:

I received an offer from Company A (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, Amex) which started in Feb 2022. Process: (0) Resume screen; (1) Recruiter video call; (2) 3 hour take home assignment; (3) technical chat with SWE head of dept (choice of 2 LC easy questions, 1 system design question - how does Ticketmaster work?) (4) HR call (usual behavioural questions). They initially rejected me in May 2021 after the technical chat with SWE head saying they were prioritising another candidate but that I passed. They emailed me again in June asking if I was still interested. I completed the HR call and received an offer from them. Salary: 70k + 10% bonus (up to 25%).

I also received an offer from Company B (e.g. Accenture, ThoughtWorks, Deloitte) which starts in Aug 2021. Process: (0) Resume screen; (1) Recruiter video call; (2) 90min Hackerrank quiz (level was equivalent to 3rd year CS quiz?); (3) Pair programming (TDD); (4) Social values chat; (5) 10-min presentation and Q+A. Salary: 63k. I proceeded with this company because the culture at this place was more appealing. I think I'll also be exposed to more sectors and technologies working here, which will be helpful starting as a new grad. Also, I start work earlier and I need income.

The salary discrepancy is interesting, but I ultimately think I will learn more at the second company.

Hope this was helpful.",2021-07-26 02:36:22
1adi3av,Have tech salaries dropped this much?,"I've been job hunting the last \~3 months as a Senior dev.

For context:

I have 8 YOE, a masters in CS and spent the first 2 years of my career working at FAANG. I was laid off in 2020 and was recently laid off again towards the end of last year. In 2022 I was making 180k base + 20k stocks + super

I recently received these 3 offers, all are for a Senior Software Engineer role:

**Company A (Big4 bank) -** 135k base + 5% bonus + super

**Company B (Large company) -** 140k base + super

**Company C (Mid sized company)** \- 140k base + super (negotiated, they only offered to match company B only after asking me to share their offer email lol)

These companies have given me a week to accept the offer. I'm planning to accept one since I don't have enough savings and need money for my mortgage + kids but I'm wondering if salaries have dropped this much?

It seems a bit absurd considering these interviews had 5-6 rounds only to offer me the same as I was making as a mid level dev. I know a mate working in tech who made upwards of 200k during 2022 as well who's recently been laid off. He just finished an interview process with a smallish company with around 60 employees who offered him 145k for a staff level role, he has 11 YOE.",2024-01-29 00:42:19

&#x200B;

I want to know if it's worth going out of my way to do the classic LeetCode grind. From my understanding, very few companies require it in Australia. So obviously I don't think it'd be worth it if there's only 1or 2 companies like Amazon and Google.

Edit: What I mean by LeetCode grind are coding tests that usually contain LeetCode questions. Not coding tests that may involve creating a program while peer programming (such as a calculator or CRUD app). Algorithmic and problem solving questions.

* 27 total Jobs applied to
* Relatively casual applying over \~3 months, only ever had a handful of active applications going at one time
* Some places are much more strict with the ""Senior"" title than others, got bumped down or straight up declined for a handful
* 1 place went straight from the first interview to an offer (declined)
* A few places put my application on hold following Big Tech layoffs, presumably to see if they could snag people from that
* Most applications were ones I searched for on LinkedIn and applied for, maybe about 20% came from recruiters
* Salaries ranged from \~140-160 base, with 2 for around 175. I was aiming for 150.
* I'm pretty sure I only did 3 take home programming problems, everything else had live programming and system design rounds.
* Total coin flip if recruiters/companies get back to you promptly, or if you have to follow-up yourself.

Some context:

* 5 years total experience
* Backend-leaning Fullstack

&#x200B;

# Worst interview/application experience:

Xero, Vivcourt - heavy automated screening rounds with no direct contact with the people working there. Vivcourt especially with their take-home coding task which takes over 5 hours and I've heard people get rejected despite completing it.

I hate virtual behavioural interviews so that's why I hated Xero's application process.

Atlassian - seems fairly brutal and I was tilted to find out I got rejected from a 8 minute phone interview.

# Best interview/application experience (excluding the company which I got a offer at):

Jump trading - alot of casual talks and seems like a great environment

Dolby - nice interviewers

\*I would put the company which I ended up getting an offer for here because I liked the people that I ended up talked to.

# Notes:

HFT have an emphasis on OS concepts and networking but other fields felt fairly standard.

System design seems to be getting more popular, but most tech interviews are just leetcode type questions.

Getting along with interviewers I think has a major impact on making it to the next stage - even in the technical interviews.

Also: it feels like all extracurricular activities, WAM and projects go out the window for most applications once you get to the interview stage, where all that matters is problem solving and soft skills. I do feel like it does become useful for behavioural interviews as proof of interest.

# My advice for getting internships

I would say that studying leetcode and attending society/networking events probably was the two most useful activities for getting past the interview stage and also the screening rounds. Society/networking events  for building soft skills. Studying leetcode makes it so that you get past most screening rounds and past a decent amount of interviews.

I think that having good extracurricular projects/competitions/hackathons is good for getting to the initial stage of some HFT interviews but is mostly useless in other domains.",2022-06-01 08:37:48

Hey guys, I just wanted to reiterate the existence of this repository for majority of internships publicly available in Australia. This was based on my applications in 2023, so there probably will be some or even a lot of changes in 2024.

It's your responsibility to keep up with the time line and be aware of any changes of program or dates and more.

I'd like to keep this repository public so anyone can access or make changes. Any input would be welcome. 

I'll be respoting this link here and there through out this year so I'm sorry if it bothers you but I really think this would help a lot of students looking for internships.

This is predominantly made for domestic students (AU Citizen/PR, NZ Citizen) and international students will most likely not eligible for a lot of the programs on it. 

Once again dates are subject to change as well as not all companies on the readme will be hiring or there will be companies that are hiring that aren't on the readme file.

v83fdv,OP strat: study during the summer break for internships.,"I recently received a 6 figure internship/grad role. I hope this post can help any 2nd/1st year student.

I think the biggest contributing factor was studying accouple hours per week during most summer and winter breaks. This usually consisted of doing projects, leetcode and coursera (or generally learning any new topic and building a project out of it). I generally think that putting a small amount of effort over an extended period of time has huge benefits. It also improves general knowledge and makes certain classes easier. It's also way easier than studying during the semester.

Of course I sometimes took month long breaks from any academic activity, but I generally found it helpful to aim for some goal (maybe completing a project or lecture series) and then striving towards finishing it during the break. I found getting rejected by internships every season since first year motivating.

For context: I started off university fairly poorly with a 70 WAM and a 90 atar which is low considering that I think that most of my pears who have gotten a similar offer received an atar of 99+.

I recently (over the last semester) also started and found it useful to attend as much networking events as possible just so I could get used to talking to potential employers and improving my soft skills. I think this was also a crucial step. I still got rejected by a lot of companies in the behavioural interview so I think my soft skills are still an issue.",2022-06-08 23:50:34

1aigljk,Stuggling To Find Employees,"In what might be a stark contrast to other posts on this subreddit my company has been looking for a software engineer for about 3 months now. The job description is basically just:

\- Know Typescript

\- Know the basics of AWS Lambda and DynamoDB

\- Knowing a little Terraform or Python would be nice

That is it.

This is all for a backend position. We choose Node, Typescript, Python and AWS specifically about a year ago since we figured it would make hiring easier but that appears to be not the case. The only caveat of this job is that it is hybrid but I don't think that is usually. 

For context we have received about 200 resumes, phoned 15 people and interviewed 8. We ask 5 basic questions and a very short (<20 lines) review of some typescript code. Almost every single person we have interviewed has more than 4 years of experience and every single one has put ""TypeScript"" on their resume.

Previously, I've been honing my skills in order to break into big tech and now I succeeded. A bit of background of me: mid-level software engineer with 2.5 YoE.

But right after I received the offer, I found out I kind of lost in knowing which direction I should be heading, I'm not sure what should I invest my time and energy in to maximize my future gain. Of course, I could make climbing up the corporate ladder my short-term goal, but there's always a part of me inside telling me that's not all I want, I don't want to walk the path that most people walked.

I want to do something challenging enough that can impact the world in a significant way, perhaps starting a business and earn a whole lot of money which enables me to try out many other stuffs that I don't have the financial means to accomplish at the moment and bring goodness to the people around me.

I'm terribly afraid that myself ending up in mediocrity, pls don't get me wrong, I believe everyone in the world has the potential to create a huge impact in the world. But I'm seriously scared that I'll eventually forget about what I really want and get restricted by golden handcuffs forever (which is not a bad plan at all for most of the people). I don't want to end up being a slave to the bank, and working my xss in order to pay the debt that I borrow from the bank to buy for a pretty tiny house. Meeting brilliant people who wants to same thing as I do is also one of my reasons to join big tech, people as individuals are usually powerless but a group of people together could produce a tremendous accomplishment, sales & marketing are as important as your technical skills.

opatgb,"Atlassian VS Canva, Looking for insider perspectives (for Senior Software Engineer)","Hello everyone,

I am currently considering to join one of Atlassian or Canva as a Senior Software Engineer (with aspirations for a technical career pathway, e.g. Principal, Architect).

In certain regards they seem quite similar, in others quite the opposite. I am looking for experience reports from people at those companies, ideally maybe even ones who worked at both and could give a direct comparison view.

Areas of comparison I'd be interested in:

- The people you work with
  - Flair, e.g. formal, dynamic, fun, genuine, competitive, cooperative, ...
- Professional Growth (Knowledge)
  - At Canva it could be easier to step up or take on several cross-functioal responsibilities, helping you get set up for the next career step
  - It could be that Atlassian has more technical maturity and you learn ""higher level"" stuff
  - Resultingly in Canva you could develop more breadth, at Atlassian more depth
  - It could be that the promotion paths at Atlassian are more formalised and structurised, which could make it harder to get a promotion (e.g. in the individual contributor path from Senior to Principal)
- Affect
  - It seems Canva growing so fast creates more ambiguity and a start-up atmosphere whereas Atlassian might feel more stable and corporate
  - Canva could be more ever-changing and Atlassian more certain; positively speaking this could feel fresh VS consistent; negatively speaking it could feel unstable VS monotonous
  - Which company might give you feelings of: ownership, impact, being a cog in the machine
- Work life balance (overall load / stress during work, tendencies for working over time)",2021-07-22 10:02:44
hdsjzd,Seeking Advice From Former International Students in Australia,"Hi,

***A little bit of background first***: I'm an international student from Europe, currently in my final year of Bachelor of Science (majoring CS and DS) degree in Australia. I have a couple side projects, internship experience (in Australia) and my mark is decent (I have a D WAM at one of the top unis). So I'm fairly confident that I can get a job in Australia after graduation.

**Problem**

I have been looking for graduate role and it's been a little bit frustrating. Although there are companies that I can apply to, 80-85% of the vacancies require applicants to be Australian citizen/permanent resident or New Zealand citizen. Even when they do not state this requirement, I call their HR to ask whether I can apply, and they just tell me to find opportunities somewhere else. For example, one of the Big 4 accounting firms allows international students to apply for grad role as long as they have permanent residency or proof that they are going to get one. Unfortunately, international students cannot apply for PR after graduation, and so I asked their executive at one of my uni workshops about this issue and they just straight up told me to find another employer. The same issue comes up with some of the bigger tech companies as well where they are open to Australian citizens only (I'm not talking about FAANG companies).

Hence, my problem is that I cannot even apply for the role I want to, even though the Australian government allows international students to work in Australia for 18 months after completion of degree (and with one year of experience they are even eligible for permanent residency). I would feel better if employers reject me after an interview so that I can at least have a hint on what I need to work on, but the fact that they do not look at my CV because of my background is sad. Also, I would like to stay in Australia as I like the culture, national parks and I also have friends/family here.

**Question**

I am confident that I can get a job here, but I would like to have a chance at bigger companies as well. So I would like to ask former international students who got into bigger firms or people who know about similar situation, how did you manage to secure your role? Did you have similar feeling about finding jobs when you were student as I am having right now? Were you able to get an interview from employers that did not want international students to apply? What would be your advice in general?

Thanks in advance!",2020-06-22 13:41:44
18z2wa9,My new approach on take-home exercises: Why I'm now saying (mostly) no.,"You can say what you want about take-home coding assignments. Me, I used to like them. I still do, in that they're a chance to stretch my skills, learn new things, and showcase my problem-solving  to potential employers. It felt like a win-win: companies got to assess my technical chops, and I got a mini coding bootcamp thrown in and I got my hands on tech that my then workplace didn't have a need for.

But then, something happened. Four years after my second-to-last job hunting, they now seem... longer? I swear, I was given two in quick succession which were... well, I'm talking single-page applications with full-fledged backend APIs. ""It should just take two to three of hours,"" they said. Well, I don't know how they got that estimate. I used to think that, yes, they probably have had dry-runs with their employees to get an idea. Either that, or they asked their resident programming savant who could complete it in twenty minutes, operating purely on Monster energy drinks. But now, I suspect that if you give them a truth serum and ask, they'll reply with ""why, I pulled that number out my arse... kinda like what you do when your project manager asks you for a time estimate.""

But you've probably been in my situation. Three hours won't produce a SPA with an API worth its salt, more so if you're lacking a particular skillset or two. And so, the ""two to three hours"" that your assignment ""should"" take, turns into a weekend-and-then-some-long marathon.

Two weeks of my life gone, after taking two take-home assignments, only to be met with a ""we have decided not to proceed"" after I thought that I had aced the final interview and getting the role was a done deal!

So, I'm taking a stand. Here's the thing: our time is valuable. If I'm merely open to new opportunities, am not unemployed and my current job hasn't turned into a dunny after a B&S ball, I'm changing the game. If your take-home assignment requires more than two hours – which, let's be real here, it most certainly fucking will – I'm asking for my contract rate. That's right, I'm treating this like the professional work it is even though it's not a ""real"" application they can put into anything.

And how do we prove how much time we've spent? Don't care. Stay up late with me and proctor me through a live stream. Check my commit timestamps. If I work on it in parts, and you can bet your arse I will, I'll add to my last commit message that I'm finishing for this iteration.

If enough of us say ""no"" to unrealistic expectations and wasting our evening and weekends away just because someone thinks we're desperate (again, I'm not talking about the unemployed or someone whose current role is a right shitter), then maybe, just maybe, things will change. The interview process may become more efficient and more respectful. I mean that last bit. I sometimes felt this close like Stanley Jobson from ""Swordfish"" when Gabriel Shear's henchman was holding him at gunpoint while he was trying to finish a hiring exercise in under a minute.

And in case you're contemplating going through with the assignment, ask yourself -  is this a company that truly respects my skills and my time? If that's what they're asking me to do *now*, what's the treatment going to be like when I'm working there?",2024-01-05 09:26:09

Every time I watch them they make it seem like working as a software engineer is super chill. It seems to be either hybrid or 100% remote work, they get all these perks like free food + messing around in the office like half the time Or in the middle of the day they would just spontaneously go for a walk around the city. No micromanagement, they kind of go off and do whatever they want aside from the occasional zoom meeting or standup. And all of their days end at 5pm sharp, where afterwards they go have fun with family or play video games after work. These are all Sydney based by the way. Like is it actually this chill ??

14dwp1r,TIL: Why we get asked to put all the details from our resume into a form during applications,"TLDR: More Legally binding as ‘I haven’t embellished my CV’ and if you have they CAN fire you without further reason

So today I was talking to a few friends in recruitment and HR, application, the market, CV’s scanning into ATS, the usual stuff I ask about. 

The topic of form submission alongside CV’s came up, I hate it and think it’s a frustrating waste of time - as I’m sure we all do.

Turns out, the reason they do this is because while your CV can ‘technically’ have whatever you want in it (stretch the truth etc) the form itself will have a T&C’s which basically states something like ‘I have not lied on this form’. Short answer is it’s a liability cover, if they hire you and it doesn’t work out/ they wanna fire you/ whatever reason (and someone find out you lied on your CV) they can fire you without any risk of FairWork etc.",2023-06-20 01:11:22
12jfj6s,Junior dev expected to know Docker/Kubernetes/AWS/Kafka?,"Just started my first job as a junior developer 3 weeks ago. I got a ticket on my second day which was basically create a new app. I was taken aback because I was expecting some training first but I managed to finish it after 2 weeks as it was only working with React Code.

In the meantime I was shown a brief demo of Docker/Kubernetes/AWS/Kafka of which Docker was the only tool I even had a basic grasp of. The rest could have been said in Spanish and I wouldn't have understood less but it felt like I was expected to already to know these technologies. I was also shown once how to kill and restart a pod's process with Kubernetes with the expectation that I would be able to handle keeping all the services running from now on.

Since then, my team lead has been on leave and now everyone in the team is pinging me when a service crashes. Most of the time a simple restart doesn't solve the problem. I don't understand why the other mid-level developers are coming to me with problems when I am a junior.

I was expecting the main focus of my job to be writing and maintaining code, not being the one responsible for keeping everything running. Is it reasonable for a junior to be familiar with Docker/Kubernetes/AWS/Kafka? How normal is this experience for a ""developer"" and a ""junior""?",2023-04-12 08:44:10

Found out I just joined the redundancy crew today. Going to take a bit of time to process this but I anticipate the longer the day drags on, the harder it's gonna hit.  Trying to not take it personally, though it is my first redundancy. 

  
For context this is my first job as a SWE after uni (Syd based), I've been a dev at this company for three years now. I've been working exclusively on Flutter for their mobile app, which I believe puts me in a tough spot in terms of the job search as this is pretty niche tech.

**My current plan is as follows:**

\- Apply for any job I see releated to flutter if it exists

\- Upskill by learning either c# .net for back-end or Java spring boot (have a bit of experience in this) and apply for junior or entry level roles.

\- Take a temp job as I'm strapped for cash at the moment.

&#x200B;

Wondering for those of you who've been in this situation, what you did to get out of it? Especially once the imposter syndrome kicks in, because to be honest I still see myself as an entry level dev or junior right now.

I live with a parent right now and may have to move out alone next year.

* Working part time as a receptionist
* Studying on weekends/off hours to land a Data Analyst job (I've already self taught myself a lot, I've given myself 6 months as a goal, I think I could do it. It will just be a stepping stone while I'm at university so I don't have to work minimum wage).

**Why I'm studying:** I'm studying with the intention of getting a Bachelors in Computer Science (4.5 years from now) because I do see myself in software or web development.

**My worries:** With the cost of living going up, having to rent, I'm worried about the future. I've thought today that if I end up getting my Data Analyst job by June this year, I might just quit doing my degree after the first semester and self teach myself after work instead so that way I can:

* Live alone by myself if need be with more financial security
* Not having to rent with a flatmate and be frugal for 4.5 years working part time just to complete this degree
* Would save me thousands - I'm already 30k+ in debt from dropping/swapping out degrees in the past because I didn't know what to do.

I just care about my financial security a lot, but also how realistic is it to decide to self teach myself instead? I really think I would be more determined to do that if I was working full time for some reason.",2024-02-07 09:36:18

14edpec,University courses seem way more interesting and challenging than employment. Is this just my current situation?,"After doing 4 years of uni, I really enjoyed the work I did. I studied software engineering at the University of Adelaide, and we a bunch of \*seemingly\* complex programming learning individual programming skills like recursion, optimisation, networking, multithreading, etc, and used them to solve bigger problems like maze navigation, network consensus, make basic AI, etc. We then spent a good chunk of time learnign client interaction, requirements engineering, presentations etc. All of this was really fun for me, and I learned a lot about programming and was really excited to be an engineer. I got a 6.5+ GPA and a couple awards, and was told I could basically do anything.

Now I'm almost at the end of my first year as an entry level employee, and everything just seems so different. Without giving too much away, I basically work with React and Java/spring, and all I seem to do is retrieve from a database, do some basic manipulation, and send it to the frontend. My biggest programming struggle is which sub-folder everything is 'meant' to go in, and my biggest PR review challenge is if the seniors will agree on my variable names. We don't care about complexity AT ALL (no mention of big o notation, or anything). There is no complex algorithms to use, 0 maths involved, nothing interesting happening at all. Some of the people at my job didn't even need a degree to get hired.

So basically, I have a couple questions:

1. Is this just what software engineering is 'really' like? I did an internship at a defence company, and the challenges were definitely cooler, but not hard at all.
2. What type of work does it seem that I would prefer based on this image (just so I can do some research).

Hello,

So I’m an electrical engineer with 2.5yrs of experience and am currently thinking that I should’ve software eng instead. I specialized in HV design during uni but the few software courses I did were by far my favourite. I did c++(2units), matlab, assembler and ladder logic plc coding(my favorite). Realistically I’m not a beginner but still below intermediate in my coding knowledge. 

I’ve been considering the options of either a bootcamp, master degree or self learning. 

However with recent layoffs I’m worried the market is very inflated and over run with experienced SW engineers and recent CS grads and people who self learn with heaps of personal projects. Im worried about not getting a SW job due to stiff competition and leaving my current job which pays decently(80k). 

So for those in the industry,  
1) What is the Australian market like? 
2) Is the pay average or relatively high for entry level roles? 
3) Are the boot camps or master degrees here worth it? 
4) Are elec engineers working as software engs common here?

I've had 3YOE at a midsize tech consulting firm, and after some reflection during the Xmas shutdown, I've realised I have no further passion for continuing consulting work (although the soft skills I've developed have been particularly useful). 

There's no real pure technical career path progression beyond senior here; all progression afterwards either leads to sales+delivery lead technical work (which I’m being nudged towards), or architect roles divorced from the intricacies of delivery, and overseeing multiple projects at once. (Both pathways are highly respectable, but involve work I don’t hold strong interest in for now).

The technical delivery work is where I've derived the most joy. I've had software dev engagements ranging from being on 9-month staff augmentation on client teams, but most of the time, it's been shorter-term project based delivery work.

I'm interested in hearing the stories of others who made the switch, and perhaps the difficulties or unexpected friction in moving from tech consulting to product. Thanks in advance!",2024-01-07 06:53:47

ozlj10,Finding an Internship (Australia),"Hi all,

I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student :)

Does anyone know the best way to find an internship for software development in Australia? I have been keeping a keen eye out on LinkedIn, Jora, Seek, Indeed and GradAustralia. However, I probably find 1-2 internships posted per week.

I have tried cold emailing local development companies, however, most (all I have message) do not have a program or time to train up internships. 

I viewed a previous post on this subreddit suggesting to use Forage. However, that is a single day virtual internship, which I can't imagine employeers being intriuged by a one day internship.

So I was hoping to see how anyone else ended up getting their internship? Should I just move on and get a part-time job teaching children coding to get experience (a lot of jobs doing this).",2021-08-07 03:11:22

1acyhz4,2023 Internship Job Hunt Experience,"Hi, in light of the recently posted graduate job hunt post just thought I would give an overview of how my internship hunt went last year for anyone applying this year. Blurred out some dets, but im sure some of you will recognise so iykyk.

# Background

Had a previous internship, tech related but not SWE. No major extracurriculars or standout WAM, just some projects. Currently in a CS program at a go8.

# Applications

Applied to 17 places in total, no interstate roles as I didn't want to relocate and HFT as it wasn't an area of interest + would get skill issued by any maths component if I passed the coding parts anyways.

https://preview.redd.it/ag6andava5fc1.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=da05ec944048d3b62b604b1d32ef00406dea6a08

* Atlassian OA had an Easy + Mediums + 1 Hard. Failed miserably as I wasn't experienced with LC at the time, so would heavily recommend a brush up on LC if this is your goal.
* Suncorp is obsessed with personality quizzes, don't know anyone that passed this stage, lmk if you did haha.
* Canva OA was fairly easy, HR interview chill and the final technical wasn't bad either. 
* Xero was odd, aced their OA and thought I did really well in the video components, but was given a copy pasted rejection.
* Banks all seem to follow the same format of resume -> online testings (personality, IQ) -> video interview -> AC. 
* Consulting AC's was purely behavioural, just put up your hand whenever they ask if anyone has questions and be a team player in the case interview then ur good. The senior managers will just go through a bunch of questions they have on their paper that they are obliged to ask so be prepared for a barrage of 10+ behavioural questions in a row haha.
* Sadly 2 roles just cancelled their internship programs mid-way + some others I didn't put in.

# Conclusions

* Being good at behavioural is really important, not all companies will base off of LC and in fact many that are not big tech/HFT will either have easy's or no LC at all.
* Despite what I said above, being good at LC is a huge plus. Maximising your chances of entering big tech is always good and doesn't hurt to aim high + cast your net wide.
* If you do not have previous internships, it is important to have some sort of part time job and decently fleshed out projects to talk about. Talking about my projects + going through a quick demo of it seemed to peak the interest of many interviewers. 

Happy with what I am in right now, hoping to get a return offer or better offer elsewhere for grad. Hope this helps clarifying some details for others seeking internships this year.",2024-01-28 08:58:57

1853o80,Did I make a mistake turning down $110k,"Have been discussing a new role with a recruiter over the past few weeks. It's a very very small startup where I'd be their first official perm hire. They have a CTO writing code, but wanted to hire a full stack mid-level Dev with strong FE experience, as that's where the CTO is lacking.

After discussing with them, it came up that I'd have ownership on the FE and most decision making would come from me and my experiences. 
I'd be fine with this as my last two roles I was either in charge or majorly involved in the direction of the FE (both smallish startups). 
I'm very strong on the FE but not so much on BE (just experience from hobby projects, so I would have developed skills here too)

After checking the HAYS 22/23 and 23/24 reports, looking on LI and seeing the (wildly varying) salaries, I thought something like $130-140k would be suitable since it felt much closer to senior than low-mid.

But they said that that's not reflective of the market at that $110k was all they were willing to offer.

I feel like this is too low for the work cut out and they were making an lowball offer/offer on my perceived value rather than the role they were trying to fill, but maybe I don't have a good read on the Aus market (I'm moving from overseas).

Was $110k a reasonable offer?",2023-11-27 14:03:40
145widd,Career advice for recent grad,"Hello, 

Graduated end of last year with a cs degree from a top uni in Australia. I graduated with a good wam, but no internships or work experience. Since graduating I have been applying to graduate roles in software with no luck, only landed one interview and that went nowhere.
Recently I have been applying to other jobs in tech because Im starting to feel the pressure to find something. 

After the first place I applied for, I got an offer at a small IT/MDM company where I would basically be a help desk IT guy at 65k per year and now I’m really not sure.

On one hand, I’m really not confident on actually landing something in software engineering by next year given how it’s gone so far. Im also not sure what the career progression is like in IT because I don’t think I want to be stuck in help desk for years and years. Also worried how it might make it really hard to pivot into software later if i wanted to, since grad programs wouldn’t be available for me and I don’t really have the experience for a junior role.

On the other hand, a job is a job and I’d probably somewhat enjoy the work. Also with the increasingly large time on my resume where im just working casually, it probably wont do me any favours for future roles if I dont take this opportunity and then dont find anything this year. 

Anyone got any thoughts or advice for me?",2023-06-10 10:14:37

**1) Identify your targets**

\- Hiring Managers

\- HR/Talent Teams

\- Peers in the job you want

Get specific, e.g. looking for Software Engineering roles, look up SE Recruiters, Dev Managers etc. LinkedIn is a great for this step

**2) Build out your own CRM, Excel is good. A tool called Folk is better**

Auto import and categories people, Folk has a one click import which works well

**3) Dig up their email**

Ideally you want their work email, again a few tools out there, Hunter/Mailscoop, RocketReach and Skrapp, if not LinkedIn inmail is ok.

**4) Craft a killer subject line**

Keep it short, intriguing and relevant, here are some ideas:

\- touch on their background

\- Something they did

\- Something they wrote

e.g. Your LinkedIn post about X software framework or whatever

**5) Hook them in**

The start of your message needs to be personalised and include your reason for reaching out

e.g. I read your LinkedIn post about the benefits of the AngularJS and this resonated with me since in working at organisations that embrace this thinking/framework/concept etc

**6) Prove your worth**

Basically showcase how you can solve their problems or add value to their company in a few bullet points.

\- Accomplishment/Skill #1

\- Accomplishment/Skill #2

\- Accomplishment/Skill #3

**7) Clarify your intentions**

Make sure you give them an understanding of what your looking for.

E.g. ""I am really interested in (company/industry) and I'd love to learn about your experience, exciting projects your working on, and potential career opportunities where I could add value""

**8) Call to Action**

Don't leave things open ended, make sure you make the ask

e.g. Would you be open to a 20minute virtual coffee chat over the next couple of weeks, if it's not a good time, I completely understand. Either way, hope you have a great week

**9) Hit Send**

If you use folk, you can bulk send the personalised emails and it will track them all as well, clicks, replies etc

**10) Follow up**

If you don't get a response, that's ok. Follow up, I suggest once or twice, so wait 5 business days before following up, and then move on.

12qn78m,HFT: Is it worth the time to learn C++ or stick with Python?,"Hi, 

I have been thinking about this for a while now. 

I know C++ is highly valued in High-Frequency Trading Firms.

I know Java, and **I am now doing all my leetcode with Java.** 

However, as Optiver & IMC require Java / C++, SIG prefers C# / C++ and Citadel & Akuna requires Python / C++ for their interviews, **I don't know if it's worthwhile to:** 

(1) **Learn C#** as I already have an understanding of Java, but C# is only being used to assess in SIG. 

(2) **Learn C++** as it seems to be used for assessment everywhere, but I only have a foundation in C (and not a very solid foundation). With 6-8 months of the learning period, I am probably nowhere near the students who have been doing competitive programming with C++ for YEARS. 

(3) **Start doing LeetCode in Python**,  but again, only Citadel & Akuna allow Python for their assessment. I am more familiar with Python than C++, obviously, and I can probably do Python better than C++, but the usage is limited.

10o9anq,Advice for Pursuing a Front-End Position at Atlassian or Canva,"Hello all,

I’m a self-taught developer currently employed in my first job: on the front-end at a small start up, working in React/Typescript. I’ve been in this job for just over 6 months. I am contracted for a year, so I guess I’m now considering my options/plan of action. 

My ideal, ultimately, would be to work for either Atlassian or Canva on the front-end.

So, my questions are:

1. Is this a feasible goal for someone without a Computer Science degree? (I have a degree, though in an entirely unrelated field)

2. If so, would it be realistic to shoot for it this year (as in spend the next 6 months or so acquiring the required skills described in the entry job listings from these companies and then apply), or would having only 1 year of industry experience be insufficient?

3. Is it a good time to be changing jobs, given the significant layoffs happening in other countries?

Any answers or even any general advice much appreciated.

Mainly looking for people’s anecdotal experience with pay ranges for devs with 2-3 years xp. i.e
-	How much you, your peers or colleagues at this level of experience make
-	What you believe to be the average salary for this level of experience and what you would consider a competitive pay for this level (excluding trading companies)

My anecdotal view:

Average - 110k to 125k base (usually no equity or bonuses); Going rate for big 4 banks and well funded startups 

Competitive- 125k to 140k + 25 to 50k RSU(aud); Going rate for google, atlassian etc",2022-05-27 11:44:08

1bb6rtp,CS Careers are weird?,"Hi, I'm looking for some advice for what exactly a career path in CS should/normally look like and if my current situation is bizarre. For educational context, I have a BEc and a MSc in AI/ML.

I have worked as an Engineer for 3 years as of July of this year. I was hired as a Data Scientist, but instead I'm treated as an Engineer in a big 4 bank. 

As such, I was forced to basically do full stack dev: I do ETL/ Data Engineering stuff, I have built an Integration testing suite based on Behave, I do Terraform/HCL for DevOps with CodeFresh, Cloud Dev for AWS & GCP, ML Dev for some models on our internal sales platform and a Chatbot, Web Dev for some web applications I have developed and deployed etc etc.

I assume I have been robbed, as I get paid around USD 66k a year. I'm not in the USA, so converted it is about 100k AUD. I'm happy to have that stuff on my resume but at the same time, the fellow java dev gets the same pay and they only do Java dev. My logic is that it helps me get out easier, because banks suck but the job market ATM is crap.

My role is bizarre, we work on AWS, soon to move to GCP. We have fortnight sprints where we just attempt to fix the setup that was done by the contractors hired before I joined the team. We do monthly releases to PROD by I have no deadlines with any work, at the same time, the two senior devs are exclusively Java devs who have almost no Python experience and as such, I organise all the Notebook libs, lambda layer runtimes, Glue Jobs etc etc.

After discussion with my superior about how bizarre this situation is, I was told:

* This is a dead end role. No pay increase & no progression (I'm the most junior person in the team).
* My education doesn't mean anything in the commercial realm.
* If I want more money, I should get out of CS/Programming. (I don't like CS, I like money).

Is any of this normal? This is my first corpo tech job and Australia is not known for it's innovative tech workforce.

1. On one hand, I feel that I'm doing way too much for a Jr, which I'm not sure if I even still should be a Jr anymore, after almost 3 years and the responsibilities I have?
2. At the same time, the work is easy and I don't understand what constitutes the difference between Jr and Snr.

Do I have any ground to say ""Hey, I can do all of this stuff, I'm not exactly the same as the Junior dev that can't write Java to save his life.""

Where is the line where I have the logical standing to justify my expertise?

I have this problem, which apparently isn't enough of a problem to pay me more, where when I get asked to do something I haven't done before, I just do it, or work out how to do it, like learning Scala or Java or learning how to use X framework or tool or entire area of programming instead of just saying ""I have never done it before"".

I think that maybe by becoming more valuable that I will be rewarded, but that doesn't seem to work IRL.

I would like to leave, but this presents a new problem, I'm in this weird middle ground where I am too experienced for a Junior role, but not enough (apparently) for a Senior role, I'm specialised in one field, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude in my MSc, but I can do pretty much everything but in the end, none of it seems to matter at all?

Is any of this normal or familiar to anyone, I don't know if I hit the jackpot or I'm cursed?",2024-03-10 09:56:27

I’m a 24 yo data scientist with a stable job that will see me earning around $120,000+ within 5 years, but I find myself being bored at work. I went into data science after a maths and stats undergraduate followed by over a year working as a software developer. I made this move because I was just maintaining an ancient, uninspiring piece of enterprise software. I thought data science would offer me the chance to use my degree and let me do the stuff that I find exciting: machine learning, regressions, applied statistics, statistical/mathematical modelling, etc. Unfortunately after 2 years in my ‘data science’ role, I have spent less that 5% of my time doing that kind of work, and the majority of my time has been spent ingesting/collating horribly formatted spreadsheets and creating basic graphs. I don’t mind cleaning data but I rarely get to do exciting things with it after.

Looking on the internet, I get the impression that the majority of ‘data science’ roles are probably a lot like this in Australia - particularly since I don’t live in Sydney or Melbourne. Is that pessimistic?

It seems as though the work that interests me is more likely to come from research roles. Am I right to think that?

Under the common guidance that more/better skills will lead to more opportunities, I am considering going back to uni to pursue my honours in applied maths / stats and potentially a PhD. However, I’m concerned that my opportunities will be similar even if I relocate to a big city.

What further complicates things is that I don’t want to work for oil&gas, defence, advertising or betting websites. Am I asking too much?

I understand this is a similar feeling for every grad, and it's incredibly stressful to handle whilst finishing off your last year, but I just wonder for those who have been in the industry for a while, what are your own methods with handling rejection?

1bjyi81,"Not pity mongering, just need cold hard career advice","Fully expecting to be clowned on for what I'm about to share in this post. I deserve it, but I really need advice on how to progress from my situation.

I'm an international on a working visa that expires end 2026. I graduated mid 2021, and I've been out of tech job since late 2022. The last half of my 3 yr degree was entirely online due to COVID, and I lost a lot of motivation as a result of lockdowns + living alone. Also missed out on many typical networking opportunities due to this.

After graduating, I ended up being put on a bridging visa from graduation until what ended up being late 2022 thanks to delays in processing applications during COVID. For locals: bridging visa is the visa they put you on while assessing your visa application. You have full working rights, but since it's essentially not confirmed whether you'll be allowed to stay in the country, no company is going to look at you. 

Which is what happened to me, I ended up working hospitality to make ends meet since bridging visa made searching for full time work near impossible. I did get a small tech job through a contact during this period, but they ended up treating me really poorly: severely underpaying me, and I was essentially given a really big task of migrating a mobile application by myself, while working entirely from home and only ever speaking to my superiors through email or Skype. After I completed this task they unceremoniously called me saying that they no longer had work for me and I was laid off.

At the time I just sat there and took it because I was an international in an already disadvantaged position, and I didn't want to speak up and ruin the one lead I had. Since then I've been working hospitality and other odd jobs (currently writing teaching materials for a tuition agency), I dropped off with sending out job applications/Leetcode practice etc. 

I know I've been stupid with my time and my energy by essentially letting myself get to this point where I'm stranded, even if I did have reasons for burning out. My status as an international with a funny foreign name don't seem to help my chances in the HR department either.

I've attached my resume here, and I'd appreciate any advice for changes I can make/events I can attend/programs I could sign up to, anything to build my network or upskill or anything of the sort. Just anything so I can make progress with this rut I've dug myself into.

TLDR: got depressed/lazy due to graduating/studying in covid, got burnt out being treated unfairly at my one true tech related job, didn't really apply myself afterward, now struggling to claw my way back into the industry.

1avbue9,How to propose changes in a company?,"I've recently been lucky enough to land a job in Melbourne so I'm definitely not complaining, but the place I've joined is stuck in the past. Everyone there has a tenure of between 10 \~ 30 years and no recent exposure to modern SDLC.

For some context when I joined they briefly mentioned ""oh yeah we use TFS, not git"" - no biggie I thought, I'll just pick up a new VCS. But when I started work it turns out there's some pretty major flaws with their workflow. Probably the most shocking to me was that there's no form of code review, like at all. Which is made even worse by the fact they don't use branches either. So **all of my and everyone else's code (and inevitable bugs) goes straight to the release with no review.** Their mentality is that if there's a bug the testers will catch it at some point and then we'll fix it later. There's also no code style or linting checks on large portions of the codebase and some of the stuff I've seen is shocking. I keep imagining how easily this stuff could be picked up by simply running some ci when a pull request is opened.

It assume TFS probably can actually do things like code review and branching (not sure about pipelines) one way or another but after coming from more modern projects and companies where git is de-facto industry standard I really can't help but think there'd be a lot gained by switching to it. The problem here though is that no one at the company has even used git, and most have barely even heard of it, so there's massive overhead in migrating.

I'm keen to hear if anyone has been in a similar position before, and how they navigated floating new technology to senior developers / managers without getting shutdown instantly?

Hey, I'm a final year student studying CS at UNSW and will be starting to apply for software engineering grad roles very soon. Unfortunately despite my best efforts last year, I was not apply to pick up an internship over the summer, and so my resume is looking a bit bare.

Any advice to improve the resume or general words of advice for landing a grad role? I will note that the first project in the projects section is a Uni project that I really enjoyed, while the latter two are smaller front-end projects that I did to teach myself React.

However, the project that I worked on in ""Uni Society 1"" was much more substantial than those 2 react projects, and included team work, agile (i think?), use of a ticketing system etc so I was considering moving that project into the projects section to replace one of the others (but its not really my project, I've just contributed to it, so I'm not sure).

I'm 100% remote and I live rural and for reasons I can't move to a main city.

Most my work has been around web and mobile dev, react native / expo / flutter and i really enjoy it. Uni so far seems like I'm spending a shitload of time to learn stuff that is somewhere relevant but also most of it so far I could learn in a few weeks by myself anyway. I've made a few friends in their final year of software engineering (same degree I'm doing) and been helping them with their final project and honestly it's a joke and about 10% as complex as what I currently do daily at work. By the time I get there assuming I managed to keep deving ft it'll be a total waste of a subject.

vfl7rj,Relying on recruiters as a way to get consistent contract work?,"**TL;DR**

Has anyone made a career out of doing contract work and having regular periods off each year, say 2 or 3 months between contract and still been able to easily find work by establishing a closer relationship with a couple of recruiters? Using recruiters is to circumvent the need of establishing your own professional network to build a work pipeline.

Is this unlikely because most contracts are either longer than a year, or undertaken with the idea that you will automatically roll on to the next without long breaks?

**Thoughts that prompted the question**

I've been casually looking at the job market and the majority of jobs are posted by recruiters, or there are a lot of recruiters reaching out to see if I'm interested in positions they have.

I'm thinking about where I want to go with my career lifestyle wise and trying to see what options are available that will allow me to enjoy life. I'm aware of FIRE, but this has never appealed to me as I want to enjoy time *now* or reasonably soon on a regular basis, rather than trying to maximise salary and slog it out for 10 or 15 years. Ideally what I would like is an arrangement where I can take 2 or 3 months off each year to travel, or take it easy at home, whatever. With my past 2 jobs, I get 4 weeks a year and have had to use a little over a week of leave over Christmas as company policy. That combined with taking a couple of days off in the year to have a long weekend and I really only have 2 weeks left which does not fit in with the style of travelling I want to do.

Why I think this might be a good arrangement for me is I am an excellent saver and have relatively inexpensive tastes. I do buy expensive (to me) things every now and then but with the idea to make it last, not be caught in a constant upgrading cycle. I also don't care for cars, I don't want kids and my idea of travel is long distance hiking, camping, maybe biking, or road trips rather than staying in expensive hotels and visiting tourist traps and doing package tours. I do have a mortgage though and the expenses that home ownership brings.

Back to the job market, I am seeings lots of contract work posted by recruiters paying $700 - $1000 a day, well above what I earn currently. I'm wondering if its a better arrangement for me to move to contract work considering my lifestyle, desires, and the fact that what I really want is high pay and more control over when I work and don't.

kdfq5x,26yo wanting to become a software engineer. What is my most realistic path? Any advice welcome.,"Hey all,

Thanks for reading. My question is, how feasible is it to get a well-remunerated position at a place like Atlassian without having a CS degree? I have a Bachelor of Commerce majoring in economics and finance from Melbourne University, and would like to avoid returning to university if possible. I live in Melbourne but am happy to move anywhere in Australia for the right job.

I am 26yo, and through the course of COVID-19 I have discovered and pursued a new passion for software engineering. I have completed CS50 and found it really enjoyable, especially the algorithm and data structures stuff, and I am currently working my way through The Odin Project. I have built an AI-driven Tic-Tac-Toe game using the minimax algorithm, which can be played here: [https://atlas-1510.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/](https://atlas-1510.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/)

I am currently working in an economic consultant position, but it is not what I want to do long-term. The thing that appeals to me about software engineering is the ability to build actual tangible things that actually solve real-world problems. Kind of like a carpenter building a house, or an artist painting a portrait. In contrast, my current role is all about research/advice/forecasting, with little direct impact on the world. Basically, my job is to write reports, sound confident, and convince clients to trust what I say... even if I don't believe it myself.

I am in a bit of a weird position, as I currently earn $75k per year for basically one day of ""real work"" per week, despite it being a full time role. It really is incredible. I have found myself in a role that requires little effort, but upper management in my company are not aware of this (or maybe they are, but they just don't care?). I have been with this company since 2017, when I graduated. 

In any case, I have plenty of time to devote to self-training towards the goal of becoming a professional software engineer, and a strong family network to support me even if I somehow lost my current job.

Any advice at all is appreciated, particularly around whether it is unrealistic to think I can get a job at an A-tier company like Google/Amazon without a CS degree. Also, if it is feasible, how should I be allocating my time to achieve this goal? My current plan looks like this:  


**Complete the Odin Project**

In progress, doing the full-stack javascript path.

**Develop side projects**

1) Smart mirror app with facial recognition, interface with calendar/music/stocks/weather etc.

2) Web project that scrapes SEEK and other job sites, and analyses data to show trends in salaries and demand for different coding languages/stacks/competnecies over time

3) My own version of Apple's Siri (this is very ambitious and maybe beyond my ability, not sure)

**Grind Leetcode**

Seems to be a requirement for any interview, but I have plenty of time so not too big a deal.

**Interview**

... **Profit?**

All the Cloud & Ops related stuff was interesting at first, but since I've never experienced the development side of things, I find my knowledge in it lacking, and my itch for coding unscratched.

&#x200B;

I need some input on this:  
\- I can either stay in the Cloud space and build a career around it, but seeing as I don't have development experience, I fear I'd never truly be a good SRE.   
\- Pivot to a SWE role and take a pay cut, work my way up from there, depending on which company/team I join, this could also end up backfiring as I get stuck with repetitive work.  


I have offers lined up in the cloud space at around 200k inc bonus ex super and higher, and I'm interviewing at a big tech here + a start-up for more junior SWE roles, starting $ is going to be lower, potentially around $100\~130k + bonus + RSU.  


Obviously, money is one factor in this equation, but so is longevity, future growth, job security, career ceiling and future earning potential. What do y'all think about the prospects of these two professions? And if you were me, what would you do?",2023-03-08 12:11:52
11dsozr,Calling all interns & new grads to-be,"TL;DR: Is there an OCE based discord or similar for us sweaty try-hards who are attempting to land high-tier internships/grad roles? If there isn't, would anyone be keen to join one? Somewhere we could share resumes, interview prep, leetcode and generally support eachother. If you're interested please reply or DM me.


More broadly, how do you balance Uni/Leetcode/Personal Projects/Life? Do you find your personal life suffering?


Long version (I think I just need to vent 😅):


I finished my first year of CS (no prior programming background) feeling good with a 3.9 GPA and a 1st place in a RMIT cohort-wide hackathon. I figured I had a good 3 months to learn DSA, do a decent amount of leetcode and get a solid personal project under my belt. Unfortunately, life had other plans and I didn't get nearly as much done as I'd like. 

Now the big tech dawgs have started interviewing, I'm feeling extremely unprepared and I am struggling to find peers to keep study alongside. Nobody I've met at uni really seems to care and this is the only community I know that seems to talk about this process locally. I am feeling isolated knowing there are 1000s of people applying for these roles yet I can't find anyone to at least suffer alongside 😅

I'm a 2nd year CS student at RMIT and haven't even had a DSA class, I've tried learning things on my own but it's going a slower than I'd like and the big tech dawgs are already interviewing.

I am feeling extremely overwhelmed by what is expected of interns (even for mid-tier tech it seems) and honestly a bit baffled at how anyone finds the time to balance Uni, a job, personal projects and leetcode while keeping any semblance of a lif. It seems simple on paper but so much harder in practice. What are your secrets? Are you also feeling put through the wringer?

10zm77a,What do young people on this sub think about WFH?,"Although its in all industries now, it seems like tech industry is the most lenient and encouraging in terms of WFH. Also maybe because we tend to be more introverted compared to those in other industries like finance?...

I wanted to ask what you all think about it particularly as it seems like there are a lot of young people (20-30's) on this sub.

Personally, Im a big fan of it and won't ever work a job which expects me to come into the office 4-5 times a week. In my current role I come in 2 days a week and that's perfect as when It hits 5pm I still have the energy to meet my friends and do other things. I live in Western Sydney and coming into the office everyday would be hell for me.

Im also way more productive at home as I feel I can focus properly where as in office there is just too much noise.

10aowuk,Career Path as a SWE (Technical vs. Management pathway),"Interested in learning about your pathway as a software developer. Whether you:

1. Stayed technical (Whether you achieved principle/architect) or pursued the manager route.

\- Why did you pursue this pathway? Wanting to know your thoughts on the financial and personal aspects.

2. Your career trajectory in general (from junior to current role considering years)

Trying to gauge how people have navigated their career. For example, I personally don't do much software development after work, if at all. So I'm not expecting to move up the ranks very fast. But I'm interested in seeing what people have done with their lives and careers.

A sample response might be like:

John Doe - I personally haven't be driven to climb up the career ladder. I tried management and could have earnt a lot more money than being technical, but it wasn't my cup of tea.

I have an interview coming up with Atlassian shortly for a senior cloud engineering role.  
Has anyone been through one of these - that could shed some light on what level of knowledge is expected?  


It's a cloud role heavily based on tech in AWS, but they also want someone with senior level python programming who has made webapps using something like Flask.

&#x200B;

My cloud experience and system design experience is top notch, so I'm focusing all my time on creating apps in python using the Flask framework.   
(I'm experienced in mobile dev(Java), and have been using python for years so picking up Flask has been pretty easy)  


  
I'm also studying algorthims and data structures - but it just feels strange going to this level of programming detail for a cloud role.

Has anyone successfully interviewed for one of these roles, am I on the right track of what's expected for such a role?",2022-06-18 05:54:41

v3tcfl,Feedback Request: IT Job Board for AUS/NZ (update),"Hey all,

I took your advice to heart and changed a couple of things you guys mentioned in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsOCE/comments/u7cpt2/feedback_request_it_job_board_for_ausnz/) as well as added some new features.

Quick Summary: I made a Job Board, [www.pacificdevs.com](https://pacificdevs.com/), dedicated to the IT sector in Australia & New Zealand! The new features:

1. I added accounts for users and companies.
2. You also have a profile where you can upload your skills and get contacted by companies directly. Basically, it's a board for users to search for jobs and for companies to search for workers!
3. As a user, you can bookmark listings or filter the job board by recommended jobs (based on your skills).
4. I've added a graph with stats about the overall salary, which hopefully will become interesting once it's filled with real data.
5. I also added the option for companies to add benefits such as work from home, pet friendly office, Friday beers, etc.
6. I added the option to add data from external job boards that might offer an API (e.g. RemoteOk). Does anybody know another job board that offers an API?

I think it turned quite well for the start! Only two things left, ~~to find a good domain name...~~ and find a way to promote it!

Edit: I changed the domain name to PacificDevs!

This wikia has almost 1,000 pages, and last time peaked 5k visitors daily, I was wondering if I could put this on my resume as one of my 3 ""projects"", since I do not have any professional experience at all and have little to no other good projects currently?

17vgd78,Confused About Rejection - Uncertain of the Reasons for My Rejection.,"I applied a few days ago to Telstra's new internship program, which is offering part-time positions starting next year, with Network Engineering and Domain Engineering as the available streams. 

Although I have already received a rejection letter, I am confused about the selection criteria. It appears that most network engineers have an Electrical Engineering background, whereas my background is in Computer Science. 

My preparations for this program were thorough, including extensive research and numerous coffee chats to better understand the role. I believe my experience is relevant, having worked as a Junior Engineer and completed two internships, and I am actively involved in the student community and various clubs. Moreover, I am currently studying at one of the universities that Telstra has partnered with for their pilot internship program, which makes me eligible.

xegoaj,big A vs little A ?,"As per the title, weighing up an offer between AWS & Atlassian.
Salary is quite similar, but a huge chunk of Atlassian's salary comes from shares, which can fluctuate in price (looming stock market crash, recession, etc). 

Wlb is super important:
Atlassian is 4.7 on glassdoor & 95% rated as a great place to work, whilst AWS is 4.2 with 80%.
Both 100% remote with similar benefits, slightly in favour of Atlassian (parental leave).

AWS gets a lot of flack due to the US culture, but I'm not sure if that's the case here, management seems really friendly!

I've come to realise it isnt a field I enjoy and over the last couple of weeks ive started learning python and found it really enjoyable. I've contacted as many of my friends whom are in the field (from cybersec to network techs to software engineers) and asked for their opinion of their work and it looks to be something i'm more and more interested in.

I'm currently deciding betweeen going into a bootcamp/TAFE (Something like General Assembly) or going back to uni to study a masters in IT (comp sci) for two years (would be faster than doing a bachelors for 3 years). 

There are pros and cons to both which I know and I have asked all my friends to which their opinions are all different. Some of them suggesting to go back to uni as it is essential to learn some of the concepts/topics, whilst others say get the foot in the door and quickly get in with TAFE or a bootcamp and work from there.

1b6mei3,Help: stay at current work or move on,"Background: Did a bachelor of science with a major in computer science (Java, Python, C, all the cool stuff)

Current situation: Graduated in 2022 and had some visa restrictions. Was lucky to find a SWE job but unfortunately large part of my work requires me to use a robotic process automation software. I absolutely hate the drag and drop and this is hurting my chances of becoming a proper software engineer. I do get to do work in Java but not as much as I would like to.

Now: My visa situation has cleared up and I think employers are more willing to hire me (maybe it’s psychological). Recently received a job offer (slightly better pay) but its at a company that uses a proprietary language. The proprietary language part is a bit off putting because I don’t want to box myself up and be stuck.

Options:

1. Accept new offer and still continue applying for other roles
2. Decline offer
3. Leverage new offer at current workplace to get higher pay until I leave eventually. ( I will have to make a decision tree as if they say no then will definitely have to leave)

Note: my current workplace was supposed to increase my pay back in Dec/Jan but that still hasn’t gone because of HR delays.

What I usually do is write down my answer in dot points or full out in a notepad in the time they give to think about the question before I answer. When it comes to recording, I kinda read it off my screen but do make eye contact with the camera.

17cey6s,Coding Interview Tips,"Been helping some people with their dreaded coding interviews and thought I’d share my thoughts publicly on the off-chance that it might help someone during their preparation. I currently conduct interviews at Atlassian, but have done a few at various other companies, so hopefully my advice isn’t too myopic. 

Modern day interviews are more than just solving a problem. Though, arriving at a solution is still the bread and butter, so if you cannot comfortably solve all blind75 mediums within 45 minutes then it’s back to the leetcode stomping grounds for you. If this is something you’ve struggled with, i’ve previously left some [advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsOCE/s/OMn6fq8LH1) on this that others have found to be helpful.

A 60 minute interview should be broken down into four parts. This should imitate a competent person solving an issue in a logical manner. If any of these steps are missed, you may be sounding alarm bells that indicate that you either: are not confident in your ability, struggle to communicate or have already seen the answer. 

1. **Ask for requirements**: The first 10 minutes of an interview should not include any coding at all. Listen, and I cannot stress this enough, LISTEN to the question the interviewer  is asking. Take notes as they talk and mull over the requirements. Then, as you digest them you should have some ideas around the approach you want to take. Ask questions now and build out the set of requirements that you would typically see in an online question. E.g. ask about time & space complexity, edge cases, how things are expected to be used, etc. 
2. **The Naive Approach**: Start going through the most obvious approach in psuedocode - most of the time this is greedy or dfs/bfs. Do this even if it is obvious to you what the solution should be, especially if you have already solved the question before. If that is the case, then you should have the luxury of taking your time here. This period is a perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your thinking and communication skills. Every interviewer wants to see that you can tackle a difficult problem with planning and insight. Communication skills are a make or break for most companies and clearly articulating your approach shows that you’re a critical thinker and saves them the suspicion that you have already seen the question before. Weave questions in as you go and hopefully you will arrive at a solution. Otherwise, gracefully realise the flaw in your approach and redirect yourself onto the correct path.
3. **Solve!**: Here you can dive straight into your coding and spend more time thinking and writing. In some cases, the interviewer will continually add requirements. If so, go back to questions and psuedocode when necessary. Unfortunately, theres no secret to solving a problem other than practice. If you have not identified the correct way to solve the problem in the previous part then you will likely crumble during this section. There is nothing wrong with scraping your solution and starting again but make sure you are re-communicating your idea with pseudocode, if possible. If there is a period of silence as you fumble around for a solution, you will be dinged. In some cases, just getting close to an answer but having excellent communicational skills is enough to provide adequate signal.
4. **Further Considerations and Unit Tests**: When you have a working solution with time to spare, there are embellishments you can add that will seal the deal/uplevel you. Interviewers love hearing about considerations and limitations of your algorithm as this demonstrates critical thought. Testing is another big consideration that is required for any mid level+ role, so make sure you are comfortable in your language’s testing suite. I typically do not recommend TDD during an interview as you could waste valuable solution-solving time while not improving your signal (it’s very awkward watching someone fix failing tests midway through an interview). But, if you can get to this in the end and demonstrate a fully working solution that is tested, then you can leave knowing you’ve went above and beyond.

P.s.
Lastly, save your energy if you are going to post about how archaic coding interviews are - it is actually a very overplayed take. We all acknowledge the contentiousness of the topic as it’s an assessment of something that rarely reflects the actual work a candidate does. However, this process has become the industry standard, so you should respect the spaces of the internet that are dedicated to helping people through it.",2023-10-20 16:11:48
15tvcob,The current and future state of AI/ML jobs in Australia: What is the current job market for AI practitioners like and how do you imagine this evolving in the near future?,"I think it's safe to say that with all the advancements and investments into AI, the sector will be a essential growth sector with strategic importance for many companies. There was also a recent [WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-900-000-ai-job-is-here-230fc3cb) about the ""$900000"" AI job. Obviously, those roles with near $1M USD salaries are extremely rare outside a few companies Silicon Valley or NYC.

1. I just finished my first year at Melbourne Uni and feel like a massive idiot. I got good marks and all but I certainly don't know how to make anything practical or useful for 'real life', I don't even know the definitions of 90% of the technical words people on the popular cs subreddits use. Apart from my degree, what else can I be doing to supplement my learning? I'm currently self learning Java but I still feel like all I can do is game AIs and puzzle solvers
2. When are you supposed to be applying for internships? I know most do it in the second year, but I feel like I wouldn't be able to keep up. Also, I only started programming last year and I don't know how my introductory grasp of Python and my C checkers engine and other beginner projects is going to make any company want to take me.

When I first joined university in 2019, I did a double degree in law along with my current arts degree, and I am majoring in Japanese. However, last year I dropped law due to a multitude of negative reasons, and unfortunately that was the ”hard skill” I was intending to market myself with. So I’m currently averaging a 5.5 GPA, which is equivalent to being a B student, which isn’t great but it’s not terrible either and I’m trying to maintain that. My only real stable career path with a good salary seems to be an interpreter at an advanced level, and I wouldn’t mind that if I had more options post-graduation, but every other job field I have a chance at is highly competitive, with mediocre starting salaries, and they also mostly focus on hiring engineering, mathematics, business management or technology graduates, anyway. Out of all of the degrees in these areas, the main ones I am interested in are to do with either economics or computers, like IT and tech based things. 

I read an introductory chapter on MATLAB and it wasn’t exactly riveting, which I’m not surprised at because I am slow at learning maths. However, under a good teacher I do well. The most recent good example I can give is from high school, and the year11 maths methods A and specialist B. For A, it was a class that taught us abstract traditional maths like calculus and quadratic equations etc. My Maths A teacher was like most maths teachers I’ve had, in that they just expected me to know how to do foundational maths that is needed to solve more complex equations, so I failed my maths A class and got a D. In the same year we did Maths B, which is maths based on applied concepts in engineering and more advanced levels. I had one of my favourite teachers for the B class, and he was also the reason I enjoyed physics. So in the supposedly “more advanced” class, I got a B. Yet, my fear of doing maths slowly/badly when compared to my university classmates, since university is a whole different ballgame, was the singular factor that drove me away from STEM in general, and is still the scare factor for me going into computer science. I realise that because university is not school and there won’t be a guaranteed good maths teacher and I’ll need to learn a lot on my own, combined with my slow ability to pick it up… I’m not sure I’ll survive. 

But I still think about computer science because besides that MATLAB intro, I also read the first chapter on a book about software engineering and I really enjoyed it. Also, the stability of a CS degree looks very attractive to me, because it has a lot of job opportunities, a stable income and normal 9-5 working hours. Whilst it is a lot less demanding for me to transfer into studying something like economics or business, I believe that the skills I would pick up from a CS degree are more valuable to future employers, because I can always do a masters degree in those fields later on despite not having any related study to them, but you can’t do that with a masters related to computers, mathematics, science etc. 

TL;DR: Is it a bad idea to do CS at uni if you are slow at maths, but the field and job stability interests you (but not at a “life passion/drive” level)?",2021-09-13 08:09:24
obd2gr,Whats the best path to get me the fuck out of tech support into some sort of dev work?,"Location: Brisbane

G'day legends 

I'll start by saying that I'm not looking for some learn to code in 6 weeks and that I know I'm in for the long haul.

I've got almost 3 years in tech support, currently working as a senior on a Service Desk at a fairly reputable company. Unfortunately there is no career progression and there is no chance to increase my skills via automating stuff, etc.

I've also gone back to uni to do a degree in computer science and have done a basic python course and into to OOP with C#.

I've also started doing The Odin Project because it seems the entry path into web dev is the easiest. I can't quit my job because I need money so I can't do a bootcamp.

Is this the best path or is there something else? Cheers",2021-07-01 03:18:18

1bfahuo,How bad is delaying your graduation date to apply for internship ?,"A bit of back story, I am currently in the last year of my master's and currently have no internships under my belt. I come from a non-tech related bachelor's moving into a tech-related master's and didn't realise the leetcode requirements and such that I was able to secure an internship last year. I am now on the road to graduating this December but am considering delaying my graduation to appear in my penultimate year so I can apply for internships for companies. How do recruiters feel about this?  


Just getting ideas as I applying for graduate programs seems a bit daunting with no internship experience. How bad is it if i say I'm graduating later even just to secure an internship, I heard that a lot of big tech companies don't even take new grads, they just onboard interns into grad positions. Feeling a bit lost and considering the state of the job market I'm just hoping to get a job after I graduate.

1b9zkf4,Video Interview Hints and Tips,"I know graduate programs are opening up their recruitment soon, and I thought this may help some of you prepare for the interview process.

I built this from watching countless hours of video interviews by final year students and have seen so many people get this wrong and it just kills your chances. In particular, bad lighting, sound and noise coming into the interviews are killers.

I have this as a PDF which I can share as well

These tips can be utilised for nearly any role that you are interviewing for.

First, a word of caution: There is no such thing as an informal Zoom/Video Interview. Take them seriously.

* First impressions count for everything, even informal teams etc.… Make sure you are well presented so your hair looks good, etc; make sure you look presentable.
* Lighting and Audio are super important. Make sure you have decent lighting for the team’s call. Ideally, you want soft light as well. There are a few options out there. Some people prefer to buy some lighting and already have a webcam or go for an all-in-one solution (check the link [here](https://www.thestreet.com/review/webcam-ring-light/)) – note that I have not used the NexiGo, but it seems to get good reviews. As always, DYOR. If you have good natural light, you might want to get a good webcam. Generally, the cameras on laptops are average. Also, these webcams have noise-cancelling microphones as well, so well worth considering.
* Make sure you are in a neutral spot in your house. I am sure you know this, but don’t do the call in a bedroom or bathroom etc.
* Ideally, try to do the call when no one is around so there are no interruptions as well.
* Prepare as you would typically do for an interview, so use LinkedIn to research the person you are meeting e.g.
* make sure you familiarise yourself with their background, so scope out LinkedIn, google their name
* do your research on the company, look at their last financial statements or AGM report, and make sure you know of the challenges that they could be facing
* Know your CV and background inside out
* Make sure you know the JD and the key things they seek. Remember when interviewing you want to be answering questions in the [STAR technique](https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf)
* If you think you might have gotten lost a little bit on the way when you give your answer and are wondering whether you have answered the question, don’t be afraid to ask the interviewer, have I responded to your question or is there anything that I have missed, or you need further explanation on.
* Remember, Interviews are two-way streets, they are assessing you as a candidate, but you are also asking them, so have questions prepared to ask them.
* Be prepared to ask them some questions, make them good and unique as well
* At the end, thank them for their time, ask them next steps in the process and comment that you enjoyed learning more about the program, opportunity etc
* Send a follow up thank you note.",2024-03-08 21:17:45

1au3mvy,32 year old career change which of these fields should I get into? ,"Hello I am a 32 year old male in Australia and am about to leave my job of 3 years. It's at a dental lab where currently (amongst other things but more related to this post) I digitally move teeth on CAD softwares, and work on a big data analysis paper where I analyse tooth movements of patients over time to be published in a dental journal. 

The skills and experience I have from here are the obvious office ones (emails, phone calls, computers skills etc) and more specific ones for this post are Excel, some basic programming, data entry/analysis. I also have a university degree in Physics.

I am looking for a slight career change (away from dental) to something in, broadly speaking, IT, computers, data, analytics, statistics, mathematics, programming, cybersecurity, etc or anything similar. I am good with computers and numbers, getting better at data and programming, but only have that recent relevant work experience, also can try any online courses that may help.

Not sure what the best way is to get in, either start at the bottom of a big company and work my way up or try my luck at a higher position in a smaller company. Obviously in a perfect world I can trial all those fields out for a week and pick the best one suited to me, but in reality it would be difficult just breaking in.

1asmrit,Some basic interview tips,"This probably won’t help those get an interview but thought I’d write up a little bit of advice for once you’ve got a toe in the door for an interview. For context I’m an engineer again but have been in the management space for a decade before returning to hands on work

1. Have a good attitude

You might be the greatest swe in the history of the universe, but if you come in with a “I can do everything better and I should be the CTO by the end of the year” approach, you’ll probably get knocked down a bit.  It costs a lot to hire and get onboarded so unless it’s a contract most companies are looking for someone who has some room to grow, learn and ultimately stick around for a while and also not put others offside by day 3.

2. Come in prepared 

There’s a wealth of public information usually about a company. It seems so simple but read those bs HR because HR is going to be the first person you speak to. Also for technical interviews it’s always been bonus points for those that have come in and said “oh I had a look around and can see you’re using react … or you’re using xyz to front or host …”. It literally takes 10 minutes but at least shows you give a toss and is a good one to ask questions about when they ask if you have any questions about the role later.

3. Embellish, but don’t outright lie

This is one I see a fair bit too often and it wastes everyone’s time. It’s one thing to see the JD and angle your CV towards that, but nothing annoys more than someone trying to pass off as an expert in every tool and language listed. It’s a Wish list of things to help HR, but it’s not the be all. Focus on your strengths of the JD, and acknowledge where you might be weak against the list. But if you say you’re an expert in everything then you better dang well be because if you’re caught out on some of the basics then that’s going straight in the bin 

This obviously may not work for every job (eg maybe a HFT company might want you to be ruthless) out for those going for principal level Eng roles but hopefully it’s some really simple things to do that helps",2024-02-16 23:18:14

1846q41,"Just completed masters in AI, stuck in a weird place","I just completed MIT in AI from UNSW Sydney, and am in a weird situation

I'm just looking for some general ideas on where to go from here. 

I just completed MIT in AI from UNSW, part time. My grades aren't all that great (although they are still decent), since I had to juggle a full time job while pursuing the program. But my understanding is  pretty solid. 

Now, the thing is that I have been working as a software engineer for over 6 years now (mostly web development within the Microsoft tech stack, with a bit of cloud) and am currently in a mid level position. The reason I pursued MIT, was to eventually try and move into the AI. 

I am bit lost on where to go from here. At this stage of my life (I'm 38 and married, with a lot of financial commitments), it is really hard for me to let go of my decent paying mid level position to get into an entry level AI role (which would mean a pretty significant pay cut for the first few years). But I am not really eligible for experienced AI-related roles because I don't have paid experience in AI or Machine Learning. I would like to somehow leverage my existing skills and experience as a software developer, and still make use of the skills I gained with my completed MIT in AI. I seem to be stuck in a weird place where my current experience is very marginally relevant to what I want to do (since they both involve 'programming' at the core), but still not quite. I do not want to let the skills I gained from MIT to go waste, especially since I slogged my ass off for 4+ years, pretty much giving up everything else to complete it while still being employed full time. 

I am trying to get into some kind of hybrid role within my current job, so that I can divide my time between web development and ML/AI, but I am not sure if that will work out because AI is only just started to be considered in my company and right now they are mostly only looking for senior AI/ML engineers with tons of experience to kick things off. 

Another thing I am worried about, is my skills becoming rusty the longer I stay away from actually working on stuff related to AI and ML. During the course of my study, this wasn't  a problem because the projects/assignment/exams ensured that I learnt and used these skills continuously. I am looking to pick up some random projects and work on them, but I am finding it hard without the sense of direction offered by a university curriculum. 

Any suggestions? Thank you.",2023-11-26 09:04:54

1786glh,Am I doing leetcode properly? need advice,"Hi, first year comp sci student here who is keen on snagging an internship next year. I'm wondering if I am doing leetcode in the most optimal manner possible? Right now, I am solving leetcode easy questions until I feel comfortable to move onto medium or hard because honestly these days I am even struggling to finish some easy questions lol. Everyday I set aside 1 hour for 'leetcode time'. Btw, I am actually using algoexpert instead of leetcode keep that in mind hence I have extra features available to me such as the mock interview feature.

Here's my weekly process:

1. I give myself 1 hour to solve a leetcode Easy question from under a certain topic (Arrays, strings, trees, recursion e.t.c). If it's been an hour, I give up and then leave reviewing the answer for the next day. I follow the process EVERY single time of clarifying, brute force solution -> state run time, optimal solution -> state run time, and then write test cases.
2. The next day comes in, and I review a youtube video of the answer being solved.
3. I then repeat this but with a new question from a new topic. E.g if I did a question on strings one day then, the next time I do a question it will be under recursion.
4. Repeat for the entire week, except Friday where instead of doing leetcode I decide to do a mock interview instead for the day using the 'mock interview' feature on algoexpert where I engage in a video call with a random stranger on the internet.
5. Rinse and repeat

I'm not sure if I'm doing leetcode correctly but if anyone has suggestions on how I can further improve my leetcoding system please let me know ! Kinda new to this whole thing LOL !

The problem is I noticed that when I tried to do a question again that I didn't know how to do before and then checked the answer... I still couldn't solve it !! Also, there are still a lot of easy questions that I can't solve under an hour. Any advice on how I could better myself? Thanks :) !",2023-10-15 03:24:56

16gnnej,"Got ghosted by Airwallex, twice","I'm not sure if my complaints or feelings are justified but Ima just put out my experience with Airwallex.

Earlier this year I went to my university's career fair and happened to step my foot on the Airwallex's booth. At this stage I have already put in my application for SWE internship position. I went up to the booth, luckily there weren't that many people, so I could have a brief chat with the recruiter. It wasn't long but the recruiter wanted my name and said they would look out for me in the application process. Couple of days after I got rejected on resume screening. 

NOW, I'm not complaining because I didn't get through the resume screening. I understand I may not met their requirement in certain way so I was cleared out in the initial stage. I didn't think too much of it and moved on. I was just a little bit disappointed with the false hope, but also was told that recruiters do this all the time and they don't actually mean it. 

There goes a couple of months and I went back to my university's another career fair where I also saw Airwallex's booth. I went up again, not really expecting, and turned out I had a really really good and long chat with a lovely recruiter (about 15 ish minutes). I told this recruiter how I was told what they told me before and asked what they really meant. They told me they aren't really sure either and I could've been rejected because I didn't meet certain threshold, which is completely fair enough. 

The recuiter at this event asked for my name again and first-handedly suggested that they are willing to sit down with me and go through my application to hear my story and see where I can improve so I can prepare for the graudate role next year. I even got their LinkedIn and went on my way. 

The linkedin connect request was never accepted and I sent this recruiter another email personally asking if they were still available, but I never heard back since. Hence, I just gave up and move on. It seems like a very interesting company and would be great to work for but experience like this is just not it for me. 

I'm not complaining that my application didn't go through. I understand that I might've been not good enough and that's completely fine. I'm just annoyed that I got ghosted twice in a row even with pretty unique experience.

13iyze0,Extending degree by a year with an honours year for internships.,"Just curious about the general consensus around doing such a thing.

My situation is as follows:

Currently a comp sci major and am not the most competitive applicant for the majority of graduate programs. I completed an internship prior to starting my 3rd year which puts me slightly ahead of those with 0 exp. If I extend my grad by a year with an honours year I will have the ability to potentially do an internship at a 'larger/more recognised' company over the summer and would put me in a far better standing to get into a strong graduate program and larger foot into the industry.

Is it worth going this path? Another aspect is that I will shave a year off my masters that I will eventually do.

I have the ability to go back to the company I interned with but it's fairly small in terms of opportunities to grow early career.

Ultimately my question is: Graduate and go into a role at a small(ish) company and take the year of exp then try to hop into a better company OR extend grad by a year, do an internship, and \*potentially\* get into a better grad program.

Money / factoring in the loss of 1 year full-time salary isn't really a factor it in at the moment for me either.

12n3nzp,Your thoughts on my situation,"Hi all. Apologies for the long post ahead.

So a short background about me. I've only had been in one company since starting my career in software engineering. They are a software consulting firm (a global one at that). I worked for them for almost 6 years and my last position was as Senior SWE (for 1.5 yrs). I left since I'll be moving soon to Australia to be with my wife (as her dependent on her work visa). 

I have knowledge in C/C++, PHP, Javascript, Oracle SQL and a bit of Java. I can honestly say that I'm not confident with my coding abilities since there was no focus on a specific tech during my stay in my prev company. I could be doing a 3-4 month project using C/C++ and then use PHP on the next one. Also, projects usually just adds features to existing applications so I never really got exposed to building applications from scratch. Another thing is that the codebase of the company is very old. Using old versions of both C/C++ and PHP, and their applications are highly technically and specialized (Used by test technicians of a telco). We were also using vim when coding C/C++ applications. :) 

All I have going for my self is my ability to know what things to search to find possible solutions to the problems I faced. And being able to adjust quickly when dealing with a new application (esp. when just adding features to existing apps)

What are my chances of gettings jobs if I were to pivot on a relatively newer tech, say React for a frontend dev job, or even pivot my career path to Data Science/Engineering? I also am not looking for Senior Dev roles since I feel I'm not really qualified for it right now.

I know big companies like Canva, Atlassian sponsor but getting the CV to them seems like another tough task followed by leetcode style interview. I am down for leetcode style interview as well and am currently doing some practice for this style as well. I tried changing my location in LinkedIn and get a lot of recruiters reaching out to me but once they know I am not in the country don't try to go down further. So people having knowledge about the market situation right there, could you please provide some info regarding if it will be possible or not? I am mostly looking for position as a native iOS developer.  


The next path I see is going through a study permit to study masters but that come with a cost of $70000 on average for 2 years. I am open to this as well if the direct employment option doesn't work but if there are companies that could sponsor directly, that would really fit in for what I want. Thanks.",2022-12-08 14:07:35

I’ve been reached out by a recruiter to attend Amazon’a recruitment drive happening in Australia which helps move people to the US, Canada or Europe.

I’ve chosen the whiteboard session. Does anyone think OA is easier?

The questions may seem dumb and I apologize if they do, however I have been reading a lot of posts of graduates struggling to find employment which is giving me anxiety. If you would rather msg me directly pls do so. Any help is appreciated.  live in Auckland

1. When do I start applying for jobs (bearing in mind the time I finish uni)?
2. What jobs/type of roles do I look for (e.g. grad SE jobs or junior SE jobs)?
3. Where do I look other than linkedin and indeed? Is there any other places or ways to get a job?
4. how do I differentiate myself from other applicants (for context I have done 1 internship, have a 6.3 GPA (in between a B+ and A-), not many personal projects besides uni work) and given the ""for context"" information provided, do I stand a good chance of getting a SWE (grad or jnr) job straight outta uni?
5. Is 1 internship enough (if not, i'm kinda screwed - kinda stressing about this one)?
6. This might be a long shot but are any professionals willing to meet up, grab a drink (or a coffee) and just discuss your experience as a SWE/developer. I think it would provide good insight and also would be a good way to network/meet people in the industry. DM me if you would be willing.

HFT -> pays more initially (not sure about long term?), though is a smaller field + has non-competes so is harder to change companies and so on. Generally lesser WLB and higher turnover rate. Though the work itself seems challenging/interesting.

Tech -> pays less initially (again not sure long term), larger field with more opportunities to change companies. More chill WLB, though potentially less interesting work (mostly basic CRUD-app stuff).

To what extent is it possible to start at hft and then transition to tech, and would you be significantly disadvantaged from doing so?

jox968,Idea for a site/app for tech job seekers in Australia/NZ. Feedback needed!,"Hey folks,

I'd like to get some feedback on an idea I've had for a site / app for those looking for tech jobs in Australia/NZ.

Although the primary resource will always be networking and referrals, I'd like to create something which makes the other avenues (applying to publicly listed jobs) a little easier, and maybe present some useful data. I haven't really found anything that does what I'd like to do specific to our region, so feel free to share resources that I may not be aware of.

Essentially I'm thinking of job listings aggregator for tech jobs which does one or more of the following:

1. Collating (via their API's and/or scraping) jobs from the various large local sites (like seek.com.au) with better tech relevant filtering. I'd love to somehow give the option to filter out those posted by recruiting companies. Although these sites contain a lot of fluff, there is still merit to including them in a job search as there is always a chance of finding a gem.
2. Scraping the larger (or more tech focused) companies own websites (Atlassian, Canva, big US tech orgs, banks, etc) for internally posted tech jobs. Probably more valuable than the above, but also a lot more work and maintenance.
3. Scraping remote jobs from various sources around the net and filtering those available to our region (a lot of remote job postings are limited to certain countries, which can be tiresome to sift through).
4. Some data analysis tools to enable people to identify relevant hiring trends - for example to get an idea of how many companies are seeking experience in a specific technology, and breaking it down by salary range, location, seniority, etc.

The above ideas aren't mutually exclusive of course,  I'm just looking to settle on a path to get started on - what would be most useful to you? Alternative ideas are definitely welcome.",2020-11-06 03:11:23
1bowfcc,"Where to climb, for a Brisbane-based Java developer?","I'm a Java/React developer looking to climb to greener pastures, but I've noticed that:

* most Brisbane based companies with a tech-presence seem to use .NET for their back-end, and
* of course, there are only so-many opportunities (in terms of organization, and salary) in Brisbane, compared to Sydney

Learning C# in my own time is tempting, but I'm often told that **during the recruitment process\***, hobbyist experience barely holds a candle to enterprise experience, and may be rough.

Similarly, moving to Sydney without a job lined up sounds mildly intimidating, as I'd be eating a higher cost of living despite not currently having the salary to back it up (if I can even retain my current job while moving to Sydney?)

&#x200B;

What would you do from this position? I don't know which of these are worth focusing on, let alone the order in which I should tackle them:

* Move to Sydney
* Pick up .NET in hopes of pivoting, if a company gives me a chance
* Staying as a Java back-end, and fully commit on trying to jump straight into Canva/Atlassian/any other reputable companies with a Java-back end (open for suggestions!)

I know it's opinionated (and depends heavily on what you value; WLB/salary/etc) but I'm more than willing to move, and would love to hear anyone's thoughts / suggested pathways.",2024-03-27 07:54:53

1b6uuxz,7+ YOE and struggling to find a new role. Is my resume the problem?,"I quit my job about 9 months ago to spend some time traveling SEA, get married, and generally chill out and recover from a toxic workplace. I started looking for roles again in November/December last year, probably applied for 50 (highly targeted) jobs so far. From that I've had just 4-5 interviews, twice making the final round and each time (supposedly) just missing out.

A lot of roles which I believe I'd be really strong candidate for I'm not even getting any acknowledgement or response (for example a recent Angular specific front-end role looking for PWA/offline experience, which I have plenty but still didn't get a bite.) And roles via recruiters are getting zero response too, whereas only a couple years ago I was getting harassed by them almost daily based on my linked in profile. Is the market really that bad right now?

I'm applying for remote only roles since I'm stuck in a remote area with zero tech industry. I suspect this may be the issue, and I suspect the roles I did miss out on went to candidates closer to the company offices. But I'm also wondering if my resume is the problem. I've got pretty broad experience between frontend/backend/devops and project management skill sets, and I found it hard to include everything I've worked with while emphasizing my core skills. I generally tweak my resume to target certain roles, but that doesn't seem to help much.

19ck88y,Another dilemma: Medicine offer vs SWE New Grad,"I was compelled to write this post after reading another post on this topic, and hope you folks have some advice. I'm 22, tossing up between a postgrad medicine offer vs staying in my new grad SWE job that I've just started. 

I've always found it hard to pick a career. In 2019, I was lucky enough to get a 99.95 ATAR and the Melbourne Chancellor's Scholarship - not a flex, relevant later. I casually followed forums like medstudentsonline but never applied for med school back then. 

Various events since have cast doubt on staying in SWE:

- Failing HFT and prop trading onsites at the final technical round - behavioural was strong. Doesn't hurt to retry, but I'm pretty sure I won't ever make it.
- Interned as an SWE at a FAANG, where a very poorly scoped project (think tuning parameter A to influence metric B, C, then indirectly D - riddled with spurious correlation) made it difficult to show an impact in the demo and led to no return offer - this was at the height of the hiring craze too. When the project was first introduced to me, I had already mentally written it off as it seemed so nonsensical. I had to move out for the internship, which may have  also contributed to the pressure. My confidence was low enough that I did part-time study for the semester after that summer.
- Interned and now a new grad at a unicorn, which pays decently (less than FAANG, i.e. about a first-year intern doctor's pay after overtime in Victoria if excluding equity). However, when I think about work, I can't help but feel somewhat empty in reading/writing code, fiddling with configs, system design, eventual management, and performance reviews for the next 20, 30, 40 years. It all seems too unfulfilling - and probably not because of my company - my colleagues are very nice. SWE careers seem short and I'd like to have a long & fulfilling career. 
- Bleak tech climate in general. My employer seems to fine though.

Due to my scholarship, I have a CSP medical school offer that I can put on HECs ($40k in total). If I reapplied in the future, I'd have to go through the competitive GAMSAT pathway, so by not going now I feel like I'm giving up a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Almost-zero chance of being able to work part-time at my current company. 

I've scoured Whirlpool, /r/ausjdocs, and /r/AusFinance for advice, and it seems the consensus is that while a medical career is difficult, bullying and admin issues are common but improving, and that the specialities I'm interested in (radiology, nephrology, cardio) are very competitive with lots of quality research required to get on, it is in the end it is worth it for the experience. I wonder, if others can do it, why can't I? 

For me, fulfilment > compensation, so medicine is probably the way if I can slog it through. Compensation is also a high priority for me, and I don't see how I can rapidly grow it without joining a trading firm or moving to the US, which doesn't seem quite stable. While it would take me 12-15 years from now to become a consultant doctor, if the Australian tech market remains flat as it is, the juice might be worth the squeeze. I'm not sure I can reach ~500k by then in tech.

Lastly, there are a few reasons I'm hesitant to leave SWE:

- Being in a small, new team that is growing, and only having been here for a short time.
- Perhaps I'm not experienced enough and am just feeling imposter syndrome. 
- Being older (26) upon graduation than my friends (though I'm sure you'll tell me how silly of a point this is).

However, I'd like to ""fail fast"" (and switch to med if so) and don't think it's just imposter syndrome.

I’m also interested in learning AWS and get those completion skills. However, I saw a lot from these posts that I need to work on a side project? What kind of side projects do I need to work on? I did make like a sort of “wikia fandom” thingy which did get a decent attraction since the game I created/developed the wiki for had 20k concurrent players once, but that only showed my html/css skills and no other language.

Is learning new language better or doing this sort of “personal project” thing (still have no idea what I would do though). Should I like compile all of my school projects and put it on github for portfolio?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",2023-09-27 00:42:22

11tijlh,Higher level CS?,"I've been doing some personal projects in flask and react to get ready for SWE roles and I've really enjoyed the process of project building, planning, and success. However, I realized that I haven't really used the most of the things I've learned in college (besides the basics of OOP and DSA). 

I talked about it with a friend and he said that SWEs are like ""construction workers"" in that they use tools to build an application while architects (managers or people with higher education) make the real money. He said that attending college just to become an SWE is a waste of money and that the best use of my time/money would be using my time in college to learn a high level skill concept like ML or NLP.

I kinda followed him out of worry/pressure and have started learning about ML and other research topics but I'm not sure where that'll take me? I've heard that ML engineers take data, try to understand it, and then apply some model to it to predict future values. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opb2Bq4Qvyo&t=1049s) affirmed my understanding of what an ML engineer does. The speaker, an ML Engineer @ Amazon with only a bachelors, said that he really didn't use advanced math or computer science, but just experimented with different models on the data. 

Given all that context (sorry it's a little long, new to posting on reddit):

For those who have gotten higher level degrees, to what extent have you used your education for your current job? Would you recommend students to go past undergraduate degrees?

Do ML engineers really not use heavy math/CS frequently? Why is it almost a requirement to have higher level degrees for most companies?

Do SWEs feel like they wasted their undergrad degree by going into SWE? How would you recommend making the most of time in college?",2023-03-17 05:51:20

I found learning UNIX systems, bash and very basic scripting enjoyable, so I’m considering upskilling in CS/data science because I think I’d genuinely enjoy it. DS seems a little more niche so I’m more inclined towards CS.

My question is, should I do an undergrad in CS or a masters? A cursory search basically told me some masters courses in Australia are very similar to undergrad in terms of units and simplicity. I feel with job listings more of them prefer you have a masters over an undergrad but I could be wrong.

If it matters, I’ll be doing it PT while continuing to work FT, so would prefer the course to be 100% online, but it’s not a dealbreaker.

ubf5vh,Is the switch to tech all sunshine and rainbows?,"Hi all, was told to post here:

Civil Engineer grad here.

Its my first year working post graduation, working in construction. Its interesting and stimulating, however stressful and long days that makes it feel like a grind. I could switch to the consulting side (which im sure has its own problems) for a better work-life balance however would take approx. 15% paycut. I just feel the career of civil engineering is so regimented and defined you have to accrue a certain number of years/decades to start earning (great) money.

I have friends working in tech and they humbly brag that they do maybe 20-30 hours max. of work each week (WFH) and spend the rest of their week talking in our discord/playing games with my other friends, going for coffee, lunch etc., all the stuff I can only do on weekends. From an outside perspective it looks like the dream.

My question is how common is this? They're graduates themselves so is this a case of the company simply not assigning enough work for them and in 1-2 years they could be working under the pump for a full 40 hr week? Or is this lifestyle fairly common? Also I know tech is a VERY broad industry but it seems the work format seems similar?

Im wondering if its worth going back and doing a bachelors or masters of computer science as a way to get into tech before I go too far down the civil engineering career, where it would be harder to justify a change in careers.

I dont mean to come across as lazy, but it feels like my entire week revolves around work/prepping for week/squeezing in exercise/getting a decent sleep until the weekend hits. The CS lifestyle sounds much more balanced and better for physcial/mental health that frees up your weekend instead of catching up on chores.

skzunn,Conflicting resume advice from NZ tech recruiting company for students. SWE roles.,"Hi all.

I've seen a lot of threads and examples of CVs on here and r/cscareerquestions. The general advice seem to be to keep it as concise as possible and try to keep your resume to 1 page if you don't have much professional experience. Maybe 2 if you've got a lot of internships and projects. Also saw a couple resume examples from threads like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m0ay3v/official_exemplary_resume_sharing_thread_march/). My current CV is formatted similarly to the ones you see in threads like that and it did get me interviews last year that lead to a few offers.

Anyway, I recently joined a CV workshop here in NZ and the template they gave us is 3 pages long and imo talks too much fluff. They basically told us to include a career objective with around 3 - 6 sentences and a skill summary which takes up a whole page. The skill summary section is basically 4 - 5 of your best skills with 2-4 sentence descriptions on why you're good at that skill. I personally think this takes too much space and no recruiter would have time to read this. Like why is this necessary? Shouldn't this be in a cover letter instead?

I have huge doubts about the advice being given in that workshop and would like to have second opinions from hiring managers/recruiters in the industry here in NZ/AUS. Thoughts and opinions? Thanks!

&#x200B;

Interested in learning more about High Frequency Trading roles. From what I can tell from reading Reddit, and stalking people on LinkedIn: **Please correct me if I am wrong on any of these assumptions**  
\- Pays about 200k as a graduate (making it on par with Investment Banking and Doctors)

\- Peaks at about 1-2 million a year (Hence showing it matches IB and Doctors specialists)

\- Pay is moreso based on bonus and pays the same as Big Tech or other good jobs, so expecting a 120k grad base or 180k senior base

&#x200B;

What I want to know is

\- How does HFT differ from Investment Banking (thinking Hedgefund managers and private equity and VC funds)

\- Whats the work hours like for HFT (i.e. is it 9-5:30, do people go to the gym on breaks etc)

I’m gearing up to apply for graduate programs in 2024 and find myself pondering the preparation process, specifically regarding technical interviews.

This may not make you rich but is about as high of a guaranteed ""floor"" of any career that doesn't require far more education or a far more prestigious education""

**When you graduate you are guaranteed to be earning above minimum wage, with a stable career:**

""CS degrees are basically guaranteed jobs at above minimum wage. You're not doing it to make *good* money (even though it is, I know people who got their CS bach and *started* at nearly six figures), you're doing it to have *stable* income in a career that won't be obsolete at *any* point in the foreseeable future.""

Context: I’m just about to finish my CS degree and have been working in IT for a few years. I’ve got a few MS/Azure certs and am starting on AWS as well.

I think I’ve missed the boat on applying for grad roles this year but I’m struggling to see how i can make the jump to a new role. Im starting to more actively work on projects to showcase on GitHub as well as a portfolio/blog I’ve created. I have a decent understanding of git, know my way around a Linux system and am working on learning tools like terraform. I’ve got no problem homelabbing and practising as much as I can but how do I translate that into a job?

Do I reach out to recruiters when I think I’m ready (if that’s ever) or just start applying to jobs. I find the philosophy and practices around devops and SRE incredibly interesting so that’s my end goal. I’m also not concerned with jumping to something CS related for the salary and would even take a pay cut if it sets me on the right track for my goals.",2023-10-18 05:44:25

This is mainly a question for people in Australia. 

I find it difficult to get callbacks from companies I apply for jobs to. Jobs such as level 1 and 2 IT support. 

I have had some interviews over the last 2.5 years, however, i have had no actual employment offers in all of that time. 

The only ""job"" in IT that I could get (which is my current job) is as a contractor working for a small MSP. 

I have a Diploma of IT Networking and the CompTIA A+ certificate. 2.5 years experience as an IT Support Tech doing remote and onsite work.

Why is it so difficult to get a low level, full time IT job? Do you now need a computer science degree to obtain these positions? 

Are HR departments being flooded by uni grads who cant code well enough to be software engineers and so are going after IT support jobs?

15ijo4h,Most affordable way to do Master of CS / Data Science in Aus,"Hello everyone! Just tagging on the last question on this sub about mature age students. I’m in my late 20s, have had a career in civil engineering for the last 7 years. I have tried to learn coding by myself, and have had a couple basic projects, including an e commerce website with paypal / stripe integration. Code with java as back end and html css JavaScript in front end. Despite all that, I am still struggling to find a junior SE job, and all the good grads/interns ones (think Canva, Atlassian, etc) reject my application due to the fact I’m not doing a degree related in CS. 

I am now learning python and trying to pivot into data engineering. I am seriously considering take a master of cs or data science to check the box of “completing relevant degree” for those big tech companies. I am still working full time so can only do 100% online course.  So can anyone that had done it before or know of those master courses please let me know which the most affordable way to do this? Or which uni in Australia have the best reputation for a postgrad in data science course? I am an Australian citizen btw so have access to fee help and commonwealth supported places (although not all online courses has csp supported)

So far I have found UNSW master of data science (maybe I will have to go through graduate certificate of data science first) that has 100% online learning, relatively compact timeframe (2 yrs as the quickest to finish the master, recommend 15-20 hrs study a week). The drawback is this course really expensive ($57k in total!) and does not have CSP supported. I can try fee help but that also means having a big debt to the government to pay back once I finish). I really like the reputation of UNSW though. 

Please I would love any advice or tip. Much appreciated 🙏",2023-08-05 02:38:08

157bty3,Software Engineering In New Zealand Vs FAANG in the US,"I’m currently working at Amazon in Seattle and contemplating a move to New Zealand in pursuit of a better work-life balance. I was hoping to hear from individuals who have been through a similar process or anyone who is currently working in NZ to gain some insights about your experience. 

I have a couple of questions below and would appreciate if you can give me some insights. 

	1.	Interview Process: I’m curious about how the interview process in New Zealand compares to the US. For example, at Amazon, we go through resume screening, three Leetcode-like online questions, HR phone interview, first-round technical, and five rounds of final interviews (three DS&Algo + one Design + one culture fit).
	2.	Work-Life Balance: Can you share your thoughts on the work-life balance at your company? How often do you have to work overtime, and are there any Performance Improvement Plans in place?
	3.	Culture Fit and International Experience: I’ve heard a lot about the importance of culture fit and having experience in New Zealand. Will my international experience still be considered valuable in the NZ job market? Also, what kind of culture fit are companies typically looking for?
	4.	Sponsorship for Immigrants: Are companies in New Zealand open to sponsoring immigrants? If so, which companies are known for their sponsorship policies?
	5.	Compensation for Senior Software Role: As a senior software professional with four years of experience and expertise in backend development, what can I expect in terms of compensation in New Zealand? Is 130K NZD a good number?

I appreciate any insights and personal anecdotes you can share to help me make an informed decision! Thank you in advance.",2023-07-23 10:56:07
14r63gm,Career advice - looking to transition into the software engineering industry,"Hi all**,**

I (Melbourne based) would like some advice in transitioning to the software development industry. Ideally I'd like to pursue a one of: Full-stack developer, Front-end developer or a Back-end Developer.

To give a bit of context - Admittedly, I was grossly unprepared when I graduated (2021, I.T.) I left job searching after I graduated and did not sharpen my interview skills.

Consequently I have been working in a WITCH company (Indian consulting companies for those that do not know) - as it was my only offer at the time. Fortunately I have been able to work at a Big 4 Bank working with data VIA WITCH rather than being placed on bench - however the general consensus I have seen is that WITCH experience is not looked at too well.

My Job if mostly just writing documentation and providing support for data related tasks. Any technology that I have used (Power automate, Power BI and Database languages) that would have any value on my resume is from pursuing extra tasks from management (Big 4 Bank). Otherwise without any pursuing I would just be doing documentation + general support tasks. Ideally I would like to leave WITCH even if it is at a job different from SWE for the time being.

I get far more satisfaction out of building programs and solving problems than what I am currently doing and have been coding as a side hobby.

I plan on building a portfolio with 3 to 4 solid projects that are at a production standard (Develop in a Linux environment, authorization, databases, logging-in systems, security features, and deployment (E.I via AWS).. etc..) - Ideally I would like to have these done by roughly mid next-year.

Additionally, I have recently started a masters degree in computer science (Part-time) -(started 1 unit out of 16) and am currently doing a unit in web-development (MEAN Stack) - which aligns really well with my plans.

For those in the Industry:

1. While I have only just started my masters degree - I would like to apply for junior roles (during degree) once my portfolio is done / up to a good standard, would this be recommended? Otherwise, if applying for Junior roles are not recommended - should I Just apply for internships and apply for grad programs when eligible?
2. What Stack is recommended for projects? I have seen that a lot of junior roles require knowledge in: .NET (C#,C++,C),HTML,CSS, JavaScript + Frameworks and SQL. I am going to use multiple stacks for my portfolio.
3. Since I am doing my degree part-time and given how rough the market is right now - should I prolong my degree until the market gets better?
4. Will the WITCH reputation make the experience on my resume valueless? If so, what should I do about this?
5. Are there any new and upcoming technologies that I should incorporated into my portfolio?

Apologies for any bad formatting on this post / if information is over-bloated - this is my first time posting on any forum platform, I will edit it if anything is not clear or needs improvement.

Advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

**TL;DR:** Work at a WITCH company, trying to switch to SWE - Currently doing a masters degree, plan on building a portfolio (3-4 projects). Should I apply for junior roles (when portfolio is done) during masters? Or wait it out and apply for grad programs? ",2023-07-05 09:55:01

P.S. I also have an offer from an investment bank (not big 4) for a Senior role, although I suspect this might not involve the typical tech projects I'm used to, but rather the development of scripts, tools, scheduled tasks, and other similar tasks.

I have a few questions for the community.

1. Do you use VIM? Why or why not (I am including using the VIM extension in any IDE)
2. If yes, when did you start using it?
3. Did you ever learn it in University?
4. What is the percentage of developers using VIM for editing within an IDE (IntelliJ extension as an example)/Neovim directly compared to other tool's like IntelliJ/VSC

For context, I have been programming for several years now, mainly using Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ. I have customised both tool's with plugins, keyboard shortcuts and the likes to become fluent using them.

However, throughout my time in University and the first few years of coding professionally, I have not learnt how to use VIM properly. Of course, I can use it for simple editing with the navigation keys, deleting, and quitting due to encountering it when editing configuration files. But I have never pursued it for my daily coding activities.

So I want to know if it is worth learning it given University's don't prioritise it anymore, and with so many GUI alternatives now.

The primary benefit I see from using VIM is being able to never have to learn new shortcuts when switching IDE's throughout one's career.",2023-05-16 05:25:35

For current interns (specifically at the large banks), PLEASE be or at least try to be pleasant to work with. I am currently working with an intern who recently started mid this year and have only completed 1 year at university. It is obvious you haven't done much group work before before your internship. 

If you're assigned a task, please attempt to do it, if you can't, reach out for help but don't expect people to do the work for you. I'm assigned a task with this particular intern, workload is meant to be 50/50 but I am doing 70-80% of it. This dude leaves work till the very last minute, it is not hard work, literally documentation... 

&#x200B;

To add to that... during calls with the seniors, you don't need to call me out telling me to share my screen, you do this every time the senior asks one of us to share our screen. As much as I don't like the pressure of sharing my screen to the senior it is good to share this pressure 50/50 instead of telling me constantly to do mine. Whenever there is some sort of pressure, you always try to put this pressure on me. It's bloody annoying.

&#x200B;

Drop your ego. Stop thinking you know it all. We were told by a senior to write the documentation in a very particular way. You decided for whatever reason to delete the layout and remove the formatting. After I asked you if we should revert it to the original layout as the seniors asked, you said ""Nah this should be fine, its minor anyways we can just change it back if need be if the seniors picks up on it"" 🤦🤦. Not only this but PLEASE double check your work before sending it to the seniors. It is quite annoying. I double and sometimes triple check my work ALL THE TIME however whenever I check your work, I always find at least 2 or 3 obvious errors (file names, file path... basic stuff).  


Stop talking over me when I am talking... or when anyone is talking. I thought parents taught their kids this while they were young? Is this something millennials lack nowadays?? Basic people skills?

&#x200B;

I can go on for days. I hope you read this and really take note otherwise you won't get far. If I've been working with you for less than 6 months and I feel this way about you already then not many people will want to work with you in the future. Please take note.",2022-10-21 12:19:56

uum40a,"Career change, is a Graduate Diploma valuable/employable?","Hi All, first time poster here! 

I am a recent law/commerce grad from Australia currently working in finance, and I am looking for a career change into tech. 

While I am complacent with my current job and career trajectory, I have been self-studying CS for a few months now with free online courses (Udemy, CS50 etc.) and I want to make a career change into tech/fintech. This does not look to be possible with my current qualifications, and as a result, I am looking to start a Graduate Diploma in Computer Science at Monash University. This is taught solely online and would allow me to continue working in my current position (in a different state) full time. 

However, I am hesitant about employability and unsure if recruiters hold graduate diplomas in similar regard to a bachelors. Most job openings in junior positions seem to require either a bachelors or graduate diploma in CS - however, I am unceratain if I would be at a disadvantage for not having the bachelors under my belt. 

Essentially - would I be better off spending another 3/4 years getting a third bachelors at a local university, or would a 1.5 year graduate diploma from Monash and strong portfolio put me in the running?

up51cv,Does staying at a small company hurt my career?,"I'm currently in university and will finish end of 2023. I'm also currently working at a small tech company (just past start up stage) part- time after finishing an internship with them last summer.

Since I'm in my penultimate year, I'm eligible for internships at big companies now. But I also really like my company right now, the vibe is great, the work is fun, I feel very valued, paid nicely with scheduled increases (not crazy but still pretty decently imo) have also been given and will continue to be given a lot of opportunities to network on behalf of the company too.  I'm pretty happy to stay where I am and the company seems to be growing well too (in the industry we are in we are emerging leaders).

But I've been told that I should apply to intern for the big companies instead of staying here because it will boost my resume and make it easier for me later on. Also that getting other internships is good for exposure to different things early in career.

Will staying here hurt my career? Is it okay if I stay here and try to find graduate roles later? Is it harder to find grad roles than it is internships?",2022-05-14 00:08:53

qs0yen,How soon can I start contracting?,"My ideal setup is 6 month contracts so I can travel internationally between jobs for 1-2 month breaks twice a year. I'm also feeling a bit stale in my current role and I find I enjoy project work more than BAU/maintenance.

Currently my TC (base+super+bonus) is ~130K full time which is equivalent to $577K daily rate according to http://www.contractorpermie.com so I guess I'd be applying for the $600-700 daily rate type gigs. 

Have gone from 

* startup (part-time 8 months) ->
* internship (part-time 6 months) -> 
* internship (full time 1 year) -> 
* full-time (1 year)

So have approx 3 years experience doing a mix of webdev doing react, vue, vanilla js and backend mostly python/nodejs/sql/mongodb/AWS and microservices plus some jenkins and minor kubernetes stuff. I also have a Computer Science degree.

Atm I'm thinking it may be worth jumping one more time to get Java monolith experience in an enterprise environment as I've heard it's basically mandatory for any government contract regardless of whether you actually use Java as it tends to be omnipresent.

I'm also thinking it's probably a good idea to complete either an AWS Solutions Architect, Azure Equivalent or Google K8s cert to show I do actually know how to use the Cloud. 

As far as contracting niches I guess I would prefer to not do web and do data engineer/pure backend so wondering if it's required to have full-time experience doing Scala/Hadoop etc. or if certification would be enough? I'm somewhat familiar due to personal projects.",2021-11-12 02:12:15
qnp0bj,Best pathway for me ?,"Hey guys hope you’re doing well ! Would like some opinions on what the current pathway into becoming a developer for me would be.

So a little abit about myself , I’m a 22yo graduate with a degree in infosys and marketing , currently a month into my first role in the IT industry as a junior project coordinator at a it consulting company . I’m looking at the possibility of becoming a developer in the future . I’ve always been to exposed to things technology in my life so I feel like I’ll be pretty quick to pick up on different languages .

Currently I have no development languages aside from some pretty solid data analytic skills and languages such as sql , dashboards (tableau) ,r and some basic python .

I was originally set out on being a business analyst but I’d feel as though I’d enjoy dev work more. Anyways I don’t foresee myself going back to uni to obtain a cs degree as I believe a infosys degree should be somewhat relevant and sufficient enough to get my cv through to an interview .

I did a little research and there’s two viable paths for me : one would be to continue my role and try pick up programming on the side but I believe this would take a good year or two  to get myself up to scratch on all the different skills needed to be a developer while working full time and my other life commitments. I’d do things like the Odin project , fcc etc 

The second choice would be to go all out and do a coding bootcamp full time  for 3 months (which is also fully funded by the government right now ) and work part time at a retail job or something . Then I would spend a few months really honing in and practising doing projects , leet coding and reading materials like CTCI etc. going this route I believe I could possibly get a shot at a grad role/internship at one of the big tech companies like canva etc over in Australia (as I recently graduated in 2020 so I still fit the criteria ).

Would love to hear your guys opinions ,especially from other self taught devs in the industry right now in the OCE context. sorry about the wall of text haha ,Greatly appreciated !",2021-11-06 00:49:34
oygtyg,DevOps or Data Engineer?,"**TLDR; Deciding between DevOps or Data Engineering - Thoughts? Your experiences? Anyone that has done both or know anyone that has and reason for the choice?**

Hi all, I am at a fork in the road at the moment with this career choice. I am pondering between which one to choose. I have been an automation test engineer for 2 years now (bounded by contract - soon I am able to seek a new role) and have decided that it's just not something I am proud of doing nor like to continue doing in my next role. A big part of me knows that I don't want to be in testing for life, because I am a person that likes to create and form solutions rather than test the solution. I'd like to be hands on within the action and also help make better decisions for people.

I really like the programming, problem solving and technical thinking that automation testing has given me, these transferrable skills have opened up the door for me to consider two roles - DevOps or Data Engineer. Both roles have great salaries. In Australia, there seems to be more of a demand for DevOps rather than Data Engineers, which I think will eventually pick back up, since I think it's just Australia being slightly behind in the tech. Below are my thinking for the two roles:

DevOps => Automation testing is a DevOps practice to begin with, which are skills that would benefit me being a DevOps engineer. I love automating things, making things efficient and love to idea of enabling faster releases to beat competitors, which I think it's what DevOps is all about. I am big on Machine Learning, hence MLOps is something that also very much excites me.

Data Engineer => Initially, I got into tech through my interest in Data Science/ Machine Learning. This is just me wanting to do something related to Data and ML eventually. Just wanted to see if there are any DevOps peeps that went actually from Data into DevOps and why? Or have actually transition or know people that has moved from DevOps and head into Data Engineering and why?

Hope I am not asking for too much because I am just so undecided between the two! Any information from anyone in DevOps or Data Engineering or just in tech in general in Australia, particularly in Sydney would really help!! You are all the experts and I would love a bit of guidance from you guys!

What you like and what you dislike about your roles? What's currently trending? So I can be more informed with my decision! I'd be so grateful for that. I am happy for you to challenge any of my assumptions above as well and say, mate you are wrong about this and that.

Hello! Can anyone shed some light on how i can evaluate my situation. My past and current roles' TC have always been base salary + cash bonus + super. Almost always in big/established companies.

Now, i got an opportunity to potentially join a (well known) startup. The TC package is slightly larger, and work is heaps more interesting compared to where i am now.

Some of my additional responsibilities include C# scripting to automate broadcasting tasks, as well as interacting directly with clients.  


I've learnt a lot in my time here, but my biggest fear is that since it is a niche field (TV broadcasting), I may have trouble gaining employment in other fields in the future or be left behind.

I am currently a penultimate-year student studying CS. While I am working as a Junior Full-Stack Engineer at my University on a part-time basis (contract work, not a university internship), I don't know if it's worth it to continue to try to find other opportunities/internships over the summer.

The current job has a lot for me to learn, from full-stack development to data pipelines and all sorts of technologies. It's also a relatively smaller team, so there is room for me to move around and work with whatever I want to work with, but I felt if I interned at a big-name company, it might be helpful. However, at the same time, this current job gives me lots of room to learn and stability.

16oi4it,Data engineer contractor at WooliesX,"Hi everyone! 

I've been recently going through the interview process for data engineer contractor at WooliesX. A recruiter from some agency found me and connected me for the interview.

Here are some of my concerns
- the contract is only for 6 months and with an aim (no promise ofc) for permanent role. Has anyone worked as a contractor there? What was your experience? Have you seen people getting a permanent role? 

- Because it's via a recruitment agent, I'll technically be hired by the agency, paid by the agency but working onsite for WooliesX. I've heard of this but never done it myself as it sounded dodgy. Am I just being paranoid or is it really dodgy? What are some things I should know before jumping into a contract like this?

- Initially, recruiter told me that contract is only for 3 months. After the interview, recruiter kept trying to get a verbal agreement from me for the 3 month time. I said I'll think about it but first I wanna see the interview results. He kept pushing me and after saying no, he proceeds to withdraw my application saying there is no point wasting our time and waiting for interview results. I tried contacting the people from WooliesX who took my interview and expressed my concerns and they said the contract is for 6 months. All of this just gives me more dodgy vibes about the recruiter. Is there a way I can get a contract directly from WooliesX, rather than going through this recruiter for the role? 

For context, I'm already employed with a fixed term contract which will last over a year but I'm not very happy with the company and wanna look for better opportunities. However, I also don't wanna shoot myself in the foot with a dodgy and uncertain move like this. Any comment or suggestion is appreciated :)",2023-09-21 14:59:31

Most of the jobs I see in the market are either contract work focused on data engineering or data analysis, or in the mining industry where, in my opinion, the software development practices and standards are not very high.

My applications to Canva are getting rejected immediately.

15o2igq,Should I get a computer science or IT degree??,"Should I get a computer science or IT degree??

I’m currently in year 12 and I’ve left it last minute to decide on what degree I want to go to uni for. If my end goal is to work in the cyber security field, which degree would be the most beneficial?

Initially I was gonna go with the IT degree but after researching my options I’ve became more confused. I’ve read somewhere that a guy found what he learnt from a CS degree to be more beneficial as you dont learn it in an IT degree (not sure on the specifics). Additionally, I’ve read a lot about a CS degree being more valued over an IT degree. Anyways, any advice would be helpful, I just don’t wanna waste my time at uni lol",2023-08-11 07:59:10
15nu0vn,Thinking of jumping to Data Analytics. Can anyone here who works in that tell me about it compared to SWE/Web Development?,"Obviously, I know the definition of each field, but I don't have professional experience yet in either. I've mainly learned web development (Python, Django, HTML/CSS, JS, Git, Bootstrap, SQL) and built apps/websites using those.  
I love programming and the problem-solving/creativity aspect of it, but I also need a job(duh!). So, I'm now at a crossroad because I heard that Data Analytics **doesn't involve as much programming!**

Do I continue learning towards being a SWE? React, CI/CD, Docking, Algorithms etc... All skills I'm missing.

Or, do I leverage my knowledge in Python/SQL and go with Data?

I'm also thinking about the over saturation of ppl aiming at SWE + I like figuring out trends/drawing data(in my head atleast lol), but the maths aspect of Data Analytics worries me a bit. Any clarity would be highly appreciated.",2023-08-11 00:53:43
14vp1sg,Need Advice: Struggling with Career as a Data Engineer (Sydney),"Hey there,

I'm reaching out to this community for some advice regarding my current career situation. Here's a brief overview:

* Graduated with High Distinction from USYD with majors in Computer Science and Data Science.
* Over 1.5 years of experience as a Data Engineer, ~~proficient in~~ with relevant experience in Python, SQL, IaC (Terraform, Puppet), and CI/CD.
* Currently on a Grad Working Visa in Sydney, expiring end of next year. Working towards Permanent Residency (PR) application but it is always uncertain.
* Recently switched jobs to a company (XX) as a Data Engineer, but the actual role differs significantly from the job description. My team mainly use Alteryx for data wrangling, not the Python and ETL work I expected.
* After a month at XX, no technical projects have come my way despite me asking my manager for more coding related tasks. Started looking for new jobs but facing constant rejections (not even interviews/coding tests), making me doubt my abilities or if my visa status is hindering me.
* Losing hope for employer sponsorship due to inability to even secure a job in the first place.

Seeking advice/suggestions for next steps or insights from anyone who has been through a similar situation. Please share your thoughts.

Thank you in advance.

134nyn9,Options for living and working in Aus for 6-12 months,"Hi all,

I'm toying with the idea of spending some time living and working in Australia, likely 6-12 months and maybe more if I like it! Ideally Melbourne as I have friends there.

I'm from the UK. I'm 35, so too old for the Working Holiday visa; I've read that it's going to be extended to from 30 to 35 soon, but that's likely to be in July and I turn 36 in May :(

I'm a lead/senior dev with 14 years of experience (although I wasn't super career-focused in my twenties), I do full-stack and back-end web application stuff with JS/TS/Python, been working in a big bank for the last few years and small companies before that.

I'm aware that between the temporary nature of my plan, the current market, and Australia not having quite the same opportunities as Silicon Valley or even UK/Europe, I'm not likely to find my ""dream job"", and I'd most likely be looking at contract roles. Which is fine, although also makes the visa question trickier since I doubt a company would sponsor someone for that sort of period.

I've read mixed things about whether it's best to get sponsored by a company before going or to sort out your own visa, move over, then look for work.

The visa I come across most often in my research is [482 Temporary Skill Shortage](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-skill-shortage-482), but from the wording it sounds like it's aimed at employers rather than individuals. And the other skilled worker visas cost over $4000, which is hard to justify for a short-ish stay.

So my question is what sort of work I should look for and where (I know about Seek, but it's hard to know where to start on it!), and which type of visa to look into. I'm also happy to get a reality check and be told that I should just save up some cash and go over for a holiday, then consider moving for the longer term if I really like it.

11rnrch,Degree Title Matter in Australia?,"Hello, I'll keep it short and sharp.

For background - I am 22, from Melbourne, 1 year into a 3 year bachelor of I.T and have worked on a IT service desk for \~3 years. I am not sure exactly which path I want to go down in the Tech industry but thinking software over hardware.

The first year of my IT degree has been enjoyable and educational, have done all the coding the degree offers (which I enjoyed) and some networking work. The next 2 years are not really IT focused, over 70% are business courses e.g. teamwork and leadership and workplace preparation type courses.

As I enjoyed coding and as a result of the lack of IT courses, I was thinking about switching to a bachelor of Software Engineering with the caveat being it is a four year course and I would have to start from the start (I have confirmed this). Looking at the course outline, it all seems interesting and very in depth. Instead of graduating in 2 years it would be in \~4.5 years, however, this extra time isn't a massive deal to me, I am not really in a rush.

Would you recommend finishing the IT degree and supplementing with a good bit of self study on coding or whatever field I want to go down when I decide? Or go down the Software engineering route and get arguably a more well rounded education?

Or would you even recommend no more Uni and just focus on self study due to the lack of IT components in the degree? I am keen to learn, motivated and I know if I was to down this path I would do at least a few hours of self study a day.

p.s for reasons I won't get into to keep this short, a CS degree is not an option.

TLDR: Finish a less educational degree with a 'worse' degree title in 2 years or start from scratch, learn a lot and get a 'better' degree title in 4.5 years. Or self study? Ultimately, I’m happy with any path but obviously want to try pick the best path.

1bs372n,Delay my graduation date for top tech company? ,"Hey there,

pretty much i’m a final year Commerce and IT student and here’s where i’m at:

- two internships (one ASX200 company and one Big4) 
- few extracurriculars (volunteering, not for profit, student clubs) 
-  High 70s WAM 
- Cofounder of a startup that i’ve been working on fairly diligently for the past 6 months 

I’ve been applying for graduate positions recently and feel fairly confident about it but grad positions for top tech companies like atlassian and canva are quite unlikely for me. I’m wondering however if it’s worth delaying my graduation date by a semester to be eligible for an internship at atlassian or some other similar company and then reapply for the grad position to give myself more of an edge. This is of course because i’d be far more competitive to get their internship program. What do we think? Waste of time?  

Of course i will continue to apply for graduate positions and only delay my degree if i’ve got an internship locked in. ",2024-03-31 05:52:56

I understand that there are bootcamps and other courses you can do to up skill but ultimately I feel like having a qualification would benefit me in the long run.

1az89r3,Junior looking for career advice,"So some backstory:  


I am 37 years old and I currently work as a full time Junior Full Stack developer as a contractor for a Startup that is building a couple of different Blockchain based apps. I have worked as a developer now for about 10 months.

I went to University at age 29 and studied for a few years, completed about half a Bachelor of Science majoring in mathematics, failed a bunch of courses and ended up leaving due to financial and mental health reasons. I met my current partner, moved away from the city, got interested in Blockchain which gave me motivation to learn how to code. I spent about 18 months self learning front end development using Typescript with React and Smart Contract development with Solidity. I worked hard in my spare time, built some portfolio projects and eventually got my current job. 

At the time it seemed like the general attitude was that a degree wasn't so much a requirement anymore and that as long as you had a good portfolio you could get a job. However it seems like that has changed now.

As I have grown as a developer and looked outside the Blockchain bubble I have become wary of Blockchain, the hype, lack of real utility, gambling, scams etc. have really started to get to me and I have lost interest, however I am very motivated to improve on Full Stack web dev and put a lot of time into that. I have started to look at getting another job and have been adding to my portfolio, grinding some leetcode etc. I also have a good relationship with my current team and have learnt a lot from the senior devs about writing cleaner code, working in a team, various other soft skills and heaps more. I have no issue with the company at all.

I am a bit concerned though now though that my lack of degree will have me struggling to get another job. I am considering maybe taking on an online CS degree part time but I'm unsure as I currently have a fair bit of HECS debt.

I am looking for opinions on whether my current experience is going to be valuable in looking for a new junior role? or will I be completely overlooked because of no degree? I was under the impression that work experience trumps education but now I'm not so sure.

I am also worried that because I work for a web3 startup that my experience won't be taken as seriously? even though I am fairly skilled in Typescript/React/Next.js (for a junior anyway)

TLDR; I am a junior dev working for a web3 startup for the last 10 months. I am self taught and have no degree. I want to move away from blockchain and I'm concerned my current work experience won't be enough because of my lack of degree. ",2024-02-24 23:05:12
1ayva5r,how to become a better swe,"I think this has been asked previously but I'd like to have some input along with my personal experience.  
  
Along with the really bad job market at the moment, a lot of people (especially new grads) mostly focused on getting a job, getting interviews, doing a lot of leetcode. I have been there too. I've been on the line of desperation to just find a job and I'll deal with any problems that come after, later.  
  
Fortunately, I found a company that was willing to take me on as an intern for a year and convert me to permanent employee after. It's been about almost 2 months ish working there as a dev. (don't worry I get paid pretty well)  
  
So far, it was mainly onboarding, getting familiar with tech stack, or any other technology that the company uses and most important of all, get familiar with my team. My team has been super nice and helpful in every aspect as possible while being extremely lenient and accomodating to my needs. (I'm still studying part time).

I'm so lost in the massive code base that has been around for longer than I have. All these different technologies that are intertwined starting from front end to back end to cloud and all the other stuff that are way more advanced than anything I've seen. One respository consisting of like 8 different programming languages.   
  
Now that I've gotten over the hurdle of actually securing a job, I startd to think about what it takes to be a better software engineer, regardless of that promotion or raise or anything, I just want to be that dev that just knows how to solve an issue if a problem rises in any domain (whether it's front end, back end, cloud etc).  
  
In your experienced opinoins, what's the best way to become a better software engineer? if I do move companies, what are the good skills I need/should have to be able to adapt quickly and make impact as fast as I can? I always hear you need to be a communicator and ask questions as a junior dev but what am I communicating? how do I communicate if I don't know what's going on? How do I ask something I don't know, if I don't know what I don't know.  
  
What are the more efficient ways learn and adapt quickly regardless of where I work at, what I work with and who I work with?

Company A (Start Up):

* $60k base + bonus + stock options.
* 1 hour commute **by public transport** (around 45 minutes by car).
* Full time in office (with option to work from home in the future).
* JavaScript/TypeScript (React + Node) and potentially Python for AI/ML.
* Contract already signed (I would feel extremely bad backing out from it now even though I legally can).

Company B (Big company, known worldwide):

* $70k base.
* \~1 hour and 15 mins commute **by car.**
* 3 days in office, 2 days from home.
* **Salesforce position!!**

I am leaning towards company A because of the lower commute time and technologies. Working with Salesforce does not really appeal to me. Additionally, backing out of the contract now feels like a massive dog move.

1aeret9,Moving for a grad job,"I’ve been studying computer science part time while working full time as an APS 5 & 6 in government (unrelated to IT) and graduated at the end of 2023. I’ve landed a grad role in a tech stream in a major bank due to start in a few weeks. I have to relocate for the role from my home city to Melbourne and it will be a pay cut by about $20k (including super) plus I’ll have to pay a lot more in rent (currently I have really affordable accommodation as I’m boarding at a friends place). 

I’ve been feeling stressed about making the move because of the rental/housing crisis in Melbourne (its everywhere really), being away from family/friends and also the step back in terms of pay. Additionally it doesn’t really seem as though the tech grad stream involves programming (the company’s software engineers are primarily located in the Philippines apparently).  However, I know the market for computer science grads is tough at the moment and in my home city there’s limited options for junior/grad dev jobs. 

I really don’t know what to do and am feeling conflicted as if I don’t take this grad job I might not be able to get another one easily (or a junior dev job because of the way the market is right now).

Ideally if I could work remotely from Brisbane (my home city) doing the grad program that would make the majority of my worries go away as I’d have secure/affordable accommodation and a support network. It seems a bit pointless for me to have to move to Melbourne when the company’s work culture is that there are 3 days working from home and so it’s not like I have to be in the office much anyway.

I am 19 years old, and I am in my second year studying Computer Science at a G8 Uni. With this degree, I get to do honours guaranteed as long as I maintain a specific WAM. I am doing fairly well at Uni with an 86 WAM and received the highest marks in Operating systems when I was in my first year (normally a second-year sem 2 unit).

I currently am on a research project which works on developing medical AI in collaboration with a major hospital. I'm looking to move to a team-lead role since we are very close to getting expanding and working with a lab at another major hospital.

I also work as a Quant at a small hedge. The work is pretty hard, and I am struggling. But I making it through. I am building a risk mitigation algorithm from scratch for them. I have also recently gotten a return offer from them. There is no other senior Quant, so there is not much mentorship on the Quant side. My boss is in finance.

I am interested in AI, especially its use in medicine. I am also very interested in low-level and embedded programming as well as robotics. I would love to work on Operating Systems, kernels, embedded devices, and even massively distributed systems that need to be fast.

**My issue**

I have recently been feeling really worried about the future. I have been applying for internships at Big Tech and HFT and have been rejected from everywhere. This has really hit my confidence. I feel like I am just not smart enough for this career. Especially since I am struggling at my job.

Also, seeing generative AI like ChatGPT makes me very scared. I know ChatGPT won't fully replace SWEs, but won't it reduce the demand? This, combined with the fact that anyone from a BootCamp can get an SWE job, make me really concerned about whether I will even be able to get a job in the future. I have recently learnt about how companies offshore SWEs, which is adding to my fear.

Looking through some jobs for embedded engineering or engineering roles that relate to programming but are not SWE, a fair chuck requires engineering or Electrical engineering degrees. I fear that due to my lack of qualifications, I will be barred from those roles.

Furthermore, I have heard that Electrical Engineering is a lot safe and stable.

This has led to me considering switching to either Electrical Engineering or a double degree. I am fairly interested in Electrical Engineering as well as CS. I am also pretty sure I can do decently well in Electrical Engineering. My options are:

1. Switch to Electrical Engineering. This will take 3.5 years from now. I have done 1.5 years of my current degree, so it will be a title of 5 years.
2. Switch to Electrical Engineering + CS double degree. This would take about 5.5 years in total (normally, a double is 5 years). It would be an extra semester since there are some electives I can't get credit for. In the worst case, it would take an extra year.
3. Stay in CS and get my honours (I really enjoy research). This takes 4 years (so 2.5 years left).
4. Get a masters in Electrical engineering. There are some unis that allow you to have a different undergrad degree to get the masters. However, I will need to meet the physics prerequisite, which will require me not to take some of the AI subjects that I really want to take. This would take 5.5 to 6 years in total if I don't do my CS honours.

I have talked to some qualified people close to me and have gotten some mixed opinions. However, the general advice from more experienced professionals is to do CS. However, I really am doubting I could ever do well since other people in CS are so much smarter.

I was hoping for some advice from strangers.",2023-06-21 13:33:48
1488zeo,Desperate and looking for leads,"Sorry for the throwaway account, but I'm kind of humiliated making this post.

Does anyone have any leads about places that are hiring? I'm prepared to work for free/minimum wage just to get my foot in the industry. Just want experience.

* Graduated computer science degree in 2021 (HD average).
* 2 yoe working at a faang company (think Google/Amazon/Microsoft). Have 5 cloud certifications.
* MERN/Typescript/Python. But happy to code in anything. Very willing to learn.

Right now I have a few basic projects in my portfolio, weather app, to-do list, tictactoe game, which I know are like the most basic of the basic. But all were suggested projects for junior developers when I browsed around. 
Could a portfolio of that level be enough to be considered for an interview? I know my performance during the interviews is a whole other thing, but I’m mainly wondering how far I am from actually being able to at least get to that step in the process of being interviewed

117ww0g,How can I become a Product Manager in Australia?,"I am currently studying a software engineering/commerce (finance) double degree. Short term I'd just like to get into a software engineering graduate program, but the idea of becoming a product manager much later in my career appeals to me.

Recently studying commerce has felt like a bit of a waste of time and stress given my short-term plans. My parents are strongly urging me to continue with finance but they do not work in tech. I don't mind finance but at the moment I find software units more enjoyable. It is still an option for me to change major into something like marketing science.

So my questions: How can I become a Product Manager in Australia? What qualifications are needed? Would my finance degree give me an advantage or should I drop it? (do employers even care what degree I did at 10+ YoE?)",2023-02-21 06:48:22
117brov,What does a senior engineer do in a product engineering role,"For some backgroud I've been working as a product engineer for about a year and did about 6 months before that as a front end engineer. I'm starting to feel that im not going to be sufficiently challenged throughout my career as most jobs seem to just be implenting solutions to system design problems that have already been througly solved. 

- Am I naive to think that most problems a product engineer faces are solved? 
- For some of the more senior product engineers, what is the challenging part about your jobs given you've probably built a few complex systems by now.
- Do you have to join a infrastructure company such as AWS, Temporal, Confluent etc. to work on problems that are technical or do you have to go into research and academia for that.

Ultimately, i am curious how transferable the skills are if i wanted to move into a platform engineering role. I feel there is so much abstraction in modern software engineering that i don't really know how most of the tech works at a low level and the learning curve would be too big to transistion when im more senior in my career. My worry is that the codebase and libraries that product engineers work (web-dev frameworks like spring etc.) with is very different to the codebase proper platform engineers work with (OS libraries etc.)",2023-02-20 16:13:46

But, I have heard that people with introductory ReactJS skills are a dime a dozen and it is hard to get an entry-level job. Is this true?

My question is, should I create some projects in Java, Python, Angular2, C# and ASP.NET etc to land some sort of entry-level job in Melbourne or remote? I have heard that a lot of corporations use ASP.NET & C# in addition to Angular2 and there is less competition for entry level jobs.

z3f0a1,"Advice in pivoting away from SAP to a more ""normal"" programming job","Hi, right out of Uni I got a job working with SAP (however not with the company directly) and I have been developing in mostly ABAP while sometimes working with other languages.

I currently have 4 years of experience now but my work has started to dry up a bit and I'm getting worried. Looking at people being stuck in a niche and being let go with no other experience to help the job search is worrying me for the future.

Because of this I'd like to possibly move into a more ""normal"" programming job for my career. I personally think a job is a job so I'm not fussed about working with cutting edge technologies, being in a prestigious company or any of those touted extras. I just want to work in programming which I really enjoy. The only thing weighing on me is my mortgage, so unfortunately I can't take a $50k job to get my foot in the door, my mortgage isn't too big though so I don't need a $100k or anything.

I enjoy back end way more than front end and have good skills in databases and SQL. Unfortunately all these were done in SAP so I'm not sure how difficult it would be to transfer these skills over. I also have skills in other languages but they have become a bit rusty since Uni.

Any advice would be appreciated!

z0qh8m,Employement Help. Where to go from here?,"Hi, people of the internet. The reason for this post is pretty simple. I'm at the start of my professional journey so I am really lacking experience that would help me decide these things for myself. I was hoping I could get some advice on personal projects to pursue, what I should be teaching myself, how much to 'inflate' my resume by and even what type of internship I should next be going for. 

I am a second-year university student studying Software Engineering at UTS. I have completed a 6-month internship at a startup doing game dev in unity. The course is 5 years long and I have to complete another internship in my fourth year. I was considering trying to shoot for Optiver considering they pay quite well. Aside from this company, where else would you recommend? Preferably somewhere where I can get some 1 on 1 / in-person time with other devs for learning. (My first internship was all remote). 

From what I've done so far I don't really like working on the front-end though its probably too early to know for sure. Given that and my experience what would be some good projects to work on that I can put on a resume while learning a lot from them?

ts1ami,"How best to find work, given my pros & cons","When I was in my 20s it frustrated me that it was easy to find the job ads for the better workers, but it was never clear who was hiring the below-par graduates like me.

Now at age 41 I'm in a different position. On the positive side, over 10 years software dev experience (as part-time employee and freelancer). Primarily JS & PHP. Some Python, Java, Perl. C++ back in the day.

The most impressive thing I have to my name is Mappage, a hobby project of the last 13 years, a data viz & maps tool, primarily for census stats, with its own coding system. ([Mappage](https://mappage.net.au/) and click Examples; for animated examples see [this one](https://m3.mappage.net.au/?a=st_vax1) and [more data stories here](https://stories.mappage.net.au/) ).

On the downside, I can't do anything more than half-time because of my limited capacity and existing projects that will need support. If the right freelance gig came up that would only take 10h/w, I'd take it and be content. I'm in Adelaide, which doesn't have the demand or big $$$ of the larger cities, although there's still a fair bit happening (inc some new stuff). I've never made much more than $40k in a year (mostly because I haven't done that many hours).

I'm not really in any hurry, but I put a profile on LinkedIn (and recruiters are contacting me and it occurred to me that the ones that find you first are less likely to have an ideal job...) so now I'm wondering:  
What is my best course of action?  
Can having written Mappage get me anywhere?  
Should I study up on data science, since much of what I've done in Mappage is like data science so I might be halfway there?

1bsxvym,Resume and interview coaching service adding fake experience,"Hi everyone,

I’ve stumbled upon something that’s left me puzzled, and I’m hoping to get your insights on it. I found a company offering resume editing and interview practice for job seekers in Australia, but something about their approach seems off to me.

Many of their client profiles include work experience at a specific company, which is owned by the same individual behind the resume service. Curiously, some profiles show an abrupt gain of over 10 months to 1 year of experience practically overnight.

It appears to me that the company might be adding fake job experiences to their clients’ resumes, possibly to help them secure an unfair advantage with what looks like local experience.

I’m not looking to accuse anyone without solid evidence, but the practice, if true, raises ethical questions for me. It seems to undermine fair play in the job market by giving some an edge through fabricated experiences.

Do you think this is a common or accepted practice in the resume polishing/interview coaching industry?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and if anyone has seen something similar.

Thanks for the insights!",2024-04-01 08:02:48

I’ve been working at a start-up part time for close to 8 months now, and the learning that I’ve been able to get there has been incredible. It was founded only 4-5 months before I started there, and I’ve been a significant contributor for the past few months after putting in a lot of work to learn more about the technologies and reading documentation over and over again. I’ve been told we are close to raising a seed round and if they were to offer me a place there FT, should I accept it?

1b2v24n,Flexible jobs / working arrangements,"Hi everyone,

Most people on this sub appear to post about salaries and company culture. I was more curious about which companies provide good flexible working options? For example, CBA has a 50% in office requirement per month, but you can work from any office in the country (within being sensible). Pretty good compared to ANZ's 100% in office requirement (from what I've heard).

For my personal situation I'm someone who has close family and friends in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne. So I appreciate the ability to go between different cities, sometimes just for a weekend, sometimes for 2 weeks. I'm primarily based in Melbourne at the moment but could definitely see myself moving back to Brisbane in a year or two. Overall, I value flexibility in where I can work,

So yeah, please go ahead and post what the working arangements are in your company. Espicially if it helps with your work life balance and gives you a lot freedom with where and how you can make a living.

1ao4hgz,Fullstack Developer ROADMAP confusion.," 

Hi there. I checked out the roadmap.sh for fullstack development and it mentioned in the introductory phase that I should learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

However, I was planning on doing a project in C++ because people say you should solve a problem, do something that your passionate about, or connect to a personal hobby to learn programming more efficiently (maybe a game or something).

Another thing was the topic of beginners thinking they need to learn many languages, people have advised against this as the underlying problem solving skills that you will develop learning a language will transfer to other languages, but also it's more fruitful to know one language well than it is to know the basics of a bunch of different languages.

I'm confused as to what I should do, should I just follow the C++ developer roadmap?

My ultimate goal was to simply get a ""Software Engineering"" role at any company. I'm aware of frontend and backend, and I've chosen the goal of trying to be a fullstack developer. What should I do ?

1anfmvk,FAANG like roles from Perth?,"Over the past few years I've been hearing about developers at FAANG companies making crazy salaries, like $400k USD per year. Which would be $600k AUD.

So I'm a developer in Perth and I've found myself looking for a job for the first time in a few years. There's a lot of good jobs around which I'm very grateful for, but the best I'm going to do is about $200k AUD per year.

I have a hard requirement to live in Perth (and I love Perth) but is there any way to get those super high paying jobs without moving to silicon valley? Just seems crazy that getting a top paying job here is 1/3 the amount of getting a good job there.

1an44f8,Junior to Mid level SWE looking for advice,"3+ years of experience SWE and lost on what to do next. Intern experience not included which is about another YoE.

Being made redundant in a couple months from a larger tech company (not FAANG). Feel like I only really have 1-1.5 years of relevant experience where I was pushing myself and learning, my first job was using super legacy tech stack and there wasn't much to learn there so I coasted through it till I found my second job where I applied myself and learnt a lot in the first year and a half but then coasted again. I am applying for jobs now and have been grinding leetcode (getting fairly confident at it) but I feel as though I lack experience with a lot of relevant technologies. 

I have done some work with React and Angular in the past, but would consider my work heavily back-end focused (Java, python, C++ etc.). I have minimal to no AWS hands on experience which seems to be in every job listing (have started a course for AWS associate Solutions Architect, but that will take some time). My weaknesses as a developer are currently not being as independent as I'd like and sometimes getting lost in a massive codebase. My strengths are a genuine passion to learn which I've rediscovered during this interview prep and griding leetcode. Generally my imposter syndrome is in full tilt as you can tell.

Not sure whether to apply to my third Junior role with 3+ years of experience or if that will look like a red flag, there is also quite a shortage of junior roles right now, with most roles leaning towards senior level (from my experience in job hunting this past couple weeks). I feel as though I would be able to handle a mid-level role if I really applied myself, and am scared to fall back to coasting if I take a junior role as it may be comfortable (which was the case in my current role hence coasting towards the end).

I also wanted to ask whether I should stick to applying for roles with Java-focused tech stack (maybe using spring/spring-boot) as this is where my current ""expertise"" is from my last role or if it's early days and I should be as tech-stack agnostic as possible right now.

Thanks for reading this, any advice is greatly appreciated!",2024-02-10 01:11:16

From what I see, I have two options in 2024:

1. Join a coding bootcamp such a Coder Academy or Le Wagon which have strong reviews, career guidance and a structured learning path (qualification) which may be recognized by a potential employer. It'll cost $20k but it can be added to my HECS (no current debt).
2. Self-learn using The Odin Project and [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) for about 6 months, requires a lot more self-discipline and time but won't cost me anything.

I was leaning on option 1 but the current employment market in tech is worrying me, I don't want to sink $20k into a bootcamp and not get a job due to hiring freezes, that way option 2 is free and I can spend more time learning and not have that financial hit.

NZ-based. 30+ per hour. Paid lunch. Free snackies at work. I would say considering my current circumstances as a student studying full-time, this pays really, REALLY well compared to my past part time jobs in warehousing/manufacturing.

The dilemma: 
I want to be a software developer. Current job is IT, so not a lot of overlap with software development.

My job is usual sysadmin stuff, with a bit of network administration when it pops up as the company I work at also owns a data centre. Small-ish MSP, but a lot of clients. Aside from the technical side of things, working for an MSP also involves a lot of client interaction.

I've been looking at softdev internships, thinking that I would eventually need one anyway to get a job in software development. That means giving up this job, and potentially not having a job next school year when the internship ends (if I land one).


Is it a wise move to quit and get a software dev internship? Or keep the job, do more projects, and apply for grad roles/junior positions later on?

I’m in a bit of a difficult situation and I’m curious to know how others here would handle this.

I’ve been working at my current company for just over a year. Recently my manager left and I joined a new team. My previous manager was fantastic - respectful, supportive, encouraging and transparent. For the past 6 months in our catch ups she told me that I would be due for a pay rise at the next review.

I don’t particularly like the new team I’m in, and our pay review recently happened and I didn’t receive any change. I only received positive feedback from my previous manager. How should I approach my new manager about this? Unfortunately I don’t have anything in writing from my previous manager, only that she mentioned verbally that I’d be up for a pay increase.

11vdahl,Common NZ job boards,"Hi I’m from South Africa and looking to move to Aus or Nz next year. My current company has offices in Auckland, Wellington, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane so I might try an internal transfer. Or I am willing to find a new employer. There are plenty of jobs on LinkedIn when searching for Software engineer in Australia on Linkedin. Some immigration specialist told me that I won’t make it into Aus without 4yoe (I will have 3 by this time next year). 
But he said NZ would be easy to emigrate to, and that software engineering is a Green List Tier 1 job, which means I could also go the Straight to Permanent Residency route. However looking at software engineering openings on Linkedin for NZ, I find less than 1000 jobs. Same with Indeed. Is there another, perhaps more popular job board for NZ openings ? Or is the job market that small?

I'm graduating this year, and have been lucky to have been given two graduate offers. 

I wanted advice on which offer to take, and saw that this would be the right place to post. 

&#x200B;

**Background:** Data Science undergrad. 1 internship. 

# Offer 1 - Software Startup 

**Role:** Graduate Data Engineer 

**Upsides:** 

* Great culture (from the interviews and what I have seen in reviews) 
* More money ($90k) 
* Good potential for fast promotion 

**Downsides:** 

* WFH not possible (resulting in a 1.5 hour one way commute) 

# Offer 2 - Deloitte

**Role:** Graduate Consultant - Data and AI 

**Upsides:** 

* Good culture (although I know that this may vary across teams) 
* WFH likely possible 

**Downsides:** 

* Less money ($70k) 

I want to start my career with no regrets.

xc1n9y,Moving from public sector to private,"Hi,

A bit about me

* Late 30s
* Have an IT degree from over 10+ years ago which covered some CS concepts like programming, databases and web
* Worked in gov web roles for 10+ years, building / maintaining websites. Mostly static sites or integrating with a particular CMS that uses its own templating markup (no real programming required)
* Currently half my time is managing a website / being a product owner, the other half is coding components in react or vue by myself (self taught). Coding is not required for my position but I like doing it and can justify it with the money we save doing things in house
* Never had technical mentors so can't gauge if my code is decent (feel like its not)
* I have very limited options in terms of career progression. Currently on 120K
* Don't have any developer friends I can talk to 
* Have talked with recruiters but they are usually uninterested because I can't say I have x years 'commercial experience' in given languages or frameworks

At the moment I have a strong urge to leave government for good and try to go for more technical roles in the private sector. Partially for financial reasons, but also for growth and not enjoying my job anymore.

I'm wondering what I need to do to improve my chances of landing a decent job before committing to leaving government. I would say I'm intermediate with html / css / js (no TS), can use git, have worked a little with python and node on personal projects but feel like that sounds like someone the experience level of a grad or junior level which would be less money than what I'm on now.

I'm not great at leet code or math, so not looking to do CS type roles, but more frontend / full stack. I guess what I'm wondering is what can i do or learn to show that could appeal to future employers? Are there any particular languages, or courses that i should focus on? Should I go for certs like the AWS Certified Developer to show that I'm committed to learning?

Any advice is appreciated!",2022-09-12 03:05:37

I have an offer of joining a small VC firm as a data science intern. But after our phone interview, i noticed a couple of red flags.

I've signed the contract.

I'm thinking about changing my mind on the move, simply because they have treated me so badly in the past. I was meant to start last march as I had a return offer after a successful internship but they messed up by putting me in the wrong team, which was found out too late (HR is located overseas and have no fking idea what they are doing). It was a complete shamble. Took 6 months of calls and emails to fix, I was so stressed and angry because I was the only graduate this happened to.  I ended up on anti-depressants due to the constant 'Will I or will I not have a job'?

o4seid,"Should I start looking for grad roles or apply to ""real"" jobs?","So I've just started thinking about what to do after I finish University this year, and have a number of different factors in trying to figure out what to do. I'm aware I probably should've started looking into this earlier in the year, but oh well. Apologies for the ramble, but it's important background to my prospects.

The short version is that I've been studying IT at UTS, and decided to do an honours project (with VR+AR) this year, padding me out to my 5th year of study. I've enjoyed the uni life, but know it should finally come to an end and don't want to stick around for a PhD or anything.

Meanwhile, for the last 4 years I have been also working in web development with several different stacks, and doing a lot of learning on the job. This has been with a small family business (not my family), so they have been extremely flexible and understanding around uni and life, but don't pay that well. I've been happy here, but there isn't really much more room for me to grow in either skill or pay.

So - should I start looking for grad roles, or apply to ""real"" jobs? I'm not really sure if they'd be right for me, but I'd also be interested in gaining the experiences they'd offer with rotating around different roles. But I'm not really sure when the best time to start applying for grad roles is/was?

I'd also be interested in working further with VR or AR, or even in the games industry - but I'm not really sure where to start with either of those ideas.

I also want to take some time off between the end of this year, and starting anything new, but I don't know if that will play much of a factor?

Any suggestions are welcome! Thanks in advance :)",2021-06-21 10:50:27

I'm currently on $70k and my title says junior developer. I'm a bit sick of this salary and want to get to >$100k sooner than later but don't know if I ask for this in interviews if I'll be laughed out of the building. So far when asked salary expectations I have been saying $85k to $90k but don't know if I'm lowballing myself.

I don't think I'm the best software developer in the world but the experience I have from working with others who are on large salaries... they seem fairly average themselves.

Should I really knuckle down and learn the entire language (JS probably) or just worry about learning well when I come across things at work?

hizm9i,How can Software Engineers find Trading Systems Developer jobs in Tech/Quant Finance?,"Tech/Quant Finance jobs are mostly located near the financial hubs — New York, Chicago in the US; London, Amsterdam in Europe; Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo in Asia; Sydney in Australia, etc.

These jobs are typically hired by firms via headhunters. The best way to get noticed is with a good profile on LinkedIn. Usually, the recruiters reach you out if you hit certain keywords related to the job such as C++, Linux, Multithreading, Trading Systems Development, previous work experience in tech/quant finance roles, etc. You may also reach recruiters via LinkedIn InMails. Another way to get interviews is by applying to jobs on efinancial careers, LinkedIn Jobs, dice, etc. which are posted by the head hunters.

Most firms have no problem hiring software developers from junior to senior levels with no previous work experience in tech/quant finance roles as long as they have a strong relevant technical background. Tech Lead/Engineering Management roles are typically for people with a background in developing similar systems.

There are a variety of firms operating in this space such as — Hedge Funds, Quant Trading firms, Algo Trading firms, Prop Trading firms, Exchanges, Market Makers, Investment Banks, Brokerages, Trading Software/Analytics providers, etc. While the work for the software developer varies based on what the firm is doing, the underlying technical skills are very similar.

I will do another post on what topics a software developer needs to prepare for interviews at financial markets related companies to work on automated trading systems.

1b9hogi,BG checks and job gap,"Hi,

So basically, I have a employment gap that is closing in on a year now and read somewhere online that even saying you did some non-related casual work for a couple months during that period is better than leaving it blank. Problem is, I haven’t. Does even claiming to have done some casual retail work during that gap have the potential to fuck you over? Not sure if it’s worth the risk, but the job market seems rough and the gap is only getting bigger.

I’ve only started applying seriously at the start of this year and have gotten 2 interviews with a bunch of applications (to which is seems over 100 applicants have also applied to for each). I’m a junior if that context is helpful.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks!",2024-03-08 06:48:19
1b6ypjw,Worth doing an IT related Masters right after Degree?,"I'm an international student looking to study in Monash, I was looking to apply for a master's in Al or machine learning ideally (backup considerations are SWE or Cybersecurity) for 2025. But my friend had mentioned there was no point in doing that since I would be graduating this year from my Bachelor's degree (Computer Science), and that it would be harder to get a job due to having the master's. I wanted to ask what your thoughts were, whether it would be worthwhile or not. My goal is to become an Australian citizen so I'm hoping to work after I finish post graduate studies. If you would recommend something other than a master's please do let me know. I plan on spending this year learning and building my portfolio. I apologise if this isn't the place for this, if not do let me know where else maybe better suited. Thank you for your time, hope you all have a good day. :)

1aulbi0,Strange Advice from University Resume Help,"Hi all,  


Today I thought why not drop through my university's resume review drop in session and get some feedback from them on what I should improve and I got some really strange advice, counter to what I have received from both recruiters I have reached out to and this sub. I am after anyones opinion who can help me by clarifying what is best, and whether I should be worried about sticking to one page. If your are somewhat experienced thats great, a recruiter even better! 

For reference, I am in my final year of a comp sci degree, with a software engineering major at a Western Australian university, and have started some grad applications already, with more coming up.

Following are the changes they said I should make:  


* Include a one paragraph bio / introduction: I removed this previously to fit the resume onto one page
* Split work experience into ""relevant experience"" and ""employment history"": just doesn't seem very useful to me- add soft skills into skills section: had these but removed because everyone in existence is going to put ""teamwork"" and ""communication""
* under each skill, add a sentence or two to explain how you developed it: seems like this would take up soooo much room
* add references onto the resume: I had these, but had been told to remove them to get it under one page, as if I reached the stage where they are required I will be asked for them
* remove GPA and WAM: I understand not including it all the time, but as a soon to be grad, and someone who has worked hard to maintain these, I kinda want them on there

Here is my resume as currently constructed, thanks in advance everyone!

Since summer internships in Australia start in late November, does this make me automatically ineligible for pretty much everything? 

Unfortunately it’s too late to pull out of the exchange (which I wouldn’t do anyway without guarantee of an internship). 

Are there any companies that offer shorter internships? 

I’m thinking I might just have to wait to do one winter 2025, or more drastically extend my degree by a semester so I can slot an internship in before I graduate. 

As I understand it I can’t work to the extent of an internship in the US as I’m an Australian citizen, so that kinda sucks as well.

I want the Masters for my own personal reasons, as I feel my degree and uni isn’t anything special and it would be nice to be someone who has a Masters.

193yiec,Software engineering and data science,"
I am about to go on to my 3rd year of a 5 year combined degree of software engineering and data science (engineering honors and science double degree) in Australia. The Software Engineering degree on its own is 4 years and with the data science on top the course becomes 5 years long. Ive recently been thinking about whether the extra 1 year of studying is worth the extra data science knowledge/degree. Does anyone think it would be more beneficial to drop the data science to finish a year earlier and get some good experience working or just carrying on that extra 1 year for the data science skills. I would say i equally enjoy both but i seem to be gravitating towards the SWE side, however the recent CS job market activity and the opportunity has made me still consider keeping my job opportunities more open with the data science on top. I honestly wouldn't mind the extra year however just the thought that i could be getting valuable experience and money for that year (and also the fact that both degrees are similar and have a few overlapping units/classes) makes me slightly hesitant. I am also currently on the hunt for internships/work before i complete my course. So im just asking for some advice or insights as to what you guys would do or if it would be worth it.

I hope you're doing well. I'm a mechanical engineering graduate with a keen interest in transitioning to software engineering. However, recent conversations with software engineers have left me questioning this decision.

Some have advised against the switch, expressing concerns about the demanding nature of the field. They emphasized potential challenges like constant after-hours coding, the mental exhaustion of feeling inadequate, and the pressure to quickly adapt to new software. Additionally, they warned that for extroverts, the solitary nature of the job might pose difficulties.

Despite being an extroverted female, I'm open to working independently. Still, their insights have given me pause because I love to enjoy life so I really can’t just work all day and code all day.

17n6ym7,How to get into the industry as a working holiday visa holder?,"
Current working as a IT support at a college in Sydney after nearly two months job finding as a working holiday visa holder. As first it’s just miscellaneous stuff like printer/computer/projector troubleshoot, OS installation etc. I guess the workload is not enough they starting to assign students attendance task like downloading attendance spreadsheets from a website called RTO manager, attached it to teachers through Emails and collect back from them later on and open it one by one to input the attendance data back into the system every week. I had to use Python to wrote a Headless crawler to download the file, parse the content and send Emails out, and another program to query Outlook API to receive the Emails/send out reminder Emails, parse the excel, and a Headless crawler to input the data back into the system. It was several hours of manual work before, now it’s just 10 minutes.

Before I got here they’re manually creating student’s account for a online learning platform and campus computer login. Cannot stand the endless account creation request from emails/messages I took two weeks to wrote a web extension to inject a little popup into the RTOmanager website to provide account creation functionality. the web extension’s backend is wrote in Golang, to creat Active Directory user for campus computer login I had to use C# to build/expose a Restful api inside the intranet so the backend writen in Golang can talked to the AD 😢. I had it containerized; setup GitHub Action, auto docker image release upon push. Had a Kubernetes setup with 3 worker nodes running inside the campus intranet, the backend is running on those nodes and exposed it through cloudflare worker.

Did all this for $28/h pay, and the most depressing part is no one is capable of understanding what I’m doing, and I had no one to discuss with, they even thought my job is quite easy.

Now, since my visa is about to expire (had about 3 months left) I applied several masters program, got an offer from UTS, tuition fee is like 100,000 something 😭. Should I accept it? Or it’s waste of time? If I commit to this program am I be able to land some industry internship during my study? and dev jobs after graduation (should have 3 years working rights)? I don’t wanna go back to do IT support again, it’s a nightmare.

Sry for the rant, what should I do next? And if I quit my job how am I supposed to deal with all the projects I build here? How to do hand over? The tech stack is consist of JavaScript/Golang/C# and little bit of gRPC, it’s gonna be hard to find some dude to manage all the project I build right?",2023-11-03 22:31:08

(1) Go to Uni and get a CS degree.

- I did not go to school here, therefore it looks like I’ll have to complete a Cert IV of some kind to be eligible to apply.
- I have dependents and would therefore have to keep working whilst studying. Not sure if this is even doable. Add the extra time to complete the Cert IV first and it becomes quite daunting.
- HECS debt

(2) Self study and get a “real job”. Get some team experience under my belt and start my career this way.

16bwc1s,Do I leave cruisy secure 170k~ operations role to re-enter engineering career path?," 

Looking for advice from engineers on what my future may look like if I proceed down the engineering career path. Australia based.

In 2019 I graduated with a double honours in Electrical Engineering. I completed an internship and got offered a grad role with an EPCM company. I loved my time working in the city/office, before I accepted a grad project engineer with the company north of the city. Long story short, this slowly turn into being used as cheap labour and I was getting burnt out after working 6, 10.5 hours, days a week with 2.5 hrs travel each day. I repeatedly let the company know I wasnt in a good spot and repeatedly got told ""just 2 more weeks"". 3 months, turned into 9 months. This left me very resentful and I decided to leave.

I was looking for work back in my home town, 2 hours away from CBD, partner also lived here. I got offered 2 roles, an engineering grad role for 75k\~ on a small site, and a shift operator technician role for 170k\~ at a power station. At the time I had also started day trading and thought long term that would be my career path (lol).... So I neglected my engineering career path at the time and took the money.

So for the past 3 years, I've worked in this shift ops role. 2nights/shift change/2 days/4 off. 12.5hr shifts, 1 hr travel either way. Carpool, and drive once a round. Pays 170k\~ (200k package), but otherwise very little progression to offer. The job is cruisy, but certainly not fulfilling. Also more than likely have 10 years life here.

Lately, ive gotten over the shift work and have began exploring my options and constantly think, what if? Im going to start applying for engineering roles that appear to pay a similar amount. The current role im looking at is on a construction site right near my house, pays 200k\~ package and will last 2 years (probably 2.5 years). After this 2 years, I will need to find another eng role, and without working FIFO (fly in fly out), I possibly take a large paycut to stay local and in work, depending on future opportunities and development.

My concerns are:

If I dont apply for this eng role, which really suits my previous experience (have also done loads of site work previously before engineering), then the eng career path will be harder to re-enter the longer I leave it.

and generally, just the unknown of where I may end up after the 2 years on this construction site finishes.

TLDR:

Do i leave a cruisy secure, 180k/yr role in operations with little fulfilment and progression for equivalent paying engineering role with only 2 years guarantee to re-enter engineering career path potentially opening up further career advancement?

SFU, as far as I’ve heard and read, has decent co-op and Canada in general has a level playing field between internationals and local, unlike Oz, where it is harder for internationals to land roles. UniMelb/UNSW has monumentally more prestige and costs the same, plus I might get more scholarships too but Australian employers tend to not hire international kids, for the simple reason to not bother with visa candidates. In my scenario, which would be a better route for me. I’m curious to hear your opinions. Thanks!",2023-08-23 11:11:13
15woujb,Career pathway to get a role as a data scientist,"So I graduated last year with a Masters of I.T. from Unimelb which provided a great introduction to many innovative computer science fields. I'm now looking for work and have found it slower and more challenging than I'd expected. 

I've primarily narrowed my search to data science roles, as this field seems the most interesting compared to other comp-sci roles, however, I am starting to consider that I should also consider back-end dev roles and anything with ML/AI, as I love this stuff and now need to find a job sooner rather than later and get my foot in the door.

My main confusion with finding a data scientist role is that every job listing has always been in a mid-senior level requiring several years of experience, and I have not come across a single listing as ""junior"" data scientist (if that even exists). I understand some of the reasons why: I know that DS roles are more of a luxury for larger companies and it is unusual to have a team of data scientists unless the company is quite large. But my question is, what is the usual career pathway to find your way into data science?

15wfgu7,comp sci to data analysis,"hi, looking for people who have transitioned from comp sci and found a job as a data analyst. i’m unhappy with comp sci but i’m already halfway through the degree so i’m thinking about sticking through it and hopefully land a data analyst position post-grad. 

just some questions to those who have done the same:
1) how have you found it? (eg. was the change hard? how is your day-to-day job?) 
2) why did you transition?",2023-08-20 16:13:06
15cev8d,Multiple Short Experiences vs. Longer Employment but fewer experiences,"Hi,

I'm currently in a situation where I have a choice between **accumulating multiple short-term software engineering internship experiences** or **investing in a single long-term role as junior engineer while still studying**. I would appreciate insights on how these choices might be perceived by future employers, especially given my goal to eventually find opportunities in Sydney.

**Background: (Currently a second-year bachelor student studying CS)**

1. I was fortunate enough to receive an offer for a Junior Engineer position at my university, which is not an internship, but an actual job (part-time) focused on gathering IoT data in my university. It's full stack, where I will be developing both front-end, back-end and getting in touch with data lake. This role offers a hybrid working model, and the contract is flexible. As for now it is signed for a year, but can be subject to change.
2. I've previously worked at a start-up (80-90 employees) for 3 months in a software engineering role, worked 70% on front-end, 30% on back-end.
3. I might have an opportunity to potentially secure an internship at a well-known company (like Xero or Telstra) for another 3 months.

**Considerations & Questions:**

1. **Duration of Experience:** Does a longer working experience (like a year) at a single employer reflect better on a resume, possibly showing loyalty and depth of experience? Or would multiple 3-month experiences across various companies showcase adaptability?
2. **How much to gain from an experience:** Will I gain more from a long-term experience, or multiple short-term experiences? Skill wise, and networking wise?
3. **Job Titles:** How do future employers see the title difference between 'Junior Engineer' vs. 'Intern'? Is one more valuable than the other?
4. **Move to Sydney:** My goal is to live in Sydney for 3 months by the end of the year, because I want to experience what it is like to live in Sydney, and also potentially build connections in Sydney to prepare for next year's grad role applications. While the Junior Engineer role is hybrid and allows me to move, I'm not sure if I should still continue to seek for an internship in Sydney, or just stick with this junior engineer position at my uni?

**Decisions:** 

1. Should I still continue to find an internship for the end of the year? 
2. Should I stick with this Junior Engineer position for a long term? 

I would love to hear any insights on this, thanks in advance!",2023-07-29 01:08:36

So, I'm looking at education options to prepare me for the field. I don't think I can commit to the years that would be required for a university course, so I'm thinking TAFE? Would that be the best way forward? If so, then which certs? From what I can see, the likely candidates are certificate IV in Programming, Web Developement, and/or Networking, followed by a diploma. From the information I've read it seems like I should at the very least start with the Cert IV in programming. Does that sound right?  Any advice would be appreciated.

13iz4z4,Resume comparisons and Portfolio review,"Hello everyone,

I am a New Zealand bootcamp graduate who is moving to Melbourne this week (with my partner who has already secured a job). I am looking for some feedback on my portfolio and choosing between two resume options (plus suggested changes). For a bit of context, I have been self learning for over a year (while working) and and chose to attend a bootcamp last August to fully commit to the career change.

PORTFOLIO:

My [online portfolio](https://portfolio-vyonyx.vercel.app/) is primarily for web development, but also has some design work. I initially included the design stuff to land an agency role here in NZ; Do you think the design stuff hurts my applications to non agency job applications in Aus?

&#x200B;

RESUME:

1. The [first resume](https://shaneelkumar-personal-files.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/CV+-+Shaneel+(AU)+-+Anonymous.pdf) is what I've used to apply to around 100 web developer/software engineer roles in Aus (without much luck). I've had this resume reviewed by an ex-tech recruiter in NZ and the Summer of Tech team when signing up for their internship scheme. Will this style work in Aus? Should it be formatted differently, or scrapped for option 2?
2. The [second resume](https://shaneelkumar-personal-files.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Shaneel+Kumar+-+Software+Engineer+Resume+-+Anonymous.pdf) is new and is based on a template/format that makes it easier for ATS parsing. I think this option is also more friendly to recruiters but would love some feedback/a sanity check on my assumption. The format encourages the use of bullet points and action verbs to describe the impact of my contributions.

12fnb3u,Which subject is essential in a CS degree? I also need career advice.,"Reposting an old question of mine, just discovered this sub today!

A bit of a back story, I'm doing a Bachelor of Business (Finance major).

My previous years and former self were a fog that I wanted to get out of. I didn't think much about it when I chose to study business. I also hate it, really hate it. That, combined with untreated ADHD, made me a terrible student... Everything's getting better this year, though. Fortunately, I got diagnosed and, started meds, read Atomic Habits 3 times. 

&#x200B;

Thanks to that, I'm finally doing better at uni. But unluckily for me, the only subject that could make me sit and enjoy and eager to learn is Programming. It's a basic Programming 1 subject that teaches Java and Python programming fundamentals stuff (from variables to classes, objects, and inheritance). 

&#x200B;

Man, I love it... Finance still gives me yawning episodes, but it's a bit better than before. I've also started TOP Foundation (front-end stuff) and love it. YES. Finally, something I like to do and find really interesting. So long story short, I changed my study planner from doing Acct + Finance to Finance + Electives. I get to study 7 Electives! My Finance major is only eight subjects, so I basically have the chance to do a major-minor in CS! Although without the official name, I tried asking the university to put CS as minor on my resume but understandably, it was a blunt NO :(   


&#x200B;

So I'm trying to pick the diamonds, the absolute chads in a CS degree to study. Here's my list after researching online: 

Programming 1 

Programming 2 

Database Fundamentals 

Discrete Maths 

Data Structure and Algorithms 

Advanced Algorithms 

Last one - undecided. 

&#x200B;

I can choose to study anything (CS theory to Web Dev to Data Systems...) Do people prefer OS to CS theory here? I kind of don't know what to do. This is where I need your guys advice. As of this moment, I'm going through Sedgewick's Algorithms book. Planning to self-teach  Computer Architecture and OS next! Oh, I'm studying at UTS just in case anyone asks.

ukwnvv,Advice on how to shift into more technical software role without sacrificing salary?,"Looking for some advice for where to start in terms of shifting my career trajectory without sacrificing my pay or starting from a completely juniour role.

For some context, I graduated at the end of 2019 with a double degree of engineering (mechatronic) and computer science and got a job as a graduate mechatronic engineer with the APS. During the job I did lots of different types of work such as managing clients, designing/creating electrical circuits, writing software scripts for experiments, writing embedded C code, doing 3D design and working on trucks. I managed to make a shift after 18 months into something more software focused as a systems analyst with defence science & technology. In the role I get to write simulation models in Java/Python, perform analysis and also act as product owner for a contracted developer team to deliver a web application to clients. The pay isn't great and so far over the past 2.5 years I have really felt like a jack of all trades with a heavy emphasis on 'master of none'. Being able to do a bit of everything and wear whatever hat that is required, but could never really classify what my role 'is'. After doing 6 years at uni and 2 years in the workforce, it feels pretty defeating to be making less than some of my computer science friends first graduate position straight out of uni.

tai342,Software Development Analyst at FNZ Wellington,"Hi everyone. Got contacted by a recruiter for a role there. Just curious about people's experience working there.

1. Are the Glassdoor reviews accurate? Pretty much a lot of them say WLB sucks, long hours and the code base is an enormous mess.

2. Why is it called Developer Analyst? Is there a lot of non-development work? 

3. How's management like there in general? Micromanagers? Horrible team culture?

4. Mentorship opportunities. Are people open to knowledge sharing?

5. How's compensation compared to the NZ market for Software Developers?

Pretty much just wanted to know if I should avoid them like a plague. 😬 Thanks all.",2022-03-09 21:27:57

s1lnjj,Becoming a contractor - advisable?,"Hi there. I'm a senior software engineer (7 YOE) and based in NZ.

I've got a fairly strong devops background but the market here in NZ is quite stale and I'm looking for a way to do more of what I love.

Basically what I want to know is: is switching from full time employment to contracting advisable at my career stage? Is it considered a step down? Is it difficult to come back to full time employment after contracting for a few years?

A few things making me consider this:

No opportunities for advancement at my current place of employment. 

Tired of BAU and maintenance

Tired of using my time off for learning new skills and having no time left to actually rest. With contracting I was hoping to earn enough to take longer breaks to allow me to do 4 wks self improvement and 4 wks actual rest per year. Is this realistic?

Tired of office politics. Every company I've worked for has had a crowd of seniors vying for a couple of scraps for advancement and it gets pretty toxic.

My thinking was to set up a company in NZ and go for contracts in the Australian market. Hoping I could go for longer 12 month ones. 

Then aportion some time for admin, further learning and travel between contracts.

Any thoughts or advice that occur would be much appreciated.",2022-01-11 19:44:50
riccoj,Moving to FAANG from NZ?!,"Hey team,

Long story short, I've decided now is the time to do my OE and that I want to do it at a FAANG company or similar big tech if possible. Now I know that some will cringe at the thought of wanting to join big tech and I'm not here to debate that! However, it \_is\_ a personal decision I've made for various reasons.

I've always wanted to move to California or NY after visiting there a few years ago. However, I hear that due to the whole H1-B thing, that it is borderline impossible to even be considered for an interview.

I guess I'm putting out a call for any software engineers that have done this before and could possibly share some pointers or guides on how to achieve this.

Other than the states, I'm possibly looking at Europe (London especially) or AUS. Would also love to hear stories of people that have done a similar move from NZ.

17z8wmf,Doing a BS in CS/SWE after a BS in EE.,"Hello Everyone.

I'm based in Australia and graduated with a BS of EE in 2020. I have been working at a very small company for the past few years, but I feel like I haven't been taking my career seriously. I realised that I didn't really enjoy EE when I was studying it at uni, but I pushed on because I was already a year or two into it. You could say that I was just studying to get the grades. The job that I have now is very niche and I don't feel confident that I'll be able to transfer my skills to anything else in the industry without starting at an entry-level/junior role.

I have been doing a lot of reflection on myself and my future goals, and have realised that a CS/SWE career might be for me. I did an introductory course in C++ and MATLAB back in uni, as well as a bit of basic Arduino and Raspberry Pi coding at my current job. I have found these small experiences with programming very enjoyable and I could see myself pursuing it further. I have started my journey to do the self-taught method. But I am feeling overwhelmed and think that I would prefer to follow a more structured and rudimentary degree.

I know a lot of people will probably argue that going down the self-taught or bootcamp method would be better, but I'm curious as to whether anyone else has gone down the CS degree option (especially if you already have a degree in engineering).

The reason I'm considering the CS degree route is because for me personally it feels like a clean slate. There is something exciting about starting from the bottom again. I feel that I'll be much better equipped going back to uni now than I was back then, as I've matured with age and I'm more focused. I also believe that I could make some friends, and network while I'm at uni. This is all at the cost of 3 years and an additional ~$30k AUD of student debt, but it seems like a small price to pay relative to the lifelong (35+ years) career ahead of me.

What are your thoughts?",2023-11-19 22:28:43

Despite being self taught for 2.5 years now, I still could not find a job as a junior SE. My plan now is to get a formal education degree (hence the grad cert) to tick off the box of ""completing a relevant CS degree"" in those formal good graduation program from the likes of Canva, Wisetech global, Atlassian, etc, and also hopefully to fill the gap of knowledge that I did not get from self taught. The 2 grad certs above are the only ones I can find that let students study 100% online, and have CSP (Commonwealth Supported Place) which reduce the fees greatly (up to 75% off). UOW is really close to me as I live in Wollongong, but I guess the location does not matter much if the courses are 100% online. I really want to get into tech as a software engineer though, so not sure if the cyber security cert is too specific. On the other hand, is the grad cert in IT from Macquarie uni equivalent to a CS degree? Or is it more like networking, help desk, etc. I read the course handbook from Macquarie for the course and find that they do teach computer science concept, but the description is still very vague and I worry the name of the degree might got me looked down by those recruiters/employers (as it is not ""computer science"" but ""IT"").

Have anyone had any experience with any of these 2 courses? Or if anyone have any advice that they can give me regards to the career prospect and what I can expect to help me decide on which course to take? Your advice / tip is much appreciated.

Macquarie Grad cert in IT:

[https://coursefinder.uow.edu.au/information/index.html?course=graduate-certificate-cyber-security](https://coursefinder.uow.edu.au/information/index.html?course=graduate-certificate-cyber-security)

Full disclosure: I know that a degree is not everything to get a job, and I prepare to self-study much more on the side for it. It is just my need to get a formal degree to show future employers I'm serious about this career change and to feel like I would be treated as one of ""traditional CS graduates"".

Many thanks

EDIT 1: so I have the chance to talk to the subject coordinator (program builder) of the grad cert in cyber security in UOW. He is actually someone I know quite well. He said he built this course himself, and it has been running since 2020. The number of students take the course increased from 20-30 to a few hundred students now. The course is 60-70% computer science, and 30% cyber security related at the end of each subject. He said a lot of students completed this course also got job as junior software engineer. Also, the course will give credit for students if they want to take study further with master in computer science, either in UOW or any other Australian university. With this update, would it be worth it to consider studying this course in UOW?

EDIT 2: so I have had a closer look at both of these courses last night. It turns out that the one at Macquarie uni is not really ""100% online delivery"", as a lot of the electives have only in-person delivery. So that's that, it is not possible to study the grad cert at Macquarie online fully. I will go with the grad cert in cyber security from UOW. It is not ideal but it is something that can provide that ""formal education"" in a CS related field. Thanks everyone for the advice and input.",2023-11-05 22:42:01

Currently I work at a bank, NAB and am doing an internship. I do hybrid work, I have a lot of friends so I get to socialise a lot when I go into office. I don’t get much work though, I feel like I don’t do much. it’s a very slow paced environment and I usually get 1-2 tasks to worry about for the whole sprint. I love the people and the culture, just the job/work itself is a bit questionable.

I’ve also received a graduate program offer at Telstra. I know that at Telstra, it’s very flexible, optional to go into the office, can do all work remotely. My interviewer told me she’s been working there for 3 years and has only been to the office 3 times in her life.  I have heard the work life balance is good, bc you don’t get much work. 

Both companies’ salary is about the same and it’s not really my biggest concern. The role is also similar. I value culture, career prospects, job stability and interesting work projects.

164d0kd,Should I switch to Compsci from IT+Business degree?,"Hi, I was contemplating whether I should drop IT+Business and transfer over to Computer Science (Honours). They're both the same length (4 years) but it'll take a little bit longer since I'm already into the second semester of my first year. All the IT subjects I have done (4 subjects) will carry over to compsci, but not the business ones (also 4 subjects). So effectively I will only be one semester behind, I can take summer classes to catch up.

I don't think a Business (majoring in Finance) degree would help that much to become a software developer or a programmer which is what I want to do. At this rate I'm doing basically 2 years of IT and 2 years of Business, whereas I could be doing 4 years of computer science instead even if there is alot of overlap with IT. Note that it is IT (majoring in Software development). As for the sunk costs of the business subjects I already paid for, I don't want that to be considered a factor as I want it to be completely unbiased. I am also considering the fact that computer science is much more reputable and has a higher average salary. My parents are wanting me to stay in the double degree because they believe there to be more job opportunities. What do you all think?

13h7te0,[JS Dev] Should I try out Python for a backend in a work project?,"80% of my time will be dedicated to developing a frontend. However I will need a semi-rudimentary backend for my app and thought it might be a good chance to learn Python. Here is my use case

* Intra-company app that allows engineers to browse data produced by assembly line machines (right now they spit out mangled csv files that can only be accessed on a crappy laptop on-site). Will be browsed via desktop and maybe the occasional tablet on-site.
* Since the backend will mostly parse csv files, store them in a database, and automatically look for issues (right now engineers just inspect the spreadsheets manually) I thought about Python since it has probably the best resources and tooling for data manipulation and extraction.
* Extremely low in scale (10 concurrent users at best case scenario).
* Daily reports are 25KB .csv files so I won't have to deal with monstrous amounts of data.
* I'm the solo developer/designer/entreprenur of the entire operation. It's the first attempt of the company in developing something from scratch (my suggestion after seeing how much time engineers spend on that laptop). Our IT is made up of SAP and low-code hotglue. Naturally, this means I am given much freedom in determining everything in development.

What do you think? I'd normally write a backend in Node.js but it could be a nice opportunity to get familiar with Pandas, bash scripting, and data science. I've written backends in other languages before (Java/Spring) so a Flask/Django backend can't be THAT of a curve ball (but still tell me what you think).",2023-05-14 09:36:49

10wwzm4,A degree in computer science or engineering,"I would really appreciate any advice or personal experience from
you guys (especially Australians and Canadians).

I (CS IB student) am currently having difficulties choosing
whether to apply for bachelor's degrees in some sort of computer
engineering (software, computer science, data science) or
whether I should apply t degrees in computer science, especially
ones that focus on a major in cyber security.

My parents (especially my mother), want me to apply only to
engineering degrees, but I don't see the point in studying a 4-5
year course if it doesn't lead me directly to my desired field of
study and work (digital forensics or something in cyber security).
After my bachelors I do plan on studying a master's degree in
cyber security and as far as I know, I can apply for them with
any sort of related computer science background degrees
(engineering, Beng).

My only worry with studying a computer science degree,
majoring in cyber security is that by studying a more specialed
course, it will be hard to change fields in the future if I do decide
to.

So in summary, I'm looking for advice as to whether I should
pursue purely cyber security or whether I should be that ""golden
child"" and apply to engineering courses instead to keep my future
prospects broad.

P.s. Does anyone about employability with those holding more
specialised bachelor degrees or those with engineering degrees?
I've heard that companies favour those with a bachelor in
engineering, however, I'm not sure as to how true that is.

For context, i'm studying a double degree in Software Eng(Hons) + CompSci at Monash University. I've just finished my 4th year, and i've got 3 semesters left since I took 3 units this sem (and am planning on continuing to do so for the remaining semesters if i stay).


I've just been offered to be kept on at a relatively small company after an internship as a fullstack SE. They are planning on training me on becoming a full on QA Engineer. This company is full of young but extremely capable engineers, and coming from zero experience just 4 months ago, I feel like the learning pace here is astounding, even more so than what my peers at uni get at their placements. The company's contract requires minimum 4 days a week, which is what I've been doing but it has been difficult to juggle with uni and life.

My end goal is to have a stable, (high paying hopefully) career, but this juggling of full time uni and work has been really, really tough on my mental health and relationships.

xadlfo,What does technical tests/take homes look like for NZ companies ?,"Hey there ! Little background about myself , I’m a bootcamp graduate . Mainly learnt your basic web dev stuff with JavaScript /typescript  (  Node on the backend and react on the front end etc ). I’ve got a few interviews for internship roles(mainly with the same stack that I learnt ) however I’m abit nervous that I’ll run into some ds and algorithm questions ( been kinda neglecting them and working more on projects). I’ve heard that in NZ these are not as common in interviews besides like xero?

Just wanted to reach out and ask the Nz peeps what their technicals looked like so I can somewhat better prepare . ( guess it’s different for every company but I’m completely in the dark here ). The roles I’ve got an interview are for  small-med sized companies if that helps, specifically through summer of tech .

Hopefully I'm posting this in the right place. 

I'm about to receive a job offer which is conditional on background checks. I'm told the background checks will take 2-3 weeks. My notice period is 4 weeks. Their (new employer's) HR is pushing for my start date to be just about bang on 4 weeks. They're also pushing me to resign quickly after signing the paper work - I guess so that they can get be on board asap? Should I resign from my current job? 

I've never had to do a background check like this before, but I take that it's standard practice in certain sectors. 

I should have nothing to worry about. I've been truthful on my resume regarding current and previous employment and education. The only thing I'm concerned about is a **spent** conviction from 13 years ago. Out of interest, I ran a police check on myself recently and it came back with ""zero disclosable court outcomes"".

ugtt8g,Part-time Jobs for International Masters(non-reasearch) Students.,"Hi All,

I've got close to 3 years of experience in both BE(Java) and FE(React JS/native) work, Currently working in a FE position. I've never really wanted to enroll in a master's program but must do so to GTFO of my home country. (landing a direct job in AUS is not an option)

My question is about doing a part-time dev job while being enrolled in a master's program, I've gone through some job postings on Indeed, Seek, and LinkedIn and did actually find a considerable amount of openings(mainly on LinkedIn), But some of them are very ambiguous. Openings sometimes say Part-time/Full-time meaning it could be either one or both? and Most don't post a salary. 

So I have decided to seek help here from you folks, How common is it for International students enrolled in master's programs(non-research) to be employed part-time at dev jobs?  If so how much does the avg part-time dev job pay? What other related jobs should I look out for eg: IT support, Instructor, etc.

I'll be needing close to 60K AUSD per year, unis are very expensive (at least for me) but a little bit of number crunching shows that  \~8hrs on min wage per 7 days a week should be enough to get me through (living cost included) but this is reliant on the ""no work hour cap for students"" policy introduced because of Covid. 

Now realistically I won't be able to work 7 days a week for 2 years straight. Policies can change, I will have assignments and I will also get sick etc etc. So I need to come up with a solid plan to make the most out of the time available. 

Really appreciate any info you might have. TIA!",2022-05-02 16:41:14

u39o16,Are Masters programmes worth it for experienced devs?,"A few questions here, I know. TL;DR the title basically. 

Some background: For the last few years I’ve been trying to decide if I want to study at the postgraduate level (it hasn’t really been possible for me to actually do it though until recently). I graduated with a CS Bachelors degree back in mid-2016 and have about 7.5+ years total professional experience. I currently hold a senior-level role with some lead dev responsibilities such as system design and architecture on some new projects.

My motivations for studying at the post grad level is that I feel I am missing a couple of gaps in my knowledge, general interest, and my constant need for advancement in my skillset. 

Has anyone got any advice around going back to study (would have to be part-time) as someone with industry experience?

One problem I’ve found so far in my search for a programme is that there are too many that aren’t sufficiently advanced for someone with experience. I’m looking at the Master of Software Engineering degree programme at UniMelb as this appears to suit my requirements. Anyone got feedback on that?

siie5e,Where do usyd CS students at different ability levels generally end up as?,"I feel like by truthfully and honestly comparing yourself to other students: you are able to gain a general perception on what approximate percentile of a cs student you are by examining general coding ability, work experience and projects.

I'm generally interested if anyone has a general idea of what % of students get into the top tier companies, then F500, then average tech companies and finally low-tier no growth prospect companies. Please link sources if you have any but my impression is that there aren't really any formal investigations.

I dunno if I should share my estimate on my percentile but I truthfully believe that I'm around the top 25%. I believe this will make it hard for me to get into an impressive company but enough maybe enough to land a F500 job.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

according to the QILT study: CS and IT is the second most popular degree behind business and management type degrees. Overall career prospects are average (68% full time employment some time after graduation). It's hard to say how the top end students at go8 universities will perform or what the boundary is to get into a good company but there are maybe around 200 super ""top tier"" grad jobs and around 28,000 CS and IT students per year.

It seems like a common goal amongst young graduates in tech or even those more generally in tech, is to work at a big tech companies like Facebook, Google etc. Im wondering if those who have this desire as well as those who currently are employed at such companies, consider/reflect on the moralilty of their ambitions/decisions and truly view these companies as ethical to work for. I guess I'm curious as to how many of those working for such companies are aware of the unethical practices yet still work for them. I'm aware that many people arent in such privleged positions and life is full of tradeoffs so there would be understandable cases of course.

*Oil and gas job*

*  Pay is better by about $10k and pays 14% super. 180k in five years is very much par for the course here as well
*  Work-life balance is very good, I interned there and never saw anyone leave after 5 (I usually stuck around till 5.30)
* I am concerned about how technical the work will be, I kinda think that if you don't progress technically post-uni it will be difficult to get a mid-career dev role. Especially given I don't think oil and gas is for me long-term.
* Like most big companies it uses Azure and Windows for its dev platforms, which I personally find a bit grating to work with 
* I am more likely to get varied (but not necessarily interesting) projects and experience with project management there
* Working from an office, which is a double-edged sword because I am quite extroverted but don't like commuting
* I didn't get any mentoring during my time there as an intern, and didn't technically improve much during my time there as an intern
* Extremely large PD budget

*Start up*

* Much more autonomy 
* I've spoken with some insiders in the industry they're looking to disrupt and the product is pretty solid
* I enjoy the work, though there is a lot more of it. I've worked weekends before, and regularly start at 7.30 and finish at 6 or 7.
* I get constructive reviews on my PRs and have genuinely improved since I started working there
* Fully working from home company 
* Freedom to develop using whatever platform you want, all the cloud stuff is AWS

d47l2b,IT Support / helpdesk -> Software developer / engineer,"Hi all,

I live in Sydney, Australia and I'm currently in my penultimate year of uni, majoring in IT. I have some experience in IT support / helpdesk.

I find IT topics such as networking, cyber security, cloud computing, databases and systems administration alright, but I seem to have more passion for programming and software development after recently completed my data structures and algorithms class (along side 3 other programming subjects which cover Java, C#, object-oriented programming concepts, JavaFX for GUI apps using MVC and .NET framework). I seem to really enjoy the problem solving part of programming and able to apply my creativity to build apps from scratch is rather fulfilling.

My current resume is very much geared towards IT support / helpdesk roles. How can I optimise it for graduate software developer / internship roles instead? I haven't done any side projects outside of my uni coursework, and I don't have a portfolio / github profile. Are those a necessity for getting into software dev? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Also, how much would I be disadvantaged if my major is in IT instead of CS when applying for developer roles? I'm reluctant to switch my degree from IT to CS within UTS as their CS degree includes an honours project which I fear it would be too difficult to get through (I am absolutely not the type of person that enjoys writing long essays, let alone long research papers).

I'm a year 12 student who's considering studying a [Bachelor of Design (Interaction Design)](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/uc/bachelor-of-design-interaction-design.html) degree at USYD. The degree itself looks alright but some of the units in the first year seem a bit wishy-washy and impractical. Other than that I don't have any problems with it. Considering this because I'm not too big on pure theoretical Computer Science and the highly Mathematical component of it, but don't mind coding and enjoy thinking creatively - also enjoy the humanities (history, english) quite a lot and this seems like a better fit for someone who leans slightly more in that direction in terms of aptitude and interest.

'Front-end developer' is one of the listed careers on the website I linked, apparently because you do a decent amount of coding in it. You can also add on selective/elective units to do more programming units (you would share these with SoftEng and CS students). Or you can add on an actual major in CS or Software Development, but that adds on another year  to the degree, something I'm considering but I'm not 100% sure about.

Wanted to avoid any biases on r/usyd \- if you were a recruiter or hiring manager, would you look down upon this degree for a front-end developer role compared to a CS or Software Engineering degree? Same question for if you were to add a major in Software Development onto the degree itself.

She asked us what our interest was in applying before even introducing ourselves. Being a fresh new graduate, and being new to the corporate interviewing scene, my subconscious decided to introduce myself first and provided her with who I am, my major and my work experiences. Within 8 seconds of talking, she abruptly barges in in a forceful and loud tone 

""I'M GOING TO STOP YOU THERE, REFER BACK TO THE QUESTION I ASKED, WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THIS ROLE""

I was quite shocked to be honest, as I came in with a joyful tone, but I tried to not let it get to me and stayed professional throughout the interview. I'll admit my answer was not straight on point but I believe she could have notified me in a professional or at least neutral tone rather than a forceful and loud tone. I believe interviews are a two-way street, and both parties should be treated with respect, I guess that's a red flag. 

Before asking me the question she initially mispronounced my name, I corrected her in a friendly tone, but she said nothing back, and neither did she apologize or try to pronounce my name again. Let me know what you guys think if I should continue with the application. 

After that experience, I’m looking to explore my pathways outside of help desk roles. I’ve got an information systems major, can anyone recommend entry-level jobs/careers that require minimal talking?

1adnsev,No idea where to even begin with my future (Hardcore burnt out on helpdesk),"As the title states, i have no idea where to even begin with my future in IT. To give you all some of my background in IT. Completed a diploma in network administration at tafe in 2012. Started at level 1 in 2013 and worked through various companies doing their L1 Support, both internal and MSP. Rose to Level 2 in 2018 and worked until 2020. In 2020 i left Traditional IT to move laterally into Level 2 Software Support as i was sick of the IT Industry and i was also given a massive 21K Payrise in the move as well. At this point in 2020 i was completely DONE with IT. I hated it and never wanted to go back to it again. The job it self was fine but just the toxic management in every single job i worked at made me hate it.

I've been in my current job for just over 3 years now. It's a complete snoozefest. Low amounts of work and i'm bored doing my job. It's for a virtual events/webcasting company based in the US. We run our own systems internally and our clients connect in and host their quarterly reviews over an audio conference or video call. Similar to the likes of Zoom, MS Teams etc but way more corporate and focussed on the one feature. Plus with support of thousands of people to attend.

So that brings me to now. I'm in a job that has ZERO career development. There is literally nothing for me to get promoted into. Barely any work. Still have to go into the office twice a week but it is what it is. We get short bursts of work every quarter and my job is very secure as they just did a massive restructure and moved me into a slightly different sector but with the same role and same pay.

I've thought about going back into IT. I had an interview with an MSP last year and was able to bargain 90K but they shit the bed on that at the last minute and i bailed on it due to way too much risk. I'm currently on 88.4K and it was too much risk for a tiny payrise. But it did tell me despite being 3 years out of the game, i'm still able to bargain a decent pay for Level 2 IT.

But my problem is i REALLY don't want to go back into helpdesk. I hate it so much. It's a soul sucking job that pays the absolute minimum. I can't stand it. I'd much rather go into security, cloud or even Software Engineering. At least with these i'd be ok doing it knowing i'm getting paid well. And they are relatively interesting too.

I'm currently trying to decide which path i should take but i'm just not sure. Are they all as good as each other? Is it worth going to uni and getting a bachelors in either of these at this point? I'm 30 years old for what its worth. I've been learning some front end development via the online platform ""Scrimba"" which has been quite helpful and fun, but the thought of doing these tests they give you in interviews for places like canva or atlassian absolutely terrify me because i just feel i wouldn't be able to complete it no matter what i knew.

With the way the world is going, and with my experience already. Am i better off sticking to IT and maybe taking on a L2 job to quickly get back up to speed and move fast into a IT security/cloud job? Or is it still not too late for me to learn front end development and transition into a software development job instead? I'm worried about going to Uni as 1. it's MEGA expensive and 2. Would take 3 years minimum doing it full time on top of full time work which would probably kill me. and 3. Doing it part time would set me back massively in terms of career development and salary development. Also 4. The HECS would screw me over trying to get a home loan as well. Would love to hear some opinions on my situation here. Has anyone ever done full time uni and work before? How did you juggle it?",2024-01-29 05:34:34
1ad0prc,Am I scuffed?,"Final year IT student at Macquarie University, majoring in AI and data science. Distinction WAM.

Maybe MQ isn't the best uni for this (I certainly hate it) but I was starting out with actuarial studies, didn't like it, so I switched to the closest thing to cs (switching unis would've delayed my graduation date). Just wanted to get my degree and leave.

It's just that I had 98 atar, and even though I'm aiming for passes I still run distinction. I think I'm pretty smart and often ace the TAs and all that. But last summer I applied for like 50+ internships but didn't receive a single offer. Don't really have any experience.

I spent a lot of time the past two years upskilling myself with online courses and have plenty of projects under my belt.

A lot of this has to do with my family knowing I'm smart, and it's like I have to justify how smart I am and how much they invested in me with a well paying job after uni.

Current job is very entry level support, mainly assisting older people with their computer issues. It's getting boring and the pay is shit. 

Just wanted to know if people recommend completing certificates like aws or comptia+ or actually going to uni/tafe would be better. I suppose the first step would be finding the field I enjoy, there's just a lot of different paths in IT to go down its a bit overwhelming. Or just tell me im a deadshit and I should of tried in school, either way i don't mind.

Currently working as a developer, I'm unsure about this shift and its implications for my long-term goal of working as a project manager or Scrum Master. The IT Project Officer role is more non-technical and support-oriented, and I'm wondering if taking this role might put me at a disadvantage for future opportunities in software development or related fields.

I am not very happy at my current company, I was once yelled at in a meeting in front of everyone by the CEO (i had no other choice but to stay because of uni requirements) and there's constant pressure of getting tasks done without getting much help. However, the CEO hasn't been attending the meetings the last few months but I think will return next year and start yelling again. 

I am currently getting paid $59000 and switching to IT project officer role will increase my salary by $16k. I still have 1 year to graduate, the new role is hybrid and my current role is WFH which might make studying a bit easier. 

I'd greatly appreciate any advice or insights you could share. Specifically:

* Do you think transitioning to an IT Project Officer role would be beneficial for someone aiming for project management or Scrum Master positions in the long term?
* Could the experience gained in project management aspects compensate for the lack of direct software development work on my resume?
* Any recommendations or considerations I should keep in mind as I contemplate this career move?

176rg2y,(Another?)Post about career switching from 0 computer science background,"Hello r/cscareerquestionsOCE,

I have a few questions regarding my pathway towards a potential career in software engineering. I am currently full time employed working in one of the Allied Health professions in Australia. I have no background exposure to computer science during my tertiary studies, as all my subjects related more to biological systems. 

Recently I had casually mentioned this idea to work towards software to my mate who is currently a backend (something???) for CBA. He had recommended me to ""just"" learn Python language (and don't worry about languages like HTML and JavaScript) to get started, and pick up additional skills as I work. He's also recommended me to try short courses/bootcamps from Udemy to see if I truly enjoy this field, given that they can also provide some kind of certificate upon completion? I do appreciate the thought of him getting me to ""try before I buy"" to avoid hard commitment, but I feel limiting my language skills will lead to my shortcoming?

Despite so, I've found an online resource called w3schools and have worked through their Python tutorials. So far? I've been quite enjoying playing around with the fundamental tools and trying to play around with additional ideas to see if I can get them to work by myself. The w3schools website also have tutorials for HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, C/C++/C# and many other languages I've seen recommended to be proficient in for job roles. I suspect the tutorial only covers the surface of each various language, so I do plan to do further courses leading to the right direction.

So I guess my questions are:

* In reality when looking for role applications where they list a whole bunch of different desired languages, should I have a few commonly seen languages under my belt to ensure I cover as many bases as possible? Or does my friend's recommendation sound reasonable to consolidate one language first, then branch out to others as I work along?
* From reading a little bit about the commonly seen languages, each has its pros/cons and serve different purposes. Is there a general rule of thumb what category of languages are recommended for e.g. backend developers vs. frontend developers? Web design?
* Self learning resources vs. bootcamps vs. certified tertiary courses: from what I read in other related threads, the general consensus is to go for a certified course as I will be competing with others for the same role, and initial filtering of applicants will put me at a disadvantage without an appropriate degree. But in terms of practical application and learning/understanding development, is there a major difference provided I am given the appropriate learning materials?
* Portfolio: I've seen this pop up quite commonly and was wondering; if I do end up self-learning all the way, what do I have to do or create to build some kind of portfolio? Do I demonstrate my skills by making some kind of program that does a particular job? Or is portfolio building more to do with having experience from interning basic roles and building my way up from there. 

Thank you if you have made it through my wall of text, and would love any suggestions/opinions from you all. I have tried my best to research as much as I could before posting (to avoid low-effort threads) so apologies if there were shortfalls in some areas.

14alhdr,Should I take a grad job with a controversial company and less employable tech stack?,"I graduated late last year and I was too picky with jobs throughout last year because I had a pretty high interview rate (I think I got an interview rate of at least 95%), internship experience, and above average grades. This has since come back to bite me in the ass as I remain unemployed and the job market has shrivelled. Over the past few months, I have been applying for any job I can find that is related to software development. My interview rate has dramatically dropped to around \~55%. I initially only applied for roles in NZ which has also backfired on me and has caused me to miss out on quite a few potential applications from Australia too.

&#x200B;

However, despite current job market, in the past month I have managed to secure two offers. 

1. I turned down the first offer because the pay was very poor and it was not the position I initially applied for. They told me they decided to not go forward with their initial role but wanted to keep me anyways in another role.
2. The second offer is a proper software engineering role like I wanted. However, there are a few things that I am a bit suspicious about with this job. The first is that this company, particularly their founding members, have been appearing on the news with polarising reactions. Secondly, the tech stack I will be working mainly involves a lesser used programming language.

&#x200B;

I am worried about how it will affect my employ-ability in the future. Right now, I have this dreaded gap in my CV and it is only going to get worse without a job. I can gamble and keep waiting for another offer that may never come or just make off with what I have on the table. I am still eligible for most graduate positions until late 2024 as they require that I am less than two years removed from university. Given the recession and scarce number of software engineering roles available, the competition for each role is going to be much tougher and I think employers would prefer someone that is still in education for their grad/junior roles.

At least to me, after reading many threads on this subreddit, specialising in IoT doesn't look like a good decision since you won't be able to land a job with your dream companies, and their products are mostly web or mobile applications without any IoS components.

1308dlh,Realistic for a self-taught engineer with a mechanical engineering background to apply for CS roles?,"Hey everyone,

I have a background in mechanical engineering, and I've been teaching myself computer science for the past year. I am building up a solid portfolio of projects, and I hope to complete The Odin Project, an online curriculum for learning web development, soon.

I'm really interested in pursuing a career in CS, but I'm not sure how realistic it is for someone with my background to apply for CS roles. I understand that a lot of CS positions require a degree in computer science or a related field, but I feel like I have the skills to be successful in a CS role.

Has anyone else made a similar transition from a non-CS background to a CS role? What was your experience like? Do you have any tips or advice for someone in my position?

I understand the job market is not as good as it was a year ago. But, I would just like to know your opinion.

12dbqo6,Experience with Indian IT contractors,"Hey guys, I was just wanting to hear if anyone has had good experience with Indian contractors.

Our company has recently created a new team to work on a new product. We have two onshore staff in our team, myself and my Lead Engineer, a Product Manager shared with another team, and management have also hired two contractors from India.

I left my old team on Friday and started this new team with my Lead Engineer on Monday, but we were doing some administrative work such as setting up new AWS accounts, GitHub repos, pipelines etc. ready to welcome in the contractors on Wednesday to start our first sprint. Our plan was to give them a 1-hour introduction of our product (besides information we gave to them days earlier which their company had asked them to read), followed by Planning.

Now, the thing about our stack is that we use GraphQL and the Relay client on the client side to do our stuff. So, in the first days I got to witness two red flags:

* Despite me making it clear in the interview that this is what they'd be exposed with and these guys sounding like they were very eager to learn GraphQL, our first meeting was a bit of a fail. They requested to delay the start of the sprint until today so that they can learn more GraphQL stuff. Fair enough I think, and Product Manager agreed, but I really wanted to do some pair programming with them just to show them the basics so that they wouldn't have to spend so much time on GraphQL. Which led to the second red flag.
* One guy is based in India (let's say his name is Gregg), and the other guy (Jack) was also meant to be based in India, but somehow he's now in Canada. Now, in the initial interview with us, we raised insufficient timezone overlap as an issue. Jack reassured us (and management) that he would be willing to work as if he was in the Indian timezone, that his agency is aware of this and is paying him extra money to work unsociable hours which he is happy with. But yesterday he told me and my lead developer that he can only work for the first three hours when his Indian-based mate started (7.30am), he would then go to bed (it would be just past midnight in Canada) and complete the rest 5 hours the following morning. Which means that doing any kind of training is very hard for us even when it is so essential to do so in the first few days.

In short, it feels like there are two different expectations here:

* This is both our first time working with overseas contractors with language barriers and insufficient timezone overlap so we have been shocked by the experience. We were thinking it would just be similar to onboarding a junior engineer which we already have experience with, that they would work on real projects and we would pair program to help and show them how to do things i.e. learning on the spot.
* The contractors, it feels to us, seem aware of the timezone difference and would rather work asynchronously and in their own time to prep themselves up, which led to them initially asking for a 1-day ""study leave"" to read and experiment with GraphQL.

Now, we don't have a problem with how they want to do things and were initially, too, happy with the suggestion. Until today. In today's standup, my lead developer asked them what they did yesterday.

* Gregg did a demo of his work. He got quite far with grasping all the GraphQL basics (queries, mutations, even a bit of subscriptions) and consuming the GraphQL API via Apollo on the client side.
* Jack showed us two simple query resolvers to return some fake data. In our expectation this was an underdelivery given he had 5 hours yesterday (not including the meetings) to play around with GraphQL.
* In addition, Jack did not communicate with either Gregg or our NZ based team at all in Slack for the entire first day. I had to show him how to log into Slack after our standup, and he clearly never visited our company's Slack, Jira or Confluence until then.

Now, in the standup they both asked to delay our sprint until Monday morning. My product manager was not very convinced but eventually agreed to the request, with myself and my Lead Developer sorting out some more overhead work in this period. PM also asked us to send a message in Slack outlining what their plan was and what we want to see as part of their demo tomorrow, which I did.

So, now comes to my questions:

The thing I hate most on this planet Earth is micromanaging people. I believe people have dignity and are motivated enough to be able to have a reasonable amount of autonomy to try their best and be honest about their work. However, for Jack, it seems as though we may need to spell out exactly in our tickets what exactly he needs to do and give him clear instructions. Is this the right thing to do?

For Gregg, his experience with me has been better but my PM is certainly not impressed that he's the one asking to delay the sprint. However, I do think if it had not been for Jack, there would be sufficient timezone overlap for me to do one on one pair programming with him.

So my second question is, what would be your advice, tips, or suggestions when it comes to managing offshore teams?",2023-04-06 06:50:52
11y790x,Cloud Architect Career Path Recommendations?,"Hi everyone, I'm about to be a freshman in Bachelor Of Computer Science in Australia. Complete NEWBIE. It's might way way too early to think about an IT architect path and I understand it is insanely difficult job that requires something like 10 years+ experience? But I just want an overall plan that can lead me to that big picture end goal, or at least something comparative with a step by step goal to work towards.

So according to this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2pXoh3Cmo8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2pXoh3Cmo8), he provided 3 pathways to become a cloud architect that are the following:

IT support -> System Engineering -> Database Administrator -> Cloud Architect

Developer -> DevOps -> Principle Developer -> Cloud Architect

Data -> Principle System Administrator -> Cloud Architect

I'm currently leaning towards the software developer/engineering route. But I'm not certain if these 3 routes are the routes that are the most effective to potentially lead to a cloud/solution architect job? What other routes that are possible or even more effective?

Anyone currently in a cloud architect role or a software developer that shared the same end goal?Please enlighten me with your knowledge, thank you so much! Anything that you may want to share will be very much appreciated.",2023-03-22 04:44:13

I'm trying to get some insight into the possibility of landing a job before arrival? Has anyone here managed to accomplish this, if so, were companies open to this? Also was it possible to land any relocation assistance (Visa, flights etc) as part of the contract?  
The other option would be to arrive on a Working Holiday Visa and then begin looking, but obviously would prefer the first option to save time and cost of the move.

Would be interested in anyone's similar experience here, and also any companies recommendations who are open to the process would be great.

* I don't think the english tutor experience is relevant and the personal website project isn't great since its very basic, but my resume would be a bit empty without them
* I haven't actually started the USYD tutor thing yet since the semester hasn't started, but I just wrote some stuff that I think i'll be doing
* Since I haven't actually started the USYD tutor thing, do you think I should wait for the semester to start before I apply for any of the internships that have already opened?

I'm coming to the end of my degree now and have managed to land tech consulting internships in the Big 4, one was for a more strategy, change management and operating models focused team while the other was Frontend development primarily. I enjoyed the more technical role a lot more and was wondering if anyone who has had experience in doing development work at a consultancy and been an in-house developer on the client-side found much difference between the two?

I know I would like to be more technical earlier in my career and move to a leadership role as I progress down the track, so I wonder if the consulting role would give me a better opportunity to help develop my soft skills more? From what I've found from talking to people at these internships it seems consultancies really focus on your training since you are essentially the product.

18zyq46,Do you schedule on-call/backup personnels for your tech stack?,"Hi fellow techies! 

Recently, I have built a prototype of an advanced scheduler for assigning ops (or other roles) to on-call/backup shifts. It takes the ops' preferences, availability, equitable workload, previously scheduled rosters and host of other factors into account while scheduling.

I built this for a friend and he is happy with it. It has freed him from a lot of cognitive load. Also, scheduling is now done in less than second whereas it used to take hours before (for him, 6+ hours). 

Anyway, I am not here to fish potential customers. Rather I would like to make the solution more matured so that the other techies can get the benefit as well. 

If you are someone who schedules on-call/backup personnels for mission critical tech-stacks I would be very keen to chat to understand the user journey. If you are someone who thinks the manual scheduling is affecting your WLB, I woule be interested to know about how your expectations were breached.

16yjkv1,MS in CS/Software Engineering Schools,"Hi

I recently received two masters offers to study Software Engineering and Computer Science, from The University Of Oxford and Cornell Tech (Cornell University in New York City)

I am weighing up which option I should chose and would like to kindly request for some advice on what a good move would be

About the programs

The University Of Oxford

MSc (Master Of Science) in Software Engineering

Duration: 2 years – 4 years (part time, intensive classes that run one week (9-5am) at Oxford University), I am assigned to a college (New College), etc etc.

Administered and awarded by School of Computer Science, this is a on-campus program i.e not remote/online.

https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-software-engineering

The main drawback and potentially benefit of this is that it is a part-time program, I can grind my 9-5 (I am a software engineer), another drawback i see is that maybe I will not be getting the full Oxford experience.

The course contains 10 subjects studied intensively followed by a final project and dissertation (your standard CS/SENG masters)

Total Cost: (Including flights) roughly 100-110k

Cornell University (Cornell Tech)

MEng (Master of Eng) Computer Science

Duration: 1 year full-time in new york city

Cost: 150-200k AUD, the issue here is that it is a full-time program, and I won't be able to work, also it is in new york city, I guess the location is potentially glamorous career wise the main factor that is influencing me is the fact that it is an Ivy league school and that in itself may open up future opportunities.

Link to program: https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/masters-programs/master-in-computer-science/

My profile

23M, graduate from a Go8 Uni (First Class Honours >= 75 WAM, roughly 3.5 years of professional experience, Interned every year as a software engineer for the duration of my 5 year degree)

Savings: I have roughly 70k in savings, however it is still a while away for the program to begin so I can easily cover the entire tuition for Oxford in one go.

I will most likely either need student loans/parents to help me out to afford Cornell.

I am just wondering, i am finalising Oxford University due to its low cost, primarily Is this a potentially bad decision, over Cornell.

I am planning to return/keep working in Sydney after the Masters so I can see employers recognizing and valuing Oxford over Cornell alot more.

Oxford's units seem alot more academic compared to Cornell's and I will also be missing out on the start-up culture that NYC brings.

Am I making the right choice here?",2023-10-03 05:32:27

16lol1f,Looking for career advice,"I'm an NZ citizen currently living in a pacific islands country, working at a small fintech startup. I am looking to move to Melbourne early next year, but my current company is unlikely to let me to convert to a remote contract. With 2 years full-stack experience, and an un-finished software engineering degree, what are my odds of getting a job in Melbourne in the next 2-6 months? What positions should I be aiming for, and what type of interviews should I be prepping for (any leetcode companies in Melbourne)? Would it be worth it to invest in some AWS/K8s certs?

Open to the possibility of going back to uni to complete my BE, or switching to BSc compsci for quicker graduation. I know not having a degree will make it harder for me now and the next few years, but is it also going to hold me back significantly in 5+ years time? I've attached my resume for critiques too.

1. Should I put ""tech lead"" on my resume, or something else?  Having tech lead as a job title on my resume seems a bit weird considering I am applying for entry level jobs, but it's the title.
2. What experience should I include on my resume? I am definitely including 3 and 4, but I am not sure if I should get rid of the personal projects section and just have a big experience section listing all 4 of the above experiences.

Looking for career advice.

Background: I'm a 40Yr old Australia citizen with close to 20Yrs of Siebel CRM experience; Huge techno functional experience that includes integration, data transformation, reporting, escript etc; lots of analyst roles, a little BA experience, have managed large technical teams as well. Been with Siebel due to the golden cuffs (> AUD $100k post tax) and unfortunately, no other 'big' software skills. Good communication skills but barely manageable social skills. 

It's time to pivot the career; below are my preferences, although I'm flexible: 

\- Something that I can learn and be able to contribute to a job quickly (say within a few months)

\- Be able to maintain the current income. Have already tried very low paying permanent/contract jobs. 

\- Open to learn new programming languages especially if it doesn't hinder getting a job right away and then continue learning. 

\- Trying to stay away from intense coding gigs. 

\- I enjoy the Analysis work

\- Salesforce admin/analyst/dev seems doable with the right motivation - salary/job longevity

\- Long term career goal could be Sr BA, Architect etc. WFH or Hybrid roles (at least eventually) will be a huge bonus.

\- Not keen on the rat race anymore; I coast most times but sacrifice/work hard when the moment calls for it.

\> @ Ex Siebel CRM professionals, where are you in your career at the moment? It will be great to know what you switched to in terms of technology (like salesforce, dynamics, hubspot etc) &/or role (BA, PM, Architect etc.). Also, feel free to suggest my next move.

I've recently been offered an unpaid internship for web developer through my school's career center. The opportunity looks promising, but it would replace two of my academic subjects in the upcoming semester. I'm facing a bit of a conundrum and would appreciate your insights.

On one hand, this internship seems like a good way to gain real-world experience and might be a valuable stepping stone for my career. On the other hand, the academic courses I'd be giving up are also important and provide comprehensive knowledge in my field of study. Besides I have actually had one internship experience when doing my Bachelor, I am doing my Master's right now, but the internship experience was overseas.

For those of you who've been in a similar situation, or generally have insights about this, I'd love to hear your thoughts:

1. Is an unpaid internship worth the practical experience at the cost of academic learning?
2. In your experience, does an internship significantly enhance a resume compared to academic coursework? Like if its gonna help me land a job next year when I graduate?
3. How likely is the chance they give me a return offer?

I'm trying to make an informed decision that balances my short-term learning and long-term career prospects. Any advice or shared experiences would be immensely helpful!

I find myself at a crossroads and could use some valuable insights from the community. I am considering the Master's in Information Technology (specialization in AI) at the Uni of Melbourne. However, I'm also considering pursuing a Master's in Data Science or even IT at either Monash or UNSW in Sydney.

Here are a few points I'm grappling with and would appreciate your thoughts on:

Specificity of Data Science vs. Versatility of IT: While I am initially inclined towards a career as a Data Scientist, I wonder if specializing in Data Science might be too specific. Opting for a Master's in IT with a focus on AI seems like it would keep my options open for a broader range of opportunities. What are your thoughts on the balance between specialization and versatility in the current job market?

Career Path Concerns: I'm curious about the potential implications of pursuing a Master's in IT first and then transitioning into a Data Science role. Would employers view this path less favorably compared to someone with a dedicated Master's in Data Science? I have a strong foundation in mathematics, including probability, statistics, and calculus, and have already delved into machine learning with plans to learn NLP soon.

Background: I graduated from the University of Melbourne at the end of 2021 with a major in Computer and Software Systems. Since then, my work experience includes a 3-month software engineering internship, a 6-month unpaid full-stack role (remote), and a brief 1-month full-stack position. Earlier this year, I completed a 2-month web development bootcamp. Additionally, I've been actively participating in meetups and networking on LinkedIn.

Visa Status: I'm currently on a post-study work visa in Australia, valid until the end of 2026, which influences my job search and potential opportunities.

Job Search Experience: Throughout this year, I've been consistently applying for jobs, focusing mainly on junior developer positions rather than graduate programs due to my visa status. Despite reaching the final stages in about 7 interviews, I haven't secured a position yet, often receiving feedback that there was a more suitable candidate.

Skillset: My primary expertise lies in MERN and Rails, though I sometimes apply to job applications where the framework don't fit my bill but I try to learn them in few days and I know is a bad idea. like lately I haven't seen a lot of junior applications in rails, nodejs, next, mostly mid-senior roles. only seen a alot of asp net and c#

Academic Considerations: Given the competitive job market and my experiences, I've contemplated pursuing further studies, specifically a Master's in Artificial Intelligence. However, I'm uncertain whether this is the right step forward. I'm aware that practical experience is often valued over academic qualifications in our field, but I wonder if specializing in AI could enhance my career prospects.

1. Given my situation, should I focus more on continuing personal projects and practicing coding challenges while job hunting, or consider pursuing a Master's degree?
2. If further studies are advisable, is a Master's in AI a worthwhile investment, both in terms of career opportunities and financially?
3. Can the essential skills in AI be self-learned effectively, or does formal education provide a significant advantage?

Any insights, experiences, or advice from fellow software engineers and developers in Oceania would be incredibly helpful. I'm eager to understand different perspectives to make an informed decision about my next steps.",2023-12-15 05:57:54

Most part of my career has been spent working at startups so far. I like the autonomy and faster pivots. If I opt for any of the startups over Ausgrid, then I will see 2+ years more on this front. 

However, I think it at some point I will have to tune down my risk appetite and settle for something big tech/enterprise-y, perhaps for a better WLB.

16obr3g,Cyber Security aus tier list?,"Stealing a bit of attention to the other ""cs"" :)

The tier list post [from the other week](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsOCE/comments/166ati7/australian_tier_list/) was really insightful, anyone have any changes to that list for cyber security? 

Some additional employer options:

- Big US Cyber with AU operations: Tier 1.5-2? Just under US tech, if not equivalent. Gives you an opening to work in the US too, which is where all the money is.

- AU native Cyber companies: Tier 2-4? Lower than US cyber IMO. 

I think I would lump MSSPs, cyber software, and cyber consultancies together for the above two. AU native cyber companies would depend on how big/well known the brand is, and they differ greatly in reputation.

- State & Federal gov: Federal T2, State T2.5? But federal probably means you have to move to Canberra, and state would differ greatly I think depending on department. In both cases, points awarded because government work is good WLB, and obviously branding. Pay might not be amazing, but it should be good on the resume for future roles.

- Operational Technology (OT), critical infrastructure (gas/water/electric): No clue? I imagine it has brand recognition on the resume.

- Every other tech SME: Tier 4.5, you can get a pretty decent pay if you pick one that just got funding to build a security team, but it will be hard work as you'll be in a team of 1-2. Might not be suitable for a new grad, but with a couple YoE, could easily give you 130k base to springboard off, but maybe lacking the brand reputation.

I feel like most tiers stay the same/similar to software dev, but a big thing is that early/startup tech SMEs deprioritise cyber security in favour of increasing the priority on software development, or forgo it altogether. Understaffing is a problem with SMEs; you often have to ""do everything"" since you're working with a ratio of 1 cyber to 250-1000 staff.

Another big thing in cyber is to go contract-based, and that can be very lucrative if you know what you're doing; $1000/day as a normal rate.",2023-09-21 09:54:32

&#x200B;

I am an IT student, majoring in Cyber Security, and will be completing my degree in mid-2024 after dropping from a double degree, leaving me with some awkward unit choices.

I have completed an internship at Deloitte, under their Digital consulting team. I was lucky to have been given a great project opportunity while there, and was able to complete a proof of concept to an actual client via presentation, with all the technology learning/programming language learning done by myself and two other interns. 

&#x200B;

Ended up organising a pipeline as well, which I had not done before, using BitBucket, and was able to setup a baseline system, through which the front-end devs could take over and begin once the entire project was approved by the client/payment for workers was organised - I was also extended an offer for a full-time position start of 2025 given my delayed graduation circumstances, although they do seem to give offers to the majority of interns.

&#x200B;

Based on what I've seen overall, this seems to be great experience, and I would like to extend myself further, and actually get to speak my experience into interviews, however, I am often stopped by the technical challenges before interviews, and if I pass that, the actual technical interview with a FED, etc.

i assume she was confident based on my technical interview outcome, she did mention i was scored highly.

But other times they are often shutdown by people saying ""just enjoy your life"" or overexaggerated jokes like ""nah bro you should have applied in year 10!"" as if it's an invalid / stupid question.

1aloc4s,Seeking Advice: Pursuing a Career in Computer Science in Europe - AI vs. Traditional CS Degrees," I'm certain that many people here possess valuable experience, so I would greatly appreciate everyone's suggestions. Especially those who have work experience in software development, programming, etc., within the European Union.

A series of unfortunate events, including an economic crisis in my home country and serious financial problems, have led me to consider a deviation from my current career path and explore opportunities in computer science-related fields such as programming and software development.

I am contemplating studying computer science in Europe, but I only speak English. Therefore, I have restricted my search to English-taught Bachelor's programs.

Despite their scarcity, I have managed to find some English-taught Bachelor's programs in subjects such as Applied Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, which although not strictly Computer Science programs, are akin to a CS degree.

I understand that most individuals pursue a computer science degree and then either specialize in AI during their final year or pursue a master's later on for specialization in AI (which I believe is probably the ideal path). Unfortunately, given my circumstances, choices are limited. There aren't many English-taught programs, and those available are predominantly AI-focused.

On one hand, I contemplate whether an employer would seek someone who has studied solely artificial intelligence and lacks a general computer science background. On the other hand, I recall acquaintances who secured good jobs in the EU despite lacking a CS degree but possessing a few bootcamp certificates and some work experience.

Has anyone here pursued a Bachelor's degree in AI-related fields and successfully found employment as a software developer or programmer?",2024-02-08 05:29:01

Long story short, I’m already going to start my second year next year and I’m still unsure if I want to pursure cs or datasci, it’s kind of like 90% cs 10% datasci. I’m kinda biased on wanting to do maths subjects related to datasci in case I wanted to pursure datasci postgrad, however am kinda experiencing somewhat of an impostor syndrome right now since most of my cs friends are taking AI and machine learning (ML) modules in their 3rd year and I can’t do that if I take maths subjects. (I read that the AI/ML subjects and its prereqs are pretty disorganized subjects, which could affect my wam heavily)

Question is, how relevant do you guys think basic knowledge of AI and machine learning is in the field of Computer Science careers? Recently I’ve came across posts where cs roles are expected to have basic knowledge of AI and ML ? (which is what these subjects will give me). Do yall think my friends who take this subject will gain a significant advantage over me if I don’t end up taking these subjects? Any thoughts or insights are very very appreciated since I’ve been debating about this topic for the past few months already and I have to finalise my decisions soon.

I'm just looking for general advice on my current situation and whether my current intended career goals seem reasonable. I'm very open to suggestions

Context: Self-taught FE for 1 year (primarily React). Took an internship into a junior full stack Python role (primarily Django) with a small web agency in the outskirts of Sydney. My starting salary was $50k. A recent salary review has bumped me up to $60k. I now have a little over 1 YOE and I'm intending to study up for a new role.

I have minimal cloud experience (AWS) and haven't touched a FE framework since I was previously studying. 

Intentions are to again study a FE framework (leaning towards React) by creating some full stack projects. I'm hoping to hit a salary of 90k to 100k within the next 6 months. 

Does this salary sound reasonable given my current level of experience? Is there an alternative path e.g. a different FE framework people would suggest or instead learn an alternative back end framework like Node?

I am trying to get a job at any entry level. I have a degree in finance and marketing and have had no luck finding employment of any sorts, period (Have work experience in both) but can't land anything at the moment. I  have learnt the fundamentals of Python and currently learning SQL on my own. However, all the job postings I see even for entry level require a CS degree and or sometimes the equivalent. This is from entry to mid +.  So while I have the time on my hands with no job I am thinking about getting a graduate diploma in either CS or SWE which will take 1 year.  The problem I have is I can only choose up to 8 papers from a list with each paper making up to 15 points equaling 120 points total. I want to have a good grasp of things I would need to learn to functional in the workforce. I know I need  to take OOP, algo and data structures but that's about all I know about what I should take. That still leaves me with 5 papers to choose from.

I  am hoping those of you with experience and or more knowledge than  myself could give some pointers on what papers to take. I think I know I can learn programming on the job and should learn the theory at uni as I doubt I would look to learn it outside, but then I may lack the practical experience to get a job if I don't do SWE. So in a catch 22 in my head. Is a graduate diploma even worth it? or do I go and spend another 3-4 years and get more debt?

Link to image of papers available: [https://imgur.com/a/zBj2RPj](https://imgur.com/a/zBj2RPj) Need to choose 5 papers from this list.

* How long do I have before I will no longer be considered for a grad role? Finished uni a few months ago and am worried I might miss the boat.
* Can I and is it advisable to get a temporary job software before these roles open? Then switch if I get a better offer?

Am a Bsci major in mathematics and finance with honours in applied maths (some coding but not really deep compared to cs/SWE majors) from Go8. Marks weren’t amazing but graduated with overall distinction. Electives in intro to programming, object oriented, and DS&A.

Currently working at an investment bank front office but absolutely hate it right now (thought the money could get me through mind numbing PowerPoints, I was wrong).

Looking to pivot to a technical/more engineering role. Obviously trading/quant finance is an option but it’s very competitive, planning to apply but naturally it shouldn’t be my only option.

In the current environment, is maths major + presentable GitHub portfolio enough? Have been testing the waters and it seems the lack of CS/SWE degree is hurting the app quite a bit.

With a background in EEE and a strong math foundation, I'm interested in AI/ML and data science roles. I've dabbled in ML and plan to explore NLP.

Any insights on choosing between CS and IT? How did you decide? Any crucial factors I might be missing?

1ajfk5r,Salary range for junior-mid level full stack developer in Sydney,"Hey guys, I recently joined the job market in search for a new software developer role. I am based in Sydney and have no experience in the Australian software developer job market as of yet. I am currently pretty unsure what salary range/ experience level I fit into in this market.

For some context, in my current role I work as a contractor for a UK based B2B SaaS startup, maintaining and developing their SPA (Vue.js frontend, TypeScript serverless backend hosted on AWS). I’ve been working for them for almost 3 years now. It’s a pretty small company and I’ve been the sole developer on the project the last few years, inheriting it from a dev house that did the initial development. Before this role, I had an entry level position for about 2 years at a consultancy in my home town, developing in-house tools for them. My professional software career started with them, learning the tools I needed to complete projects as required, i.e. I am self-taught with no formal software development qualifications (I did start studying, but life happened and I could no longer afford it).

My predicament is this, my room for professional growth in my current position without technical seniors is very limited, and I need to get myself into an environment where I can become the best in my domain that I can be, working with people that know more than me that can give me constructive criticism when I get things wrong, and push me to my limits.

I guess my question is this, what level position should I be searching for (I’m currently searching for Junior positions) and what salary range should I be expecting (some companies ask this in their application).

Thanks to all for reading, hope you’re having a great day!",2024-02-05 12:40:39

199bkuc,Is applying interstate for new grad positions still OK? (Not for grad programs),"Hello everyone,

Thanks to this subreddit, I was able to get my first interview for SWE since my graduation last month! The interview was with a financial company in Sydney and it was pretty good. However since I am in Melbourne and it would be hard for me to work with financial data in the company, I could not get an offer there, despite my emphasis in the interview that I could relocate to Sydney for the job.

As such, I would like to ask some questions for you guys:

1. Is applying interstate for new grad/junior positions still worth it for me, given disadvantages that I could face? I am planning to move from Melbourne if I get any offers elsewhere.
2. Where could I connect directly with recruiters, apart from LinkedIn? I was suggested to search for 'recruiters in data analyst/SWE' in LinkedIn, but I wonder is there any other way to reach out for them.

176n0cp,Seeking Advice on Manager's Perception of My Work,"Hi all,

I work as a SWE on some very interesting and groundbreaking software at a start-up. I started this job as a graduate out of university (been with this company for a little under 2 years, and have seen the team grow from just myself and my mentor to around 10 people in my immediate team) and have learned a huge amount while working here. It is a hybrid role with most of my co-workers working out of Silicon Valley. Things like SWE best practices, as well as specifics related to the product/area of study which I have really enjoyed - all in all this job is exactly what I wished for when I was studying CS at college.

However, the project I have been working on for the past few months has been very difficult and has caused some issues between myself and my manager. I have been working quite hard on this project ever since I took it on, and have collaborated with lots of different teams as this project pertains to multiple aspects of the SW stack, as opposed to just the immediate layer that my team works on - I've really enjoyed this process (even though it has been extremely testing on myself and my personal life) as I've learnt so much. A complication is that this project was meant to be finished a little over 3 months ago, but mostly issues related to work done by other teams has blocked me. I did my best to move as fast as I could once the ball was back in my court, but there has been a lot of back-and-forth with other teams that has made this project move quite slow.

The crux of the issue is that it appears as though my manager is unaware and/or does not understand the amount of effort I put into this project. A colleague recently mentioned in passing that our manager said that it appears my productivity has recently dropped - my colleague jumped to my defence and said it is the opposite, as only within the past week has all blockers been removed and I am able to get in to some really deep work to progress on the project. This essentially has me worried. I've spent the past 4 months grinding hard, coming up another steep learning curve to understand the other aspects of the SW stack, even start to understand something completely unrelated to my part of the stack, because I find it interesting as well as because an understanding of this part of the stack has helped me diagnose bugs in my own code, but my manager does not seem to recognise this. Let alone the fact that my personal life is super hectic (married with a child, extended family issues, and another child due technically yesterday, plus I am young and this is my first SWE job, so there's so much to learn) - although I have worked really hard to never let me personal life get in the way of work.

A bit more context - my manager used to be really hard on me and always on my case. Then, other members of my team (rightfully) raised concerns over the quality of code I was delivering to main. As a result, my manager decided to step back. I have since improved my code quality with help from the team and continue to improve and reflect where possible. As a result my manager is not as interactive with me as he used to be, except for teams messages (which IMO are sometimes a bit rude/aggressive/manipulative) asking for updates on the project, expressing concern for the progress of the project, as well as reminding me of the importance of the project (of which I think I'm quite aware of at this point).

Before I conclude and move to the final question, I will add that I did some self-reflection over these past few weeks, and decided that I could have progressed the project sooner by providing temporary solutions that would stop me relying on other parts of the SW stack. At the time I made a judgement call that it was perhaps best for me to wait, but now that they have finished their aspect and I have seen what their implementation looks like etc. it may have been best for me to just learn that aspect as well and implement a temporary solution. I'll also concede that not every single day I have been 100% productive, but as I have moved forward the days where I am less productive have become fewer and fewer. I'm also in the process of learning to work smarter, not harder in this industry. In other projects, me working hard but not reflecting as often as I should have has resulted in sub-optimal solutions IMO.

I've tried to provide an unbiased recollection of events, but that is truly impossible because I am a human. Given this context, the questions I have are as follows:

* Am I right to be concerned about what appears to be my manager's unawareness of the effort I am putting in?
* Am I putting in enough effort, and is there anything I'm missing that I should be doing to improve my QOL? Usually I would ask my manager for feedback, but as he is a person of interest here, I do not feel as though I can ask him this question.

I really like this job and love to learn all this stuff, but the lack of appreciation/acknowledgement/understanding from my manager is starting to wear me down.

I am currently a penultimate student seeking an internship, and I have been struggling to decide whether to keep my resume at 1 page or 2 pages. 

Originally my resume was two pages long, but after asking peers, mentors and some currently working software engineers, they all felt my resume had too much on it. I use a rather traditional template, so two pages of text (1100 words) might be overwhelming. 

So I cut it down to 1 page (570 words) and surprisingly found that it still reads well and somehow delivered most of the information I wanted to deliver, but just not to a full extent like what I did in 2 pages resume. 

I wondered if 1 page and succinct resume would really give me an advantage in terms of readability? Or should I keep it as 2 pages, so I can elaborate more on what I have done?

I just have a couple questions about universities, the 3 that I'd be hoping to go to are usyd, unsw or uts. Not sure if this is the right place to ask but it seemed like the best. My questions are:

\- Would UNSW vs USYD vs UTS make a difference to employers?  
\- Are there big gaps in course quality between the 3? (I've read online that UNSW is the best, but it's a further commute from me and has trimesters so I'm just tossing up where to go)  
\- I'd be interested in working in the US as an AUS/US dual citizen. I've seen online that some US companies look for 4 year degrees while the UNSW compsci is 3 years. Would that be a reason to do a 4 year degree rather than UNSW CS or would it not really be a problem?

14nayj1,Liberal Arts Guy Weighing In Between PM and Urban Planning For Higher Education,"You read it right, and let me explain what I am trying to say.

I did my Bachelors in Development Studies (which is a mix of political sciences, sociology, economics, anthropology etc.). During that while, I took a lot of city management and urban development classes, and a few related internships too.

Soon after graduating, in 2020, I worked as Product Support Specialist at a US-Based telecommunication company. A year later, I worked at my university as a research assistant trying to understand (and help fix) my city's water management vows. After that contract was over, I took some time to learn UX/UI skills (since I was already pretty skilled with user research) and to sustain myself, worked as a brand strategist at a digital marketing firm (to be credit I turned the company's profits around). Within six months, I got a UX analyst job at a Fintech startup, where my role quickly transformed to a PM one.

As a PM, I have also been looking after the company's Product Marketing work as well.

Now I am trying to immigrate to Australia (I live in a third world failing state with crashing economy), and continue working in tech there. I will likely enroll in a Masters in Information Technology degree (a. I'll get the technical acumen and b. as a STEM degree it will give me extra PR points). However, while I was researching, I looked at Skilled Occupation List, it has Urban Planning in the list (the field where I already have experience, and formal education in) and no PM (tho many specific tech roles like Soft. eng., analyst etc.)

My question is: I am very confused what to do. I love PM (but dont like programming only jobs), and I also love Urban Planning (which is high in demand in Australia). Given my background, do you think I will find a job as Junior PM in Australia easily? Or should I seriously consider urban planning?

1. Understand how my education could be perceived in the Australian job market, especially in the tech industry.
2. Get insights into any additional qualifications or certifications that might complement my existing skills for Australian employers.
3. Connect with individuals who've navigated similar educational transitions to secure jobs in Australia.

If anyone has advice, information, or leads that could help me in this journey, I'd greatly appreciate your assistance. Please feel free to share your thoughts via comments or direct messages.

Thank you all for your support as I take steps toward building my career in Australia!

18jd09y,CS or Speech pathology?,"Hi everyone, hope you all are doing well. I graduated my year 12, took few months break, and exploring career options. I have done some research on the CS and SLP field, and found out that the CS market is terrible right now. I don’t have any particular passion, I want to do a job to support me and my family.
I decided to either pursue CS or speech pathology in university next year. However, speech pathology does not have a high earning potential as CS, conversely, the market of CS for new grads is horrible now. Since both of these fields are very different from each other, I am in a state of predicament.  

I was wondering- will the CS market get better? Is it wise to go with speech pathology since it has a guaranteed job after graduation even though it has a lower earning potential?",2023-12-15 23:08:37
18cant5,Junior Web Developer looking to move & apply to the US. What's the best route?,"Hi there!

I'm a junior web-developer with 1 year of experience. I have a Cert IV in Programming (Web Dev).The company I work for is rather small & local (no big branches or overseas opportunities, however, I am extremely interested in moving to the US and eventually branching into database management/engineering.

I currently have *zero* idea about how to go about this change & what needs to be done to take this next step. I was wondering if anyone in this sub has advice or been through a similar journey?

Things I would appreciate learning more about include:

**1 - How to research job opportunities** ***before*** **moving to the US**I worry that moving straight overseas without any prior applications or research might leave me really vulnerable and make getting a job really difficult. Is there any resources or pathways to build job connections with US companies before moving?

**2 - What certification or credentials do I need to pursue to be more employable overseas?**Honestly, I've always been a little insecure that my education is not as admirable as others (I didnt go to uni & never got a degree) so I worry that my current certification will make me unappealing to potential employers (I hold a Cert IV & have completed 'CS50: Intro to CompSci'). If you were in my shoes & wanted to get involved with database engineering, what courses or certification might you pursue?

I think that's all I have to ask at the moment, thank you in advance for anyone willing to share advice :)

126lism,Impact of Chat-GPT on Australian workers.,"I was listening to Ezra Klein's Podcast where they talked about the fact that companies would invest a lot of money into AI systems purely cause of the fact that Software Engineers cost a lot of money and they are hard to hire. I also think everyone should be worried about it regardless of where you work. Whether its a bank, big tech or even in research, everyone is replaceable and none of those organisations will put you over their bottom line. One of the interesting points I got from the article is that we will reach a critical stage when AI will be able to replace AI researchers themselves I guess in which we would all reach Nirvana.

**Does anyone feel a bit shattered though? I studied really hard in high school to get into a computer science degree, and then studied hard in a computer science degree with the certainty that I would get a good income once I finish. Now that I have finished, it seems that within a decade maybe and definitely 2 that certainty won't exist.**

I know we won't be the only job affected by this and many industries would be affected by it. Actually the entire white-collar workforce would be affected by this. Im not saying also that Chat-GPT would completely replace us but it does mean that as time goes on less Software Engineers would be needed for each company.

Today I talked with one of my friend over the phone, we haven't met for a long time, he's operating an Korean food shop by himself. We told each other how life has been and one thing he said was really clicked. He said this to me: ""I'm gonna be totally honest with you, although you seems to be doing good, I expected you to be more superior than you're right now."" I don't understand what he said at first, and even felt a little bit insult about it, but when I'm in the shower, I started to think he seems to be right.

I think the thing is, I simply lack of motivation. I'm a alright male, mentally and physically. I'm doing an alright side gig with an alright pay. I got a full scholarship so I just need to Pass the units in Uni. Social life is alright. I occasionally splurge by flying here and there seeing friends.

I think I felt right into the rat maze if I don't pack my shit up. I got too comfortable with life and I became a soft person. I'm embarassed and laugh at my past dreams as ""unrealistic"" and ""unattainable"".

1bnwhag,Degree crossroads,"Hi all.

I'm at a bit of a crossroads in my career/degree path right now. I'm currently in my third year of Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours), and I'm considering switching degrees to a three year Bachelor of IT (software engineering) to finish in the next year. The course content for both are pretty much identical up to the third year, so I could transfer 100% of my credits.

Reason being I've got two friends in management positions at BAEs software department, both saying they could guarantee me a graduate position as soon as I've got a year left in my degree. I'm also pretty mentally exhausted with Uni, I've always preferred full time work and the idea of getting started as a developer right away is pretty alluring.

The caveat is, if I transferred to a bachelor of IT, I'd be able to start working full time in the next two months, as I'd only have two pretty easy classes left next semester. If I stayed in software engineering, I'd probably not be able to start until the end of next year, as I'd still have a final gauntlet year ahead of tough CS classes and full time study load. 

I'm hoping any CS career veterans can chime in on what would leave me in the best position by the end of 2025.

1. Bachelor of IT (software engineering) with 1.5 years of experience as a software engineer.
2. Bachelor Software Engineering (Honors) with no software engineer experience.

yauvhg,What to specialize in for my first job as a Software Engineer?,"# What to specialize in for my first job as a Software Engineer?

**Overall plan:**

I want to first work for a company while gaining experience and then change to freelancing remotely when I'm more experienced. Whenever I get an entrepreneurial idea, I would like to execute that idea (being a Software entrepreneur is my ultimate goal).

&#x200B;

**The thing I specialize in should ideally help me with all three things:**

1. Job in a company using the niche (ideally remotely... Or is it too hard getting a remote job as an entry-level position?)
2. Highly paid freelancing niche (So I have money to spend while executing the next software entrepreneur idea)
3. Developing apps as a Software entrepreneur (I think most of my ideas will be Web apps or mobile apps, maybe involving machine learning)

&#x200B;

So which thing can I specialize in for my first job that I can later specialize in when freelancing remotely and that is also useful as a Software entrepreneur (most likely web apps and mobile apps).

&#x200B;

**I'm interested in these things:**

* Webapps and mobile (mostly because most of my entrepreneur ideas are web apps or mobile apps)
* Machine Learning
* UI/UX/Psychology
* Music 

&#x200B;

I don't know if I want to specialize in front-end, back-end, or both (full-stack). 

Should I start out with front-end because it's easier and then later switch to back-end to see what I prefer? Then if I prefer front-end I could get some UI/UX skills and specialize as a front-end UI/UX Developer? If I prefer back-end I could get some machine learning skills and specialize as a backend machine learning engineer?

I'm considering specializing in Flutter or React Native because I only have to learn one thing I can use for Android, iPhone, and web apps.

Maybe I should start out in a big company because they can invest more in people who have just graduated?

&#x200B;

**So to sum up everything I have these questions:**

1. Should I specialize in front-end (maybe with UI/UX), back-end (maybe with machine learning), or full-stack as my first job, if I don't know which I would prefer? (Ideally, it should be useful for getting a remote job in a company, a highly paid freelancing niche, AND useful for creating web/mobile apps as an entrepreneur).
2. Is it a good idea to specialize in React Native or Flutter, so I can make web AND mobile apps with one technology? Or should I specialize in something else?
3. Will aiming for a remote job be too ambitious for a newly graduated software engineer entry-level position?
4. Is it best to aim for a big company, because they have more resources to invest in newly graduated software engineers?",2022-10-22 18:25:18

It was for the same role/team I was in (and have been asked to return to next year). I spoke to the company and they deny hiring an external candidate, saying that if a graduate position were available it would have gone straight to me as a former intern.

I have just finished my 1st year in bachelor of comp sci and excited about soon applying for internships, building my own software etc. However, I'd like to pay for some coaching from people that are more experienced than me because even if I come up with solutions to coding problems etc. I'm not sure how good my code really is and if my approach is adequate. I would also like some advice on career progression etc.

So, my question is, how would I go about finding a good coach to do code reviews with, ask them career questions and maybe get some advice on making decisions regarding tech stack and data structures etc. when building my own projects? Again, I'm more than willing to pay for these services but I don't know the best way to approach this situation. I have sort of tried finding people on LinkedIn but the problem is, I have no idea if they're actually gonna be good at the thing that they do? And it's a bit awkward/not-very-organic to just hit people up and say ""hey, I want coaching but I'm not sure if you're good so can I see your GitHub?""... I've tried searching in the ""Services"" category but again, same thing, no one actually has any public links to example of their work or examples of their coaching services lol

Please DM me if you have experience being coached or are a coach yourself.

p.s. I'm not looking for a mentor, what I'm after is more like a tutor/coach who will actually tell me what to do.

 I have gotten an offer for both AUT software engineering (4 year) and UoA Comp Sci (3 year) degree.

After further processes from cross crediting from UoA Part 1 engineering last year (because I didn't get into the specialization I wanted/you already know what it is), AUT offers me to do the software engineering program in 3.5 years, whereas I still need to do UoA Comp Sci for 3 years. 

I am already doing a project with my mates and and learning new programing language on the side. 

Is there anyone who can advice me on what opportunities these uni's provide for these program's and the downsides?. Opportunities as in internship programs, better start to the industry, student life, etc

r63e6w,dropping out to work,"Hi,

I've already graduated from a software engineering degree and am due to start a graduate program late March at a big tech company (think google). Since graduating, I've been applying to jobs to get some experience and earn money. A lot companies are interested in me, until I tell them that I have a job lined up. Understandably, companies don't want to hire someone who will be leaving in 4 months time.

As I am under some financial stress, I am wondering whether it would be a good idea to just give up my graduate role so I can find a job that is starting now? Four months is a lot time to forgo a salary and work experience, and I don't know if it is worth it even for a big name company.",2021-12-01 01:51:42
jliqq0,"Want to land that dev role? Show that you have practical team experience, beyond the theory.","Hey all,

As we all know, transitioning into tech or landing that ideal dev role right now is difficult. I've interviewed a tonne of tech recruiters looking for engineering talent, and probably the most common thing I've heard is that: **beyond the theory**, **you need to show**. 

Some things they mean when they say *show* are: 

* showcasing artifacts of your capability (often in the form of a degree, certificates or side projects) 
* displaying your ability to work as a team across disciplines, since that's what your real work environment will look like, 
* execution skills that display depth over breadth, rather than many side projects, focus on one or two and do it well 
* discuss how you made dev design decisions and trade-offs, again because resourcing and constraints are a real part of your dev role
* many people can take classes or a bootcamp or a course, though can you really show that you can put into practice what you've learned? 

All of this sort of explains why we often hear ""you need experience to get experience"". Because obviously you'd get all those if you were working within a team environment already, but that's also what you're applying for, so it's a catch-22...

Again though, when you're really looking to stand out in front of hiring managers, recruiters and interviewers (being one myself), definitely try to discuss those points above! 

Full transparency - I'm posting here as one of the founders of [Co.Lab](https://joincolab.io). We are program that gives you the real, practical experience you need to land that ideal dev role.  Aka we try to solve the points above!

We'll match you within a real product team, along with a Product Manager and Designer. You'll get to do sprint planning, roadmapping, negotiate scope, make design trade-offs, choose your tech stack, and ship your product to real people for real impact. You can check it out here at [joincolab.io](https://joincolab.io). 

We also run a weekly newsletter for tips and stories from non-traditional techies looking to break into the industry! Feel free to give it a read [here](http://youbelong.substack.com/)!

Hope this write-up helped provide some additional insight into what folks are looking for when hiring. Best of luck, you've got this!",2020-10-31 13:53:46

I am posting here today looking for some guidance in how to proceed further with CS as I am currently lost and very demotivated. I live in Perth, Australia. 

I am currently 21 and a half years old and have yet to actually start my journey with CS in Uni. 

I've had a bit of a rocky time with Uni as I switched degrees and took up prerequisites - this all unfortunately killed a lotta time. 

I don't know if I'll be able to start Uni in Semester 2, this year.

It pains me to realize and accept that I may very well start my career at 24 (if I'm lucky) and it'll take years before I can pull myself up to a 6 figure salary. 

I could've graduated in December, last year, had I known what to follow at 18. Thinking about how far I would've gotten by 24 if I had done that is a big source of a lot of my worries these days. 

Anyway, I am contemplating 3 options:

1) Leave university and take up on a 24 week Software Engineering Program by AcademyXi and cut a 3 year study pathway down to less than 6 months

2) Continue studying at University but do a 24 week UX design or Data Analytics Program by AcademyXi to redeem myself from the time I've wasted and start earning in a job that can actually help boost my standing when it's time I have to market myself after graduation 

3) Ignore bootcamps and just do University and accept my circumstances.

I would like you to please guide me on which pathway I should choose, I could really use it :)

My main priorities are uplifting my parents' and younger brother's quality of life. 

As a teenager I wanted to strive towards a life free from the endless shackle of work whilst basking in financial freedom, and somewhere deep down I'm still chasing the delusion that I can earn that life by my mid 20s with CS. 

I don't think that is realistic anymore but maybe I can do something to salvage the time I've wasted.

vb4k7y,"Given 72-hours to complete a programming challenge, what could the challenge be like?","I've made it past the interview at a small-medium sized company in Perth. HR called me today and said they're going to give me a programming challenge that I can complete in 72 hours. I tried to get some more details off her but I guess she didn't know the technical side of things as the Dev manager makes it. She did mention that they'll be 3 choices, one of them had something to do with ""taxation"" the other had something to do with ""trains"". She said I can do them in any language. 

I'm guessing it's a small application based on certain topics (tax, trains etc.) by the sound of things. What else could it be?",2022-06-13 05:11:51
u3765n,Has anyone here done a graduate certificate for Data/business analytics?,"I'm trying to translation into analytics and I already have a bachelor's degree. There are an overwhelming amount of options and I don't completely know what's important. 

Does anyone have any positive/ negative experiences for certs that run online? Money is important so I was looking at the University of Newcastle since I might get a commonwealth supported place.

sat1w9,what rate should I expect as an part time dev (working as a student),"I'm in my final year of university and am interviewing for a few different part time developer roles. The idea is that I work part time as an entry level dev with the potential to go fulltime if there is some mutual benefit. Generally small/medium companies and I'm aiming for backend dev.

I passed the initial phone screen interview for one company into an upcoming proper interview and I want to prepare my pay expectation in case they ask.

What's a reasonable rate? I could imagine it being anywhere between $25/h to $40/h (somewhere between the internship pay to average entry level job pay). It has a technical team of about 6 people (most have been working for over 5-10 years) and it emphasises secure coding practice from what I can tell.

Even if I don't get this particular job; I still want to gain an expectation for what to ask for that ""type"" of company.",2022-01-23 12:54:33

1axukny,Computer Science Major? don't know about future career,"In a Bachelor's Computer Science course, will have to pick a major soon. Games development, AI, Cyber Security, Internet of Things, Software Development and Data Science are options I can choose from. Brief description, skills taught and expected career opportunities for each major here: [https://imgur.com/a/Cazfq0l](https://imgur.com/a/Cazfq0l)

I went with computer science as degree since I thought it seemed fun, but never really gave much thought into what I want to do post graduation. Looking at my options, cybersecurity for e.g. seems pretty cool and relevant, but then a quick google search and I find a lot of discussion that it's: hard, stressful, you can be called in to work at any moment, requires a high degree of communication skills (which I'm not very confident with) Though of course I don't know the differences between Security Consultant, Cyber security penetration tester, Information Security Analyst and Network or systems admin that are listed as career opportunities for that major. 

Games Development seems fun, but I'm worried about the creativity required, and under the impression that entry level jobs are hard to find. Other majors are also interesting, but I don't know quite what to expect. 

My ideal career wouldn't necessarily need to be very exciting or high paying, I'd be happy with something where I'd be confident at what I do (doesn't need a high level of expertise with other areas such as math) and have a lighter schedule. (not 9-5 every day of the week or being called at 2am or working long overtime like some have reported from cybersecurity)

If I could get any advice that breaks down the different career opportunities and can guide me into a suitable major, it'd be much appreciated.",2024-02-23 07:20:06

How would the rates differ for lvl1 vs lvl2 vs lvl3 IT Help Desk Support? I presume the higher levels get paid more. 

What about the hourly rates for Desktop Support Technicians / Field Service Technicians for a multiweek contract for a large office build out on site, would this be a more skilled role or not than IT Help Desk Support? 

Would the going casual contract rate be $40/hr? More? Less? ",2024-02-21 13:29:27
1avjehs,Perth Graduate Roles,"Hey all,  


For those of you who are based in Perth what are some of the better graduate programs? I feel like we have a lot less variety in available graduate roles in comparison to over east with Mining, Banking and Consulting companies(big 4 and other tech consultancies) making up the majority of available roles. Or is it still just too early and a lot of them aren't open yet?  


Small sidenote how are the tech graduate roles in the mining companies for anyone who has done one?",2024-02-20 14:49:29
1augz0i,Delivery Lead vs Test Analyst,"Hi all,

Tl;dr: delivery lead looking to switch to dev work, is taking a role as junior test analyst regression?

Bit of backstory - always been interested in dev work, was a hobby when I was younger, wasn't a viable career path at the time so pursued different avenues, pivoted in 2022 did bootcamp etc brush up on skills. I landed an internship for a company, then they merged with another who outsource a lot of their dev work so I was left without an offer in that capacity. They did have opportunities for a Delivery Lead, and I had already been doing some client liaison stuff so I managed to stumble my way into a delivery lead role.

Been doing that for about 8 months, I don't hate it, but really it's just a bunch of managerial stuff, handling my calendar and client meetings - but they also have me basically running the agile model. I work with multiple teams on multiple projects and am responsible for handling all the ceremonies, doing backlog etc as well as making sure we're on budget. I didn't get back into the field to do this sort of stuff.

I may have an opportunity to make a a move to take a Junior Test Analyst position, similar pay(because I'm inexperienced the DL role doesn't make the big bucks), which I'm heavily considering, which will at least put me in more of a product focused role with some potential to do some coding in the form of automation etc.

Wondering if anyone has done something similar? Love it or hate it? Ultimately I'd want to bridge the gap eventually and land a dev role, but for now I'm happy just being more on the tools. I hate the ambiguity of a DL role, it's just putting out fires and moving on to the next one, I can never tell if my day has been successful really, I'd rather just be assigned tickets and work through them lol, at least that way I can quantify my work.

On the other side of the card I don't want to shoot myself in the foot moving into a role I also may not enjoy, and aware of the opportunity that's been afforded to me in my current position.

Cheers in advance.",2024-02-19 06:51:43
zbsy76,At a crossroads... Need advice pls,"I currently do CS and graduate nxt yr (june/july). I have done a yr long internship as a SWE Intern that ended a few months back. I As next year will be my last year before I graduate I wanted to take this summer off to work on a portfolio and leetcode and just overall get my s\*\*t together outside of my career and academia (i.e. fitness, health wellbeing etc). But my main focus for this summer was going to be leetcode and portfolio because I want to land a graduate role.  However I might have an opportunity to go back to my internship company next month (working full time for 2 months, transferring to part time during uni). If i'm being honest I think it will be quite tough to juggle projects/leetcode and working at the internship company mainly due to reasons external to all of this (other responsibilities not related to any of this), so it really does seem like one or the other. In terms of what is better to land a graduate position, should I go back to work at the internship company or should I work on my personal projects/leetcode/job preparation?",2022-12-03 22:38:25

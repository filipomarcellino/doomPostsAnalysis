1b0zw8v,I am going to run out of money completely in 5 months. I am a 2 year experienced software engineer searching for a job for 9 months and still unemployed..,"How can I get a job ASAP? How do I go from here? What am I doing wrong? What are the next steps that I should take? Here is my progress so far: 
  

  
June-August: 150 companies (1 tech screen)
  
August-November: 178 applications (4 tech screens, 1 onsite) 
  
January-Feb 2024: 319 (2 tech screens)
  
Total:  647
  

  
I am getting interviews but they’re very little in regard to how much I’m applying. I’m using Indeed, linkedin, levels.fyi
  

  

  

  
I’m a Canadian citizen looking to work for roles in the US under the TN status (applying to remote, hybrid, in-person). I don’t really think this affects my hireability because my strategy is to tell them in the end when I passed all interviews that I need sponsorship since at that point i’d have more leverage. I know this isn’t the problem because I haven’t been rejected for being a non-US citizen yet. Additionally, the companies who hire Canadian Software engineers knows its just as easy to hire an American Software engineer due to TN status. Correct me if I’m wrong based on what you know and the current market.",2024-02-27 02:02:13
1be8zvu,unemployed for almost a year.. what to do?,"I’ve been without work since APRIL 2023, and have been actively searching since NOV 2023. During that time I took a break to see family travel and brush up on skills. Ive applied to 300+ job postings with a referral for 5-10% of them. I make sure to reach out to my network, directly reach out to recruiters, and have cover letters for each job. Recruiters cold call and I pick up most, I believe I have had at least 1 HR call a week since NOV. Ive made a portfolio website, 3 personal projects with design/outline guide, and reached out to a tech community to help teach leetcode (for free). However it is now almost a year of being unemployed. I chose not to pick up part time work to focus on job applications/process. I am now thinking of going into part time work 20 - 40 hrs a week.   
Ive reached 3rd or 4th final rounds with 3 companies, where two decided they no longer needed a hire as their business model has changed. Ive been ghosted a bunch or let go after 2 great interviews. It can get discouraging. For reference I live at home with my mother, 23 POC F, and my vague resume is below!   
What do you think given my info & market? I do love full stack engineering and want to pursue CS

1bd2gz0,How AI might be affecting the demand of software engineers,"I recently did a study on how AI might be affecting the demand of software engineers.   
I took a dataset of 20M job postings from big and small startups. I then used a ML classifier to classify each engineering job to the type of engineer it belonged to (ie backend, ML, date, mobile etc). In addition, I extracted the skills listed in each job using entity extraction. I indexed all of this to an elasticsearch cluster when I ran aggregation queries to see how the # of jobs changed for each type of engineer in the past year.  
Here were my findings:  
1) The # of jobs for ML engineers and research scientists increased 70% from a year ago  
2) # of jobs for frontend, mobile and data engineers all dropped 25% from a year ago, while backend engineers did a bit better dropping at 12%  
3) Data scientist jobs and security engineer jobs did a bit better, both declining 5% or so  
4) There seemed to be no correlation between tech layoffs and the demand for more AI engineers/talent.  
I published my findings in more detail in this article: https://bloomberry.com/how-ai-is-disrupting-the-tech-job-market-data-from-20m-job-postings/. Of course correlation != causation but just trying to make sense of the data as best as I could. Everything I wrote is still just an opinion, but backed by some data :) ",2024-03-12 17:06:34
dqtqml,Is Quintrix Solutions job offer legit?,"FYI, updates are in edits.

Hello guys! I'm a long time lurker, first time poster. Sorry for all the mistakes!

I have an Associates in Applied Science in Computer Programming from a technical school. I graduated in April 2018 and have been applying for jobs on and off. 

I landed an internship at a local insurance company April 2018 through April 2019. However, once the internship was up there were no positions available.

Throughout my time applying for jobs I would consistently get screened out for not having a bachelors or enough work experience in programming. I have been feeling down from all of the rejections that I have gotten. 

I applied for jobs on several job networking sites. A recruiter reached out to me after finding my resume on Dice. It was a position as a SalesForce Developer  from Quintrix Solutions. There was a phone interview regarding that was mainly focused on my soft skills. If I remember correctly, they did not ask any technical questions at all. 

The next step was a quantitative aptitude coding test with 10 quantitative, 10 OOP concept, and 4 coding questions. The recruiter stated in the email that they do not expect me to have any experience with coding and that they are mainly looking to see if I can get the majority of the concepts correct. I needed a 50% to pass. I got a 32% with 6 correct in the quantitative and 5 correct in the concepts. However, with that, they wanted to move on the the next step: a contract. 

Which brings me to my question. Is this company legit? What worries me is that there was a lack of them trying to know me. No face-to-face, no additional phone interviews, no email chains. After a brief 20 minute phone interview and a ""failed"" test they offer me a contract. 

Contract details: A) evening and weekday training for 1 week refresher training, 8 week training with maybe an additional 4 weeks if they seem necessary. Candidates are paid about $500 every 4 weeks. B) 1 year contract and if breached, candidates have to pay Quintrix $5,000 back for training. C) when placed with a company, the pay will be $30 an hour with about $62,000 a year. D) location is listed as nationwide. 

I did not see anything about benefits, insurance, relocation assistance, PTO, 401k. I want to be optimistic and hope that this is legit and it will give me the experience I will need for other opportunities  but I am afraid that I am looking at this with rose-tinted glasses. Please share you knowledge with me! Thank you all for your time and consideration!

Pre-Edit: I gave status updates in the comments. After a bit, I could not longer reply/comment so I am just editing my post now.

Edit: May 8th 2020
Hey! With the covid19 and other technical issues (on boarding system is down) I actually haven't started my new job yet. I've been given the ""the start date is delay for another week"" at least 4 times now. I definitely say that communication is lacking both on the Quintrix and Cognizant. It has been a very frustrating experience. 

I don't know if I can provide any insight to the elimination process because they picked 15 candidates for 15 positions. There were some people who did not put in the effort like some others. I would have to say just do your best. If there are any issues/questions/ or delays with turning in your assignment. Reach out to them. Leave a written trail of communication to show that you tried. Just complete all the assignments and pass the test. Some of our candidates didn't pass the test but I haven't heard any news regarding them. 

As for the interview part, they were not organized at all. It was initially supposed to be a phone interview. 10 minutes pass the scheduled time I got a Zoom code via email for the interview. But it was another 10 minutes until the Cognizant interviewer signed in. Now I talked to a few candidates and they had different interviewers and different questions. Some required web cam. I had questions that focus on ALL of the usage of the workflow and process builders. They mainly focus on the small, deep and dirty details on everything versus the overview. Which I have to admit I did not really know the specifics about. They didn't ask OOP questions. For me it was specifically Salesforce questions. If I were to rate the initial interview to the final interview I would have to say the initial was a 2 and the final is a 10. But it might have just been the interviewer that I got because my fellow classmates didn't get the questions that I got.

Edit 2: May 24th 2020
I started my job at Cognizant Monday the 18th. It took them a whole week for a manager to authorize IT to give me my password via phone. 

Our first meeting they iterated, ""Don't be afraid to work overtime. You may need to do that to get up to speed. It doesn't mean that you will be paid, but it will be good for your career.""I still have yet to receive any information though. 

We never had people join our classes. We never had to turn on the webcam. That is really strange. As for the pay, I would definitely ask your recruiter or Alex Hamilton about your pay. They tried to give our training pay late but I kept badgering them for any updates.

Edit 3: June 10th 2020
I ""started"" my job at Cognizant on 5/18/2020. The only thing that I have done so far is complete 4 new hire trainings that were sent to me. There has been no further communication about the next step forward or anything. But I feel like the disarray and unorganization is Cognizant's fault. Quintrix has been almost silent the entire time. 

No one showed us how to complete the timesheets (I asked a classmate who was in an earlier batch.) The timesheets are through Cognizant's portal, and they have to approve it. However, Quintrix asks us to screenshot the timesheets and email it to them lol. Here is where it gets dicey though. Quintrix did not give us the hours that were approved from Cognizant. They did not pay us holiday pay, and some of my classmates worked overtime by attending mandatory weekend trainings. They did not get paid for that. We got paid today so we are still waiting for them to answer our questions.

Edit 4: August 25th 2020
Due to covid19, the project I was assigned to released 4 members of the team due to budget constraints. Fortunately, due to my contract, I am supposed to be paid my normal rate of pay because Quintrix found me a job at Cognizant (therefore I am not benched) but I will double check next pay period.  

The team I was assigned to was very helpful and very nice. There was still an issue of communication but it is not as bad as what I have experienced before. The company I was contracted out to was very organized, the communication issue came from the Cognizant team vs the company team. They threw me into the deep end of the water and told me to swim. It was very challenging but kind of fun and rewarding?

Edit 5: August 4th 2021
Cognizant has offered me a full time position! No pay increase but I get benefits now! They mentioned that I might have to relocate in like 6 months or maybe not at all. I still feel like a junior level programmer but the imposter syndrome is strong. At least now I have my foot in the door with all my experience and I can go elsewhere whenever I want! I have recruiters messaging me on LinkedIn for new opportunities as well but I just signed up for full time so I think I'm going to spend some time with them for now.",2019-11-03 01:20:57
u2u852,I'm the Person That LeetCode is Designed to Weed Out,"I've been studying LeetCode hard for at least a month, but all told I've spent quite a lot of time on it over the years.  I have an interview at Google in 2 weeks.

I've read CTCI.  I purchased Grokking the Coding Interview and I've read/reviewed all the sections.  I have a LeetCode Premium subscription.  I've tried grinding the problems, and I've tried memorizing the problems.  I've tried reverse-engineering by picking patterns and studying the solutions, watching YouTube videos, and reading tutorials.

I get the concepts.  For instance, the Sliding Window pattern: I understand the underlying principle.  You take two pointers and slide a window across the array.  Depending on the nature of the problem, you can also widen/shorten the window and hold/replace data based on the new data that's coming into the window vs the data that's going out.  It makes sense.  I can visualize it.  I understand the pattern.

I can do some easy problems.  But the hard problems?  No way.  Not a chance.  Even quite a few of the medium problems are beyond me.  Like this one, for instance: [https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/)

It's a good candidate for study because it's a medium problem with both sliding window and Google tags, and it has a 100% frequency.  Solid.

I barely understand what they're asking for.  It's paralyzing for me.  I look at the solution in the context of sliding window, and after a few minutes I just wilt because I don't understand how I could ever get there on my own.  I just can't seem to connect the problem to the pattern - and even if I could - I wouldn't know how to implement it.

I'm so depressed thinking that the purpose of LeetCode is to weed out people who don't meet some kind of intellectual threshold, and it's me.  I'm the person these problems are designed to weed out.  I truly hate myself for coming up so far short in this.",2022-04-13 16:27:07
vhilbd,Reminder that sometimes you will just get terrible interviewers.,"I did a final interview with Amazon SDE1 with 3 SDE2s and the hiring manager. 4 of the questions were directly copied from LeetCode so they were incredibly easy to answer and explain. But despite being an SDE1 interview, the last question I was asked was a System Design question. This is after I was told multiple times that I would *not* be asked a System Design question.

1 of my interviewers had no idea how recursion worked and didn't believe my answer to a question was correct because they didn't understand the DFS method. I had to teach this SDE2 how recursion worked in the middle of my interview as well as walk through multiple test cases to show that it worked.

All of my coding interviews ended with the interviewers *telling* me that I arrived at the most optimal answer (after running through multiple test cases) and I correctly identified time and space complexities. 

Well I got my decision today and was told that I was not selected for the roll. Behavioral came back positive but my coding competencies came back mixed.

Honestly I'm not upset about the decision because I know there's nothing I can do to change it, but just a reminder to all of you that you can believe you did well, you can even be *told* you did well, and luck will just not be on your side.",2022-06-21 17:26:47
b8uba6,Stay-at-Home Mother to Software Engineer,"After 2 years at home taking care of my daughter, I finally got my first job, which is also my dream job. I successfully transitioned from a background in economics to become a software engineer. Without previous technical knowledge, I dedicated a year to make the jump. I finished a 6-month bootcamp to learn full stack development at Galvanize. I had the best and most compassionate instructors in town. During the same time, I won 2 hackathons. The first hackathon led to a startup. I competed with my startup in the AngelHack 3-month HACKcelerator and won one of the prizes at Global Demo Day. The second hackathon was with Discover and my team won the $10,000 first prize. The past year has been truly eye-opening. I have met with so many amazing tech enthusiasts and startup founders from all over the world. These people truly inspire me because of their boldness and courage to transform the tech industry. After my bootcamp, I spent 3 - 4 months focused on job searching. After countless rejections, I landed multiple offers at my top choices. Now, I am excited for my next step as a Software Engineer at Nordstrom. It has been my dream since I was little to work in the fashion industry. I am truly grateful for all the help and encouragement that I received along the way. ",2019-04-03 06:13:28

Not only was my position a lie but the leadership is so far removed in the brain they do not particularly see the problem in just assigning random projects that have nothing to do with your skills or education to you. You will be left with a year of wasted time, just go live with your family or something while you try to get your first job.

Also they will try to trap you with a sign on bonus and having to relocate closer to an office even if you WFH because they know ppl would simply just quit immediately. They treat the US branch like step children while trying to force us to work or have meetings during working hours for India. 

Non stop training, this is all they do. You gain nothing from just training and never actually doing anything to use said training but for some reason they think after long hours of training you will be an expert...

dlbdpp,Laid off. Just accepted offer.,"Recently myself and 17 others were restructured out of the large company we worked at, with no warning.

Every meeting with my manager would end that I'm ""doing a good job and I should keep the great work.""

I delivered things early.
I worked hard.
I mentored others.

This is not the first random layoffs they've done.
They happened every few months or every quarter.

The writing was on the wall, they're going through a few transformations, including changing office spaces and looking at offshoring (which they already did once and it went poorly).

I have a family so this has been stressful.  Finances are ok, but you need cash flow to survive long term.

I have been interviewing and doing countless skill tests.
Major thing I was reaffirmed :  no two developers, companies, interviews, tech stacks are the same.

Countless interviews where they're looking for some perfect person who is their magical puzzle piece and somehow codes exactly how they do it, use the same extensions or already know their tech, inside and out, 
It's infuriating.

I'm happy to announce that I've accepted an offer with a competitor for more money, better title, decent vacation and benefits.",2019-10-22 02:36:40
113xcfm,Beware of Cognizant,"I interviewed with this company yesterday, and it was bizarre and unprofessional. Sorry for the long post, but I want to share my experience for people who do their research throughout Reddit.

To give some context, I got accepted into Cognizant’s Java Full Stack Pre-Apprentice Program partnered with Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) in Chicago August 2022 with the promise of an interview once completed. This was meant for non-tech professionals to get their foot in the door within the tech industry. I come from a healthcare background so this sounded like a promising opportunity, and I have done zero research of Cognizant up to this point. Prior to the program I was told the tentative timeline would be that the program ends mid Dec 2022 and within the next week we would interview with Cognizant. Before the program ended we were told they would ask one technical question, and then test our knowledge of OOP and SQL. This seemed fair, and after speaking with past cohorts about their experience, I felt confident in my skills.

Once the program ended, we were told by our program director that interviews would not be until early Jan after persistently emailing them when we would be able to schedule an interview. By this time, I have already been studying on LeetCode and OOP concepts for a couple weeks. After being told it was being delayed, I was angry, disappointed, and burnt out as I was fully prepared to interview in December. Within the following week, we were told interviews were postponed even more due to Cognizant wanting to create a “portal” to assist in the hiring process. I would think they would have known this months in advance and not within weeks, but I digress. The director could not provide a definitive timeline and we were left in the dark about when interviews will actually be conducted.

Finally in February of 2023, we were told we would have to do a Hacker Rank Assessment before we can have an interview. This was never mentioned prior to applying to this program so this was a shock and was frustrating for us all. Not only that, but you had to get a score greater than 70% to be offered an interview, which was not disclosed to us until after we submitted our assessments. The assessment was completely unfair with only 2/3 questions being on topics we reviewed in the bootcamp. The third one was for an HTTP Request and even my boyfriend who is a DevOps engineer complained that that question was not appropriate especially since the program never reviewed HTTP Requests. I felt we were already set up to fail.

I eventually found out I passed the Hacker Rank, and was invited to interview for their Digital Engineering Healthcare Team as a Software Engineer within Cognizant. The email stated, “The digital engineering unit is currently in the process of interviewing resources for future hiring needs.” The wording was confusing as it made it seem like they are not currently hiring, but wanting to create a pool of potential candidates. I figured I can just ask during the interview. Not only that, but we were told we would be in their apprenticeship program being paid to train and eventually be paired with a client. Based on this email, this did not seem like the case.

Cognizant also did not ask for my availability for when I would be free to interview, and just gave me a date and time that worked for them. Luckily, I was free and did not have to reschedule, however, that is not the situation for everybody. I was also told via email that “This is a technical interview so be prepared to answer any questions related to full stack-java, including logic.” With only 48 hours to prepare, needless to say I was stressed and did not have the confidence I was going to perform well.

I had my interview yesterday, and not only was the interviewer unprofessional, he was also uninformed. The interviewer was 15 minutes late, asked if I was currently a Cognizant employee (look at my resume), and then asked about my general experience with Java. No OOP or technical questions at all. He also proceeded to ask, “Do you have any questions? I have a meeting after this.” This comment made me feel rushed and that I was unworthy of his time. Eventually I asked if there was another interview after this to test my technical skills, and he said “no, I do not think so.” I asked for a tentative timeline about when this position starts, and he did not know. He did not know when I would even hear back after this interview. Overall this interview was maybe 10 minutes and with him being late, and with his lack of knowledge of the position, I felt like we wasted both of our times.

I now know Cognizant has a bad reputation, but after hearing the other cohort’s testimonies, I thought the outcome would be different. All in all, if you interview with Cognizant, be apprehensive about what you are interviewing for. Do not let them rush you as your time is just as important as the time they spend with others, and make sure all of your questions are not left unanswered. However, there is a high chance they will not know the answer to your question.

I was not offered a position nor rejected yet, but if they were to extend an offer I would strongly decline based on my experience thus far. Thank god the pre-apprentice program was free.",2023-02-16 18:26:06

 https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/z772ww/just_got_a_pretty_shit_offer_at_a_dream_job

Tldr: I currently make $110k, been interviewing for a dream job for almost 4 months and they offer me $95k.

Update:  
So I took a lot of y'alls advice and I came back at them with the number I wanted, $120k. The guy told me that probably wasn't going to happen but he would talk to people and see what he could do. He ended up coming back the next day with $100k and mentioned the $5k retention bonus they do every year (my current company gives me more than that for our yearly bonuses and the amount also increases every year). I said that wasn't gonna do it and that I'd love to work there but the absolute bare minimum I could take is $115k base salary. He asked if I would take $110k (I assume he meant including the bonus) if he could figure it out and I said no. So I passed on the job. Sucks because it would've been a great opportunity and a fun product to work on but they obviously don't really value my experience. I'll probably start up the job hunt again in the spring.",2022-11-30 20:05:34
cc5bbh,Why whiteboard interviews are terrible and here's how interviews should be conducted.,"The big 4 have popularized white board interviews like never before and people think it's the gold standard on doing interviews. But how many people even currently working at these companies would be able to answer any of these questions months or years after the fact? My guess is basically zero without practicing a lot again at first. 

Because they don't test your fundamentals and what kind of skills you'd be using on the job. It's about memorizing and regurgitating a bunch of leetcode questions and then instantly forgetting everything once you get the job. 

Seriously, think about it. If the senior developers at these companies wouldn't even be able to pass these interviews without extensive practice, that alone should be red flag on the validity of these interviews.

Here's the practical way to construct an interview:

* Ask them about everything they've listed on their resume, they presumably used this to land the interview in the first place, if they can't answer everything they claim to know/worked on on there, that's 100 percent on them
* Ask them questions about stuff they'd actually be working on (rocket science I know)
* Show them a piece of your code base with intentional bugs, ask them to debug through it and fix it using whatever tools they wish
* Show them a piece of code that could be improved in terms of scalability or performance and ask them to do so
* Ask them to implement a very simple feature/addition to some application that's related to whatever role they are being interviewed for

By doing this the interview process is:

* 100 percent fair on both sides, nobody feels like they got cheated or just got lucky
* Practical because any software developer will tell you the points above are what actually consist of their day to day activity, NOT solving triva puzzle questions on the spot with zero tools/help on a whiteboard with some judge glaring at them
* Valuable because even if the candidate fails this kind of interview they now learn which area they need work on as opposed to ""shoot, I should have memorized that puzzle/trivia question too before coming in!""",2019-07-12 03:03:51

I started interviewing at a new company (that I would love to work for) back in August.

I finally got an offer today after several months of interviewing and the guy is telling me how impressed everyone was and how excited they were to have me on their team and then gave me the salary of 95k. Literally the very bottom of their range and 15k less than I make now. If I were going to negotiate I'd want to offer like 120k but that's pretty far from the offer they gave me.

Companies are out to make money and will pay you the minimum they can, you don’t run a successful business by overpaying your employees. The key here is to have a good relationship with your workplace and be polite about it. “I recently interviewed at xyz and they are willing to offer me $xxx. But I like this place, I’m familiar with you guys, and I want to stay here. Can you match them/come close to that figure?” I’ve done it a few times without any repercussions at my workplace.

2. Don’t work unpaid overtime: while some companies are notorious in this regard, there are lots of companies with a good work/life balance. But that doesn’t mean you will be successful if you ALWAYS clock in and out to the minute. Sometimes you need to put in extra time and care into your current task and make sure it’s done well and on time, and that will mean putting in extra effort. You can get by without it, but come promotion/compensation time, your boss will naturally favour the employees who went above expectations in terms of effort and care.

3. Companies don’t care about you: it goes both ways. The main reason you are at the company is because they’re paying you. The main reason the company is paying you is because you are useful to them. That’s how businesses work. Now sometimes companies will pay you more because they don’t want to lose expertise and experience, and sometimes you will accept less pay because you like the company/people/workplace and don’t want the added stress of trying something new. But don’t mistake this for ‘care’ or any other sentiment, this is still a cold hard business decision on both sides.

The post has already gotten long so I will stop here. Just for point of reference to contextualize all this: I have a cs degree, started my first job at $40k, and after 12 years of steady progress, have a job in a large US city with a salary of $200k. And the above is my personal experience, it may not apply to you at all. Thanks for reading, hope this helps.",2018-12-27 20:33:22
840bd7,"My online assessments + technical interview experience with Dropbox, Twitter, Amazon, Box internships (2017-18)","Hi all,

Just wanted to share a bit of my internship interview experience with these big guys. I was rejected from all of them because I overlooked extremely important things mentioned in the tips (likely a result of lack of practice/internalization of these tips). Difficulty of problems, length of interview and type are specified next to company name.


**Dropbox [medium] [90min] [OA]**

Grid Illumination: Given an NxN grid with an array of lamp  coordinates. Each lamp provides illumination to every square on their x axis, every square on their y axis, and every square that lies in their diagonal (think of a Queen in chess). Given an array of query coordinates, determine whether that point is illuminated or not. The catch is when checking a query all lamps adjacent to, or on, that query get turned off. The ranges for the variables/arrays were about: 10^3 < N < 10^9, 10^3 < lamps < 10^9, 10^3 < queries < 10^9.

This problem was quite hard for an internship OA. I got it in first semester freshman year with next to zero coding practice, not to mention reading up CTCI to learn the ""right way"" to solve problems.
Tips: Use time accordingly to plan solution.

**Twitter [easy - medium] [45min/each] [onsite]**

Technical:
1 Given two numbers as strings, output their sum as a string. 

Straightforward. For this question, be careful in the way you handle the carry. Make sure to consider a lot of different cases when testing.

2 Given an array of integers with duplicates, find the int that isn’t a duplicate (this int is guaranteed in the input array). followup: given that your solution will be used as a backend utility function, how to design a return value for invalid inputs?

You can approach it with a straightforward hash map and expect the interviewer to follow up asking for improvement in space complexity (hint: use bit manipulation). For the followup example answers are exception handling mechanisms or constants. I bombed the followup because I simply did not know how to answer it with a lack of design knowledge, but it seems like most of the time interns don't get this kind of questions. 

3 Behavioral: why major, what’s your proudest achievement, talk about a challenge you’ve encountered in group/team setting

Tips: Follow the process strictly but(!) also listen closely and communicate frequently with interviewer. 

**Amazon [easy] [OA x 2 \+ video interview]**

OA1: 

debugging and logical questions (straightforward but time goes by really fast so manage it well!)
OA2\*:

1. amazon fulfillment center, find two boxes whose weight is less or equal to maximum weight

Classic combinatorial optimization, a variant to the knapsack problem.

2. amazon data center, round-robin style access, find average waiting time of all clients

This problem was very hard in the sense that there were a lot of things one needs to keep track of when crafting a solution. You need a crystal clear understanding of the problem and plan your solution meticulously.

\*Rumors say that if you did exceptionally well in OA2 they will skip the last round of interview and give you an offer

1-on-1 video interview [45min]:

Behavioral:

Introduce yourself
Tell me about a project you’ve worked on with a tight time frame and how you got it done on time
General software engineering knowledge:
What is the difference between an array and linked list?
What is a foreign key in database?
What is TCP? How is reliable data transmission implemented?

Technical:

1 Find the nth Fibonacci number

I bombed this question because I tried to recall an optimal bottom-up solution but was blanking out on the details of it. After being stuck for about 10 minutes I had to go back to the basic recursive solution, talked about optimization with memoization but ran out of time to actually implement it. I was sure that this left a bad impression; it showed the interviewer that I was unorganized and hasty by trying to jump to code without thinking through my solution first.

2 Check if a string is palindrome

Straightforward. Make sure you can go beyond the solution using something like reverse()

Tips: Don't pretend to know something that you don't actually. Never, ever try to come up with an optimal solution upfront without being 100% sure how it works and how to explain it. Start by talking about a naive solution and build it up elegantly to better solutions. 

**Box (Security Automation) [easy, specialized] [OA] [90min]**

OA:

1 Check if a string is valid ipv4 or ipv6 address

2 A problem that deals with domain name  

3 Parse the base url from a path

Tips: Familiarize yourself with Python. Know how to use regexp. 


Practice/communication tips:

* Make sure your interviewer understands every step you take
 
* Practice problems, see patterns of best solutions (clean code, high performance) 

* Be highly comfortable and familiar with one coding language (Python recommended because it's used pretty ubiquitously by companies UNLESS if you're interviewing with Amazon because only Java and C++ are allowed for OAs)

Good luck and practice often!

1ade9cj,CV gap of 4 years due to burn out = Not a single interview after months of applying,"I'm a 31yo Canadian, self-taught backend developer with 13 years of experience.

Before leaving my ""last"" job in Q2 2020, I was on edge but in control. But then the pandemic panic was the straw that broke the camel's back, so I left.

Since then, I worked in two different companies (in 2022 and 2023) but fired from both after 3-4 months because I only worked 30h/week instead of 40 for the last 2 weeks due to energy drop. Nonetheless, getting great performance reviews prior to getting fired.

Indeed, I haven't put these 2 jobs on my CV, which now contains a gap of near 4 years.

I worked at 6 different companies before that, and never fired from any.

So in Q3 2023, I got a prescription for ADHD meds, actively applying to jobs since then, but not single interview whatsoever, even tho historically getting hired within 1 month or 2 max.

The last job on my CV was quite an epic home run, which might suggest that I require a huge salary, therefore when combined with my CV gap and having no diploma (high school dropout), making me a too risky candidate to be worth considering.

* Is there some way to mitigate the impact of the 4 years long gap?
* Should I add to my CV the last 2 jobs that I've been fired from? And how can I justify to recruiters?
* That's apparently common to lie on a CV and to recruiters. Never did it myself, but should I?
* Are companies (in Canada) going to hire devs again, and anytime soon?
* Any suggestion so I can at least get interviews?

I'm open to any advice you may have, thanks!",2024-01-28 21:53:34
qde1z8,Recruiter would not let up about current salary,"I must have spoken to 30 recruiters in the last month, most of them ask for current salary, plenty take the hint after I say my required salary in response, a few a push a little further, but after standing my ground up until now none have gone further than a little further and give up quickly.

But this guy just didn't give up, I was enthralled by his insistence and the conversation was going well up until that point so I heard him out and listened to his 2 minute spiel about how it was important for him to know to represent me. After that I told him I'm still not convinced and we can move on or I can hang up... he still would not let it go.

I kept my word of course, shame, what an odd hill for them to die on. I know I'm hardly going to make or break their company but surely I'm worth more than the info of my salary lol.

I have no questions nor advice wanted, just something I found amusing that others may enjoy or relate to.",2021-10-22 10:32:42
dhkvkc,Technical interview burnout,"Need some perspective on whether or not I'm being a whiny little b.

I am extremely bad at technical interviews--admittedly because I don't practice as much as I should. However, I resent the fact that I have to treat technical interview study as basically a third ""job"" in order to even get a CHANCE at getting an interview.

Does this attitude mean I'm not cut out for engineering? Have any of you faced a similar frustration and were able to deal with it in a constructive way?

b1jljl,Am I just too old and stupid?,"Hey all,

I know some of you will say age is not a thing in the CS field, and I partly agree.. if you are one of the few (that I have known) that are just super sharp/smart. I have been in the field 20 years now, I actually do NOT have a degree.. one of the lucky ones (then, not now) that got hired without a concern of a degree because the need to find software developers 20+ years ago was much harder than the need to have a 4+ year degree. Today, obviously anyone in this sub knows that there are literally millions of developers most of which seem to now have masters degrees in the field. So not only am I up against much younger developers with masters degrees, but despite it supposedly being a market where there are way more jobs than developers, I am finding that companies are extremely picky now in hiring. They will go months in many cases without hiring a needed engineer if they cant seem to find that perfect 1% elite developer.

Am I the only one petrified with the job requirements lately? I either see front end engineer (with like mastery of CSS, JS, HTML, React, Angular, and 10 other things), or Full Stack, which now means we have to do the work of what literally was 5 to 7 roles not too long ago, and more so, as I am finding out, if we are not at least pro level in many of the listed needs (e.g. front end React, back end Java, JPA, Database, DevOps, CI/CD, Amazon/Google, Kubernetes, etc) they pass you up without even a chance. 

I feel like in just the past few years, the requirements to be a developer have grown exponentially. I dont know if this is to weed out older developers like myself who have mostly/usually been stuck in one area of the about 10 or so I seem to now need to be an expert in to get a senior role, or if companies are just being ultra cheap in trying to hire a lot less developers to do a ridiculous amount of work. Also, while in some places the pay is crazy ($200K+ for many roles in the SF Bay Area, New York, etc), in most places the pay seems to be based on where the company is HQ'd. So a lot of salaries for what seems like about 70 or so hours a week, are below what I started out with 20 years ago.

Why are developers who are expected to know more and do more being paid less? I mean, not always, like I said, but a lot of the potential jobs I look at pay just a hair more than what a friend of mine who cleans up the city (weeds, sewage, etc). I thought software development was a white collar job, but I am really starting to feel a lot of companies feel because there are so many developers now, its a blue collar position and in most places the pay seems to indicate this.

&#x200B;

Interviews scare me now. I gotta be honest, I have never passed a white board exam. Ever. Any interview that gives me one, I fail at. In 20 years of coding, I have NEVER used any of the leetcode style data algorithm stuff. I know I am not alone in not only disliking but disagreeing with this style interview to ""weed out"" developers. It sucks that despite a fairly comprehensive resume that does indeed have a lot of todays ""desired"" skills, that not doing well on college level academic style problem solving, dictates that I dont land a job. The kicker is, many times I do work through a ""brute force"" way of solving a problem.. but because I dont do some fancy data algorithm stuff and reduce the code, I am basically not capable of writing code. It is to the point now, where I am truly looking at entry level positions to try to land a job so that I dont lose my house and have to uproot my family. Yet, most of what I read here and other forums is ""it sucks, but its the way it is so you gotta do it"". OK.. but I need a few months of many hours a day studying to even potentially learn some of this stuff, and I dont have months left before I am in a world of shit financially. I also dont have the option to move my family across the country or world right now, so am stuck in an area that has a much smaller offering of jobs, most of which are using languages I dont know (ruby, .net, python, etc) and to add insult to injury, for whatever reason there is not ONE JOB that would consider hiring someone and letting them learn the language on the job. If you dont have the skills to hit the ground running, someone else does so you are ass out, despite that you may have many of the other skills/experience needed.

&#x200B;

What really tears me up right now is I need a certain amount of money coming in every month to keep my basic lifestyle. Not rich by any means, but years ago when I was lucky enough to have a decent salary and bought a home, plus kids that drive, etc.. the bills add up. I am trying to figure out if I should sell my home or consider a possible loan/equity against it to try to stay in my home in hopes I land a job in the next few months. I dont even have retirement at this point as I liquidated what little 401K I had a few years ago when I was in a similar situation.. to save my house. So not only am I getting older, but I have no retirement to speak of and am thinking how the hell am I going to be able to work the rest of my life if as I get older, I seemingly get stupider and cant land a job?

&#x200B;

I am not one to cry.. but man, sometimes, especially after an interview and hear back no go, it takes a whopping lot of effort to keep my shit together. ",2019-03-15 20:12:36

ypqf3w,"Had an interview with google, it didnt go well.","So I have been doing this for a very long time. I am very good at my job but I do not do interviews really well. I prepped for the algo for about 2 hours. I watched a couple of videos and did a couple of other things.

I am an embedded programmer so the one thing I definitely know how to do is a circular buffer. But when he asked I kind of froze up as usual because gasp I dont like interviews. But I kinda hammered out a solution. Then he was like why dont you use modulus and I said because it is inefficient when compiled. And he said what if the compiler made it efficient. I was like thats not a thing. Then we ran out of time.

I just got a call from the recruiter saying that I was not technically proficient enough for them. And I am like okay whatever. But your interviewer was wrong. I ended up emailing the interviewer with a quote on why modulus in circular buffers is not as good as just limit checking the ends. I am sure I burnt that bridge. Oh well, at least I still have a good job. :D",2022-11-08 16:00:21
x4mm1v,Frustrating junior developer - how can I not let them bother me?,"&#x200B;

I've been working with a junior developer for about nine months.

&#x200B;

This person cannot complete the simplest assignments - when a ticket comes in from a customer, they let the ticket just sit there for WEEKS before taking any action.

&#x200B;

In the process of completing a piece of work:

&#x200B;

1. read the ticket
2. understand what the ticket is asking for
3. find the part of the codebase that controls that behavior
4. figure out how to change that behavior to accomplish the ticket
5. unit and manual testing

&#x200B;

They rarely seem to get past step 1 or 2.

&#x200B;

I try hard to assign them tickets that will increase their knowledge of the codebase and encourage them to try and get things done without putting them in a position where there is ever any serious pressure if they mess up. However, they seem to feel that any work assigned to them is an undue burden and never feel any desire or impulse to get anything done. 

They never seem to retain any knowledge - I can write so many long documents explaining how to do things, but they seem to, even after all this time, barely be able to log in to our app or manage their development environment, let alone do anything after that. They appear to retain no knowledge from previous tickets, and generally ignore my advice ""this ticket will be easier if you use this kind of database column"". Then, months later, I say ""ok, we use that database column you made a few months ago -"" crickets. They didn't remember it. I guess if you never do any of your own work, why would you remember any details about it?

&#x200B;

We're all full remote, and to me it looks like this developer works for about an hour and a half a day, producing work of low quality. If I ever try to explain to them the many different approaches they could take to shipping simple features, they get irritated and accumulate no information whatsoever.

&#x200B;

During screenshares, though they appear to know how to use git, they seem utterly clueless with regard to the architecture of a PHP application, debugging, or how to build anything from scratch.

&#x200B;

Generally, during their standups, they just mention a bunch of tickets by name, and seem to spend more time obsessing over the pedantics of how work is categorized into tickets rather than actually writing any code or doing anything.

&#x200B;

I've discussed my concerns about their poor performance and lack of improvement with my boss, who, because this person offers much-needed d1v3rs1ty, has absolutely no expectations about their performance whatsoever. They are being paid to take credit for things that I do for them, because they never bother to finish even the simplest task.

&#x200B;

This person supposedly has such great academic credentials - much better than mine - that I am baffled at how they can appear to be so incompetent. Are they refusing to work because they realize they don't have to? Or do they hate software development generally? Or are they genuinely just this incapable? What is the incapable-unwilling breakdown - 70% incapable, 30% unwilling? or 80% unwilling, 20% incapable?

&#x200B;

Anyway, there's literally nothing I can do. Even though I am doing this person's job for them, which is to make them appear as if they are a contributing member of the team , they are incredibly cold to me. Maybe I was a little too flippant while explaining things? But when someone asks you how to do the same thing over, and over, and over and never seems to learn...

&#x200B;

Anyone been in this position? It just feels unfair to me that this person is getting paid when they money could have gone to someone who could actually contribute to our team, or you know, the budget could have gone to a different department and hired someone who really needed the money instead of a spoiled person who appears to have barely had a job before in their lives.

tholt3,"I'm a self-taught programmer that started programming 13 years ago. I want to try turning it into a career, but I have no idea where to start. Would someone be willing to help me?","I have some code on GitHub, although I could put more up there. I'm pretty knowledgeable about computer programming, and am confident in my abilities in Python, C#, C++, and maybe Rust (Just started this one). I can easily pick up Javascript or Lua as I've used them in the past. I'm pretty sure I could write C code as I've definitely played around with procedural programming. I consider myself a decent programmer as well. I'm able to reason about my programs really well, I'm able to write algorithms to solve problems that I'm struggling with, I know how to turn requirements into code, I know how to read and write documentation for my code, I use descriptive variable names, consistent conventions, etc. etc. I've studied the art for over a decade now, so I consider myself fairly proficient.

That being said, I've just been so obsessed with programming and learning about programming itself that I've never actually dedicated any time to pursuing a career in programming, or even entertaining the idea of schooling (I live in the U.S. and can't afford it). (Disclaimer: there was some time that I spent homeless during 13 years, so maybe only 10-11 count towards developing my skills.)

I don't want to get into to many details about my life, but I'm in a much more stable place now, and I would like to try out a programming career. I just really have no clue where to start, who to talk to, what to do, or how to do it. I won't lie, I have had an obsession with computer programming ever since I discovered it. I don't mean metaphorically, I mean in the ""this is crippling my life"" sense. I have not pursued friendships, I have not pursued love, I have not pursued money. All I have ever wanted to do in life is write code. Even when I take breaks from writing code (which I have to otherwise I have trouble sleeping), I can't stop thinking about code.

I'm not saying this so that you think ""Wow, this guy must really know his stuff"". I'm saying that I have an unhealthy obsession with my keyboard.

Recently, I've been playing with the idea of taking these skills I have learned and utilizing it to make money. I've done a little freelancing, but I didn't really know how to get clients so it was hard to get jobs, despite getting 5 star reviews on the jobs that I did do.

So the picture that I'm trying to paint here is that my dilemma is that I know how to write code, but I don't know how to write code for money. I was hoping I could find someone to guide me through the process. Or a mentor of some sort. Someone that could guide me through it, be a friend, and give me advice along the way.",2022-03-19 05:39:30

I'm in a really difficult place because I can barely work up the motivation to wake up and continue to solve the same recurring coding tasks that seem to come up on nearly every project I've ever worked on. I've considered looking for jobs that may be more interesting, but I know that this is a pipedream because virtually all companies are making CRUD applications and there is little ""interesting"" work being done at most companies, nor would I qualify to work on projects that require advanced specialized knowledge such as AI or anything like that.

digvrr,Should I stay a programmer? What else is there?,"I am 33 and recently left my programming job of 7 years. I'm currently interviewing poorly at companies in my area. I'm finding that I am not good at coding questions, since my career has often focused on higher-level abstractions in web applications where the data/access patterns made using obscure data structures/algorithms unnecessary.

I'm worried because even if I manage to finally nail the multiple parts of a technical interview to get hired, I'm not a passionate programmer. I like coding, but I don't love it; I don't generally stay up to date on the latest versions of libraries or frameworks, or look for new patterns, or have personal projects, or contribute to open source, or any of that. I want to work 8 hours and go home and relax. But I've been thinking that maybe what I want isn't possible in this industry.

I'm wondering what career I could move to that would allow such a work-life pattern, where I don't need to prove in an interview I have skills the company probably doesn't need and I don't need to spend all my free time essentially doing more work. All the stuff I've looked at says to go into management or similar, but I suspect that's even more stressful.

Does anyone have any ideas?

**EDIT**

Not sure if anyone was really waiting for an update, but I'm happy to report I finally got an offer for a new programming job. One of the reasons, I think, is because their interview process was fairly different from what I've come to expect in the industry. They seemed more interested in direct application of things ('how would I use OAuth?'), and they feel that finding a person with the right attitude is more important than someone with the right knowledge since the rest is teachable. I didn't actually write any code in the interview, which I was surprised by. I think the difference comes in part from being a non-software company (they do shipping logistics).

9s63xj,Am I supposed to like my job?," I just finished undergrad back in May and since June I’ve been working for a small office of a large tech company. The benefits are decent, the pay is alright and the people I’m working with are nice, but I find my software job to be soul-crushing. Every weekday morning, I lay in bed for up to an hour debating if I actually have to wake up to head into work for the day. Once I get into the office, I pour myself some coffee and stare at a screen for 8hrs only to be interrupted for meetings, lunch, and occasional conversations. Everyday, I put on a happy face and I pretend that I like to be at my company, but constant frustration at fixing hard-to-track bugs, and a deep-seated feeling of wasting my life sends me into a spiral by the end of the day. I often find that my brain shuts off a few hours before the end of the workday and I end up staring at my screen, pretending to type and scroll, while the clocks ticks down toward my time to head out. I had always thought I’d enjoy this field. I like problem solving, I’ve always liked playing with electronics, and I know this profession is a good way to make a semi-comfortable living, but the tedium of the normal workday is making me question my ability to succeed. In college, my nearly masochistic will to metaphorically pound my head against my desk until I can figure out a solution seems to have evaporated leaving me with nothing but anxiety. Even if I emerge from tunnel of debugging after spending hours on a problem, the excitement is short-lived.",2018-10-28 19:48:59

199akp4,Software Engineer Interview at Canonical,"*TLDR: As mentioned already by a lot of people, don’t waste your time, just apply elsewhere. Canonical is not worth it. In my case one of the interviewer was just a complete jerk.* 

&#x200B;

My review is mainly influenced by the length of the process and the unacceptable behavior of one interviewer. 

The interview process took over **6 months**. Here is the detailed process I had to go through:

* First you need to write an essay answering \~30 questions.
* Then you need to do an aptitude test
* Then you must complete a technical challenge

In between those steps, you can count 1-1.5 months. If there are holidays, you will wait more. By the time I got the questions, I already thought they had rejected/ghosted me. The questions were interesting, the aptitude test was just pure bs and the technical challenge was fun.

* If you pass everything, you will have 3 ""early stage"" interviews scheduled with potential future team members:
   * One about the system you will be working on,
   * One about your social skills,
   * One specialized for the programming language that you will be working with

In my case, the two first ones were really cool and instructive. The interviewers were kind and you could feel that they wanted to help you, prepare you for the round and teach you the things you didn’t know. The last one was a disaster: the guy was very arrogant, a sarcastic know-it-all and just trolled me. I felt very uncomfortable with him and he was giving me bad vibes. In my view it’s totally unacceptable to treat someone that doesn’t know something, or knows less, like he did. To be honest, at that point I knew I didn’t want to work with him. I had prepared some questions to ask him at the end of the interview, in my view they were open ended so he could talk, elaborate, and we could have an interesting discussion (one about C++ build tools, one about a SW design decision they took in their codebase and one about challenges he faced during his years as a dev). But the guy just answered with a small empty sentence for each, not interested at all. It really felt as if he was wasting his time talking to me, because he’s so superior to me. For some answers to my questions, what he said was even complete rubbish! (""meson is not for building C++"") Or he was just trolling me. To me, that’s just an antisocial and immature college dorm attitude, not the one that a lead dev and maintainer should have.

* After those interviews normally you will get to the ""late stage"" interviews: again a round of 3-5 interviews. The last one may be with Mark, the CEO (fun fact: I got an email from him before the early interviews that contained *""\[...\] All of this means that the team has to be technically exceptional \[...\] and also socially well adjusted. \[...\]""*).

But I didn't make it there. 3 weeks after those ""early stage"" interviews I first got an email that said it was holidays seasons so everybody was on vacation and we shouldn't inquire about the status of our application. Then a couple of days later, I got the rejection email without any concrete feedback. I mean, that’s just another totally disrespectful thing to do: at least give the candidate something constructive. I’ve been in it for 6 months! 

And guess what, a couple of days later, they want a feedback from me!

As many also pointed out, Canonical will employ you as a contractor in most countries and their pay is just not worth it. Look it up on levels.fyi look it up here. **Overall the whole process is not worth it and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. Go and work on fun things elsewhere where you’re better paid and respected.**

*Fun note: This review was suspiciously removed from Glassdoor more than one month after it had been submitted, claiming I shouldn't mention the seniority of the people who interviewed me. Only if they are at the C level. But many people have done it and still do it...*",2024-01-17 23:01:54
w7tmcf,Pro Tip: Low/No-Code tools won't improve your development skills,"Just a pet peeve of mine when I read marketing material from no/low-code platforms.  

Yes, these tools are great for creating commodity applications quickly and cheaply.  However, learning these tools provide very little career development value to the individual using them... they will not teach you generally marketable skills the same way learning a language, framework, or doing any sort of real development will.  Your market value will be tightly bound to the success of that no-code platform.  If you want to go on to do big, amazing things in software, don't take positions now that force you to use them.

ud3ndj,"Having trouble getting hired in what is supposed to be a ""hot"" job market?","You're not alone. The reality is that for many job seekers getting hired is still a struggle even in this ""hot"" job market. They apply for dozens of positions and hear nothing. Or they get an initial interview and never move forward. Here are five things you can do to increase your chances of getting hired:

\#1 - Start or Join a Project

You already learned to code, or you're in the process of learning right now. As you'll see in my article about hiring developers, I encourage business owners to hire developers who are passionate about what they do. My dirty little secret? I would write software for the rest of my life, even if no one ever paid me another dime. If you're truly passionate about writing software, then you feel the same way, so why aren't you actually writing software?

Too many people think they need to have some big, complex project -- or, someone else assigning them tasks. Trust me, when you start working for someone and they're assigning you tasks all day you'll wish you had weeks of freedom to do whatever you want. Take advantage of that now! 

\#2 - Initiating a Creative Project

Have you had a business idea that you have thought of for years, and never got started on it? Give it a try! Think about existing products that you'd like to make ""suck less"" and just go for it. This is the best stage in the world to be in, you can't fail! Challenge Google's dominance in the search engine market. It's not necessarily about how well it works, it's more about what you learn in the process.

Interested in the Internet of Things? Take a dive into the Beaglebone Black for $55. This is a computer that fits inside an Altoids case. If you can't think of something interesting to do with that, just go be a chef! (Ok, or you can go to the Capes page, which will give you enough add-ons that you can create your own chef!)

The path couldn't be easier for those wanting to do app development. Walk to your local grocery store and you're likely to hear 3 new app ideas. Go create them. You aren't worried about success or failure, you're looking for a way to give yourself a focused purpose that lets you explore some aspect of computer science for its learning experience. If it works so well that you're making thousands per day in the app store, then you've solved your own job problem and can start hiring others!

There are a thousand terrible web apps waiting to be improved. Write a time tracker, or create a catalog for your favorite collectibles. There are a lot of existing APIs with tons of data that you can use. Take a look at ProgrammableWeb to see some of the APIs available and come up with ideas of what you can do with all that data.

\#3 - When You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em!

Sometimes it's difficult to come up with a new project, but you just need to dig in and do something. There are plenty of open-source projects that are looking for developers. This is an easy one for me because if I had free time I would pick up about a dozen of these projects myself. Content Management Systems like Drupal or WordPress have lots of Open-source modules that are in desperate need of your coding skills.

Enjoy doing 3D work, how about jumping in to help a great resource called Blender. They even have a page to help new developers get started. Looking for more engineering-type problems to solve, go find a Linux kernel driver that is getting a lot of complaints online or a device you own yourself that's having issues.

\#4 - Line Up the Resources

Web Developers - Setup an Amazon EC2 cloud instance under the free tier. Or find a cheap hosting solution. You don't care about bandwidth right now, you just need SSH access and a couple of gigabytes to start your project. 

If you're thinking about IoT, but need something a little easier than the BeagleBone Black, then take a look at the Raspberry Pi for $35. The coding language is a little simpler, but if you're more mechanical engineer than software engineer, there are a lot of hardware extensions that will let you experiment. You can even search the Internet for other ideas and try to recreate them. Remember, it's all about learning, so your idea doesn't have to be unique, the world over.

Whether your code is for web, Windows, Linux, mobile, or something completely different, there are some great common places to host your source code. GitHub is probably chief among them, if for no other reason than that they're popular and employers will know how to find your code there easily. It's free to host Open source projects, and if you want employers to see your code then it should be Open-source anyway. Besides helping present your source code, GitHub will help you learn how to revise your source code with a tool called git. One more notch to add to your resume and one more skill that will be uber helpful to your new employer.

\#5 - Don't Wait!

This I can't stress enough. Even if you can't do anything else, set up a profile on Upwork, or one of the other software freelance sites. It will take some work to set up a profile, but show future employers that you have initiative. In fact, you might even find your future employer after you've worked a few jobs for them online first. It's not uncommon to get hired into a company on a job that first started out as a simple freelancer position.

Another basic way to get started is to begin reading the topics on StackOverflow. There are some really brilliant people who are active on that site and you can learn a lot of insight about your language or platform just by reading the questions and answers of others. In fact, you might even run into a few questions that give you some ideas for what project you can start.

When you get started with these things online, focus less on the money and more on getting some experience. The biggest part of all of this is that you're working on real projects and that's really valuable to an employer. When employers see that you're so passionate about software that you're doing it on your own, your resume will start to turn heads. But by that time, you may have already accidentally started your own billion-dollar enterprise.",2022-04-27 13:31:15

x029uq,Current manager has blocked 4 internal offers so far. Do I keep fighting or resign?,"The title says it all. I am a computer science graduate and web and Android developer. I have got good development skills and have the potential to be really good at my craft. I landed my first job (Corporate IT) in February 2020, and in November, I was transferred to the department I'm in now. I was told I'd eventually get into the development work on this project, but two years in I am still doing tech support. I'm talking unblocking user accounts, editing documents and spreadsheets and supporting the actual developer team with things like internet access. Tasks where my CS degree and coding skills are not utilised at all. In addition to this, I have been denied a raise for over a year, but they keep hiring external staff for me to report to, making maybe twice as much as I am but doing exactly what I am doing.

The company I work in is good for this country, and I've gotten a chance to work with lots of teams in my time here. My work has been good enough that this year alone, I have received 4 offers from 3 different teams that I have worked with. We agree on my pay, roles, etc and then they just ghost me. I found out this week that when these hiring managers come to inform my manager of their interest, they are asked to back off to the point of threats and statements like 'I am not going anywhere'. My manager is a pretty important person in this company, so these hiring managers usually just back off so they won't risk their own jobs.

I have tried to balance by working during the day and coding in the night, but many days I log off at 7pm, and also have deployments in the night between 11pm until 2 to 4am, depending on what it is. These deployments are an average of 3 a week. I am exhausted and very worried for my career.

Should I resign completely, 'quiet quit' or start trouble and keep fighting for these transfers?

TLDR:

Developer stuck in tech support and manager blocking offers to internal developer roles in other departments. Need advice.",2022-08-28 18:25:40

t8ljz5,Adobe vs Apple Internship,"Yes, I know Apple is part of FAANG but hear me out on my situation first. Also note that this will be my last internship so I'm looking forward to getting a return offer from them.

Apple

Team: Internal Tools Team

* $45/hr, Cupertino
* 2 interns, 2 engineers, in late 20s
* most likely going to be in-person or hybrid internship since Apple is big on privacy
* Return offer is like 70% chance since their expectations are very high but doable if I majorly kiss ass
* New grad return offer tc (bay area): 160k-175k
* Tech stack: Not sure but I know it's web based team with a front-end and back-end engineer. Was told they use JavaScript and React though

Adobe

Team: Adobe Analytics Cloud

* $51/hr, based in Utah but flexible on letting me work from any office (Bay Area, LA, Seattle, etc.)
* 1 intern (just me), 3 engineers, older with families and generally super chill and nice people
* Completely remote internship with $8k bonus for whatever I need
* Return offer is almost guaranteed and their expectations aren't too high
* New grad return offer tc (bay area): 170k-190k
* Tech stack: Full stack dev, Java, Scala, React, Kubernates, Kafka, APIs...
* Pro: My team seems to really like me, specifically my engineering director. I feel like since their expectations are a little lower I could shine here and possibly get promoted faster(?) if I put in around the same effort as I would at Apple.

Benefits comparison: [https://www.levels.fyi/benefits/?companies=Apple,Adobe](https://www.levels.fyi/benefits/?companies=Apple,Adobe)

Benefits breakdown:

* Both have great ESPP with Adobe's allowing 25% of base salary contribution and Apple's 15%
* Adobe gives Free lunch and dinner, Apple does not (it says dinner but that's only for HWE and after 7PM)
* Adobe allows remote work, Apple will go in person in April
* Other than that, around the same benefits

So my dilemma is that in all honesty, I'm tired of grinding and I kind of want to cruise. However, since I got Apple I finally felt this spark that I ""made it."" A lot of people keep telling me that I should go for Apple because it's part of a FAANG, that it will help open doors for me in the future, and because it's really hard to get a job at Apple. However, I feel like the same applies for Adobe. You don't see many SWEs at Adobe, it's a software first company (Apple is a hardware first), pay is better, and you work remotely.

At Apple, I feel like if I worked there I'd be walking on eggshells most days. My manager seems really nice but I don't work with them directly.  At Adobe my team seems very warm and welcoming. I have a good relationship with the director of my group and my direct engineer is an older man who seems nice and laid back. Additionally, my Adobe director said they're very open to letting me wear many hats and that if by the end of the internship I want to pursue, for example, Product Management they'd fully support me. Apparently they had helped the last intern transition into a PM role after realizing they didn't like coding.

Overall, I don't know if I'm letting my feelings get in the way of my career decisions. I feel like with Adobe I could have a chill summer and a return offer. However, with Apple I feel like I'll be grinding again for a return offer but the outcome is having FAANG  on my resume and standing out more to recruiters. Apple seems like the obvious route for my career but Adobe just seems safer. Am I being stupid? I can't tell if I'm considering the ""easier route"" of interning with Adobe because I'm burnt out or if it's truly the better offer.

Yes, I’m asking about tech jobs in particular.  

Yes, I really want you to answer.  I want a list of places that subjectively don’t suck. Enough places it would take me some time to get through them all.  I’ve had it good at work before. I want it good again. 

So…

I want to know about any places where the majority of devs would characterize their employer as a nice place to work… that’s mainly it.  On any given day, you close your eyes, and a disembodied voice comes from a part of your computer that doesn’t have speakers: “hey there.  How ya feeling?” it asks in an overly-friendly Me Too unaware baritone .  And before you can think, you respond “not too bad, disembodied voice.  Not too bad indeed.”

If there is a place you no longer work and you bitterly regret your decision to leave, I’d like to know about that place too.  I will tell them you say hi.

If a place is a hornets nest of entertaining politics and drama, but the primary effect it has on you and your colleagues mental health is massive entertainment, I might want to hear about that as well. 

…

Really what I’m asking is for you to forgot about pay and perks for a minute  and tell me the places that made you feel good about yourself…",2022-02-17 09:50:51

7z3f40,"Employer perspective, why are so many candidates terrible?","Kind of a rant... I've been on both sides of the hiring fence. From what I've seen, the main driving force behind the gauntlet interview process we've all been through is an extreme amount of ""resume spam"". 

I don't get it. I've been part of hiring in other fields and the signal to noise ratio for competent hires is usually 1/10 or better. When hiring for CS, even at small unknown companies, at least 80% of people we phone screen know nothing about programming. I can't reason why this is the case.

We put together a list of phone screen questions that we've ranked as a team from extremely easy to hard. The easiest ones are things like ""what's the difference between a function and a variable"".  And ""how many bits are in a byte"". Over half the people we screen don't make it past a handful of these questions.

This is why you never see advertisements for junior programmers. Whenever we post a junior position, 99% of applicants, maybe more, have followed a JS tutorial or two but can't write any code. There's so much resume spam from clueless people that it's not even worth sorting through.

So my tip to people looking for their first jobs in the field. Don't apply for junior roles. The best junior candidates think they could swing a non-junior position and these are the few that actually get the inivisble junior roles.

I think it's because it's so easy to get started in the field. A ton of people do a couple tutorials and think they can walk right in. If anyone has a better theory and a way to filter these people let me know. It's a huge burden on our hiring team and makes the interview process hell for competent candidates",2018-02-21 06:11:31

qqjhxi,Career Advice from discussion with a Senior Google Engineer,"Hey all! A few weekends ago, I had the change to have long discussion with Jason Mayes, who is the Senior Dev Advocate for TensorFlow.JS at Google. Jason's journey on how he reached Google and eventually became a Dev Advocate for TensorFlow.JS is quite different than the one I'm used to reading. Jason was hired into Google purely because of his skills.

I tried to distil this discussion on some lessons I can apply to my future career as well.

## Carve out your own path in life

After graduating from University, Jason worked for a day at a big bank before realizing it wasn't for him. He decided to join an early stage startup instead, where he was able to explore his creativity, by working on UX, photography, 3D-modelling and Digital Marketing, amongst a lot of other things.

This is what he recommends new graduates and early career professionals as well. Join an early stage startup so you get more freedom over what you want to pursue, while being in an environment conducive of exploration.

After taking up roles and projects which showcased his creative side, he left his startup job to found a consultancy, to build creative solutions for his clients. Google's ""Creative Innovation"" eventually took notice of his talents and decided to take him on. There, they utilized the latest web technologies to build creative technically impressive demos for Google's various clients. Jason then climbed the ranks of Google throughout the years to eventually become the Sr. Developer Advocate for Tensorflow.JS

You can work on a narrowed field but also try to go wider or work in a multi-disciplinary role.

>*Leave the job you don't enjoy doing stuff at*

For example, if you can code but music is something you love doing - you can combine these two skills and make something out of it like a project or join a company that's trying to do something similar in that space.

### An Interesting Answer for the Q: How to start in Machine Learning (or any other field)?

Firstly, try to leverage all of the available no-code and low code solutions to find the limitations of existing technologies. Eg, a browser based object detection model might recognize both the water bottle and the hand holding the bottle as a ""bottle"".

Once you are aware of these limitations and have some ideas on how we can improve on them, you become a good candidate for hiring.

And most importantly, the main takeaway that I took from this conversation with Jason was the importance of career capital and compounding. Let me explain in brief what I mean.

Instead of trying to game the system, try to focus on your skills and try to become the best at what you have a natural aptitude for. At the start, your role may seem generic and undirected, but as time progresses, you are pulled towards fields where there's a natural need for your skills. These skills also compound, since over the years, you can keep finding new and more innovative ways to do what you do better.

In Jason's case, in retrospect, I saw his natural skills towards being a Creative Engineer. Even though he started with a more generic startup role, by focusing on his creative skills, he eventually took the notice of Google, where his talent was eventually pulled towards being a Developer Advocate, even though that might not have been the specific goal he had in his mind.

Similarly, we can also utilize career capital and compounding in our lives to be pulled into fields where our natural abilities (which we actively work on) are valued.

aviotv,"Please, if giving a candidate a code test, please take a look at his public code first to decide if it’s really needed.","I’m a freelancer and I probably do more code tests than your average joe. I also host all of them publicly on my GitHub. 

I must have about ten of these laying about. Each one is a full application or package done to a professional standard. Most of them are simple Flask/Django applications depending on Celery; because that’s what most take home Python code tests end up being. 

Sometimes I get approached by companies saying “we saw your GitHub... would you fancy an interview”, and after a successful phone interview I get handed another code test!

This is beginning to strike me as absurd. I’ve been a professional for over 6 years. I’ve worked for some interesting places. But you’re handing me tasks that I’d trust a junior developer to handle.

I appreciate that determining if someone can code at all filters out a worryingly large number of people. However, in my experience (and I have been on the other end of this) they: tend not to have public and practicable examples of what they’ve done in the past; and they have difficulty giving good answers about how they solved past problems.

18a64vn,It Finally Happened. I finally got my first internship.,"Third year at a flagship state school studying CS with no prior internship or software development experience (but some warehouse experience with electrical assembly and bare-bones digital logic work). I would consider myself incredibly average as far as my programming abilities; some small scale Arduino and raspberry pi projects, some system level C, some knowledge of Java and OOP principles, and basic HTML/CSS. I have done projects in every aforementioned language (all \~1000 lines or less), and 60% of my resume consisted of these projects. Been trying to get an internship for months (ever since August this year) and sent out around 200 applications with cover letters whenever I could. I got rejected and or ghosted from nearly every single one and It was honestly really jading getting nothing from all that effort. I was starting to get really down in the dumps worried about my future.  


Feelings of doubt and impostor syndrome were really creeping up on me, and then out of the blue this week I got an offer from a biomedical firm for an internship doing embedded systems and then 2 days after a spring co-op offer for an IT position at a vehicle company who's product you've most likely seen today. Both of these are in office, 40 hours a week and about \~1hr drive away but would probably provide invaluable experience so I'm more than happy to do a commute for the time being, so I accepted both.  


I was barely expecting to get 1 internship this year, let alone get 2 and both at companies you could arguably say I would have had dreams about working for. I'm still in shock and it was starting to feel like it would never happen, but here we are.If someone as plain as me can do it, so can literally anyone else as long as they give it their best shot.  


Good luck everyone on your internship and career hunt and thank you for listening to a stranger's perils.  


TLDR; I finally got my first time internship, and was really surprised by what I ended up getting.",2023-12-03 23:08:29
14qpqix,6 Mistakes to Avoid when Preparing for Coding Interviews,"Disclaimer: I’m the person building a tool which helps people learn how to avoid these mistakes.

1. Not putting in the time
    
    It seems like an obvious pitfall to avoid, but you’d be surprised how many candidates make this mistake. If you’re serious about preparing for interviews, you need to put in the time. Some individuals choose not to invest the necessary time, but the reward makes it well worth the effort. Think about it this way, securing an offer can lead you to an average pay increase of $20,000 or even more, especially if competing offers are in play. Treat your interview preparation as an investment in your future. Besides, if you fail an interview, most companies will require you to wait for another 6 months before they consider your application again. 
    
    The amount of time needed to practice varies for different roles, but at least devote extra time to truly understand the starting easy problems for each topic in the tool I’m building. Subsequent problems use a similar pattern to solve, so they become easier once you’ve grasped the initial concept. Aim to get to a point where you can assess most problems quickly and efficiently. This could look like receiving and evaluating the problem and almost immediately being able to come up with 1-2 different approaches.  
    
2. Memorizing answers
    
    Although it’s tempting to search up a company’s list of interview questions and memorize dozens of interview questions, this approach often leads to failure. Interviewers ask open-ended questions or nuanced follow-up questions to assess your problem-solving skills, so they’ll notice if you’re not able to explain your thought process well. 
    
3. Not practicing with a plan
    
    If you’re just doing random Leetcode questions, you’ll likely overwhelm yourself and after struggling for the second or third question, you may become so demotivated that you’ll procrastinate from prepping until a couple days before the actual interview. This is why many candidates end up struggling during interviews — they didn’t prepare with a strategy. Each interview question can be systematically solved, so as long as you understand and can identify the general pattern of how to solve these problems, you’ll be able to work your way toward a functional solution in the context of that problem. This is exactly why I’m building this tool, to help you learn the *patterns* of how to solve coding problems so you can strategically approach questions in a way that will allow you to articulate your reasoning well. It groups problems with similar solutions together, so you can familiarize and practice the same approach with different questions.
    
4. Not understanding your own plan before coding
    
    When under the time pressure, some interviewees hastily dive into coding a solution without a thought-out plan. They end up making mistakes, wasting precious implementation time, and not completely providing a working solution. To avoid this, take the time to thoroughly understand the question by considering edge cases, identifying a simple input/output test case, and then explaining your approach as if you’re explaining it to a child. The solution should be simple to understand, so both you and your interviewer know what direction your solution will take. Verbalizing your approach will also allow you, or even your interviewer, to identify potential flaws in your solution. This is why, before writing the code, the tool encourages you to think of potential clarifying questions as well as the output of an example test case.
    
5. Refactoring the solution before finishing implementing it 
    
    It’s always best to first provide an explanation of a naive solution before thinking of a more optimal solution. If you’re not able to think of a more optimal approach, then take 5-10 minutes to write the naive solution so you at least have ****some**** working implementation. Once you begin to write your implementation, try not to focus too much on optimizing or improving your code until you have a finished solution. Otherwise, you may risk running out of time because you were too focused on refactoring your code.
    
6. Not learning from mistakes
    
    If you fail to solve a question, then it means you’ve identified a weak point in your interview skills, so not taking the time to reflect on your mistakes is passing up an opportunity to make yourself a stronger candidate. Identify what specific decisions or approaches led to your missteps. Did you not spend enough time in planning your approach? Did you use an incorrect data structure or algorithm? What decisions prevented you from finding an optimal solution? Identify what factors led to your errors so you can avoid similar mistakes in future interviews. The tool allows you to flag the problem you missed, save notes for why you missed it, and see when you last tried the problem. Revisit the question again in two weeks to see if you learned from your mistakes.",2023-07-04 20:16:27
11a2hd4,FTC Proposed Rule Against Revature and Others,"So, many of you my know me by a few posts I've made regarding Revature.  A new development has come up that I'm extremely excited about, and desperately want to get out to the rest of you.  Basically, the FTC has drafted a [proposed ruling](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/non-compete-clause-rulemaking) against Non-Compete Agreements, citing research that shows they suppress wages, limit company growth, and generally don't provide any real benefits to anyone except employers looking to minimize salaries.  As part of this proposed rule, the FTC is including a ban on practices that amount to Non-Compete Agreements, [such as TRAP agreements](https://protectborrowers.org/training-repayment-agreement-provisions/) (in other words, **training fee** clauses).

The FTC is opening up the rule to [public comment](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FTC-2023-0007/comments), and will use these comments when deciding to finalize the rule, rescind the proposal, or update it.  It will be open for comments until **March 20th**.

On that note, I was informed of a possible training session by Democracy Forward, Towards Justice, and the Student Borrower Protection Center.  They want to try and put together a training session that ""*explains how workers who have been impacted by TRAPs can share their  story during the non-compete proposed rule comment period (what is most  important to share & what the FTC is looking for/how to structure  comments/helpful things to include), followed by a ""know-your-rights""  presentation.*""  They're aiming to hold this training sometime during **the first week of March**, so as to give all participants plenty of time to draft a comment.

I was asked to find out if anyone I knew might be interested.  When I suggested reaching out to this community, the representative I spoke with reacted positively, and had no issues with it.  **Anyone here who might be interested in this, please feel free to reach out to me with both a method of contact and a preferred time + date during that first week of March.**

I know a lot of people--including myself--were harmed by Revature and other companies like them.  The prospect of potentially ending this problem for good is something of a dream come true for me.  If it's something that has impacted you, please don't hesitate to reach out!",2023-02-23 16:53:49
zzbjpq,Things I found about CS Careers - notably dispelling the myth programming jobs come easy,"Unless your name is Jon Skeet, or you worked for google, I actually find getting a CS job to be extremely difficult. I've been continuously employed for over a decade.

There are several reasons for this:

1: The skills required for each job change pretty much every year. When I started, React and Angular didn't exist. Neither did .NET Core, Blazor, and probably more than I can think of.

2: Each year, the number of people who get into coding drastically increases, making the market that much more competitive. Even when I started, it took me a couple hundred resumes, and I was probably drastically underpaid for that work. This is someone who graduated from a decent (not top tier) school and had a year of paid internship experience.

3: Applies to this year, but yes, a lot of layoffs happened. There will always be jobs, but each job has a hundred applicants. Twitter, Facebook, Amazon.

4: I find this common in the industry but being a programmer doesn't just mean writing lines of code. It means designing code that's easy to read, easy for you AND others to work with, being able to test the code, and well documented. You may have to deal with people who have just ""faked it"" to get in. 

5: I'd go so far to say soft skills are just as important, if not more so, than writing code if writing enterprise level software - unless you are capable and willing to do it DIY. In short, if you can't prove you have the soft skills, you likely won't get the job.

6: This is probably the hardest for me to discuss, but finding a good balance is extremely difficult in programming because there are a lot of unknowns. You never know when something is unfinished, buggy, or when requirements will change - but all three happen very frequently. However, there's a deadline to meet, and you can't work too hard or else you'll be burned out. I considered game dev, but chose against it due to the infamous ""crunch time"". In addition, if there's a critical bug, depending on the industry, you may need to be able to fix it at any time.

Anyways, this is just my general thoughts about CS careers. While most likely you'll be able to find a job, it will take a lot of effort - a few months of looking at the minimum. In addition, I find that the more you make, the more difficult the job will be.",2022-12-30 21:07:04
u1708y,How to prepare for a senior position in Software Engineering?,"I recently applied to two senior positions and I got accepted to one of them while I got rejected to another. On the one that I got rejected on, I received a complex problem to solve in 90 minutes. The complex problem was basically to do the following:

1. Build a virtual storage service that manages all the directory structure of a storage service.
2. Allow ADD\_FILE, GET\_FILE, COPY\_FILE operation for the first step.
3. Allow FIND\_FILE that does recursive search for the second step.
4. There were two other steps that I don't remember because I couldn't reach those two steps. However, it is safe to say that they were of equal complexity as the first and second.  


I have solved medium and hard problems in Leetcode which usually takes me 30 minutes to 90 minutes based on how new they are to me. However, the above problem was very long and complex to sufficiently finish in 90 minutes while passing all the given tests as well as writing DRY and clean code. As I mentioned earlier, I only finished 2 of them and left two of them untouched. When I got rejected, I got bummed.  


I only have 2.5 years of full-time experience and 1 year of internship experience (in total 3.5 years of experience). So, I was thinking how I could effectively improve my skills so that I could be considered for senior positions by more companies.",2022-04-11 12:50:05
snxz0s,Was I promoted too soon? Senior Engineer advice.,"I've been working as a dev for about 7 years. Been at my current company for 4. 2 years ago they promoted me to a Senior.

So I'm currently interviewing for new jobs as a Senior Engineer, and both the offers I got were conditional. They would hire me as a Midlevel, not a Senior because they think I'm 'just below' Senior, or 'on the cusp' as they put it. Personally, I think that is a fair assessment of where I am, but I'm worried that taking one of these jobs is not a good idea because it will look like a step down.

The interview process has made me realize that maybe I was promoted too soon... anyone else had experience with this?

Some context: my current job a pretty big, local digital marketing company. The jobs I am interviewing for are much closer to a FANG type company. So maybe I am just a big fish in a small pond?

s1okoh,Feeling extremely demotivated after not getting interviews and not passing the first round of the only interview I got,"So currently I've been applying constantly to new job opening but cant seem to land any interviews. I have applied to around 150+ applications and received one interview which led to nothing for the past 2-3 months. 

I thought the interview actually went well. They asked me around 3 coding questions and I was able to comfortably answer 2 of them while the other I was not able to give an optimal solution. I thought with some technical internships I would be able to land at least a few interviews but to my luck, I have only seen one.

I graduated in 2021 with a Computer Engineering degree and got a internship right off the bat. My friends were saying that I shouldn't have taken the offer due it not being labelled as a developer job but during the interview I was promised a lot of technical skills, which after 7+ months, I haven't really been exposed to.

I am also currently doing Leetcode and other free algorithm courses such as grokking the coding interview. Doing interview prep material that I can find online. Also built a personal website to showcase some projects.

I do understand that I only have one developer role for my past internships but I have worked on a few medium to large side projects and a capstone project that I can comfortably talk about. But the opportunity never comes to talk about them.

Not entirely sure what I am doing wrong with my applications. I have tried following most online guidelines. I'm not sure if the single developer role on my experience is the deterrent for employers to not chose me as an candidate or my resume just does not reflect well.  If I could get some feedback on how my applications should be catered or what I need to change it would be amazing.

I do have answers i am hoping to hear with all of these, and those usually help me decipher if this company is good to work for or not, but im curious if you have any green flag questions that you know point to a good work place? Im mostly looking for 'work life balance', in the truest sense, where there are no panic attacks over small things, no need to always be rushing everything, and ideally a group of engineers that have the freedom to do their job the best way they see fit. I know thats a pipe dream, but hey, you gotta have ideals, right? 

**TLDR:** Id be curious what questions you ask in interviews, if any, to suss out if the company you're interviewing for is full of insanity or not. Alternatively, are there any green flags you've learned to recognize that show that a particular company is awesome?",2021-12-12 15:27:19

p88blj,Can anyone share their experience with pivoting mid-career to a CS career in their forties or fifties?,"I'm thinking of changing industries completely from finance to a more hands on software job, possibly in machine learning. I'm burnt out after years of trading financial markets. I realize that I would take a pretty massive pay cut in the short (as well as possibly longer) term, but at this point I'm more interested in working on interesting technologies and being able to eventually work remote.

I actually have a CS first degree and a statistics postgrad degree, both from top universities. I've done quite a bit of quant analysis over the years, but never did much hardcore coding (as there are others on the team who do this). I've been refreshing my maths and self-learning machine learning. I'm finding the material to be not too difficult, but my coding skills are definitely rusty and I'm still pretty slow. I definitely don't want to go back into finance/trading in a software role. Instead I'm interested in more ML engineering or research roles or possibly data science as a second choice.

Has anyone else done a complete pivot mid- (or even late-) career into CS? How did you do manage that in terms getting the necessary knowledge? Are there any bootcamps that might be appropriate for someone in a similar position? Were companies open to hiring fairly senior people in more junior roles in CS? What sort of companies would provide the best opportunities? Would I have more prospects looking for a product management role instead (I've got pretty good commercial instincts, at least in finance)? Really appreciate any input!",2021-08-20 16:10:15

oqcpim,Are there as many vacant jobs as I am hearing about?,"I am in my late 40s considering going into cybersecurity. Everyone (news, YouTubers, podcasts, schools, etc.) says that there are 100 of thousands of jobs available for people who ""have the right skills"".

They say that you can work in cybersecurity with as little education as certs like CompTIA A+, Security+, Network+, etc. Or attend a Bootcamp and you will be able to land entry-level cyber jobs making $50,000, $60.00 or even $70,000+ a year.

Is this actually true? When I look on sites like Indeed, in my large metro area (Sacramento)  there are 7 entry-level jobs listed. And most times entry-level still means they want some exp. What search terms should I try to get a larger return on sights like Indeed?

Like I said I am quickly approaching 50 y/o and thanks to COVID I lost my job as a Park Ranger and I really would like to try my hand at cybersecurity. Is it possible to land a good-paying entry-level job doing cybersecurity with only certificates and/or an associated degree?

okxar8,How do you handle tough interviewers?,"So I've been interviewing for sr. software engineer roles this past couple of weeks. I bombed on 2 interviews for 2 separate companies, but the interviewers were both very similar to each other. To illustrate, I was asked to return the kth largest integer from an unsorted array of integers. I was solving it in python and decided to use heapq to build a min heap of size k and iterate over the array. Once completed the item on top of the heap is the kth largest int. The interviewer didn't like that. He told me to instead use the input array itself as a buffer and keep it sorted (O(1) memory). With some struggles I managed to do it, but I think I took a little too long because I was a little flustered at being interrupted regularly and I could not understand his accent at times.

Im 29 and getting to a point in life where im tired of jumping between jobs and want a solid career (one issue with my life is not wanting to be locked on a dead end job or career).


Well. I graduated in Physics and have a Information Science post grad degree.. but no coding.. although I did some coding back in the University but It was entry level Java for a period.


Anyway.. is there still a chance for me??

What would be the best return career option in CS??

And the best language to learn?? How long to learn??


Im considering python and doing online courses and self teaching. Im fairly smart although I've been out of the studying game for a bit..

I mean, there must be a way to intuitively learn coding now a day right??



The market sound really great in the whole world.. guess the prospects for the demand of good coders is to only increase??


Any tips??

9bz4uv,"Quitting after Ten Years how can I break it lightly, but professional?","**TL;DR:** I was hired straight out of High School into a PHP System Development job, was laid off seven years ago then rehired 3 months later, and now I am having an anxiety and panic attack about quitting, and need some help with how I can get out amicably.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To start this story, I want to mention that I got this job before I got out of High School, I got in it as a Co-op Student. My 12th grade year I ended up doing an entire semester of Co-op, making this pretty much my first and only job since I was 17 years old.

I was officially hired when summer started, and school was over, there have been high points, and low points. I had gotten laid off for 3 months when I was originally blamed for causing the business money problems 3 Years into my employment.

While I was looking for a new Job at the time, I received an email from my boss asking if I still needed a job because he was wrong and needed me back. I later found out one of my co-workers wasn’t being too helpful to our clients, and causing them too to leave, which was the actual issues, and when I had been rehired from my lay off, he was fired.

My official job title at this company currently is “Senior Developer” however, instead of just being somebody who write code, I have always been tasked with having to make design choices, choose template designs from clients, gather requirements from clients, meet with clients to do progress updates, write up technical documents, build their sites and branding, among my system development work.

It has gotten to the point where in the past couple months our constant money issues keep getting blamed on me and five of our other developers because we aren’t fast enough at our job, which our turn around time on websites and systems has become 1 week, two at max, with 0 time for testing.

Well recently I setup a LinkedIn profile with all my information, what I do, how long I have been doing this job, and after a few months of kind of searching for a new job on the side since there isn’t much in my area, I got contacted by a pretty reputable business one town over about a job opening.

I would make more money, and receive benefits for the first time ever, and it generally seems like a health environment, however I know the grass isn’t always as green on the other side, but man, doesn’t it look like they take damn good care of that grass.

Anyway, to the meat and potatoes after a very brief insight into what is going on. I need to give notice to my current boss on Tuesday. I have been having panic and anxiety attacks about how to bring it up because... I mean, it has been ten years and with my job responsibilities I feel like me leaving could have a pretty bad impact on the workplace.

I needed to get this off my chest a bit, maybe looking for advice on how I should do this, I am giving three weeks’ notice which I know isn’t a lot but the job position was a firm start date.",2018-09-01 01:06:40
7c5867,I'm a good coder but I feel useless otherwise,"Hi guys,

I recently started a new career out of school as a backend enterprise java developer. I love my job and I work hard because I enjoy it. I changed careers in my 30s to become a coder and had to go back to college. I fast tracked my way through and graduated at the top of my class.

I feel like I'm good at what I do but at the same time, I feel so out of place sometimes. Programming is easy, but I really struggle when it comes to some of the other things.

We do a lot of command line stuff, which I am learning on the fly. But things that people seem to know off hand are new to me. Configuring and installing environments, databases, things like that... I just don't know how to do it without having to do research. And I'm not always successful and feel I need to ask for help a lot.

Things like deploying from Jenkins, and specifically sysadmin type work is just foreign to me. I never had to do it in school before. It took me a long time to figure out how to download and install something from smb... Or how to download files remotely via linux (I am familiar developing in Windows, but never used linux before).

I don't know... I guess I'm just looking for advice on skills I should brush up on to help me in my career. Would taking a sysadmin course help? I'm not even sure how to qualify these things... Like are they sysadmin related?

If anyone is a backend enterprise dev and has advice on what I should research and practice independently to help me with my career I would appreciate it. I can code in Java. But I feel limited in what I can do because aside from straight coding a lot of other things are new to me.

wrfpqh,Junior Developer Lost,"I don't know where to start with this, my heads all a jumble as I don't know know what do or what my next move is.

I started at a 6 month boot-camp February 2022, I passed the classes with high marks, High Distinctions and Distinctions, at the end of the camp I got a degree.

From here I started to work as a junior dev for a startup company, I worked there for about 1 year and 6 months.

While working there training and guidance was minimal but I was able to figure out most of it on my own, I got tasks done and was even applauded for some of my ingenuity.

After about the first year though I hadn't really progressed beyond where I started. I didn't learn anything new, I felt like I was stagnating at this company, and the kind of environment we were working in didn't offer much in the way of help or guidance (the job was full remote).

Innovation was slow, the app we were creating didn't require much in the way of new features at the time, so for months I was working on QA tasks, this severally burnt me out.

For the last month my productivity had slowed down, I didn't have any big tasks to work on, the ones that we did I had no experience with the technology, I had asked to work on those projects, to learn what needed to be done but I was not given the time and was ignored.

Eventually a meeting was had and I was let go.

The ceo wanted to meet up with me afterwards, he asked what had happened, I told him it felt like I was ignored and pushed to the side, I didn't receive any help or training and wasn't allowed to work on the project I requested to learn and be more involved.

The ceo said he understood and that he realizes at this moment in time they don't have the resources for a junior dev.

This next point is important, he offered to help me find a job, gave me info on recruiters and places hiring, said he would be a reference for me as the code I put out was good, I thought this was pretty nice and went on my way.

I started applying for new jobs.

(Two months later) Eventual another startup company offered to bring me on (found theme through a recruiter), from what they told me they needed at least mid level developer, I was forward that I'm still a junior and eager to learn, they were ok with this.

Initially I wanted to decline the offer as I felt I didn't have enough experience and was unsure of myself due to being let go from the previous company. I spoke to my recruiter who secured the interview for me and he convinced me to not live in the past and to give this new role a shot.

So i took the new position. While working for this company I was very unlucky, before I was set to start I caught the flu, I was out for the first to second week I was set to start.

After this I started working, the code I put out was good and I was commended on the work I had done.

Then I got hit with covid, out again for another week to two weeks. After this my mind was a jamble for months, concentrating became hard, simple things could take hours because I couldn't run through the logic, some days were almost impossible. This has thankfully passed but it was there for at least two months.

This didnt go over well and I was let go, the CTO said he would be a reference but he wouldn't put me forward for any startup companies.

I was at this company for a little over two months.

I put them on my resume, but I didn't plan on using them as reference, but adding them I realize is stupid now, I just didn't want to have a gap on the resume.

As of right now its been 3 months since I left the second company, and about 6 months since the first one let me go.

I've been applying for jobs, passing code tests but being turned down at the last second due to lack of experience.

This is where my head gets thrown and I dont know what to do.

A friend of mine is a senior developer at a good company, been in business for over 5 years but still considered a startup. I passed their code test, they loved meeting me and it all looked set that they would hire me, they knew I was a junior but they respected the word of my friend there and the work he did so were considering me and knew id be trained up.

I was especially looking forward to it as my friend is a great programmer and would be able to offer me actual guidance.

I didn't get the role.

My friend poked around asking why because it seemed for sure I was going to be offered the position, but apparently the ceo of this company knows the ceo from one of the companies I worked at and they recommend not to hire me.

I thought it must have been from the second company, even though I didnt give them as a reference, because the ceo of the first company seemed to really want me to succeed. But I looked up the ceo's of the companies I worked at on linkedin to see what the connections are and the only connections I found was from the ceo of the first company I worked at who offered to help me find a new job and the founder of the company my friend works at.

Im now at a loss of what to do, this was the person who was initially offering me guidance on where to get a new job, agreed to be my reference (i asked) but has now stopped me from getting this role.

If I continue forward, the work experience from my first job where i worked for 1 year and 6 months cant be used as the ceo there clearly doesn't think im a good developer, I just dont get it though, he offered to help me find a new job, he agreed to be my reference.

I also cant use the experience from the second job as they wont have anything good to say.

I'm just completely lost, taking these companies off my resume gives me a two year gap I have to explain.

Im not a bad coder, the first company didn't offer any help or listen to my requests to work on harder projects.

The second company I got sick twice, these are things outside my control.

I honestly just don't know what to do, I feel like giving up on being a developer, I know I can do it but its just, what do i do now, I'm completely lost.

bml0po,Lost at new job and weak documentation,I am now two weeks into my new job and feel completely lost. I am a backend dev with about a year and a half experience in the role but feel completely lost doing the same job at a new organization. I have basically been dropped into a huge codebase that was written by a different company and the documentation is lacking to say the least. I am the only person on the team with a background in backend programming and am really struggling to understand the codebase and even do the simplest things based on how unfamiliar the structure is. I feel like people are starting to get frustrated with me in the stand-ups because I haven't done anything productive and am worried that I'm in over my head.

7u375o,"Software Dev - Job search, not having much luck","Not necessarily a greybeard but have been in Tech for quite a while. BS-CS degree from quite a few years ago. Approx 10 yrs of client/server dev. Then got shifted into IT/Ops about a decade ago.. hate it and have been trying to get OUT of IT/Ops and back into Software Dev. Started taking MS classes couple years back.. too much theory. Tried solo/Udemy type learning. Did that for a while; too unfocused. Enrolled in a web-dev bootcamp about 9 months ago. Bootcamp wrapped up. Learned a lot but not sure I'd repeat the exp. Now am trying to execute transition/relo, etc. (Bootcamp: Python/Flask/Django, MEAN: JS, Node, Express, Mongo, etc)

Anyhow, I've been applying heavy this month (mostly Indeed, Linkedin), and am getting really frustrated because I don't seem to be able to even get callbacks/interviews--at least for Software Dev positions. Focusing on Austin, TX area. Seems like there are a ton of jobs there, yet I'm not getting any response.

Had my resume rewritten (good resume writer) few months back. But I'm thinking if my results aren't showing then maybe the resume isn't that hot.

Short-circuiting the complaining, asking for advice on:

1) Top resume writers for SOFTWARE DEV

2) Job boards and/or methods to apply to co's for software dev jobs.

3) General repackaging recommendations. Is there a FAQ?

5i4aln,My story. I am so happy!,"Hello,

I don't know if anyone cares but I wanted to share my story in hopes that anyone in a similar position can get something out of it.

I am 31 years old. I have loved working with computers my entire life, from the moment I did my first ""programming"" way back when using Logowriter (which at the time was the only ""computer class"" we had in school). It was the only thing I was ever truly passionate about.

When it came time to go to college, I was lost. At this point a career in CS, while probably extremely profitable at the time, was not as hyped as it is today. I didn't know what to do and I was 19 or 20 and way too immature to handle the workload. I ended up going into business because that's what EVERYONE was doing.

I hated accounting. I hated finance. I even hated marketing. I hated it all and barely graduated. When it came time to find work I ended up getting hired at a bank since the benefits were good and they were considered a good employer.

The job was brutal. I am good at dealing with people so my job in sales went well but I really hated it. I am not good at giving bad news, and this was right around the financial crisis which meant I was ONLY giving bad news. I would have many sleepless nights dreading how I would tell my client the next day that they would lose their car or their house. 

I worked really hard to get promoted because I hated the job so much and figured if I get a promotion, maybe I'll like the next job better. The promotion came, and I still felt the same way. It took me at least 2 years to find my groove in that position (management) and it was only because I moved to a new team where I had the flexibility to shape how things were done. I still struggled a lot with happiness at work, but I had a lot of success. Eventually, I was promoted again, this time to a senior sales position (commission based).

From day 1 I knew it was the wrong move. Back to giving bad news, except this time the stakes were far bigger. I developed anxiety issues from this job that I still sometimes struggle with.

Eventually, I realized that I will never be happy at work because I was never happy with my career to begin with. It was always just a job to me, a paycheck. I would secretly want to get hit by a car every day on the way to work so I could take a few weeks off, it was that bad.

So one day, I looked at my bank account, and I calculated that I could afford to take some time off and figure things out. With the support of my wife and my family, I quit my job and decided to go back to college to get what I deep down have always wanted... a degree in computer science. I started in January 2015.

In June 2017 I will be graduating (less than 3 years). I am a top of class student and I LOVE WHAT I DO. I love programming. I can sit here for 12 hours straight working on something and it doesn't bother me at all, I actually love it. I do not regret my decision at all and never have, even in the middle of insane deadlines and huge pressure.

And I am so happy to say that I was hired to be an actual software developer, full time, starting this summer (once I graduate). I'm going to be a real life programmer. The kid inside me is so happy! The adult in me in happy too, because I am getting paid, as a starting salary with 0 experience in this industry, the same as what I got when I quit my job at the bank (after 6+ years and 2 promotions).

I wanted to tell this story because I know there are others out there like me. I have friends who are in the same position. Know that it is never too late. It isn't easy, and I am lucky to have a wife that supported me and shouldered most the bills for a while, but it can be done. If this is what you want to do, then DO IT.

I am over the moon and so excited to finally start a new chapter in my life.",2016-12-13 15:52:09
1bkb011,A guide to surviving your internship or career,"I've been noticing a lot of new college graduates asking for advice getting a job, but not a lot asking how to manage and survive a job or internship after landing it. This thread has been very helpful for my career development, and I'd like to pay it forward with some tips I've learned on surviving in this industry.

Background: I'm currently a SWE for a small-medium sized company. I have a bachelors and masters in computer science. I've worked for multiple companies of different sizes. I've been a developer for small start ups and large corporations. I've been a intern while I was at school and have also been a software lead/manager. I've worked remote, hybrid, and in-office jobs. I've been around and I've seen some patterns that are always prevalent regardless of the company.

**1. Visibility matters more than performance:**

This is a hard one to stomach, but visibility will always matter more than what you program. Your boss will never fully comprehend what you are programming and the progress you are making day-to-day, but if you can find a way to market yourself as a ""hard worker""and ""busy"" to your boss you are much more likely to succeed. It seems almost backwards because you enter this field as an engineer so you are configured to believe that your performance matters. In reality, every technical and nontechnical job I've had has always resolved around making you look busy. For example, while working for a large space defensive agency, I was hired on with another software engineer. While working on a project with them, I realized that they had the greatest personality ever and would communicate everything they did, but was actually not technical at all. I'm serious when I tell you that they were making tons of money but didn't know the command to copy and paste. Because they were good at marketing themselves to everyone, they manage to out earn people that have been there for years.

Tip: Really sell yourself. Adding a simple paragraph tag? Sell it as ""Redesigning the entire front-end to be more customer-friendly... etc"" You get the point. It may seem outlandish and crazy, **but if you aren't doing it, someone else will.**

**2. You need to be sending Job Applications Daily:**

This was also a hard one to stomach for me as well. I have extremely ""traditional"" parents that would always suggest I stay with a company for 30+ years. It is no longer the ""old days"". It is 2024. When I mean everyone, I mean everyone is job hopping. It is just a harsh truth that you need to realize when you enter this industry. Although this tip is a bit more applicable for younger people that aren't tied down by family, children, etc, everyone needs to be sending out job applications. Even if you love your job, even if you are making tons of money, even if you get to work remotely, etc. The list of benefits for applying to jobs is endless. Below is a few:

1. There is a high chance that you will get a large salary increase. **It is easier to make more money by working for a different company than it is working for a promotion.** Seriously, I've nearly doubled my salary by working for a different company than 3+ years of promotions at one company.
2. You get connections/contact info for the recruiter/HR. It doesn't really matter if you get rejected or not. I always suggest everyone apply for every position even if they aren't qualified for it. Best case is you get the job and you make a ton of money. Worst case is you get rejected and apply for more positions. **You have to remember that this is a number game.** But lets say you get an interview, you now have access to that companies HR or recruiting information. Next time you apply, you can shoot them a message and you have a much higher chance of getting the position or into the next round of interviews. Although this is more common for smaller companies, I've gotten offers because they used my previous application and contact information.
3. You get practice with technical interviews. Once you get a career or internship, you start to notice very quickly that your technical skills start declining. It is weird because you expect to become more technical working in that position, but SWE can and will be mundane and monotonous at times. Sending job applications not only makes you stay updated with your cover letter and resume, but it will force you to stay technically proficient with Leetcode, etc. It is good to practice your skills that will get rusty as you work your normal job.

**3. Document everything:**

When I mean document everything, I seriously mean to document everything. It is VERY important to have a daily work log that documents the things you do. Because when raise time and promotion time comes around, you need to have some records showing what you did, what things you learned, etc. If you don't have that you can't defend yourself in case they don't give you the raise you were expecting. It is also important to document every meeting. For example, if your boss sets new expectations, send them an email after the meeting verifying thats the new expectations. Your boss stressing you out? Document it. Coworkers aren't doing what they need to and your doing their work. Document it. You need to have a paper trail that can be traced because eventually you will get tired of things or things will just be enough and you need to prove your claims/statements.

**4. A lot of people don't actually know how to program:**

A lot of people that I've worked with are very clueless when it comes to actually programming. There will be days you will wonder how a person got even hired. Until that day comes, you need to realize that your imposter syndrome is all in your head. Most of the time you are doing a lot better than you expect. When you do become more experienced to analyze other peoples development skill, you'll realize that they aren't as competent as you expect them to be. Even the people that market themselves as extremely technical (which you should be doing!) Aren't as technical as you expect. You'll be surprised at the number of people that don't really know how to program.

Tip: Since a lot of people aren't computer wizards, you can do what you need to do to get by. You can seriously do the bare minimum. I remember having extremely bad imposter syndrome, but even if you get fired or laid off, you're already applying for jobs so it won't be too bad. There will be days where you feel dumb stupid for not knowing how to use a new javascript framework, but you need to remember that most SWE don't actually even program day to day during work.

**5. HR/Coworkers/Supervisor are not your friends:**

You seriously have to remind yourself everyday that they aren't your friends. Of course that doesn't mean be a horrible person to them, but every place I've worked at has some corporate politics. It is fine to hang out with people outside of work and even hang out with your supervisor. I do that currently at my job but you need to remember that when push comes to shove these people will sell you short to save themselves every single time. It is really hard to believe since I've made some of my best friends from my work, but you need to realize that people can and will backstab you. Unfortunately, that is just corporate America and this ""politics"" exists everywhere from small to large sized companies. You just need to learn how to manage and navigate it.

Tip: The best way I've found to manage this is to be very quiet and private. Supervisors and coworkers will eventually ask details about your personal life. Do your very best to not reveal any details about this since it will lead them to develop biases (good/bad) against you. Don't forget that people are very subjective, emotionally driven, and biased. Be nice to people but mind your own business and try not to tell anyone anything that could potentially be used against you.

Of course these are all anecdotal and these experiences are my own, but I just can't help thinking these are coincidences as I've experienced the same issue across every single company I've worked at. Again, there are some times where none of these tips apply, but in general these are very common problems and patterns I've experienced. What I know now, I would of done a lot better at certain jobs at certain companies. Working in corporate for some time now, I've developed a better understanding of how it runs and I don't want to see a junior dev go through the same mistakes I have. Feel free to ask any questions or add additional advice. It is a tough time and market right now, so I wish everyone the best.",2024-03-21 16:42:28
1b3p0gc,Cloud Engineer continuously out of employment in Australia ,"Anyone else in this boat?

It has driven me insane the past year especially. I used to have a cushy job at a uni as well and could WFH 5 days a week right before they went back to hybrid.

So asking for advice on what to do next  
Like I mentioned I applied for my masters but those are all top tier schools in states so I did all the pre requisites( some credit courses some MOOC) but incase if i dont get in, what should be my backup  
any other courses or  certifications I can do that would guarantee my masters?  
I am also grinding leetcode but I am not actively applying for jobs atm. I want to keep grinding leetcode for 2-3 months and then apply   
but really wanna know what kind of AI certs/ Masters can get my foot in the door

166egh5,Employer turns down remote work for gerrymandering purposes,"I work for a Federal contractor. In 2020 we all went remote, and slowly folks began moving back into the office, although many of us are still remote. I actually moved out of state, and assumed I'd be staying remote since none of my team is within hundreds of miles of me.

It turns out that my employer can bill the client for physical building expenses, and they can do more of this when there are more people listed as on-site. The top brass are denying as many remote requests as possible in order to get reimbursed for the buildings. Although my team is hundreds of miles away, there is a building within a few miles of me, so they have decided to list me as on-site so that I contribute to the money they get on the building.

Manager says she ""does not care"" whether I really go in, but that for auditing purposes I should badge into the building twice a month. I don't like this because I sometimes go out of town for a month to visit family elsewhere, and because I don't want to give them an inch which could become a slippery slope.

That said, I have been paid un-competitively for a while, so perhaps I could get them to up my pay in response to this new requirement? But really I just hate that they're jerking me around just so they can check certain boxes on a file somewhere.",2023-08-31 15:36:06

ywxiny,Boss Wants Me(<2 years experience) To Consider Promotion to Senior Software Engineer,"Title. I graduated with a BS in software engineering just last summer and started working in the industry July 2021. I hated the team I was working on, but met my now boss who liked me and brought me onto his team with a promotion 6 months ago. I'm much happier now, and can see myself staying on this team long term.

It's time for year end evaluations, and my boss is giving me the highest evaluation tier. He also says that if I continue to do well like this, there will be a question of why I haven't been promoted yet. So he is asking me if I want to take ownership of this new project on my team, and by the end of next year, consider being promoted to Senior Software Engineer.

Of course it's exciting to be given this opportunity, and I definitely wouldn't complain about a pay raise. But I feel like I am too inexperienced to take on this kind of responsibility. I know nothing of leadership or good architecture. I'm not even entirely sure if the code I write is good code. I feel so clueless and unaware of the things outside my specific app that I write code for. I am the youngest on my team in both age and tenure, and it feels like anyone else on my team would be more qualified for this.

Should I tell my boss to consider someone else? Should I take him up on his offer? Any insights from those who may have been in similar situations would be greatly appreciated.",2022-11-16 16:05:29

ylgvju,Jobs that will allow me to take time to be extra thorough instead of rushing me from task to task.,"My natural tendency towards extreme thoroughness has caused problems for me in most, if not all of the past jobs I've ever had.  At my last job (IT call center) my boss tried many times to get me to shorten my calls so I can get more calls per day.  I couldn't bring myself to do that, because I feel like I HAVE to fix the customer's problem, both because I want to help them, and because the problem itself feels like a puzzle for me.  It really bugs me to leave the puzzle unsolved.  When I was younger I had a number of retail jobs.  In all cases, my manager had to talk to me about my habit of organizing the products in my aisle/section too perfectly.  They wanted me to get it ""good enough"" so I can move onto the next thing.  I can't shake this tendency towards thorough perfectionism.  If I can just find a job that would benefit from this kind of thorough behavior I would absolutely thrive!

w300gh,Recruiters are driving me insane.,"I know I should be grateful that people are working to find me a job, especially in this economy but lately recruiters have been getting VERY pushy to the point where its become irritating. Furthermore they don't seem to be very interested in actually listening to my responses to their questions, but would rather just vomit words at me over the phone. This gives me a lot of pause when I consider how I'd be represented to the actual client. I'm not sure why, but this seems very specific to Indian recruiters, and I've got no idea why. Perhaps someone from that culture could give me some advice on how to deal with this, and to get them to slow down a bit in general.

&#x200B;

I was at the grocery store today and got a call about a job. I wasn't able to hear him very well. I asked him to repeat a few details, but he pressed on with his script instead.  When he got to the end he tried to confirm my email, which he had incorrectly (missing a hyphen). I corrected him and we said goodbye. Before I could even finish checking out and paying, my phone was ringing again. ""Hello can you please confirm to the email?"" I explained for a second time that I was out at the moment and I'd be back at my computer within the hour. That didn't matter. Before I was even on the way home I'd got another phone call. Thats three calls within 20 minutes when I made it really clear I was tied up. Why do they do this?

&#x200B;

When I finally got to check, there was no email. I called back and finally got the right email to them, and now the ball is finally rolling.

&#x200B;

While I was writing this the same guy called me AGAIN because he's got another client he think I should talk to. This time I'm being asked to bend the truth on my resume to 'better fit the requirement.' I'm not entirely comfortable doing that and to be perfectly honest I've got half a mind to take the interview just to let the company know whats going on.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice on how I should deal with this? Is there something I could do to make it better? I've gotten GREAT positions from indian recruiters before so I cannot and will not write them off but lately 1) my phone is ringing off the hook 2) the interviews all seem to go nowhere and 3) I fucking hate being told to lie.

I know how similar these languages are and I’m confident that I can learn the libraries and tools quickly but I can’t convince people to hire me outside of .net roles (I also thought I did well in their Java interview). I hope I’m not limiting my career to .net just because I’ve had some .net jobs after I got my degree. I want to expand my experience by working with other technology stacks too. Are CS jobs always so specific? Is it that difficult to get a job outside of your tech stack?",2022-02-14 21:15:05

d8mmr1,Is anyone else in the UK finding themselves working alone most of the time?,"For the last 3 years I've been working pretty much solo. I've either been a contractor working by myself on a project that doesn't require a team effort, or I've been working with a remote team.

In my current job, we started as a team but management fired everyone but me. 

It's lonely, the pace of work is slowed, your own standards drop. Open offices become even more annoying because absolutely nothing you overhear has any relevance to you. Working with remote teams is particularly hard because they'll generally have their own dedicated office, where they develop a strong esprit-de-corps and standard operating procedures that you get left out on.

d6zbcs,Is this a good route to becoming a good software developer?,"My brother would like to become a software developer but for various reasons cannot go to uni right now for a CS degree. I did some searching around and decided to recommend him the following pathway to become a reasonably well rounded programmer that will be qualified for any junior dev role. However, I would still like some further feedback and extra advice/ recommendations as well:

1: He did the A+ Certificate (to get a general understanding of how computers, and some networks work)

2: Two programming courses in Java (the second one teaching OO software engineering concepts and a very brief dive into design patterns, I might also get him to try and solve the basic and some intermediate algorithms from freecodeCamp in whatever language he likes just to further increase his problem solving)

3: A programming course in C (to get some understanding about low lvl concepts that other languages abstract away like pointers, and memory allocation, etc.)

4: ""Intro to Computer Science with Android"" book by Hamzeh Roumani (to get familiar with android programming and build some projects to show off to employers)

5:   ""The Complete 2019 Web Dev Bootcamp"" by Angela Yu (goes really deep into front and backend web dev and teaches him html, css, javascript, node, sql, git & using terminal, etc.)

6:  Coursera - Princeton's two Algorithms & data structures courses or an equivalent

7:  Solve at least 100 questions in LeetCode

Bonus: Perhaps Harvards CS50, the SICP book, discrete maths,  and a linux sys admin course later on if he's interested in further knowledge

My question is would this pathway prepare him well as a developer, and give him enough solid fundamentals to compete with the other applicants that are CS/ bootcamp, etc. grads? Or would you recommend some other resources as well?",2019-09-20 18:48:34

I've been working with PHP 5.x and MySQL 5.x plus JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, etc for ages now, and I feel like Im slipping (or have slipped) behind the latest tech requirements I'm seeing on job postings.

ck3g0d,Is this Legit?,"Background: Graduated about two years ago as an undergrad studying Economics and Political Science. I recently discovered my passion for computer programming, and am currently in the process of learning and taking tutorials for different languages and frameworks (Django, ReactJS, etc). My programming experience started with statistical programming, around the time I graduated (started with R). I'd say I am fairly proficient in R, but now I am wanting to expand my skills beyond just statistics and am interested in doing other different kinds of work, such as web development. I've been searching for entry level positions as web developer and came across a job opening on Glass Door, for ""Computer Programmer.""

I applied directly to the website, and was quite surprised when I heard back from a recruiter, since I do not have any programming experience. However, the response I got had me concerned, if only because it seems too good to be true (see image). In addition, when I look into the [company website](https://alderwoodenterprise.com/), the website appears kinda vague. Not even sure what kind of services they offer to the public.

Is it normal for companies to offer such competitive salaries, for positions such as ""Computer Programmer""? I'd understand if this was a senior role but I see no indication that this is an entry level position.

In addition, the recruiter makes clear that the would give only three projects every few months, and explicitly told me that if I completed these projects early then I could ""enjoy the rest of my time off, fully paid.""

I was just thinking that all these together paint a picture of a rather shady enterprise, but I am not sure if I am being too cautious. If someone can offer any thoughts as to what they think or heard of this Alderwood Enterprise organization, I would greatly appreciate it!

c7w39j,Time tracking on the job?,"I'm asking this to try to see what's normal out there. This is a throwaway.

At my previous job I didn't have to track my time. My boss literally said “As long as you get the work done, that's all I care about. If you get it done in 2 hours, then so be it.” It was a pretty awesome environment but unfortunately the pay wasn't where I wanted it.

At the job I've been at now for about a year, we have to track all of our billable time, and it has to add up to a certain percentage of our 40 hour week.

So we get a task, we have to estimate it, then try to meet that estimate. If it's going to take longer, we have to ask the PM for more time.

I find it incredibly stressful. It's hard for me to focus 8 hours straight, which I feel like I have to do if I need to justify all my time throughout the day. And if I need to ask for more time, I feel incompetent.

It's affected my productivity a bit because I constantly feel like I'm rushing against the clock. I'm prone to anxiety so it piles up pretty quickly.

Are most CS jobs like this? This is only my second job in the field so I don't have much experience. I'm tempted to look for another job with less stressful conditions, but don't know if I just had it really good at the previous one.

1. Is this pretty ubiquitous for programming jobs?
2. If this is how your job is, how have you coped with it?",2019-07-01 17:17:20
byerfd,"I'm confused about what I enjoy about computing, especially for a career","Hi! I'm currently a rising sophomore intending to become a CS major with an art minor. Ever since I was introduced to computing thru graphics (python!!), I've really loved being able to design websites and make things look ""pretty"" or aesthetically pleasing. I also really enjoy solving problems, especially my homework problems. Nothing feels better after trying to fix my code with my friend for three hours and we finally figure it out. 

&#x200B;

I know it's super early to start thinking about jobs, but everyone around me also interested in computing has these fancy big-name tech company internships while I'm just dog sitting and helping out in a classroom :p . So I'm just wondering if someone could help me figure out what exactly I'm interested in computing and what the name of the title is. 

For example, I currently am a ""data analyst"" (I'm not going to lie, I do not know what that means)  for my school's webmaster but I mainly use php/html/css to create new pages and templates to upload to the server. I also just design new pages for different departments. I really enjoy that! I've also had the opportunity to be an apprentice for a company's Client-Side Engineering team and helped fix small client-side bugs and coded new functions for a toolkit. I also used html/css/json. I also really enjoyed that!  I also really love photoshop and making graphics/ making videos and editing them. I'm not very good at it currently, but I will be after I finish taking more art classes. 

&#x200B;

But at school, I personally think learning all this binary, discrete math, data structures... behind the scenes stuff is pretty boring. It's interesting, but I absolutely do not like it when we're learning it. I get so excited when one of our extra credits is to incorporate graphics or art. Unfortunately, I have to learn all of this to access our UX/UI course and graphics course. I guess my question is, what part of computing am I interested in? Some people call it front end, my family says UX but I'm not interested in research nor do I know a lot about ""what a human is interested in"" if that makes sense. I'm just extremely confused because when I search ""UX"" jobs, a lot of them require more ""UX"" background and no coding. 

&#x200B;

I'm just very confused and I want to figure out what is it that I'm interested in when I'm looking for computing jobs/internships. I love to code and it upsets me when people just say ""Oh you wanna just be a graphics designer"" but I do also want to design things. Any feedback or commentary is appreciated!",2019-06-09 00:53:32

b5k22j,23 year old getting serious with school. Enjoy propositional logic and am looking for a lucrative career path. Trying to decide between CS major or CEngineering major.,"First off sorry if my punctuation is off Im currently in Mexico in a cyber cafe and their keyboards are very different.

So heres my current situation. Im a 23 year old who went back to community college full time3 semsters ago and I just finished all of my Gen ed classes. Now its time to get serious and pick a career path. Im not going to BS you guys, a large part of why I want to get into CS or Comp Engineering is to be able to live comfortably after I graduate. Money is nice. I want to have a lot of money after I get out of college. You get the idea.

But wait, theres also another reason why I want to get into Computers, I love my logic classes. I really enjoy propositon (symbolic) logic and get As on all my tests. My professor says that propositional logic has a lot to do with computers. So heres my question, If I want keep my career path as close as possible to propositional logic type problems should I go into a computer science major or a computer engineering major.

Also to anyone who has taken a symbolic logic class, have you noticed any similarities to anything in the field of computers that might indicate an enjoyment of one if you enjoy the other.

My math skills are also not fully developed, I will be enrolling in College Algebra next semester and will have to work my way up to Calculus II. This is a bit overwhelming but I think I can do it through hard work and focus.

Was free for me because I work there currently as a director. I am 30 years old, so this is a career change for me, and I was REALLY excited about this new path as the degree was really fun.  
  
I make decent money as a director currently, so it feels literally impossible for me to switch over to the career without taking a decent pay cut and starting from zero. Every job I find requires multiple years of experience, internships don't pay well and the requirements for all position are extensive and heavily vary.

1aw96f2,Quitting CS job for a year to start a company - good idea?,"I currently have a comfy average SWE job. 170k per year (this number includes stock/bonus/etc.), etc. I graduated with a CS degree and I have 1.5 years on the job so far. I'm a react web developer, but I've also published a few mobile apps and web project with a few thousand downloads in my free time. I have been learning a lot of new AI stuff recently, and started building a product I love.

I have always wanted to start my own company, but I absolutely hate having to balance my job and work on side projects. I've only been able to complete very small projects with my free time, and working on something bigger always burns me out on top of my job, so I want to take the next step and go all in on a big project and quit my job. I developed a prototype for my project and applied to a few VC's with no results, but my friends thought it was a pretty useful product and I have managed to get like 10-20 paid customers so far with some advertising. **But honestly, I know the startup failure rate and don't bank on succeeding. I just want to spend a year building something I love, learning new things, and enjoying myself** (I absolutely love coding, but hate coding for other people/projects I don't like). If it works out, that's great, but if it doesn't, I'm willing to return to the job market.

I know the more recommended thing to do is to just work on side projects while working a job, but for me, that is unfortunately unsustainable and I burn out fast while doing both. My current job is comfy but boring and I don't grow much, and I find my work life extremely unsatisfying. Because I'm still young I feel like these next few years are going to be my last where I am free from financial responsibility. I still live with my parents (I'm asian) and have a good 80k in the bank from working which will easily last more than a year. This makes me feel like this is the last point in my life where I can do something like this, and I might highly regret it when I'm older if I miss out on a chance like this.My biggest worry is if I do need to get a job again after a year, how difficult it will be. 

I got my job 2 years ago and it was a lot of work but didn't feel terrible. But I have heard that the job market has only been getting worse, and I'm worried about what the state of it will be in another year. On the other hand, I feel like having a startup on my resume (even a failed one) could be a good plus, but I'm not too sure. This is the area where I would love to get some advice, please let me know your thoughts!

11lyhp4,SWE thinking of returning to university to study Mechanical Engineering or Applied Physics – do you feel it would be worth the time investment?,"Interest is split between both areas, but I understand future options would be easier with ME.

So I've dug myself into a hole by pigeonholing myself doing grunt iOS development for the last decade. No interest in either my current job or software development, but always regretted not studying physics/maths or engineering first day.

Am I completely delusional considering such a drastic change? Being on the inside I see so many tech jobs (Mobile/Web) as barely being above a high-school level of problem solving. Most roles are akin to a technician rather than an engineer. And don't get me started on the hoops needed to change jobs with homework assignments and coding tests. I want to solve interesting problems, but also understand more about how the world works.

Ignoring money – engineers that switched to tech, are you doing more rewarding work? Developers, do you generally feel the time/cost investment would be better spent in changing directions within tech?

Lastly for context, I'm in my late 30s and based in Europe, so I am looking at English speaking universities (Netherlands, Ireland, UK) for a bachelor's degree. Fees wouldn't break the bank in the Netherlands (€2k/yr); rent without full-time work is the main cost.

116oopo,FTC has proposed banning non-compete agreements. PLEASE go comment in support of this for your own good.,"Short summary:

The FTC has proposed a rule to ban non-competes, and retroactively invalidate old ones.

For those not familiar, many tech companies outside of California force employees to sign horrible non-competes that prevent you from getting other jobs related to that. These are downright evil.

Why?

1. They can be super broad, capturing massive industries or technologies

2. They can include ""lists of competitors that we can add to at any time""

3. They apply to nearly everyone, not just those with sensitive information

4. They are absolute bullshit. These contracts essentially would prevent you from working at companies with the exact skillset you grew.

If you were laid off right now, and couldn't get a new job because of this? How stuck would you be?

10gp81b,Taking a vaguely tech-related internship? (Freshman),"Have one potential internship opportunity which essentially is like a “help desk” job (e.g. troubleshooting, application support, data entitlements, etc). The job itself does not mention any programming/software aspects. Would it be worth taking this as a freshman summer job when my career goals are more SWE-related? 

My other options are seeking out a summer research opportunity with a professor at my uni (don’t have anything secured yet), applying to other, more tech-focused internship roles (slim chances), or just staying home and using the time to Leetcode.",2023-01-20 06:05:03
106qzvr,A Warning - some people are having offers rescinded,"I just wanted to bring up a much undiscussed topic that could have a potentially major impact. Especially if you have put in your notice already.

That topic is offers being rescinded.

This is not to scare anyone from making that switch. Rather this post is to make people aware that yes, this is a thing. While you shouldn't let it scare you away, you need to understand that it does exist.

This usually happens more during economic downturns - and 2022/likely 2023 are considered to be downturn years. If you go here: https://layoffs.fyi/ you will see names added to the list nearly every day. While engineers are more resistant than most jobs, they are not immune. 

It is a known fact that companies like Amazon, Meta, and Google have rescinded offers:
https://www.siasat.com/resigned-at-google-this-techie-saw-his-job-offer-rescinded-by-amazon-2472862/
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/technology/google-rescinds-job-offers-to-contract-workers.html
https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-canceled-jobs-to-international-engeineers-hiring-freeze-2022-10

While this has never happened to me, I know it did happen at a local company I used to work for. 

While there is no way to completely protect yourself, I would recommend asking questions after receiving the offer:

1: Does the offer have any contingencies? The only answer I'd expect is a background check and possibly a credit check. Aside from being a victim of ID theft, you know if you're clean or not. The same with credit score - you can find that online at a site like BankRate.

2: How has the company been doing? How did it do during the pandemic? And, did supply chain issues from war in Ukraine have an effect?

3: Know how important the project you are doing is for the company. Is it critical - or will it be the first to be scrapped?

Again, you can never fully protect yourselves and there's risks with everything. But you can be aware, you can take steps, and odds are you'll be perfectly fine.",2023-01-08 18:55:40
zcxufc,Should I be wary of internships/junior positions at small companies?,"Hey there, I'm trying to get my first-ever programming job at the moment,  and I'm applying for every company I see. Especially as I graduate soon.

However, my GPA is really low (specifically 2 out of 9), and because of this, I  think I might be pushed into working for a smaller company.

However, a lot of the small companies and start-ups I'm seeing, seem like they might be *too small*. Potentially only 5 employees. I'm starting to get paranoid of problems that might occur such as:

* Being expected to do massive things outside of my ability, but quickly
* Being over-worked, pressured to do more work than I'm capable of and outside of work-hours
* If I have a problem with a co-worker, manager, or team-leader, I'll likely be trapped with that (especially as they might literally be the owner)

I guess every company needs to start somewhere, but I feel like I'd need to be a lot more experienced to be able to work at a start-up or small company, with very little stress.

Am I being paranoid, or are there potential dangers that I should be watching out for, especially as an intern at these small-companies?",2022-12-05 05:19:03

yoppdj,What's the best approach to job search if you wanna be working at the intersection of 2 or 3 different roles?,"CS background, worked in IT positions. I find myself at the intersection of technology, product and futurism; needless to say I have several interests and I'm not the classic IT/dev person. With that said, I do understand the technicalities, can code, think forward and I have an eye for design/details; most importantly I understand the users, connect things, ideas and people in a non linear way.

There is no job title to look for while seeking a position embedding all those different elements. Perhaps, creative technologist or solutions engineer are the job titles which get closer; however, most of the times are either used for different roles (solutions engineer but then they look for support o.o) or require too much specialisation (e.g. you need to be a designer, for instance).

y8xjju,Doctorate ambitions in Machine Learning with BSc in Economics,"Hello,

&#x200B;

This question has plagued me for a long time since I was a freshman during my BSc. Long story short, I quickly realized I was not too fond of Economics as a discipline, and I dedicated all my spare time to learning machine learning. I still did my ""homework"" during my BSc and graduated with excellent grades (corny as that sounds), and I undertook a well-received dissertation in machine learning for asset pricing.

&#x200B;

I then created a GitHub portfolio of a few projects and interned at Ernst and Young for a while as part of their credit risk team, doing some machine learning. I then went on to do an MSc at a technical university, among the best in my country, Greece, with another well-received dissertation in MADRL. I am now hunting for Ph.D. opportunities, exclusively abroad.

&#x200B;

The thing is, I feel my CV is extraordinarily underwhelming and uncompetitive, primarily due to my undergrad and secondarily due to no publications. I have seldom witnessed any doctoral students in fields other than electrical engineering, CS, or physics/math. I think I will be auto-disqualified when the committees read about ""Economics"" in my BSc like they did when I applied for master's degrees abroad.

&#x200B;

What's worse is that I believe I am also uncompetitive for the kinds of jobs that interest me, like research / applied (deep) machine learning engineer at tech companies. Meanwhile, I am apparently unqualified for financial engineering jobs (quant) at serious institutions because they prefer STEM graduates.

&#x200B;

Therefore it's unclear what my subsequent actions should be if I do not get any offers this year, which honestly sounds like a genuine possibility. I can't get the jobs I want, and the jobs I can get, I don't want.

&#x200B;

Do you have any words of advice for me?",2022-10-20 12:55:38
xcvsn8,Company wants to buy everything and build nothing,"My company was acquired in 2021. Since then, the new CEOs have wanted to replace everything with SaaS and PaaS and extremely cheap Indian subcontracted work. Hubspot, Shopify etc.

I had the opportunity to do some technical leadership for a few months while working with a very talented 1099 and our DBA. We were moving much faster and we were generating far more valuable software than the PaaS project which has been a boondoggle that is destroying the morale of the people working with it.

Now I have just learned that we will not be taking on the 1099s any more and we should be purely 3rd party CMS, LMS etc. Our business has a lot of essential complexity and we were fortunate to have some solid software built in the past.

I am pretty exhausted with working alone and I feel like I have had my legs cut out from under me. Furthermore, I feel like the leadership is clueless as to how flaky our infrastructure is with all of the duct tape required to keep these systems working together.

That’s all I was supposed to do was program and make changes to there web app as described in my interview and contract. I am the only software engineer for the entire company. 

I signed at 90k. Since my signing I got put in charge of dealing with the transfer of code, servers and databases which is way more than just programming already, but I was happy to do it. 

Recently I pitched just doing a total revamp of the software from scratch, they have a good financial backing and are willing to let me contract out 4 software engineers plus myself for this revamp.  So now my responsibilities are to plan out a new user interface, new database architecture and api architecture, and finally a mobile app to compliment the web application. 

They expect me to oversee, plan and manage the entire project, on top of take on my own chunk of software production. I have mentioned a salary increase with the changed responsibilities, and it sounds like we are going to have that convo soon. My intuition is telling me my salary should be in the neighborhood of 140k+. 

The caviat that I’m unsure how to deal with is the fact that I just signed and agreed to 90k in January. I’m quite inexperienced (graduating college next week) but am excited that they are giving me the chance. Is 140k+ for taking this on realistic, at my level of experience provided they have full confidence in my abilities? (Sr level software managers make 200-300k in this industry so I am thinking lower end of this salary range to compromise for my inexperience). Keep in mind this coming nets around 1.2 million annually, and has a full staff (30-50 employees). 

How should I go about the conversation coming up? Is 140k for the responsibilities described realistic? Why or why not?

I am a civil engineer from Pakistan. I'm seeking career advice.

I'm working as a Trainee/Junior BIM ( Building Information Modelling) Engineer. I was always fond of computers. I wanted to do CS but couldn't since my family forced me not to do it at that time and so I chose civil. While working my current job, I'm also fixing minor computer problems ( like installing softwares, controlling fan speeds etc as others are noob). 

First of all, i think there's no career progression for me over here as I have 2 seniors, 1 Bim specialist and a manager. Since organization follows Heirarchy , It would take me forever to become a manager. Secondly, I think working in cyber security or data science or AI would be awesome and would give me satisfaction. I've learned basics of python, also learning JavaScript. 

How can I transition from a BIM engineer to AI or cyber security etc? Would i be able to get a scholarship in these fields? I would love to go to USA or Canada or European countries like Germany if provided with scholarship or a Job. 

Most important point is working with computers give me immense pleasure.

p3eipc,Moving from government to private? How difficult?,"So I've been working as a programmer/devops at a small institution for almost 13 years now.  I basically had the best boss ever on day 1, and co-workers that treated each other(and me) like family.  It's been an amazing ride all around, except for the abysmal salary(even with 3 promotions, I'm around 70k). 


Fast forward to now and the boss retired.  His replacement has annihilated the office dynamics and continues to pile one bad decision on top of another.  I've never been this miserable going to work.


I'm looking around at other government jobs, but I'm considering what a transition to the private sector might look like.


I'm most worried about my coding skills being so stale.  I'd consider myself a full stack developer, but have very little experience with any modern frameworks. I'm most at home just banging out straight php, sql and javascript, because that's what underpins our applications.  I've learned the basics of python, Android, and node on my own with a couple personal projects, but that's about it.


I do love the work still and am nowhere near being burnt out on coding. Interesting problems and projects easily hold my attention, many of which are from my own initiative.  I also have picked up a large degree of business analyst skills(reqs, specs, QA, user training, processes,etc).


How marketable am I or could I be with a realistic time investment?  Is it 6mo of studying and practicing tests/interview questions before landing anything?  What types of positions/levels would I be looking at? I really have no idea.  My parents were also in government and my friends are in totally different industries.


If it matters I don't have a bachelor's.  I'm self-taught and just learn quicker that way.

odi3rm,How difficult is it to get a fulltime software engineering interview as a college dropout?,"Hello everyone! I've seen a few posts regarding dropping out, but I think my situation might be a bit different? I'm not really sure.

I interned at a FAANG company last summer, and got a return offer, so I'm interning for them again now. My project seems actually meaningful and nontrivial this time, and things seem to be going well.

But I have a strong desire to drop out of college (CS degree, have 2 years left), most of which stems from the fact that I think it's very expensive and very uninteresting. Last semester was really rough, I remember feeling super disgusted with the fact that I had homework to do, and was generally suicidal because of it.

This leads to my beloved personal hobby at the moment, which is competitive programming. Unlike homework problems, the issue isn't understanding what you're being asked and then following instructions, but instead whether your problem solving skills/creativity are strong enough. I'm decently satisfied with my improvement, got google code jam rank \~550 after 2 years of learning :\^) But anyways, the point is that I feel college is extremely dull in comparison.

So back to the question I guess, does anyone have an estimation on the probability of me receiving a fulltime interview from some respectable tech company? In addition to my internships, I've done a few projects, the primary one being a react/aws web app I've worked on for \~7 months. In theory, I should have a very high interview to offer conversion rate, so it's possible that a single interview would suffice.

You could also try to convince me not to drop out? idk lol, a much bigger chance of staying alive plus \~300k of opportunity cost over 2 years seems to outweigh any harm in getting shafted by employers due to no degree imo

oa1juy,Feeling lost [RANT],"I just graduated in June.

I've been spending my weeks doing some leetcode, checking out random free online courses, and applying to more jobs.

I feel like I've had no success in my job pursuit with my email inbox pretty much being filled with ""Thank you for applying to company {X}"" and nothing else.

Every time I look for new grad positions, all I see is job descriptions asking for 3-5+ experience in some framework or technology I have never heard of or have I only touched for 10-weeks of my college journey. I still apply because what's there to lose, but yeah, to no avail. And now, I got spam emails and random phone calls from Recruiters asking if I'm interested in Sr. Software Engineer roles. Like bruh.

I've had my resume checked and revamped by friends who I consider exceptional students (working at: Twitter, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Amazon), So I don't feel like my resume is the issue. I got at least one not-special internship from a small company under my belt so that must mean something I guess.

The only thing I feel lacking is that I am a hybrid major (Half CS + Half LA). The college I fall into is LA still so my education says ""BS in Liberal Arts and Computer Science"". I'm feeling that maybe recruiters just instantly see ""Liberal Arts"" and chuck it away. At the same time, I don't feel like my major is that much of a concern as alumni from my major pretty much all end up as software engineers. And the college itself is quite reputable / top ranking in California. But it is a very new and small department with only a handful of students. The pool of alumni is incredibly small with only software engineer examples.

I'm starting to doubt myself on whether I'm applying to the right things or using my major correctly. I've mainly been applying for software QA roles as TDD feels like the main thing I've taken away from college with friends motioning for me to get into the same field. At the same time, I've been advised to look into consulting positions which I've been applying to as well (but honestly more interested in an engineering role) with about as much success as my software job search.

I just don't know if I'm taking the job hunting path correctly. For software engineer roles, I've been trying to learn popular frameworks but feel like there's too much new stuff for my bad-at-retaining-memory brain can handle. Unless I'm doing something consistently, it all disappears from my brain given 1-2 weeks time. I've done probably 200 applications since Spring with only a handful of interviews.

Worst to me being that I never was the best programmer. I was known for getting projects done fast, but not efficiently since I brute force hard and stayed up late hours. So my algorithm skills suck which leetcode has made me realize nonstop. Is my direction just bad? Any tips for job hunting for people of my situation? Thank you for listening to rant.

o1hzmz,New mod and unrestricted posting,"I've recently requested and been granted modship of /r/cscareers - and it is now, once again, an unrestricted subreddit.  People can post comments and questions.

I'd like to have this sub reflect the original goals as described in [Why this sub exists](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/4g6sxc/why_this_sub_exists/)

> cscareerquestions mods are recruiters and perma-ban any negative discussion about tech companies. Talk there is limited to stupid shit that CS workers don't care about like ""my recruiter never called me back."" (No shit, you were declined.) It should be called pre-cs career questions. Real industry workers need a place to discuss real issues. What companies are not good places to work? What very good opportunities are out there? What are industry trends. So, maybe cscareers will be that place, maybe not. If you want to ask about your internship, hearing back from a recruiter, or if you can get into the tech industry, head over to /r/cscareerquestions. If you ARE part of the tech industry, please post here or somewhere else.

While I'm not going to 100% endorse the phrasing there, that's what I'd like to have the sub focus on.

In that, have this be a place that *isn't* focusing on the job seeking and job changing questions that /r/cscareerquestions has.

There is also a lot of features that Reddit has which could make this a sub that is easier to use - post flair, automod rules, etc...  And so, I'm looking for advice for what others would like to see that isn't offered by or hard to find with other subs.",2021-06-16 22:55:58

ejht6x,"Request for Advice: When you know something is a bad idea, but you can't argue the point clearly","This has happened a few times in my career. It's a different story, but the same script...

1. Someone outranking or more experienced proposes a decision
2. I just _know_ that's _probably_ not going to end well
3. I can't _prove_ it's absolutely a bad idea. It even has some good points. It's not a _completely_ bad idea, but my gut is telling me ""no, don't do it!""
4. It doesn't end well. Someone says, ""Well, hindsight is 20/20. How do we move forward?"" ...but I was pretty sure everything that happened *would probably happen*.

I know this is fairly abstract, but abstract is a lot of what we do around here. Hopefully, this makes enough sense to illustrate the issue.

The question is: What are some ways to handle this better?

I suppose the most obvious is: Spend some time thinking about it. But that's very open ended. We often have too much work to do to spend all our time obsessing and rechecking every little point of discussion. Perhaps my expectations for near-perfect results exceeds our resources/abilities? Should I accept that mistakes will be made, _even when someone knows better?_ I just don't believe in that kind of thinking. Now I'm rambling...

Edit: I should also say... This doesn't happen all the time. I have gotten better at quickly figuring out exactly _why_ ""I have a bad feeling about this."" :) But this above script still plays out from time to time. Recently, it cost us a lot of time in recovery. And I think the answer to ""how do we move forward?"" should be ""avoid this kind of decision making in the future.""

Edit 2: You may assume I _do_ have an alternative idea. Generally, the decision being made is whether one course of action is better than another. Often times the major implications are generally understood by the group. I think it comes down to sizing up relative risks... Come to think of it, maybe that's helpful to understand when addressing this. Thoughts? Anyone want to bounce off of that?",2020-01-03 16:33:43

I have recently landed the position of my dreams at an amazing company. However, there is just one problem. As part of their invention agreement, they ask me to sign over all my inventions currently in existence and ones that do not currently exist for an indefinite amount of time.

e9v434,Experience with FDM Group,"A few months ago, I moved to Florida to start a job with a retail warehouse. I knew the job was too labor intensive for me, so I began to send my resume out before I was fired or forced to quit. So last week, I sent my resume and cover letter to FDM group, and was promptly contacted by a recruiter (name changed to Jennifer for the sake of the story).

Jennifer was nice. She recently graduated from college within the past 3-4 years, and still maintained a youthful, very verbal appeal. She presented herself in a very sweet way, very educated, and was very positive towards me, my experience, and my ability to achieve within FDM from the start.

Our interview followed the form of a conversation. She was even willing to call me on a Sunday and while taking a sick day from work. All this time, she assured me I was a shoe-in, while not preparing me deeply for the format of the final, in-person interviews.

The day after our first conversation, I completed an on-line assessment. It was timed, around 25 minutes, consisting of a few arithmetic problems, set-theoretic/probabilty questions, and a toy algorithm. It wasn't very hard, honestly, considering I had just completed a 10 hour shift of manual labor and was partially buzzed from a few drinks.

The next day after work, I plastered my hair down, threw on a polo shirt, and answered a series of questions in video format via the FDM application on my iPhone. The questions were not provided prior to the video-response exercise, but it was OK. I knew enough about public speaking to BS until the timer runs down close to zero. She called me that afternoon and said I was all-set for the in-person interview which occurred the following week.

In the meantime, I made a grave error. I quit my job at the warehouse, partially due to stress and exhaustion, partially due to feeling like I would nail both the strength-based portion of the interview, and the tech-based portion of the interview.

Around 11:30 AM on the interview day, the first interviewer Skyped me. She was an account manager for the company, who asked me a number of strength-based questions. I answered her questions with complete throughts, always remembering to answer in the form of introduction-body-conclusion, and always giving an ample answer even when I didn't necessarily know for sure what I was saying.

Some of the questions asked were

* What was your proudest moment besides obtaining your degree?
* Your client presents a deadline due to unforseen problems. What do you do in that situation?
* How do you manage tasks when stess levels are high?
* Etc.

&#x200B;

Then a few minutes later, the technical interviewer called via Skype as well. I could tell from the first impression, the look on her face, that she didn't like me. She spoke with a British accent, was very formal, and cut straight to the questioning without allowing me to be build rapport with her through small-talk or informal conversation.

She asked me a few questions about my experience gathering and sorting data. I mentioned a project I worked on as a student in the field of computational astronomy, involving querying a database via a web-based frontend, applying noise filters to images acquired from a telescope, and fitting the images together to form an RGB image via opensource software.

She asked me how I interacted with the software. And I said ""via the command line interface in Linux and Macintosh."" Her reply was ""So it was a UNIX environment? How do you change directories in UNIX?"" To which I gave the correct response, \`cd\` as well as \`ls\` for viewing the directory tree.

She asked me about my experience visualizing data. I told her that I had experience with the Python libraries \`matplotlib\` and \`seaborn\` while telling her that my favorite function from Seaborn is the \`pairplot\` function, which displays scatterplots of all pairs of variables. She asked me then what was the difference between a scatterplot and a line plot, and my response was that a scatterplot shows individual data points AS POINTS while a line plot connects the dotted data points with lines. She asked me if Microsoft Excel could plot both a scatterplot and a line plot at the same time. My response was ""yes , you can show both at the same time.""

During the interview, she interrupted one of my responses, and told me that I seemed to be very focused on Data Analysis, whereas the position, called ITSM, consisted of project management and Business Analytics. My response was that I was very analytical in nature, and that my management style required the collection of data to inquire about productivity as well as managing the budget and deadline. I was a bit thrown-off by her interruption, thinking that Business Analytics and Data Analytics were similar, if not the same.

Her final question involved Microsoft excel. I told her about an experience I had for a non-profit performing a root cause analysis on one of their business processes, and that I had used Python's \`pandas\` library to tally errors in the data by using Pivot tables. I told her I was also familiar with Excel's ability to drag down on cells to fill columns iteratively. She asked me if I knew how it worked, and mentioned it was called relative referencing. My mind drew a blank , but I tried my best to describe the way the reference is incremented iteratively through the dragging feature of Excel.

A few hours later, Jennifer called me in a very emotional state. She told me I did well on the strength-based interview portion of the process, but had failed the technical portion. In retrospect, I do feel like the interviewer was biased against me from the start, having felt a gut-instinct that she didn't like me for some reason. Jennifer told me she would forward the numerical results of the interview to me at a later date, and that she wants to continue working with me if I wanted to interview again in 3 months, or if I wanted to speak to any of her recruiter friends along the East Coast.

My conclusion is this. If you want to work in tech or coding, do some research on the format of the interview process. Find out how they want you to answer the questions. The tech interviewer told Jennifer that I answered with broad, high-level knowledge instead of giving specific answers, and she thought I didn't know what I was talking about. Don't rely on the recruiter's opinion of your strength as a candidate and go into it blind. Your best bet is to receive coaching and training regarding technical interviews before approaching a company about a job. You may not receive another call for a while.",2019-12-12 22:55:52
e80srx,Best path toward becoming a Machine Learning Engineer,"For some context into my experience level, I have been working as a Software Engineer for the last two years at a startup.

I had no assignment for 8 months and was recently informed that I will be moving into a production support role while keeping the same title as systems developer.

ct4go0,Changing careers from 6 figure salary ?,"Hi all, 

Need some advice about changing careers.  Currently, I'm a pharmacist and I can't stand it.  The main benefits are the salary and my schedule (night shift, 5 on/5 off).  However, there are some changes in the pharmacist labor market that are making me think it might be time to start looking for something else.  The job market is saturated, pharmacist hours and salaries are being cut, stores closing, new grads having hard time finding full time employment, etc. 

 I can honestly see my job being replaced by automation as well.  A robot could check prescriptions much faster and more accurately than I ever could. I just turned 38 2 weeks ago and want to get out before I get much older and/or SHTF.  I've always had a strong passion for computers and the internet and would like to switch careers.

cpddlo,My software development journey one week after finishing Thinkful's Software Engineering Immersion,"As the title says, I recently finished a bootcamp with Thinkful that taught full stack web development (React, Node, and PostgreSQL). Having finished a week ago, I am four weeks into my job search and, well, it's been... interesting. In summary, the reason for this post is that I can't figure out how to split my time between coding (learning Redux, building a Python project, etc.), algorithm problems (Cracking the Coding Interview, LeetCode, InterviewCake, etc.), or job applications. 

I have conducted about six interviews at this point, most of which have been a quick phone screen followed by an online assessment. These coding challenges have been totally disparate, from timed algorithm problems to building a to-do-list and styling a landing page to building a full stack booking app. Across the board, one aspect of the process has stood out to me... I suck at algorithm problems despite throwing myself at several different resources. I also can't seem to motivate myself to crank out problems in the same way that I can work on a coding project or job applications. Algo problems feel so far removed from the work that I will be doing as a front end developer, and what I *want* is to focus on my portfolio and networking to find the best job and fit. Yet, I have bombed two of the six interviews because in attempting to solve an algo problem I can merely write a brute force messy solution that runs in O(n\^2)... 

See, I understand data structures pretty well, and I could probably write quick sort or merge sort from scratch if I had an hour, but when it comes to solving a complex algorithm that I have never seen I just get stuck and spend thirty minutes trying to understand the problem. In an in-person interview (which I've never had, I should add - only mock interviews), you have the ability to field questions. When the clock is ticking in some virtual browser environment that I've never used, I often feel a sense of terror which is certainly not conducive to success. 

The lead engineer of one start-up I've been interviewing with literally told me he could care less about subjecting me to white boarding questions, which was quite refreshing to hear. Instead, I built a small full stack booking app for them, answered several technical questions about React, advanced JS, and so on. This has allowed me to show off my *actual* abilities and I have felt much more confident as such. 

In conclusion, I guess I feel stuck. Every interview is different and I'm so eager to find a job that I basically spend all of my time coding, reading about code, doing leetcode problems, applying to hundreds of jobs, going to events, etc. I feel like I'm doing everything I can, but it may actually be best for me to slow down and focus on interview problems for a week and then hit it hard again. I need to figure out how to optimize my time. I'd be super interested in anyone's thoughts. Thank you for reading!",2019-08-12 14:49:47

b0znnx,Final year in undergrad CS & feel totally incompetent,"Hi guys,

I am in my senior year of my CS major and I am supposed to be doing the whole job search thing now. I know everyone thinks it's easy to get a job with a degree like this, but the fact is, I don't feel like I've learned anything. 

It scares me to program anything and I have somehow made it all the way through my degree, barely skating by the whole time. My goal has become ""just pass the class."" Somehow, that's earned me pretty much straight B-s. I don't know how the hell I'm going to get a job when something as simple as debugging scares me. I don't understand how to use github. I can't believe I've gotten this far avoiding my programming assignments. I have no idea how to feel like a marketable applicant when I don't think my skills are where they need to be at all-- and it seems a little late to learn now. 

I guess I'm just asking what to do now. I bought Cracking the Coding Interview. I'm hoping to pass my classes in this last semester. I just don't know. I have been known to be down on myself and I'm hoping it's just a case of that. I went to my 75 year old professor and he said he'd never encountered anyone in his entire career who, at the end of their degree, felt like they couldn't program. 

I'm a personable human, and I tend to interview well. I am also a strong writer, so I can communicate pretty well. I also think I'm capable of learning this stuff-- but the time limit of getting a job is terrifying me. Any advice you have would be incredible. ",2019-03-14 12:19:41

amibyj,Almost no passion for CS anymore and not productive with CS,"I have a Bachelor's degree in computer science, and have landed a few good internships in the past.  Right now, I have almost zero passion for computer science.  I'm not entirely sure why, but I would say it's partially because I started coding when I was 11, and it just seems really tedious and old at this point.  Front end, back end, whatever doesn't matter.  Another part is that I am recovering from mental illness (depression, or something like that, depending on who you ask), but in the real world you can't necessarily just break it down into 1) cure depression 2) continue with real life. 

&#x200B;

 I had a full-time software engineering job last year, but I got fired after a few months because of lack of productivity.  I was literally doing about 5-7 hours of work during a 40 hour work week - not because I was lazy or undisciplined, but that is all I could actually manage.  I could be looking at the code and the requirements, and my brain would just not be functioning (hard to relate to if you haven't experienced it).

&#x200B;

Anyway, does anyone had any CS career / life advice about this?  The only thing that might strike up my passion again in CS is something research-y, like cutting-edge AI work or designing new models of computation.  But, I only have a Bachelor's degree, and there is a long road to get to that point that I don't feel at all confident I can do right now.  If I had a boring CS job but it were part-time, I might be able to handle that, but I have not been able to land a part-time coding job yet.

Should I just give up on CS for now?  Any advice?

9ymcdm,I feel like my remote location and lack of experience are making getting a job impossible. What kinds of things should I be looking for?,"Hey there. I graduated back in May 2018 and have had an incredibly hard time getting a job. To best explain my situation, I'll get some basic facts out of the way first:

* I have a BS in CS.
* I live in a super remote place - no neighbors or anything, just a trailer in the middle of farmland. The nearest city is Cincinnati OH, about an hour+ away.
* I have no programming experience outside of minor school projects. I've never worked in a team or had an internship or even properly used git. I've never done full stack development, just regular standalone programs. I learned some software engineering-related terms like Agile/Waterfall and general terms like PassByReference, but never implemented anything complex in practice.
* My hobby programming is limited to python scripts, game clones in C, UE4 Blueprints, RasPi IOT projects, and emulation/ROMhacking-related (dis)assembly. I think game development is cool, but mostly as a hobby - I don't think I'd enjoy trying to make a game where I'm not in control of everything, nor am I qualified to work as a game developer.
* I have access to a car, but:
 - It's a 96 Saturn in poor condition (flat tire, check engine lights, stuff like that.)
 - I don't know how to drive (never went to driving school, got my license at 18 and haven't driven much at all since) and have a fear of driving at on highways, merging, etc. I'd really like to be able to work at a place that doesn't require travel and has affordable housing <20 minutes away.
* I have slow internet (4 Mb/s down, 0.33 Mb/s up), which would probably make remote work hard if I have to pull down large decentralized databases to my own device.
* I have no idea what CS work is like. I see offers for software engineers on the internet, but even the entry level stuff want at least a little experience. I'm not sure what else is out there, even just in terms of job titles that I could be googling.
* I have about $600 to my name, but thankfully no debt at all (thank you, loopholes!). I mention this because I want to show that I don't have access to moving, buying a new car, etc. as well as the fact that, while getting a job ASAP is best, I'm not sinking any further (financially) if I have to wait for the right position to come along.

I'm really clueless as to what to do. I don't know much about CS careers, nor do I have any related experience to help me know what to look for. Here are my questions I leave to you:

* **Should I be looking for internships or full-time jobs?**

* **What kind of websites are best for that, and what should I be typing in** (based on my qualifications/experiences/hobbies listed above)**?**

* **What locations/job styles would work best?** As in, should I take out a big loan and move into an apartment near a far-away workplace if I were to get hired for a regular job? Or should I shoot for something that lets me work from home so I can avoid travel issues? Sorry for being more of a general advice question than CS.

* **Are there any topics I should be familiar with (or projects I should try) before going into an interview?** I hear that some places ask actual programming questions and even use whiteboards, but most ""typical interview questions"" I see on Google are way over my head because I haven't really written much object-oriented code and all the specific syntax/definitions I learned in school were forgotten the day after the exam. (Of course, I'm not a *total* idiot - I got good grades and even was briefly hired back in June, but I found out day 1 that the job required too much travel and I didn't even have a car at the time, so I had to quit. To be fair though, I only had a single phone ""interview"" and the company was kinda shady to begin with).

Thanks for reading through this! Sorry if this is less CS-focused and more general financial/life advice. I just have no idea where to go - even if I manage to make get an interview and the position, I don't think I really have access to getting *to* the workplace considering my location, let alone the job being anything more resume-worthy than a generic tech support job. :/

Thanks again for reading through!",2018-11-19 23:37:03

95y914,Career Options For An Excellent Programmer Who's Currently A Bit Of An Old Fuddy-Duddy?,"**TL/DR:  Trying to help an aging semi-retired programmer who wants to ""code until he can't"" actually figure out what to do with himself next.  What should he think about doing with himself next?**

(oops -- meant to post this on /cscareerquestions, messed up the sub, but would love your input, too!  I just see that it's a smaller sub)

I have a family friend who's a brilliant algorithm / systems designer and bug-hunter/preventer.

Feedback from colleagues is that he can see/anticipate problems no one else can see.

UG & PhD from tippy-top universities in the field.

But ... his skills are out-of-date.

He hasn't worked in 6 years (lived off savings and did ""personal life"" projects when his last employer went under as a semi-retirement, figuring he'd look for work again ""at some point"").

And, to put a cherry on top, he moved far from home and about a 1.5-2 hour commute from any ""old tech"" programming job hubs.

But the ""personal life"" projects have wrapped up now, and he wants to work as a programmer again.

If I think about the common thread running through his experience, I'd say that he specialized in ""designing cutting-edge or innovative **back-end controls for highly-networked real-world systems**.""  Lead developer/architect on ""First-in-industry"" or ""greatly improved"" controls for things like airline reservations, telephone switching, publicly traded financial markets, etc.

It makes sense -- it let him do **useful work on interesting challenges with high stakes** while leveraging older knowledge of networking and mostly sticking to older programming languages (C, C++, Unix scripting, etc).

That said, I think the last employer having such a project available was a bit of a lucky find, and I think that now, in 2018, it's gotten particularly tough for him to find work that he can just jump into as-is.

He does have a few personal obstacles to the job search -- but that's out-of-scope for this thread.  Still, perhaps a bit relevant to guiding answers to my questions.  He's always been the type to be ""extrinsically motivated"" by other people *(e.g. adores walking but never gets out unless someone else says, ""Want to go for a walk?"")* and deadlines, so he hasn't yet taken the plunge into intensive study from new skills or seeking out nonprofit work to do for free because, well, it can be hard to get someone with that type of personality to ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps"" *(especially while the various semi-retirement personal projects were so much more appealing)*.  And, honestly, when it comes to intensive study, I can understand the paralysis.  I've spent half my life perfecting my French as a second language, and while I adore foreign language study and really, really, really want to learn German or Arabic or something, I've never gotten past a bit of ""conversational tourist Spanish/Italian"" *(which doesn't count because French)* -- starting all over and putting in the amount of work I put in as a teenager to truly *learn* French seems unbelievably daunting as an adult with a life and responsibilities.  While he can certainly tell that ""data science"" is big and ""software is now developed with the web browser as an operating system"" is largely true and ""blockchain"" is complicated and corporate and probably interesting, those are ... completely different skills that involve a lot of study.  As daunting as my ""I really should"" decision to actually pick German or Arabic and keep with it enough to get fluent.  I can see why he picked the personal projects instead of writing a coin miner or making a mini web app or writing a digit-recognizing neural network thus far.

Anyway, I think he's being very self-aware in deciding to just ""work with recruiters and try to find 'a job' the traditional way"" / ""search for jobs online and apply to them"" so as to have an ""I have to be at work"" / ""I have to study this for work"" extrinsic bootstrap.

But, of course, it's not working because, well, job-hunting is slow, especially under such circumstances.  :-)

**So my main question is ...**

- **What kind of business needs are still out there where ""brilliant people with rusty old hard skills, but not literally FORTRAN/COBOL,"" are valued?**  And does any such work allow remote or mostly-remote or mostly-remote-after-the-team-gets-to-know-each-other?  I'd like to **help him more strategically target search keywords, industries to cold-call companies from, etc.**

**My secondary question is ...**

- He'll probably never get as ""fluent"" in new technologies as he is in old ones, but of course he's smart enough to get ""reasonably useful"" in maybe one area *(before old age starts to take a toll on the body and reduce working hours, like it or not)* if he could only pick *(same as I could, of course, learn German if I would just get over my FOMO of picking the wrong language)*.
- So ... does any technology ""heavily used today"" strike you as ""**the first thing he should close the door and study**""?  Basically, am I forgetting to suggest anything that's practically ""learning Spanish"" if his old skills and experience are French?  Or skills currently used for the kind of work he used to do *(""how do I make these transactions flow and organize them more effectively / beat someone else to conducting this transaction / overhaul this system to newer technology"" -- keeping in mind that there's NO WAY he's going to beat out some fresh millennial who's been working for the last 6 years to make a tool he's just started studying run faster at Netflix)*?  Or skills that are tangential to his old skills+work -- in other words, ""Arabic"" for me *(since I could begin Arabic while job-hunting for jobs in France working with Moroccan immigrants)*?",2018-08-09 17:00:34
8snvid,Coding Bootcamp (Hack Reactor) vs. normal state university,"Alright guys, I'm sure you've probably gotten plenty of questions like this before. I'm a newcomer to this sub. If there is a master thread, or some kind of other resource on this sub, I'd be happy to refer to that first.

I currently work in the translation industry as a project coordinator. It's mostly administrative work combined with customer service. I'm looking to transition into a CS career where I'd get to either design websites or software (I have no preference, but I do want to learn full stack so I stay with an app from beginning to end). I've done stuff on Codecademy, Udemy, and am doing the prep course from Hack Reactor called SSP (Structured Study Program) that cost me 250 bucks.

I've been enjoying coding so far, and am certain this is a field I want to pursue. I find Hack Reactor attractive as they have a remote part time program that lasts 9 months, so I'd be able to work while doing it. It seems to be a quicker path to get into the field versus a degree.

Now, Hack Reactor boasts of very high job placements rates (over 90&#37;), but I heard that bootcamp grads are now struggling to get placed in jobs, very likely due to how many bootcamps popped up. This one grad from this bootcamp mentioned that in the past year, it was more like 53&#37;. Also, most job openings I've seen for developer positions prefer that you have a degree in CS.

I already have an English college degree, and I'd be able to get a BS in Computer Science within 2 years or so from my old state college. I graduated back in May 2014 originally.  
I wanted to get your thoughts on bootcamps vs a BS CS degree in regards to which is the best route in obtaining an entry level position.  
What are your thoughts either regarding my situation or your own experience with bootcamps?",2018-06-21 01:34:16
8r3mtg,"Do positions like *this* exist? (Low-level software, etc.)","EDIT: Meant to post this to /r/cscareerquestions, but I'll leave it here for now unless someone wants to remove it.

Hey there,

I just finished my senior year with a BS in CS (among a few IT minors). I did pretty well academically, but unfortunately I spent my summers taking more classes instead of getting internships. As a result, I have absolutely no programming experience outside of few minor personal projects and the occasional class project. While I can say I've used 10+ languages, I don't really have any *experience* with them. My only jobs have been with management of tech support, hardware deployment, etc. - nothing with a whole lot of programming aside from the occasional script I choose to write to automate the boring stuff.

However, what I really love is the stuff that I never did much in school. I know the big name stuff is in software engineering, but are there jobs in the low level, byte code stuff? I love reverse engineering, emulation as a tool of preserving hardware, romhacking, and performance sensitive code. My favorite projects have been making a *Wolfenstein 3D* clone and writing a very very primitive unix-like ARM OS in C. I just love the low level software that deals with byte-level code. I can't say I'm a fan of the ""full stack"" with tons of high level abstractions and hundreds of proprietary libraries. I don't mind HTML, C# or SQL (or using them in a full MVC context) but I really prefer to use just a few libraries where I know what each does and how the interact - why they're necessary modules and not just bloat.

I can't say I know a whole lot about hardware - sure I've built my own PC, and I am fairly familiar with all sorts of stuff like:

* Disks (not only things like clustered indices and B+ trees but also physical layout issues like seek time and track length)

* How an OS interacts with I/O devices (and RAM, cache, virtual memory, deadlock detection semaphores, etc.)

* The CPU pipeline, etc.

but at the end of the day I'm **not** an engineer by any means. Once we start getting into voltages and circuits, I kind of lose my way. What I do get is general concepts and phenomenons like the 2007-ish Power Wall and 2017's Spectre/Meltdown. I absolutely love crazy workarounds and firmly believe that limitations are the best way to foster creativity.

I feel like most people use their degree in short-lived startups or boring jobs ""maintaining"" some proprietary ERP service.

I'm just a big fan of open software, cronjobs, linux, emulation, and all other fun stuff. (Not a FLOSS purist, but I certainly feel at home there)

**Do jobs with this ""low-level"" abstraction exist? If so, how do they compare to the typical software engineering that everyone clamors about? (both in pay and the type of experience required).**

Also, what other types of CS careers are out there? I've really only hear people talk about things that can be summed up as ""software engineering"". While I love the ideas of agile environments and MVC architecture/abstractions, **I just don't know where to look - or rather, what all is out there?**",2018-06-14 17:17:33
79sggb,Amazon Compensation...do I give a number?,"I’m heading to Amazon for my first in-person interview.  The recruiter I’m working with sent me a bunch of questions via email that she would like me to answer beforehand. Of course, there’s the dreaded compensation piece: “Please provide your total compensation expectations.”  

What does Amazon expect here? Is there an expectation that I answer now? Are they going to keep pushing back until they get a number?  

Also, any advice on what ""total compensation"" consists of, and what I should be asking for each of these areas? I'm assuming it's base salary, on-hire stock, and signing bonus.  

Interested to hear how you would respond via email, and any advice for a 15-minute prep call where it’s expected that the recruiter will talk about compensation again. Thanks!

I feel like even the jobs that say ""new grad"" expect me to have so much practical experience even though a CS degree is mostly theory and fundamentals.

When I was younger, had no problem whatsoever completing 40h/week plus a few hours of freelance contracts during week end.

But nowadays: doing 40h/week the first few months of a new job, but then it drops at 30h/week. I got fired from my previous 2 jobs this way (never been fired before).

Got many warnings from managers that I must fill my timesheets with 40h/week but have no energy for it anymore.

Always completing sprints on time plus working on side tasks when sprint completed before deadline. Managers ""apparently"" happy with performance and quality delivered.

10zzsru,Ideas for questions to ask during informational interviews,"I'm currently attending a software development bootcamp, which includes job search, interview, and networking training.  As an assignment, I need to do at least 5 informational interviews.  If you don't know what that is, it's basically a conversation with someone currently in the field where you ask them questions about themselves and their job, company, and/or industry.  The purposes are to establish a relationship with a person in the field (and put yourself on their radar should an opportunity at their company open up), learn more about the career or job you're trying to pursue, and see if their company may be a good fit.

Some ideas and suggestions that I've gotten already:  Make sure to start the conversation focusing on the person you're talking to, as opposed to getting right into job stuff; Ask about how their team communicates and their flow when working through projects; Make sure to focus the conversation heavily on them instead of yourself; This is my favorite, but I'm almost afraid to ask because it's a big question ""What about your job keeps you up at night?""

So I have a bit of a starting point.  I'm also extremely fortunate to have some personal connections through my wife and friends.  My wife's friend is a CTO of a startup, she works with a manager for a team of data science engineers (not the field I'm going into, but still valuable),  my friend's wife is a developer, and a friend of mine recently started in the field and went through the same course I did. So I have a really strong base of people where at least some of the awkwardness won't be a factor, as opposed to just messaging a stranger on LinkedIn or something like that (which I actually did, and they seemed receptive to having a conversation).

Do you guys have any additional advice on this, whether it's general advice on pursuing or having these conversations, or specific questions that would be helpful to ask.  To be clear about my situation, I'm currently working full-time in the construction industry, so I'm taking this course part-time (basically all of my nights and weekends) in the hopes of making a desperately needed career change.

I've just completed my first year in college studying Accounting and Finance. Tried to do an internship, but honestly couldn't bring myself to complete it. I just....genuinely despise the field now. It's so dull, and all the corporate stuff just seems so hollow to me. I really don't want to continue. So I've been thinking of dropping out and learning web-development/coding, and I'm confident that in 3-4 years (the time it will take me to graduate in accounting) I'll be at a secure place in the field if I go ahead with the plan. Am I wrong?

Now, some questions. Sorry if the formatting is off.

• I am thinking of taking the self-taught route. Is that advisable? 

I plan to use online resources to teach myself. I've an idea of some places where I can start. Plus enrolling into a university to study computer science will get me behind by 2 years, which I don't want to waste.

• What are some qualifications and certificates one can acquire to show their skills aside from portfolio?

• From your experience, how important is it to be a college graduate to be successful in this field?

• Are there any online certification/programs/qualifications, which if completed, stand equal to graduation/college degree? 

The reason I ask this might seem dumb, but a high-school graduate isn't very respected here, even if somewhat successful. So I want to get something equal to a college program, (e.g like ACCA is for Accounting). Something online and cheap? 

• How easy it to find jobs in other countries in this field? 

This is more of a personal wish, but I'd really want a skill that lets me work in different countries and explore them. Oh and again, how much do qualifications/college degree matter for this?

• I'm afraid I'll miss out on college experience, what should I do? 

You know, meeting different people, socializing with people in your field, being part of a highly educated network of people, fun exclusive events. Do i just accept I won't be able to experience anything close to it?

**Strengths**: Regarding the three listed 'Desired Qualifications', I've completed multiple programing certificates in addition to the AAS (e.g. MIT's  Computational Thinking using Python MOOC & U of W's Python 3 specialization); I'm doing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate; and the AAS had courses in C#, [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET), Blazor, SQL, JS, HTML, etc. I at least somewhat fulfill all three.

I have ten years IT experience, which I think should be handy for a position that works to ""support all of our IT systems"". Most of that has been for the government.

\--------

I have been able to get interview offers with Google & Microsoft (due to their veteran's hiring programs, not because I'm amazingly qualified or something); however, after reading the interview preparation guide Google's recruiter sent me, I feel like need to study a lot more. This type of position seems a lot easier.

I have basically infinite free time right now. What would do to ensure the resume, application, and interview were 'perfect' if you were in my position? I'm obviously applying for other jobs, but the location, department, and nature of the position make this one feel ideal to me. I want to maximize my chances.",2022-02-13 06:20:20

It was more than 1 1/2 years before I got my life together, so at that point i had no chance of getting an entry level position.

I started a Masters program in Computer Science, and I landed an internship this summer. I am applying for internships this summer, but I am low on money and I would really like to get a full-time position.

However, it seems like pursuing a Masters has disqualified me from all the entry level positions - I can't even get into places where I satisfy both their minimum and preferred qualifications (sometimes I exceed both).

I would be more than willing to drop my Masters or take a LOA to pursue a full-time position, make money, and get my career started. Should I not mention my masters and simply keep my internship on it? I am worried that I would still get disqualified because of the big gap I have after undergrad program (at this point it is nearly 2.5 years since graduation).

qzpd3l,Advice: Web3 vs Web2 skills,"Hey guys! I'm back again summarizing an interesting conversation I had! Recently I spoke with Shadab, an Experienced Blockchain Dev who recently quit the industry. This post summarizes his thoughts on Smart Contract development, and what it means for beginners. 

After graduation, Shadab decided to work as a Blockchain Engineer for the R&D department of TCS. There, he built Proof of Concepts for big clients from automobile and manufacturing sectors, using technologies like Hyperledger Fabric and the Ethereum Blockchain. Even after SPENDING MILLIONS, clients were not ready to pay for Full Projects using this tech.

🎯 What are smart contracts?

Smart contracts are pieces of code which execute on the nodes of a blockchain network. They have an inbuilt authentication & database layer, and you pay ""gas fees"" to the nodes to execute and store data on the chain.

🎯 Finally, why not learn web3?

While smart contracts are a truly amazing piece of technology, it's not enough to learn it in itself. A Web3 application still needs a UI to be accessible, which is generally built using web technologies like HTML, CSS and JS.

Additionally, since all of the data in a blockchain is public, and the transactions themselves aren't real-time, a traditional backend is still needed to store data privately, and assist in real-time communication.

Hence, learning the old technologies is still equally important.",2021-11-22 16:31:02

Lately, I've been looking into different unconventional jobs that computer science majors can take. Ik all about the high paying ones based on web articles (i.e. software engg, Data scientist, Software architect) i feel that I dont really have a chance at any of these fields (cuz tbh cs has been saturated enough for it to be like music where kids develop apps starting at age 2) since I do not really have anything much to offer in these fields and leave it to them Im looking into diff fields that are quite uncommon and needs a lot of research or manpower that could potentially be useful in one way or another (i.e. Forensics, Computational Social Science). Is there any other fields/jobs like this? If you believe that you have a sort of unconventional job, what do you do? What strides do you think you feel is needed to make your field mainstream?

Now I been job searching for a while so happy to take any offer if I get it but getting a chance to enter a top tech company is something I really want as well. So the question would it be reasonable to ask for until like end of the following week to make a decision? So interview is Tuesday while the FAANG interview is the following Weds. 

Because its going to be over a week and I feel like its kinda weird asking for that long unless I tell them the reason which also feel weird.

chxxkp,Should I quit my job and go back to school?,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons

Brief history, I don’t have a background in programming, don’t have a college degree, didn’t get into programming until I went to a bootcamp two years ago. 

After the bootcamp, I was a TA for the program for 6 months, and then got a position as a TA at another better organized bootcamp and concurrently accepted a job offer from a Fortune 500 software company as QA. second bootcamp finished and I was promoted to a SDET position.

I have been in the SDET position for a bit more than a year now. During this time I have done some coding, altering and writing scripts mostly, and feel like I have learned so much about so many topics (networking, security, etc.), but I don’t really code in my free time. I still read about tech topics, but find I don’t have the energy and need to relax when i’m not at work to relieve stress.

Now though, it feels like there is so much MORE that I don’t know, and on many days I don’t do any coding at all, which leads me to question if I am capable of filling the position of software engineer. I don’t know if this is the same old “imposter syndrome” I hear so much about or if I’m genuinely unqualified.

I am starting to feel that SDET is not the path I want my career to take, I would like to someday be an architect, and am unsure of the best path to get there. I am unhappy in my current role and that is causing a significant amount of stress. 

Should I try to stick it out to the 2 year mark, which is another 6 months, and then look for a position with a different company?

Would going to school for a CS degree give me the foundation I feel I lack to succeed in the industry?

Should I try to find a different position and learn on the job?

Some additional perspective would be very helpful

**tldr;**

I’m trying to figure out if I should 

1. Stay at my SDET job
2. Get a different SWE job
3. Go back to school for computer science

Are Software Engineers in San Francisco for the most part, underpaid in terms of cost of living?

aaxy84,Soon to be Graduate with a CS Degree with some Questions about the Job Search,"Hello all,

I will be graduating this May with a bachelors degree in Computer Science. I had never done anything CS related before college although I have always had a strong interest in technology. These last four years I have immersed myself and have a solid foundation with python, java, C++, and some practice with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

&#x200B;

The one thing that I lack however is practical experience as most of the assignments that we had to do in school were things that don't necessarily have practical uses in society. An example would be my final project for my Machine Learning class where I created a genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem. It is very cool and works well but I don't think many companies will be looking for someone to help them find the shortest path between a bunch of cities. I have never really built any apps, and I feel like when I compare myself to people who have been involved in CS for many years (like many of the people in my classes were) I fall far behind with practical knowledge. For example, I have never had the opportunity nor the need to use GitHub, which is something that I will need to teach myself near future.

&#x200B;

So, my questions are this: What are some of the most fundamental things that someone aspiring to work in the CS field must understand to get a job? What are some things that I can teach myself to give myself a huge leg up in searching for a job or that will make me desirable? What is something that I can do or learn that will enable me to create useful applications that I can show off to people?

&#x200B;

I get very anxious when I think about my post college prospects because I feel like I don't have a very specific career path that I want to follow. Everything that I have ever done that is CS related in college I thoroughly enjoyed and so there isn't one thing in specific that I really want to do more than others, however if I had to pick a subsection of CS it would be that of AI and ML. Any help that can be given would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for reading this wall of text.

2. What do you think about my chances are of getting it denied if I am completely honest with them and say that I have no intention of smoking anymore?

Obviously I had some holes jumping form Physics to EE, but I mostly made up for them by just jumping head first in my EE classes and learning what I needed to know as I found out I needed to know it. Fast forward, I spent the first two years of my career writing firmware/embedded software (the line between the two gets kinda blurry when there isn't an OS involved), got tired of the place I lived, and got a contract position back where I went to school (long distance GF is up there). At the time of the interview for the contract position I was told 'You will be placed wherever we think you are qualified'.

Unfortunately when I got to the contract position they had me doing software QA.

I have an IT course beginning soon and it appears that I'm already in over my head. For example, I know what a router is (it makes the internet work in my house and sits on my desk) but as far as how it truly works I am still unclear. 



I asked my IT professor for recommendations on what I can read to learn the basic before class begins and he basically treated me like an idiot and gave me no answer : (. He referred to the first lesson of the course, which includes jargon like networks and routers, assuming the student already knows what those mean.





I know I have some catching up to do.  Can someone refer me to a book or website that will explain the very basics of computers and and the internet with common vocabulary that is useful to know? I know I'm behind, just want to get on the right track. Thanks!",2018-01-08 23:09:21
75frlv,"17 year old about to apply for universities, I need some serious career advice","I'm okay at math, not very good or brilliant.I had taken up computer science coding courses(With Phy,Chem,Math) in grade 11 and 12 and I fairly enjoyed them. I always thought I'd get a tech degree because stuff like AI and machine learning just seemed really cool but now that I'm reading more and more I'm understanding the realities associated with it. I'm more of a hardworking person than a logical one, I'm a top student who gets grades by working my ass off. I'm dedicated and ambitious but not inherently good at logical puzzles so I dont think i'll be good at higher level calculus, tricky programming questions. Thinking about technical interviews scares the shit out of me. I'm really interested in learning about business, finance but after reading so much about technology getting a degree in those other subjects seems.. kinda superficial as compared to something like computer science. However I know for a fact that if i get into the software engineering field there's always going to be programmers who are way way better and smarter at coding than I will ever be since they've been coding since they were kids and have immense passion for it. Still, I feel like I'll lose such an edge if I dont do CS or SEng because technology has such a huge scope in the future I dont want to feel left out but I guess the tech field doesn't really need someone like me. Something about me is that I really love reading books, whether it's business biographies or the future of technology and I'm a very practical person but I'm not sure where my capabilities lie. 
If anyone has any perspective to share on this please do. 
PS: I do know the difference between CS and SEng, I was confused as to what I should go for if I want to because I've heard that most CS grads anyways take all the SEng jobs and have done more intricate math so have an upper hand than the SEng grads.",2017-10-10 08:48:50

After all, LinkedIn is supposed to be about making connections and who knows what sort of opportunities I might be missing out on (I honestly have no idea, all my connections are literally all past or current coworkers, mostly developers)? My main reason I don't accept them is I worry how my employer, who is connected to me on LinkedIn, would react. I don't think it would he would react in a negative way, I just worry he would think that I'm not a 'company man' or that I am disgruntled (which I'm not) if I started just started accepting requests out of the blue.

184idy8,Negociate Salary increase for newcomers,"Hi all,

To make it short, I've been employed for 4 months in a cybersecurity company (first job post graduation) (system security design for embedded) my company received a large sum of fund a few months ago and is now planning to increase everyone, me included. 

Knowing the following:

I started at 46k yearly

Compared to my peers young coworkers, my entry salary is lower than what they got post graduation. The reason for me is that I missed my salary negociation during my interview. I got more than what I asked for during the interview.

To add one more thing to the previous argument, they started at a higher pay 2-3 years ago, before inflation. 

My peers started at between 48k and 53k 

Everything has been going very well since I started my job, my manager told me he doesn't have anything to complain about me 1 months and half ago and I feel it's been going just as well by then.

How should I approach that ? Bluntly accepting the increase that my company is planning to offer me is a mistake right ? (if it's just like 2k or 3k).  I plan to ask for 53k to maybe find a middle ground.

Thanks on advance !",2023-11-26 19:21:39

I, like many others, don't believe that will last forever, but while it's here, what should I do to increase my chances of getting hired?

I completed a web development bootcamp this year and have obviously been unable to find a job. No surprise there. Regardless, I am determined to get into the industry (my background is in chemistry where I worked for about 3 years before deciding to switch). I'd like to move more towards data science and cloud architecture. What are the best ways to get hired in those roles? Should I pursue a master's in data science? Work on AWS Cloud Certifications? Just continue doing personal projects?

I have this underlying fear that the tech world is going to lock up and the people in it will get to stay and everyone who missed the boat will have little hope of ever getting in. Do people think this will change? How can experienced devs be made when those with no experience can't get hired?

16ydmmu,Delay graduation or graduate with a higher GPA?,"So, I come from a non-CS background. I am almost done with a masters degree in computer science.

I took some of the hardest classes in the degree, and I took some at the same time. It whooped my butt. I need 10 classes to graduate.

I have received:

A A A B B B C

I am in progress to receive:

(A A B) - best case

(B B C) - worst case

Also, we have a grade replacement policy we can use once ever.

So I am thinking about dropping a course right now to guarantee I can have the energy to ensure I get (A A) in the 2 remaining. Then, next semester, I can use grade replacement policy and re-take that course I got a C, and also probably get an A in the course that I'd be dropping this semester.

Resulting GPA would be 3.7. Otherwise, I might be at around 3.2-3.4.

Also, I have yet to grind Leetcode, and I might get a publication if I wait a semester. I just feel extremely shameful and like a failure to delay graduation. So at some level, I think its the right choice, I am just looking for validation. But I am also genuinely curious if the GPA could matter, or if interviews at FAANG companies are possible by leaving it off resume.

I have an interview this friday and was told part of the interview will involve me asking the team some technical questions about the role and what the team will be doing.

this is for a junior level software engineering role at a company that has products in a variety of different fields.  


I have some ideas already, but was wondering if there were some good ones from the hivemind here.  


So to start, here are some of my main questions...  
1. What does the day to day look like for this role?  
2. What is the main tech stack look like? ci/cd? version control?

3. What is the onboarding process for new hires? 

4. What are some challenges that this team is facing? How will I be able to help?

5. Are there common development projects? things that the team works on all the time? How is the SDLC handled in the organization?

I have done a couple practice technical interviews before and my performance is a mixed bag. Sometimes I complete both problems, sometimes the interviewer has to help me. Sometimes I only complete one problem and run out of time on the second one etc. Mind you these are usually easy problems.

Is there a career path I can take to avoid that sort of collaboration as much as possible?

14rs9jr,College - CS or Software Engineering degree?,"Finally getting my ducks in a row to get enrolled in school.  Looking at going to WGU as my current work situation affords me more time than money.  


My primary focus has been software engineering/web development (freeCodeCamp, Odin Proj, 100Devs etc.).  I live in a very rural area so I am focused on fields that offer more remote opportunities, which is a big reason why I started navigating towards web development.  


I would have defaulted to a software eng. degree BUT it seems like a general CS degree is more than enough to check the box for HR at most companies, and once you get your foot in the door experience will trump all else when job hunting.  


Pros to a CS degree are, being a far broader, more general program, it would potentially open up a lot more doors in the future, should I deviate from programming (be it job market fluctuation, change in interest, relocating).  


Pros to a software engineering degree is, it seems it checks every box required for most junior web-dev jobs, leaving nothing left for me to have to muscle through on the side to become employable.  Anyone can sit at home and learn enough to be somewhat competent in any given language, but from what I can see, simply stacking languages on your resume isn't going to get your hired without something tangible for the employer to see.  


Any input on these two options?

I followed advice from my mentors to not worry about the level but to focus on the job profile etc during negotiations even though my interviews had gone really well. 

This is affecting my mental peace - I feel I am a classic example of ""penny wise pound foolish"" as I am largely to blame because of lack awareness of opportunities and self worth. 

I know I can just work in this role for a while and change the company but I want to understand if there are other ways to address this.

I want to look into actionable items than brood over this - 

\- Is there a way I can bring this up to my manager ? If so, how should I go about bringing this up without sounding ungrateful ?

11sg50c,Help desk - not all that bad?,"Several months ago, I was hired by an IT company to do help desk. I have heard horror stories about working in this position but I decided to give it my best and see for myself what the environment is like. I have really enjoyed learning new things (my background is not IT but I always absorb new information like my life depends on it) and have sharpened my phone skills to the point where a majority of customer interactions always end pleasantly, even if the customer was screaming at me at the start of a phone call. I really enjoy solving people's problems and helping the situation stay calm and collective.

Over time, I have noticed this is not the norm as a majority of my other coworkers tend to be more reactive and rush the troubleshooting procedure, which in turns frustrates the customer. This does not happen all the time, but it's palpable when it does occur.

Prior to IT, I worked in the hospitality industry and retail for over a decade. I learned to combine those soft skills sets and work them into help desk which definitely helps when understanding where the customer is coming from in regards to their issues and frustrations. I am still newish in my role, but so far I'm really loving the impact I can have on the customer-facing end of IT.

So, my question is...is helpdesk really as awful as everyone says due to the nature of the work or is it more of a case of misidentified soft skills sets?

So if I do the math, finding a fulltime gig wins just about every time. I can see how some devs, like h1 visas, would consider them, but if you're a senior dev, the only scenario in which I could consider contract roles was if the rate exceeded a fulltime + benefits package. I'm just not seeing that in the market right now. Am I alone in that? It's become annoying having recruiters try to talk to me about roles that ultimately fall flat on compensation without benefits.

The only scenario in which I could see contract roles being attractive (other than hourly rates that are actually impressive), is if they either add on benefits (which is rare), or if I could take on two contract roles and make basically twice the money.

I have been offered a 5-month internship as a software engineer at a reasonably good company. (Not one of the big high tech names like Google, but it's a solid company). It's an in-person internship in another country, which is both good and bad. So now I can't decide. Help.

Pros of taking internship:

* a better looking resume (I don't have anything worthwhile on my resume rn)
* a potential letter of recommendation from my employer (I need it to declare my major)
* possibility of learning something.
* I get to go somewhere I've been wanting to go for a long time.

Cons of taking internship:

* $$$. It's a paid internship, but the pay barely covers rent. I can afford the extra costs, but I'd have to take another part-time job for it.

If I don't do the internship, I could stay home and work on my personal projects, which are building a game and an app.

Pros of personal projects:

* way cheaper than internship.
* also adds to my resume (I guess if I put enough effort into it, the projects can look just as good as an internship)
* still learning something

Cons of personal projects:

* I would have to find another way to get that letter of recommendation, possibly interning during fall semester or doing cs-related research somewhere somehow.

xjjgqr,"I, a senior dev, sometimes cry over PR comments...","And that's okay.

Some devs live to shred my code apart. Even though as a group we've agreed that it is time to move on, they simply cannot help it. They need to leave five extra comments that boil down to a round of programmer golf on the company's dime. Managers don't care, the codebase is smaller so all is well no matter how much time was wasted on saving a few lines of space.

That's their problem. My problem is being sensitive in a career where I'm constantly told that I cannot be so. 

So many comments online talk about tough skin. No one should be a programmer unless they are tough enough. What about all of the developers who are talented coders but feel things deeply? Are they not allowed in the career simply because they use their tear ducts?

I just wanted to share that as a senior dev, I still cry. I'm able to do so from my home office most days, but I've cried at the office too. The prayer room is my favorite spot.

So if you're new to a company, or new to programming and feel the tears start falling, it's okay. Let yourself cry and then do your best to push forward. Some of us need to let it out, doesn't mean were bad devs just means we need the occasional cry. And if you truly don't understand the comments, slap a teams meeting, yes teams, on the reviewer's calendar and have them walk you through each comment. They can enjoy the screen share controls.

xa24mz,"B.S. in Civil Engineering, looking to switch to datacenter technician","Hey everybody. I have an undergraduate degree in civil engineering (well ranked, ABET accredited) and have been working in construction management positions in the construction industry for a couple years.

Unfortunately I've found the industry to be a very poor fit, and I've been rather unhappy with my work for a long time now. I've always been interested in tech. I did a lot of PC gaming in my free time, built my own PCs, etc. I'm very good with computers. I'd be more interested in a career in that direction, but I have no idea how I can start that pivot.

I've tried applying to several data center technician jobs, since I thought my civil engineering background might be close-enough to get me an in, but none of those panned out (even with recommendations from friends employed with the companies I applied to). 

What are my options here? What sort of careers could I start to pivot to given by education and background? I enjoy beings hands on with technology and I have a lot of willingness to learn, and I don't mind a pay cut if it'll benefit me in the long run. I figured a datacenter technician would be a good opportunity to pursue (I live in Northern Virginia, which has a ton of data centers).

x1z81l,"Zero job experience, 3 years as a business owner. Which career suits me?"," I'm 23 years old, I do have a Bachelor's in Information Systems

Right after I graduated, while beginning to look for work, I started a computer repair business.  
Soon enough, that spread to affiliate virus sales, a full computer shop, networking, and other services.

This is my revenue for each year (net pay to me is about 85% of this):  
2019: 10k  
2020: 20k  
2021: 45k  
2022: 75k so far, so will make about 105-110k if this pace keeps up

However, I have some big life choices to make and have decided the area I live in is not for me. No, I do not want to hire other people and keep this business going. I want to get a remote job.

With that said, here are some of the everyday things I do at my business (which is just me):  
**Computer skills:**  
\-Hardware & software installs, maintenance, upgrade  
\-Security for devices (hundreds of clients on my RMM antivirus) & networks  
\-Website design  
\-Technician for misc. stuff that has to be repaired (printer, faulty RAM, etc.)  
\-Win over clients to buy my computers & do the setup  
\-One-on-one training to businesses for whatever it is they need to learn tech-wise  
\-Cloud backups to S3 & Microsoft/Google/Apple clouds  
**Non-computer responsibilities:**  
\-Sales, I love selling. I would sell non-computer related things if the pay was good  
\-Marketing - not my cup of tea as much but I manage. Rural area so newspaper+Facebook works fine  
\-Customer service. Of course no one can see themselves objectively but I think I do a good job of handling customer needs and complaints. Of about 900 clients I can recall 6-7 getting mad at me, or under 1% and about 50-100 others I could tell were ""tough cookies"" and I was able to work around their personalities and make them very happy  
\-Inventory management of all the RAM/PCs/stuff I'm accumulating and selling online  
\-I manage the finances, pretty easy but still worth noting  
\-Sure there are other soft skills I don't even know that I learned along the way

*Anyways, as much as I want to move right away, I only want to do so if I can secure a position making 100k or so,* or at least close to it.

I would also strongly prefer to work in a job that is **remote** so I have the freedom to move if I want to without being tied to 1 location.  
I'm not allergic to hard work or learning, and I particularly enjoy mixing tech & sales but I'm fine with only tech too - just want to avoid programming. I am also unsure how to get a good job since I have 0 ""job"" experience, just business-owner experience. Sure it is doing well but it doesn't look so cool on my resume by itself.

So, I know this is generally a no-no. One of the jobs I'm applying for has an extra reference slot I'm struggling to fill. I have a couple neighbors/high school teachers in mind but most of those are kinda weak. 

There's an intramural sport league I've maintained a website for which is probably my biggest project. It's mainly a solo dev project but is pretty extensive after continuous content updates and added features over a year. I have a pretty close friend that ran the league until a month or so ago. They haven't been involved in code but can attest to my non-technical abilities (fast turnaround on new features, getting feature specifications established, setting up user-friendly ways for tournament admins to add new data, etc). They've known me for years and worked on a couple projects in courses for me as well, and are employed with a reputable company for a few months. 

Would this be a decent reference or should I save the slot for, say, a neighbor that's known me for longer but can attest to basically only non-computer science stuff?

Hey all! I am a self taught, full stack web developer and UI/UX designer with about 10 years experience. I started out with HTML/CSS in high school. Then I got a Bachelor of Fine Art, and started working as a graphic designer for a small agency. In my spare time, I audited some CS classes from Stanford and taught myself Javascript, and gradually shifted in to a front-end dev role. Then I worked as a UI/UX designer and FE dev for a small Saas company for a few years, where I learned a ton from my teammates, and started to dig into backend languages and API design. After that I went freelance, and have been doing so successfully for about the past 6 years.

s721oq,How do I switch careers?,"Some history: 

My degree is in Electrical Engineering, but my passion is computer science. I knew 3 years into my major that this wasn’t for me, but I decided to go ahead and get the degree and do the only kind of programming the degree offered - embedded.

I’ve been working as an embedded firmware engineer for nearly 10 years, but I have avoided the low level stuff - FPGA, board bring up, drivers, etc. I hate working directly with hardware, so I feel that “embedded engineer” is an inaccurate title for me - I’m more of an “embedded applications” engineer. I primarily maintain and improve a large (million+ line) C/C++ embedded application.

I’ve been wanting to switch to distributed systems / backend for a while, but my personal life suffered a string of tragedies over a period of several years (marriage problems, family deaths, serious health events, depression, etc etc etc). So that’s held me back for several years - I knew I could handle stress at home, or stress at work, but not both. The company I’m at is very laid back, and I love the people here, so it was an easy decision to put career dreams on hold while personal life recovered.

Now I’m ready to try and make a move. I would like to land at a top level company that has a good technical career ladder. Where I’m at pretty much forces you into a people management job, or you end up with a dead end technical ladder.

Where I’m at now:
- I’ve read DDIA
- I’ve gotten pretty good at leetcode
- I’m trying to read industry papers for system design

I have recruiters from FAANG companies reaching out to me, but I haven’t yet replied.

Recently I got contacted by a recruiter from a FAANG company. The message came out of nowhere and he wanted to schedule a 15 minute phone interview to talk about the opportunities and what was required. 
Apparently since I currently work at a company that’s on their “list”, I get to skip the phone screening and coding challenge and go straight to the virtual on-site interview that consists of 4 technical interviews and 1 personal interview. 

The problem is that I haven’t had an algorithms and data structures class in about 2 years, and while I have a solid understanding of core programming concept and data structures, I’ve always struggled with algorithm questions dealing with DP and graph traversals. From my understanding, unless I’m an expert at these things, I have no chance. I’ve never been a “leet-coder” and I tried again yesterday and I could get through the easy and a couple of medium questions but it was still a challenge. 

Should I even attempt the interview knowing I’m going to have a hard time with the technical questions? I have 2 YOE at a company where I’m often viewed as “the go-to guy” to answer programming and codebase related questions so I’m not a complete idiot. Even the recruiter said that my resume and profile screamed qualified. I just have really strong doubts because I’ve never been the guy to sit and grind leetcode and become an algorithm god.

Basically the last two employers on my resume hate me.

The job before that was ruined by the job before that - where by leaving early - I inadvertently cost a small consulting firm a small contract with a large corporation. The guy at the small firm told the people at the job I moved on to all kinds of craziness, and they believed all of it and spent many months trying to drive me out. Eventually they stopped, but having a guilty conscience, it was just a matter of time before someone misinterpreted something I did / said... ultimately that company did eventually drive me out... and the guy who spearheaded it took it outside, having friends from his home area code call me, which pissed me off. Someone wrote a scathing glassdoor review of the company, and they blamed it on me as they rarely hire / fire anyone (not to mention that the contents of the review were true, from my recollection).

I graduated from an electrical engineering undergrad with a solid amount of computer/software engineering foundation. I've done 5 internships, mostly in the power industry, but the jobs themselves were entirely or focused heavily in software, doing in-house application development with VBA. I developed automation tools and application suites for process improvement, so I feel pretty confident coding in the workplace, and grew to love software as a career. I thus decided to take on a masters in computer engineering with a software focus, but due to personal reasons had to withdraw and move back home. In the meantime, I've been doing a lot of personal training, taking Java courses on Udemy and doing code practice on Leetcode, etc.

I'm now looking for full-time employment as a software developer, but looking at several job postings, I feel that with just Java/C++ (and working HTML/CSS) knowledge, I don't feel confident applying to 80% of the jobs out on the market. It seems that most focus heavily on full-stack/Javascript, but I don't know if I have the time to get into that and create a good enough portfolio of projects.

dypugb,Feeling kind of lost and not sure how to proceed.,"I have been working at this startup in Atlanta for a couple years. Initially things were going pretty well. I have had the opportunity to do a bunch of design work, frontend work, backend work, CI / CD stuff. But every step of the way there was some stuff I ended up having to do for the sake of speed, even though it was against my recommendation. For every feature that was claimed to be ""needed to get the money flowing"" there was 2 more things that popped up with the same excuse. I get sometimes we need something now but the constant soul crushing hackiness and feature creep has just burned me out.

My boss is nice and we get along well. I was accommodating if she was late getting me money. Unfortunately that has landed me in a position where there is a bunch of money she owes me, there is constant promise of money, and I am feeling a bit lost, overwhelmed, and confused about where my skills are at when looking at job posts.

I don't have a traditional CS background. So I just feel constantly under qualified. I love learning about new stuff and as new things at this job flood in I find it hard to say no just out of my genuine interest in solving problems and a weird sense of responsibility for her financial situation. It makes me feel a little taken advantage of, although I am fully aware I have set myself up for this and the risks that were involved.

So far I have reduced my hours significantly and have given her some time to try and get some proper funding to pay me. But I think it is time to cut my losses.

cb6v5k,Am I wrong for being wary of going private again?,"So, I started my career working for a University building and maintaining the website and database for student testing for the entire state, along with work with the testing application. I hated the environment there, very toxic and very condescending.  


I was able to find a new job working in the marketing department for a software company, maintaining its website/database, along with marketing tasks (of which I had no experience and was enjoying learning). About 6 months into the job, they announced they were merging with a partner company/being bought by a equity firm. Everything seemed to be fine, work carried on, 3 months after that, there was announcement of a third company getting rolled in and a new VP of Marketing was being hired.  


My first hint should've been the equity firm, and the second was the VP of Marketing barely corresponding to the marketing department. Right at my 1st anniversary, I was called down to meet with HR. I was being laid off, along with the rest of my department including the director, I got 2 months salary and a boot print on my ass.  


It took 6 months of hunting, interviewing for hours, to finally get another job. At the University I started at, different area, different job, building applications and maintaining databases for professors and colleges. I quite enjoy this job, very relaxed, but also kind of boring.  


Am I wrong for being wary about ever leaving my apparent turtle shell that is the university?

bqmi4s,Sophomore in Highschool looking for advice on getting started early.,"As today is my first day on reddit, I apologize if this post does not meet the thread guidelines. 

Right, let's start from the beginning. I've taken small classes throughout grade school, however most of them were unhelpful and more for entertainment than learning. My. junior high was an overpopulated hellhole that offered nothing useful in the computer science department. At this point in time I began to get a little worried for experience's sake. My freshman year of highschool I took a fantastic class which dived deep into the workings of Python. The class was amazing, but it also made me realize how far behind I was. I am almost done with my Sophomore year and I have been unable to find the time for classes or practice. My school is very small and offers no more opportunities in the realm of computer science outside of that class. 

Here is the opportunity I am currently pursing. I have a 4.3 GPA in school, so my HS bought tickets for me and 3 others to go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Enterprise Forum. Sound fantastic? It was! Afterwards I spoke to one of the entrepreneurs who told me about their paid internship program, and suggested I apply. I a months wait after the application process I messaged him about it on Linkedin, and he suggested I send it to his personal email. That was 5 days ago. It's unclear whether I'll secure the position or not.  

Here's what I need your advice on. I live close, but not nearly within driving distance of Silicon Valley. I would love to connect with the companies there, but it would have to be through some online means. How do you suggest I connect with other companies? Where can I learn more about coding languages? What would look good on my resume?",2019-05-19 21:43:25
bqgb9y,Should I switch companies in order to switch roles(r/careerguidance)?,"tl;dr I'm currently a tester at a company that pays me well and gives me a lot of scheduling freedom. I don't feel challenged or really enjoy being in test. Although I want to eventually manage teams I would like to transition back to a development or sales engineer role in the meanwhile. The opportunity to transition roles doesn't seem available to me at my company so I'm considering moving on and would like outside opinions.

&#x200B;

I started my career as a php/javascript developer. It was good but in my area not as lucrative as Java/.Net. On the advice of a recruiter I took a job as a software test engineer to get some Java experience by writing automated tests. Like many companies, the one I was at had us doing mostly manual testing. It wasn't bad for me because my past experience with Linux put me in a position to do more administration and process improvement work than manual testing. Eventually I left to take a job doing protractor automation. The company I went to had scaled up personnel too quickly and moved me to another team to do manual testing. Not wanting to get stuck in manual test land, I started the job hunt. Through a guy I was working with I got linked up with a recruiter who got me an interview as a tester doing 50% manual 50% automation. I was upfront about applying for development roles and as an advocate of upskilling, the person who was head of test at that time hired me knowing I would likely want to transition to a development role. 

&#x200B;

In the three-ish years I've been here there have been ups and downs The biggest ups are my salary and the amount of flexibility I've earned. A huge downside is the lack of technical growth. Despite continuing to express interest in transitioning roles, taking the initiative to fix bugs in our backlog, occasionally taking on feature work, helping with our pipelines, pairing with developers on my scrum team...I'm still in a test role with no sign of getting out if I stay. Many of the new tasks and challenges get labeled development tasks and I don't often get the chance to contribute. For example, I worked hard to get an AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification, but don't really get to use it because what little work my team does with AWS  goes to the developers.

&#x200B;

I guess where I'm at is wondering if I'm crazy for wanting to jump ship. While not generally challenged in a way I want, I am paid well and have a lot of freedom. While I do believe that a company with the culture I want will provide opportunities for me to gain the same flexibility, leaving will mean starting over. It will probably also mean taking a 10-20k pay cut since I'll likely transition from senior tester to mid level developer or sales engineer. That pay cut means that 1-3 years from now I'll likely need to job hop again just to get back to where I am now salary wise. This might sound a bit childish but I feel like I've either done enough and well enough to not have to beg for a seat at the table or to be given actionable feedback on how I can improve as well as what sets others who are receiving opportunities apart from me. 

 

Long term I'd like to get the opportunity to lead teams and beyond, but I've learned that how I get there is important to me. As I develop the skills to try my hand at leading a team I'd prefer the challenges of a development role or sales engineer role and not remain in my current test role. FWIW, I do currently manage a couple of people but it's just management with no real leadership. 

&#x200B;

While there are pros to staying at my current company, I'm not happy with my lack of growth and don't see much possibility for further growth. My performance evaluations have always been exceeds expectations, but given the lack of opportunity afforded me I often wonder if it's me or the place that's the issue. The grass isn't always greener but I'm really not enjoying my job and I'm not progressing towards my ultimate goal.

bonn8s,19yo guy needing career advice for software engineering/ network engineering,"I am a 19 year old guy currently working for a local, fairly small telecommunications company on a 3 year 'apprenticeship scheme', as part of this apprenticeship, I am moving around the company experiencing all different areas within its Engineering section, these include things from structured cabling, to voice engineering (installing phone systems), to data engineering (mainly Cisco stuff) etc. During this time, my employers have agreed to pay for all required training/ qualifications that I feel necessary, so I am in a very privileged scenario!

I already have somewhat of an idea of how I want my career to progress but am just looking for some advice on how to get there. In an ideal world I would want to train to become a Software/ Network engineer as these seem to be two job roles that would really compliment my skills. I have searched the internet for the best qualifications to start working/ planning towards, however most of these websites state that a Degree is necessary, but as far as I am aware it is far from a requirement and companies are a lot more interested in people who have work experience and more specific qualifications.

So basically, what I am looking for is some advice on the best qualifications that I should be aiming towards to be as employable as possible (I am currently working towards my CompTIA Network+ as that was an obligation from my employer). It would also be of note that, again, in an ideal world I would like to move out to Australia and not stay where I am currently, so I will not have the benefit of the employer having any background on my work ethic, motivation, passion etc; unlike my current employer (my current employer won't have any jobs within the field of work I want to go into for the foreseeable future and my contract is fixed term so I do not have any obligation to sign on after my apprenticeship)

Any advice will be highly appreciated!",2019-05-14 19:52:09

I had an internship at a medium-sized SaaS shop for summer of '17, and when I graduated June '18, I went to work at a local startup as an Android dev, however at the 10 month mark, the company went under, and I've found myself unemployed.

I've had both former classmates and former co-workers from the recently defunct Android shops look over my resume and have gotten feedback. I have also been getting referred to recruiters. Those references don't seem to have done anything beyond getting a recruiter to pretend I exist. I feel like I've dotted every I and crossed every T. I'll often ask for advice to try to find that secret sauce, the thing I'm doing wrong!

asz03h,Sifting Through Subcontracting Companies,"Hey there.  Been lurking a lot, and I've yet to find something that works for what I want to know.  Figured that, maybe by asking some questions, I could get decent answers.  


As the post title implies, it boils down to finding development jobs that don't go through a middleman.  Every job site I go to is flooded with subcontracting positions offering abysmal rates.  I know many direct-hires around the United States who, at entry-level, make between $70k to $90k annually.  This is obviously way, WAY better than the $50k to $65k that many IT ""consulting"" firms pay where I live.  The difference in pay is also for a completely stupid reason: the middleman wants to take a cut of your salary just for hooking you up with the job.  Traditionally, the markup used to be around 15%.  But, in present-day IT consulting, it sometimes reaches 200% or more.  It's insane.  I wish I were joking when I say that.  From my present experience, I've seen consultants get paid (as an example) $50 an hour for a job that direct-hires receive $80 an hour when the consulting company bills the client $150 an hour.  If the consultants could just cut out the middleman, both they and the clients would come out ahead.  By a lot.  


Is there any one-stop-shop for direct-hire job openings?  Alternatively, does anyone know of a reliable way to hack the consulting leeches and figure out who they're staffing for?  I'm pretty sick of having to sift through trash companies whose only purpose in putting out a job posting is to get rich quick at other peoples' expense.",2019-02-21 04:57:42

In my own college experience I got a comp sci degree with good grades but it didn't help nearly as much as working with someone on actual interviewing skills.

94fprs,Should I even Consider this offer ?,"My background:

  
Engineering degree, worked as a QA for 3 years. got interested in software development. Started part-time  distance CS Master program earlier this year. This semester I decided to focus full time on Master's program, quit my QA job last month, started looking for SWE internship or junior position. 

I have applied for few internships but have not heard back. I get a call from this software consultancy. They have a full stack java web dev training program. They agreed to hire me for training program and then put me to subsequent projects at their client's location. 

They have this elaborate employee agreement whose terms are as below.  
\- During 10 week training period I will be paid 250 $ / week (not too bad since it's only 5 miles away from my place).

\- After training until I get any project, I am on bench. during this period I get paid 10 $ /hour for 40 hour a week.

Now let's talk about the catch(s)

1. I will have to sign 2 years agreement with them. After commencement of training, If I quit within 1 year I will owe them $ 20,000, and $ 10,000 If I quit between 1-2 years. 

2.   I will need to relocate anywhere in US according to project availability. Max relocation they will pay is 2500 $

3.  while I am working on a project, my pay will be **$ (10 + ""unspecified bonus amount"") / hr.** The bonus amount will depend on the agreement between the client and the consultancy and will be determined when I get the project. The HR guy said that they can't promise anything in terms of bonus amount . 

4. no PTO what so ever.

What scares me most is that, during my project, let's say, the consultancy determines that my ""bonus amount"" is just 5$ / hour or less, I may end up working for 15 $ in God knows what part of the country for upto 2 years. 

Topics of training that they are giving is Java, spring and hibernate, J2EE, FrontEnd (HTML, CSS, Javascript), Angular 4, Node.js, React etc. I feel like I could learn all this stuff on my own while working on my master's degree. money wise, I can survive without income for 2 years until I finish my MS and get a job. the training program seems good, and since they will find projects for me, I will be getting some real project experience while working on my MS.

It's something I've been learning for the past year or so, but TIL makes a good headline. :)  It was today that I realized that I have learned something really important. And now I'm sharing it with you!

Also, I'm looking for feedback on my writing, perspectives, and whatever else people are inspired to share. If this helps a few people then I'd love to make this a regular thing. I want to help those who are coming up right behind me to learn and grow faster than myself. There are a lot of changes to be made and people to inspire in the short time that we have.

----

If you want to stand out, you have to pull information toward you. If you're going to have an impact where you work, you have to actively attract the details you need.

In school, we were used to having requirements laid out for us. We expected it. If an instructor gave an assignment with holes in the requirements, they were a *bad* instructor and should never again disgrace our holy department of computer science with their mortal insufficiencies. And of course, the instructor was obligated to helpfully guide us to completion, so we got away with our stone throwing.

Some of us are even lucky/unlucky enough to land a job where there's a dedicated project manager, a senior developer is always looking out for you, and everyone communicates with the clarity and cadence of Neil deGrasse Tyson. Kind of. Maybe you just have a well-organized manager that irons everything out before it gets to you. Maybe you don't even realize it's happening.

Eventually, we no longer want to be an overeducated mule with a keyboard, so we have to start *driving* projects instead of *pulling* them. In ""Extreme Ownership,"" Leif and Jocko (I love those names btw) talk about pulling and pushing information up and down the chain of command. There are four activities there. Don't let that slip past you. Pulling up, pushing up, pulling down, pushing down. This also works sideways, with people not in your ""chain of command."" 

I'm focusing on pulling in this post because the motivation behind pushing is different and this post is long enough. 

----

You need information to do your job. That's obvious. You need requirements, and they need to be clear and accurate. They need to be complete, and you need to make sure they actually define what your client/boss/coworker *actually needs*. Otherwise, you will put a LOT of work into something that --in the best case-- makes little impact. In the worse case, you have people cursing your imbecility for making something completely and utterly useless. Now they're throwing stones at you. You can't blame them. Afterall, *you're* the developer. You're a demigod that can summon fun, productive, even life-changing tools from the aether with the sheer power of your mind. Instead, you've chosen to burden them with... *this*. 

Never mind that you did exactly as they asked. What matters is that you didn't do exactly as they needed.

We have to understand that communication is challenging for everyone. We all make most of our decisions in a part of our brain that is separate from the area that controls speech. And it's not just our ability to explain our thoughts that complicates things. People rarely have an absolutely complete understanding of ... anything. It takes time to understand new things. We all have our own ways of digesting and reusing new information when we encounter it. While you're doing all that work inside your head, you don't know what's inside the other person's head. They don't know what's inside yours.

You need to pull information towards you to do your job well. This means asking questions. This means asking the right questions. Some key places to start are...

**First off, what are you envisioning already?**  
This does two things. It gets you in the same general area as your client. Very general, it's more like the same city. It gives you an easy starting point for the conversation, and it gets the thoughts flowing. Most importantly, however, it lets your client offload their thoughts so they can work *with* you instead of over you. (""Client"" could be a business, boss, or coworker.)

**Ok. Let's back up for a minute. Why are we going to do this? What's the core issue here?**  
Let's get to the point. The client already has an idea of what they need, and it may or may not be sufficient. You're the demigod, remember? It's up to you to corroborate the solution, tweak it, or offer a better one. If they've already thought it through, then this question makes sure you completely understand their perspective and how they got to their solution. It will also make it possible for you to make decisions without pestering them for days.

**That all makes sense. What are your goals here? How will we know the project was a success for you?**  
This question is critical. If these goals are achieved there will be no stone throwing. There might even be a festival in your honor. This question also helps you define the **scope**. Ah, scope. My most favoritest word. This tells you what your priorities are. From here, you can design a solution that will achieve every goal. Anything that doesn't directly contribute to achieving a goal, is another project for another time. You can still do it, just not now. 

Then you can create a project plan:

- Boil down the goals and core issue into a ""strategy."" This is one sentence that describes your solution in words and grammar that your client can understand. If you can't do this, you're probably looking at two (or more) projects.
- Then you expand that strategy into specific requirements that your client can understand. 
- Double check your requirements to make sure each one addresses one or more goals and all goals are addressed.
- Run the requirements by the client. Take feedback. Revise if necessary.
- Create what I call a ""dev plan."" This explains in technical terms how you're going to address the requirements. This (perhaps along with the requirements themselves) is your checklist.

Make sure you're asking the right people these questions. Some reading about scrum (really just project management in general) will help you understand what's relevant to who.

Leave no stone unturned and no shadow unlit. You should be able to see your route all the way to the horizon, including every potential pothole and intersection. The time you spend doing this saves you time multiplied in actual development. And the whole time, you know you're doing exactly what you need to. It's a lot more fun, and people are always impressed.

If this post wasn't so long already, I'd share some stories that illustrate the vastly different results among projects where I clarified every detail and those where I didn't. The former feels like driving a new Cadillac by the beach after a spring rain. The latter feels like driving a new Cadillac *on* the beach *in* the rain. It should be really cool, but you really don't know where you're going. Sometimes your NOT going. It takes forever to get there, and in the end, everything is a mess. Everyone is much happier when we can roll the top down and just cruise.

If you have a manger, they will especially appreciate you being at the top of your game. You can take it to the next level by *pushing* information. But as I said, that's another post for another time. Respect the scope.

----

**TL;DR** Really? I spent a lot of time writing that. I even ran it through grammarly, and I have dorky sense of humor. :/

**TL;DR!!** Fine. I get it... People aren't going to tell you what you need to know, even if they try to. You have to learn to ask good questions, sometimes lots of them. Take an active role in planning your projects, or at least understanding them.",2018-03-02 18:53:11

79vwyr,Getting into the big N post-graduation?,"Hi all,

Does anyone have experience getting into one of the big tech companies not as a graduate but also without a load of experience? I'm talking about the 2-3 years after uni range.

Unfortunately for myself I wasn't able to land a great grad job since I couldn't get into Google here in Sydney and due to family status couldn't even consider moving out of the country. Instead I took some work at a start up then a smaller tech company that doesn't pay too well.

I want to try and move into a decent paying role at a good company and while there's a lot of advice for grads does anyone have experience getting in at this stage as a junior-mid level developer?

Thanks!",2017-10-31 14:01:20
6nkezi,My third interview as a jr web developer sense grad April 2017,"I've had 2 interviews, both I thought went fantastic. However both the times I didn't get the position. So I'd like some advice on a new interview for a junior web developer.

My current strategy is trying to be realistic of my skills and just being human. I don't know if I should stick to being myself or start over presenting myself? 

I don't really like when people ask me how much I'm worth. But I've been asking for 50K though which from my city seems to be average.

As a web developer what should I be expected to answer or show?

Any other things I should do to make me stand out and be successful?

40% have a BS in computer science but no experience

25% have a BS in computer science and 1 internship

10% have a BS in computer science and 1 year of experience

62q4tu,"Little experience, but have a job. Looking for advice on where to go next.","I have always been interested in coding since I was a kid, but never had the opportunity to explore it until I turned 25, quit my job and taught myself Java. I managed to land a job with literally no experience, no github portfolio, and I hadn't even owned my own computer (besides my phone) for a solid 3 years before deciding to jump into this. 

I was extremely lucky, and after following youtube videos online for  about a month I wrote a simple card game in java and sent it to my friend who worked for a startup that was hiring.

5tqw1n,"At career crossroads, decided to ask for directions","Hey all,

I'm looking to switch careers from IT to Software Engineering, and I'd like for the internet to evaluate where I stand and what I should do next.

**Backstory**  
B.S. in Civil Engineering, J.D. Harvard Law School.  
After a 3-year search involving hundreds of applications and two placement firms, I've concluded that there aren't law jobs for me.  
After working at a Civil Engineering shop for 8 months, I decided that the computers and people from vastly cheaper countries do that work much more skillfully and cost-effectively than I can.  
Having worked with computers since I was wee, I decided that I wanted to transition into Software Engineering to build a better tomorrow.

**Things I've Done**  

1. completed the MIT edX [Intro to Programming](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-9) and [Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-5) courses,  
2. knocked out freshman/sophomore programming (C++ and Java) and linear algebra at community college over the summer,  
3. completed Princeton's [Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) course and was a community mentor there for a while, and  
4. recently graduated from Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree program (Python-heavy).  Machine Learning still feels a bit too mysterious to me, so I don't think I want a role in that field yet.

I'm still working through Princeton's [Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) course.

I've also solved a lot of LeetCode, Project Euler, and a few CodeWars problems, and have thrown the ones I was proud of up on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mgruben).  
In addition, I've done like ~8 interview preps on [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/), and can usually stumble into a solution in the ~30mins allotted, but not without hints.

**What I'm Doing Now**  
The past 6 months or so, I've been working in IT, mainly how-do-I-print, install-this-software, large-filesharing-and-storage kind of stuff, and I enjoy it, but I think I'd prefer a trajectory that allows me to build software solutions rather than to be painfully and squirmingly out of luck if there's not already software that does the job.

**What I Want to Know**  

1.  How do I get that first Software Engineering job?  
I feel like I have decent C++, Java, and Python experience, but a lot of the positions I'm seeing mention platforms and frameworks (e.g. Hadoop, database stuff, Javascript, testing frameworks, RESTful APIs, Agile development methods, etc.) that I don't have experience in, and I'm not sure which ones to pick up and how best to do that.

2.  I'd like to work in the Bay Area.  Is this pure ain't-gonna-happen fantasy?  
I like it there, and I'd like to live there.  I like the people I meet there, and I like who I am when I am there.  

3.  How do I network, especially for a preferred out-of-state position?  
I'm happy to randomly solicit people on the LinkedIn, but in all seriousness how do I reach out to people in the field, outside of Reddit and my mostly-not-CS-people friend group.  
I'd like to think that networking isn't necessary, and in truth it probably isn't *strictly* necessary, but I acknowledge that it's also the fastest way to ensure a serious consideration from someone who's not immediately inclined to toss your application into the nearest open fire.

4.  What should my job-search strategy be, especially since I'm not actually desperate for a paycheck for once?  
I'd like to think that this works by me learning more skills until I'm hire-able, and sending out applications once I have those skills.  
I'd less like to think that this is a carpet-bombing operation, where I sent out application after application to things I'm perhaps only arguably qualified for, in the hopes that one sticks, because that's really a beatdown on my fragile snowflake psyche, but also because it feels like I have no idea what I'm doing.  

5.  There are a lot of things I could keep doing, which should they be?  
Choices include (but are not limited to):  
   * [Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2), a Java-based exploration of Graph- and String-processing algorithms, among other things.  
   * LeetCode / Project Euler /  TripleByte or other similar websites, to get experience solving (perhaps canned) interview questions.  
   * Pramp.  Pramp makes me uncomfortable, but I'd rather be uncomfortable at home than in an interview (assuming I can get some lined up).  
   * Other things from the large [OSS catalog](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science) (but what though??)  
   * Working on some existing open source project.  I would love to do this, but the last time I looked at this, the existing issues were way above my ability to contribute to.  
   * Create a new open source project.  Any pointers you might have for how to *actually* parcel out a project into manageable tasks, sub-tasks, and sub-sub-tasks would be greatly appreciated, because usually I bite off way more than I can chew, but I do have some ideas I'd like to pursue.

6. What am I obviously missing or misunderstanding, as evidenced by my questions and statements above?",2017-02-13 04:26:53
5nftei,"Company downsized and I was laid off, only have about 2 years experience in unconventional tech. Looking for some guidance.","A bit of backstory, I am an older programmer who went back to school and got my CS degree after being in the military.  During my last year in school I got an internship as a QA engineer at a relatively small company that no one has heard off.  What they were doing with their product was really cool, and I thought it would get bigger, so I signed on full time when I graduated as an Associate Software Engineer.

I was put on a team that was trying to port their established windows product over to Android.  I don't want to reveal too much, but the product was basically a way to virtualize applications on a computer or mobile device without the app taking up all the space it normally would.  It utilized cloud technology to deliver data to the device on an as-needed basis.  So it basically saved space at the expense of network, but it wasn't pixel streaming.

The stuff I got to work on and learn were:

1) Getting to know the details about Android APKs and OBBs, including how they were built with Gradle and the Android Build Tools, APKtool and the like.

2) Converting shell scripts into Gradle scripts.

3) Developing an invisible system-level Android app for installing/uninstalling apps and some lower-level JNI-calls.

4) Creating a GUI wrapper for all of our scripts in Java Swing.

5) Spot debugging windows code in C++ when our team found something amiss.

Unfortunately the company had to downsize and since my team was mostly R&D and we hadn't secured a customer yet most of my team was laid off.  So now I have a couple years of experience in... a few different things that not a lot of people are looking for.  I am not really sure what kind of job would be looking for someone like me, and if I should just ""start over"" at another entry level position so I can build a better foundation in C# or front-end stuff.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.",2017-01-11 23:52:20

1bqc846,I'm in a hole I dug and not sure how to get out. Looking for advice.,"I graduated two years ago with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering and wanted to work in Software. I got a conditional job offer from a DoD contractor so that after I got a clearance they would offer me a job, fast forward to two weeks ago when I was called by the manager and informed that due to restructuring the position would no longer be available. Before the call ended I got his permission to put him as a reference. In the two years since I graduated, I was taking things slow since I naively though I was golden and just took some small jobs to pay of a bit of debt. So I am a 2022 graduate with a Bachelors, a reference, and a level 5 clearance(granted in September 2023). I have no professional experience, no internships, and no big stand out personal projects. I'm still gunna apply for entry level jobs (I've been seriously applying since January due to the clearance process taking so long), but I've been getting disheartened so I figured I'd ask for some advice. 

What are some things that are worth perusing to help me land that first job? Should I go back to college and get a masters? Are there any decent coding boot camps that could benefit me? Are certifications like the A+ or Security+ good goals to aim for in the mean time? Am I just going through a rough patch and blowing things a little out of proportion?

1bk1dzb,I just feel like I am not part of the CS space despite working a CS job and will always be an outsider.,"I did my undergrad in Electrical Engineering with a minor in CS, but my projects, electives, internships, basically everything I did in college was CS related because in my country there isn't much you can do in strictly EE areas. I was pretty active in everything I could find; developer groups, competitions, hackathons and research work in university- and I got a decent job as an ML engineer right after graduation. I am completing almost a year in that role now but I can't stop feeling like I am not in the right place. It is not because I don't like my work, I was really lucky to find a job where I get to work on building and training my own models and getting to play with good data unlike some of my friends who went the same route but at junior positions, they just work with pretrained models and prebuilt architectures and systems.  
But when I see discussions online, communities, leaderboards, podcasts, developer conversations, I feel like I am not even close to all these things, and I will not understand anything anyone is saying because I don't know any of this. Which I don't understand what the issue is. I do development, I learn skills, I practice them, even for my job every now and then I get to learn new algorithms and new python techniques, but I just feel like I am not up there as a developer or an engineer with everyone else. Like I can't participate in the community basically. Because everyone is such a pro at this, especially with python, people treat it like it is some child's play. Like I would be the only dumb person in a room full of other people who do the same thing as me around the world if you made us sit at one place.  
And the main problem is I don't even know how to overcome this. No matter how much I learn I am not going to get good enough for community participation, hell I don't even know what people even talk about. I am not going to be good enough for winning a Kaggle, ranking on Hackerrank or Leetcode, join a podcast and actually know what I am talking about, or just improve my quality as a developer. I feel there is a big gap and there are no tools to cover this. All resources just teach you the concepts and that after that you are kind of on your own. Everyone learns from the same places but somehow, I am behind everyone else.  


And this feeling has solidified after facing rejections from multiple avenues, like remote opportunities, paid online gigs, I have literally never been able to find one. 

  
  
This sometimes depresses me to the point of wanting to change fields, where I could at least understand how I am excluded and how can I cover the gap to feel like I am somebody in this field.

Ive recently been thinking about whether the extra 1 year of studying is worth the extra  data science knowledge/degree.

I had been working for a nightmare startup for 1 year and the level of professionalism by the Administration made me take the leap.

I don't want to go into details because I really don't like being a negative person or talking negatively about my previous jobs, but man, the kind of people one can find who call themselves ""Leaders"". I just feel sorry for those who have to endure these types of abusive environments.

Recently graduated with a BS in Computer Engineering Technology, and have been applying to a ton of jobs on the west coast with no luck so far. I understand there’s a lot of factors at play here though, mainly I’d guess the main thing is that I wasn’t able to get into an internship while I was in school, so I have largely no presentable experience yet. I’ve reached out to many of my friends and acquaintances in tech to see if the places they’re working for would have any opportunities available, but no luck there either.  
I know the market isn’t great at the moment for anyone, especially someone in my position, so I was just looking for a few pointers on what some of my next steps could be.  
 I’ve had a few side projects in the works for a bit that I’ll be bringing to completion hopefully soon and I can add to my resume and that would help I’m sure. I’ll keep putting out applications just in case I get lucky, but I’d guess I should primarily be looking for internships in this situation. Along with what I’ve been working on, are there any personal project topics that may be especially advantageous to work on?

Been trying to keep morale up, but 200+ applications in with not a word back has me feeling like I need to get some feedback and make a change or two as I go forward. More than willing to do what I need to to up my chances though and flesh things out for myself. I'd like to be in it for the long haul here.  
Any general advice/observations would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

Background: I will begin by saying my job history is atypical of what you are probably used to reading. I have worked in my family’s construction business my whole life. Around the age of 29 I decided I wanted a career change and enrolled in Computer Science. I will complete the degree in December of 2023. 

While studying I applied for over 1500 jobs/internships in software engineering but received only a couple of interviews that didn’t pan out. I finally got fed up and started applying to other positions in tech, received an offer in early 2023 and took it. It is decent pay for someone that doesn’t have a degree so I’m not complaining. I will say that the company is great and I enjoy working with everyone there. The problem is I don’t find the work challenging and there really isn’t opportunity for growth in the team I’m on.

151reth,[Tools and Tips]Land 15 interviews as a new grad after being laid off,"You just graduated from college, ready to take on the world, and then bam! You get laid off from your first job. That sucks, big time. But don't let it get you down. You have skills, you have potential, and you have options. Here is something I feel I did right to land those interviews and find a new job in the bad market quickly after being laid off from my first job.  
  
The number one thing is network like a boss. You have seen those numbers in Linkedin job posting. An application without reaching out is almost invalid in today's market. Your resume will never get reviewed. I emailed over 1k+ recruiters and hiring managers. I think email is better than LinkedIn Inmail because Inmail is too easy (anyone can send it) and you can't follow up unless they reply. Also, don't forget to follow up after your first email, I usually do up to 3. [InTouch](https://intouches.io) is a great tool for finding and sending emails quickly and it's totally worth it.  
  
The second thing is apply like crazy. Don't sweat the rejections, they're normal and they don't matter. Just move on and apply to more. I use [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/) to make the process easier. (just double check each field in the applications, it's not perfect) Also do some homework on the ones that interest you and tweak your resume. Tell them why you're a great fit for the role and the company vibe. Show some passion and personality.  
  
Finally, don't lose hope. I know it's hard to stay positive when things don't go your way, but trust me, there's a job out there for you. You just have to keep trying and keep learning. You've got this!",2023-07-17 04:21:20
14vfjrx,Interview Tips,"Just wanted to share some interview tips that have worked well for me!

**Behavioral Round**

* Be as vague as possible when responding to behavioral questions. It signals to the interviewer that you have so many examples that it's impossible to choose one.
* Every third question, flip the question on the interviewer. This will give you time to prepare your own response.
* Never admit to dealing with any conflict/adversity in your career. That shows you are weak.

**System Design Round**

* Don't ask any clarifying questions. Instead, make assumptions about what is being asked, so that if you are wrong or choose a bad design, you can say ""well I didn't know that!""
* Scalability is a nice to have. If you design a system that works for an n=1 input size, that is good enough

**Coding Round**

* If you are given a list or string as the input to the problem, reverse it immediately. No questions asked. This will show the interviewer that you play by your own rules.
* If you aren't using at least 7 different data structures, you are doing the problem wrong. Use as many data structures as possible, no matter how ill fitting they might seem. It will demonstrate your subject matter expertise.
* Whenever a fraction is mentioned, rephrase it as a decimal to demonstrate your mathematical knowledge.
* Use bubble sort in some way regardless of the question being asked.

My finances were finally stable so I tried to get an internship for this summer but ultimately didn't get accepted to any position. I figured I'm going to stay at the bar and just work on my portfolio since it is mainly just projects from classes I took (didn't have much free time until now to work on personal projects).

However, I wish to obviously utilize my degree and pursue a career in tech. Though due to work and other responsibilities, I've been left with little free-time to balance searching for jobs, working on projects and studying leetcode type interview questions.

I was reached out to by a recruiter on LinkedIn working for ""SunnyFuture Career"" recruiting agency based in Canada (I'm Canadian). I am extremely ignorant of all things related to working with a recruiter so I wish to ask a couple questions and potentially find answers from people who have.

Firstly, while nothing specifically stood out to me, it seems a little weird to be reached out to by a recruiter via LinkedIn direct message. When I have my resume and contact information readily available on my profile. Is my caution warranted or is this standard, as previously the only direct messaging I've received was obvious scams.

Second, the recruiter and contract state that an initial deposit of $200 is required with a month of salary due in payments after a job offer is received. From what i've gathered recruiters generally charge \~15% of one's salary so this seems reasonable. And the deposit while expensive given my current situation seems like a reasonable payment structure for a recruiting agency.

zpqqq6,Can you honestly be competitive if you don't dedicate your entire life to writing code?,"I'm starting to second guess myself.  

I was initially drawn to pursuing a career in software development because of the pay, industry growth/prevalence, desk job with air conditioning, I like tinkering and optimizing things, the possibility of remote work and how you can cross borders with your skillset easily (opposed to something like medicine).

These are all things I want out of a career, but I think I got it wrong.  I haven't graduated yet, but the hallmarks of my experience so far are social isolation, competing against people who've spent a great deal of their own personal time building this skillset since early adolescence, a surprisingly large percentage of people who seemingly do nothing but work on software with their own personal projects and it's all very disheartening.

I'm retired military.  I'm used to working closely with fun, social, adventurous and eccentric people.  This is the sort of company I'm happy being around.  The people I'm surrounded with are almost the exact opposite of this.  

It's really killing my interest in this field.  The tedium, monotony, staring at a screen for hours, feeling like I'm at such a disadvantage compared to my peers.  I'm now at the point where I don't really care about software anymore.  The thought of tech interviews churns my stomach.

Maybe I need to pivot to something more front facing, like UI/UX, anything front end.  I think that could add some color back into my life.

Or maybe switch career paths entirely.  I don't know anymore.  

My real passions are motorcycles, film making, writing and interactive media.  I feel like there's real passion and creativity in those fields, but it's probably much more difficult to make a good living trying to pursue those types of careers.  Unless I become an engineer and land a job designing motorcycle parts.

For my current job, part of my job involves writing python scripts for automation, data analysis, and file parsing. If I am to change my career to software development these are the 4 possible routes I think are possible to make my career change a reality:

1: Take a coding Boot Camp. These are 6-month programs and focus more on full-stack development rather than solely back-end. Not necessarily bad, but maybe less focused?

2: Take individual program courses at extension programs such as UCLAExtension or UC Berkeley Extension. (I prefer UC’s because credits are UC transferable should I one day pursue a CS masters at a UC). Time duration is very flexible and can end whenever I feel ready.

3: Pursue a masters in CS. A 2-3 year commitment if I also want to work full-time, which I do.

4: Self-study. Study hard, build my own projects, and hopefully my own projects and work projects can be sufficient. Time varies with how well I study and how much time I dedicate.

ybz3hq,What's the etiquette if you get an offer while at another job?,"I'm currently working on a startup-sized company. I basically have an open LinkedIn account with my full resume on it, but it doesn't say Looking For Work at the moment. The Games Industry is a bit smaller here, and I know they use the site to scout talent and potential hires. I get a message from an international company with local offices that they're open for applications.

Do I send a resume and wait for their reply while I'm still working another job? There are possibly other interviews beyond that. It doesn't sound ethical to both of the companies. How fast of a turnaround they generally expect? And it's not a guaranteed hire just a call for applications.

I know that for an amicable split from the current job I'd need to send like a 30 days notice to have enough time to finish responsibilities and documents. But I'm not sure if the other company would still be hiring by then. I could end up with neither jobs.",2022-10-24 01:53:08

xh0kow,Feeling too many chefs in the kitchen,"I am wondering how common it is to feel like there are too many chefs in the kitchen while working on a software project.

I wont dwell on the specifics, but I consider myself intermediate and I want to get myself to a senior level, but it's hard to get a large task that I can take on myself. I also consider myself very collaborative. I'm willing to break off some tasks and assign/mentor juniors. I enjoy pair programming. I always reach out if I am stuck on something. However, I never have the opportunity to take ownership on something.

I guess the good thing is that it seems the same for everyone at my level, so I am not feeling excluded, but it just feels inefficient. We have more than enough work to do, but our velocity is limited because of how the tickets are made and assigned.

I am curious to know what scenarios others have felt this way and how they fixed it, or if this situation is not as bad as I think.",2022-09-17 23:12:20
xdl0wq,Need advice about my new job,"Hello!

I just graduated college in May and have been working as a new grad SWE for almost month at my current company.

I am struggling at my current company because while everyone is very nice I feel like I'm not being supported by my team. I spoke with my manger for 30 mins on the phone before I started and I have never seen him since and when I talk to my team I sometimes feel like Im talking to a void, where I don't really get good responses from them in regards to my progress/my questions.

An example would be that this is the first time Im using Go and Docker and I am having issues with my system set up, most likely related to the M1 chip. I've asked multiple people for help and have aired this issue every stand up, yet the only response I get is either ""go ask xx"" or ""ill get back to you later"". And so I've been sort of debugging on my own for a week, but given the fact that this is all new to me, it might as well be written in Spanish. It's been 4 weeks and I don't even have my system set up.

Another example would be them putting me in calls demonstrating the release system when I haven't even typed out a line of code, so the release system as of now really means nothing to me. Even when I (admittedly gently) spoke up about it I somehow end up being pulled into another call about the release system. I feel like they're tossing me around as opposed to helping me grow.

Granted I've only ever done proper SWE once before as an intern where I was very supported so this is still all pretty new to me. Is this normal and am I being too reliant on my team? Or should I plan my exit within a year if things don't change?",2022-09-13 22:42:50
x06zk3,Enjoyable Jobs vs Better Paying Jobs,"I'm curious how people (specifically software engineers) view job fulfillment versus pay. Many software engineering positions offer great pay, but would you ever consider sacrificing working for a company you really like/a job where the work is fun and fulfilling for a job that pays significantly better? 

Would your answer change depending on how far along in your career you are? Making money early can be great, but I feel it's unlikely many people would take a big pay cut later in life just for a job they feel would be more fun (could be wrong). 

Has hindsight changed how anyone viewed such a choice? Does retiring earlier trump enjoying your career?

Sometimes I see these choices as can't lose as the pay may be great on both sides, just significantly better for one. But others may see an additional hundred thousand dollars+ over a couple of years as too good to pass up. 

It's also possible that 40+ hours a week will make any job, no matter how fulfilling, seem dull and soulless. There are really no guarantees with this. 

Obviously everyone's choice is an individual one and everyone has unique factors, big and small, which lead them to a decision. I just wanted to gauge general thoughts.",2022-08-28 21:44:11
wbbez7,Self taught backend dev of 2 years just laid off - Trying to figure out my next move,"Hey all,

As the title says, I'm a backend Java dev of roughly 2 years officially holding the title of Software Engineer. I Just found out a few days ago that my position is no longer needed at the company, along with several others. I've been working on this product for roughly 8 years starting from a Tier 1 phone rep, through to managing the support team. At that point I began taking on more technical tasks and started teaching myself how to code. The company and product were purchased by a large company and in that move I was moved to QA, where I did some QA tasks, but mostly started working on small tickets and writing unit tests. A year later I was promoted to Software Engineer and have been doing that for the last two years.

Long story short, I'm trying to figure out where I want to go next and what I should study up on to be able to land a solid job. I have solid Java experience, though I wouldn't say I'm an expert by any means. Concurrency and threading can be overwhelming to me. I understand basic OO concepts, but feel like I'm lacking in understanding of design patterns. 

\- I've used docker but would by no means say I'm good with it or fully understand it

\- Have a good amount of SQL experience

\- Played with Python and have written a few small apps 

\- Experience with Spring, maven, Junit, etc.

I guess I'm concerned that since I've spent all my time from learning through to where I'm at now, in the same product, that I'll be lost once I go anywhere else. Feeling a ton of impostor's syndrome at the moment as I look through job postings and what they want in a candidate. I was extremely valuable at my current position due to the vast amount of very specific knowledge I had of our legacy codebase and all the odds and ends related to all the one-off features and difficult to follow code paths. I feel lost when it comes to stuff outside the platform I learned in, such as how to actually build out a deployment pipeline, dockerize from scratch, and the more nitty gritty stuff that's less coding, and more infrastructure related I guess. I also have very limited front end experience, which combined with no CS degree feels limiting.

Curious what people's thoughts are on my position. I'd like to work on a project while I look for other jobs, to try to expand my skillset and have something to point to that demonstrates my abilities. As a backend dev, I can't exactly point to anything that shows what I worked on as easily as if I was building front end components.

I have an idea for a workout app that I'd like to build as it's what I wish I had at the moment, and am curious if it makes more sense to stick with what I know and have the backend built with Java and Spring, or if I should expand my horizons and use something different like Node.js, Python/Django, or Ruby. I'd like to build out both an iOS app, and a web portal that you could log into either way, so they'd both connect to a backend that keeps track of your progress and suggests changes for the next workout, that way I can get iOS and front end web experience to point to, in addition to backend, and learning how to deploy a full stack. 

Sorry that was a big ol' dump of thoughts. If anyone has suggestions on where might be the best place to learn some of the stuff I'm lacking in, or any other suggestions on what I should look into to make myself more marketable I'd love to hear what advice you have to offer. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.",2022-07-29 17:58:35

vqnepw,Would this resume finally get me into cybersecurity?,"**Resume:** [**https://imgur.com/XDVtA1l**](https://imgur.com/XDVtA1l)

**Background:**

Bachelors in Business

My goal for two years was to get into cyber security. I taught myself networking first and studied for/passed the CCNA exam. I worked in a NOC for three months and then the opportunity to work as a software engineer presented itself(through networking by chance) . Since I had taught myself Python and JavaScript while studying for CCNA(dont ask), I got the job without having to go through a technical interview.

Even though I love the freedom of being a dev, my passion has always been security. This past month I obtained security+ and Cisco's new CCNA Cyber Ops cert (CBROPS) as well as a Splunk certification which was more for myself. Im working on more hands-on certifications such as OSCP and BLT1(blue team). Both are 24 hour lab-based exams with report writing. But i feel like im overdoing it and should be able to get a job in a SOC at least.

u0x47k,Two years into lawyer to engineer career transition. What roles to search next?,"Cross-posted from r/careerguidance. I was a lawyer for 10 years and decided to shift into tech. I started studying computer science and got a pretty great job offer on a research and development project about 70% of the way through the program, so I didn’t need to finish. I have been at the job for over a year and it is a very well known company so that is a plus. From a programming standpoint, the job involves essentially trying to get a data assessment framework built. This includes things such as setting domain-specific metrics to capture, sourcing data for those metrics, working with data engineers, doing data analysis (python, pandas, plotly, etc.), SQL, proprietary collection tools. I spend a decent amount of time doing program-wide documentation and some legal work.

Importantly, I’m able to facilitate conversations between the engineering and non-engineering side (legal, non-technical leadership, etc.). I’m finding that being able to coordinate between legal/leadership and engineering teams is valuable and not something everyone can do. In fact, it seems to be a major hurdle in the industry. My project is coming to an end and I’m looking into non-attorney jobs where I can combine my legal experience (or maybe just my ability to comfortably interface with non-technical or technical leadership) with tech engineering experience.

I'm a Product Owner in the Energy Industry for just under 2 years now. I had no previous experience in software development before obtaining this post, though I had 10 years of experience using the software I am now product owner for.

In job adverts, there seems to be a wide variety of skill-sets/credentials required and I'm at a loss as to what to go for as a matter of priority .

Would you recommend looking at startups as a next move or a bigger corporation? My current company is a relatively small (200 people) but established one.

I want to find something I believe in (I also feel passionate about history, animals and the environment, which does not really connect with what I do right now) but at the same time I want to earn more money, I earn less than 50k per year (UK) which is on the low side when it comes to tech and product owner roles. I would love to have a plan for the next 10 years where hopefully I can earn some more money and not have to worry so much. I would also love to be remote and travel at the same time or go live in a cheaper European country. Would appreciate your advice and ideas, many thanks.",2021-12-19 00:11:57

I feel like going the SRE route would be a tremendous experience in getting to learn the overall architecture of a production system, but the other part of me would really enjoy writing a ton of code and building a brand new platform.

I know that the SREs are largely focused on automation, so there's still a large focus on writing code, but mostly scripting as opposed to building out new features. SREs, at least the way I perceive it, are badass and the go-to team when there's anything critical happening, so there's definitely a large appeal there - also the salary bump would be nice.

On the other hand, it's really appealing to be able to be on a team where we're building a new platform from scratch.

de41yd,Elements of Programming Interviews Question,"I'm currently working as a tester but want to start preparing to apply for development jobs. I haven't been consistent with it like I should but in my interview prep with leetcode I usually use python.  Not because I want a job in python but because it has limited boilerplate and is a little easier to work the problem without the language getting in the way. The problem is that most of the jobs in my area are for java developers with a little c# mixed in and in my experience most job interviews are more functional (tell me about how to do this in java or what is on push change detection in angular) than algorithm based.  I'm going to be applying for positions outside the area and programming practice is always a good thing so even though many employers in my area don't have you work on leetcode problems, I think getting better at algorithms is still worthwhile. 


I think that getting the book in java will help me improve in java (I currently write automated tests in c# and javascript) which may help me on interviews in the area. So my question is if I get the book in java, will it help me improve my java skills more than getting the book in python and then just going back and redoing some of the problems in java?

crl08h,[Recent Grad] Need Advice Trying to Leave a Company That I Feel I Don't Have Any Growth Opportunity,"Recently graduated with a BS in Computer Science, I've never had an internship. I did a fair amount of extracurriculars and held two jobs throughout college (TA and school IT).

I currently have a job at a company that isn't working out for me (I've been working here for less than half a year). First, they changed my job title to consultant after I accepted the offer. I would consider my job more along the lines of product IT support with minimal programming. Initially, it was described more as a developer position. There are also components about my current job that are pushing me to leave sooner than later, i.e. - travel requirements (~60%), working overtime but salaried, along with various expectations for employees that I feel can be a bit unfair at times. Long story short, I'm trying to leave my job for something with more of a developer focus.

I am currently trying to get my start as a software developer.

During the internship it felt like I would be doing a lot of meaningful work. However, now that I've started full time it really feels like my expectations have been completely subverted. There is very little work that I'm allocated to do and the work I've been doing has little to nothing to do with my job title/area of experience and the projects where I would be able to apply my skills seem to constantly be bogged down by legal/approval issues. I've talked with some of my other coworkers about this and they suggested that the company is in a bit of a slow period/this is typical practice. A lot of my other coworkers also seem to be spending a disproportionate amount of time watching videos/etc. instead of doing work. The company is fairly large and established but it really feels like my time and the time they're paying me for is being wasted.

berun7,"CS major starting college in the fall, wondering what I should do right now/soon/during college to better my career outlook","Hi there, I'm a current high school senior heading to study CS in the fall, end goal with my computer science degree is to get some type of software engineering job.

Anyway, throughout HS my biggest regrets have been not taking advantage of opportunities that could have greatly benefited me due to a lack of being proactive in searching how to help myself find these opportunities. I don't want that to happen again when I'm graduating college and I end up having trouble finding a job when there's something I could have done 3, 4 years in the past to help my chances that now it's too late for. 

Right now, most of the programming experience I have comes from my AP Computer Science A class in school (where we learn Java fundamentals). We've done a decent amount of practice with labs and such where we implement the skills we've learned in class. I also did a little practice writing programs on my own for things I'm interested in. Anyway, aside from Java (and some HTML/CSS I picked up on for fun in middle school), I don't have much programming knowledge. How would it most benefit me to continue learning programming? Should I continue to advance my Java knowledge further or learn other languages such as Python/C++? (I'm going to obviously do both, just wondering what I should prioritize)

I plan to seek internships during college, though is there any possible chance of me getting an internship in the summer before college with the programming knowledge I currently have? I doubt it, but I'm just wondering if this is not completely out of the question. Otherwise, I will use the summer to focus on studying more about CS topics. I will graduate college in only three years (if I understand how everything works) as I have enough AP credit to cover most core requirements, so that leaves just two summers of internships before I graduate. What kind of internships should I target in these summers?

And lastly, what can I do between now and graduation to help improve my chances of being able to land a solid job out of college? I don't plan to attend grad school as of now but that may change depending on the next three years. What are the biggest things I need to focus on that can help improve my career in the future?",2019-04-18 22:46:07

a74wbb,"Just finished my IT degree online, and I still feel so behind. Any feedback/insight/advice is so appreciated!","Hi all! 

I just finished my bachelors degree in information technology with a certificate in web design and development. I took my courses online and found this to be beneficial and detrimental to my learning. I learned that I can teach myself a lot of concepts and that was very rewarding. Having any kind of mentorship, the ability to ask questions/have a dialogue about topics and concepts, group projects, and exposure the field were pretty non-existent. I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript skills. I took some classes in C and Visual Basic, and I have a basic understanding of SQL, Python, ColdFusion and Ruby. 

I don't feel confident in my skills or knowledge to get a junior developer position. I haven't used any of the frameworks and honestly a lot of it is still so abstract to me. I feel like I don't really even understand what a developer job looks like; I feel so far behind even though I just finished my degree. And it doesn't seem like many junior positions are open to teaching you - it seems like you need so much experience to get those jobs.

I'm not partial to web, but I do like it. I really enjoyed my C classes but that could have just been the instructor I had. I like being able to be creative, which is what lead me to add the certificate to my coursework. 

I took my courses online to be able to keep my job full time. I currently work on a web team at smallish company, but my job requires almost no coding, and is more of a marketing position. I write blogs posts, run our social media, film and edit youtube videos, keep our internal product database updated, and add/remove content from our website. I make almost no money and I am very eager to leave this job - but as you can see not much relevant work experience for becoming a developer.

Anyway. My real question is should I enroll in a bootcamp to get more practical experience actually building functional sites and applications or should I just try to get a job? Maybe just look at internships (although most of the internships I see require you to still be in school)? I don't really know what kinds of jobs to even look for.

If anyone has any input or suggestions I so appreciate it. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this. I don't have any friends in the field and I don't have any resources from the University I attended. There isn't any career support for their online students, plus I am out of state anyway. I'm just scared I'm too under-qualified still.

I have been looking to make a career change for some time and due to a recent and rather serious injury I'm not going to be able to make the transition as slow as I would have liked. I suffered a closed displaced calcaneus fracture after a fall from a ladder at about 20 feet. My recovery time is going to be 4 months at minimum and when I am ready to return to work it has been recommended that I stay away from the risks that I encounter daily as owner of my small business in the low voltage electrical industry.

I have been self teaching web development through Udemy courses for some time now. I'm comfortable with basic front end development using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript (with or without jQuery) and will will be moving on to back end within the next week.

Specifically these courses

For a foot in the door - https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/ - 50% complete

For fun - https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/ - just getting started (I would really like to spend more time on c++ after I finish this as well)

I was accepted into a boot camp program at Case Western University in the Cleveland area and was going to start January 15th but now given the serious financial struggles brought on by this injury, there is simply no way I will be able to afford it.

I have at least 4 months with significant time available to study, create portfolio projects, and begin networking/introducing myself in the local scene. I plan to devote 56 hours per week to studying and developing projects (8hrs/7days).

Are the languages taught in the courses I am using likely to land a job with a livable salary while I continue learning? HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, JSON and XML to work with API's, C#, and a very high level overview of C++ (I know C++ is unrelated but I've read in many places that it's good to study as it will help give me an understanding of many C based languages I encounter in the future and that it can come in handy down the line)

Should I work on anything else in the meantime or change focus entirely?

What should I include in my projects to show potential employers that I am really taking the time to learn the right way and alleviate common fears of hiring someone without a formal education?

Anything else?

I have a family to support and will do what I have to do to make sure that happens. I have always been highly valued in employed positions because of my loyalty, dedication, and for the fact that I have always worked very hard to be the best I can be at my job. I know I will be an underdog trying to get into the field without a formal education or experience but I've fought a similar battle before in starting my small business. I understand the commitment required and am taking this very seriously.



Absolutely anything you could tell me to give me a fighting chance at getting my foot in the door would be greatly appreciated and will be taken seriously.

9rngdv,Deciding between blockchain startup offers,"Hey CS career folks, 

I am in the midst of a big decision and I'm really struggling to decide. Ultimately I have two goals: learn as much as I can about the crypto/blockchain space (I find the technology itself fascinating) and use the technology to actually provide value to the world.  Both companies accomplish those goals but to different degrees. 

Company A

- Open source, very strong github following 
- Team regularly speaks at leading conferences
- Has research scientists as part of the company, which write papers etc.
- Their software is used by many projects, some of which have a little real world traction

Company B

- More funding than company A and more clear use case with a lot more users
- Overall more comp then company A and in a more attractive location
- Tech team is still strong (ex-FAANG folks) 
- The tech itself is at the application layer and not something fundamental to the space

I guess my question is, when joining a startup relatively early in your career (2.5 years exp), is it more important to join one which has a research/extremely strong tech focus to grow technically or is it better to join one which has more viability as a real use case. Obviously there are loads of personal factors involved, but nevertheless I am still curious to get the perspective of older engineers who have been through this sort of thing!",2018-10-26 18:45:28

8e8kg4,Did I make the right career decision?,"A little about myself, I began tinkering around with computers and did some not very serious web design for a startup and electronics company over a decade ago.  Not long after, I decided to go to college to earn a CS degree relatively late.

Since then I've accrued several years of experience working on primarily back-end and .Net related tech, but nothing resembling web design in my opinion.  Besides my first long term entry level employment, I had one relatively short lived job on my resume which effectively served as a crash course through cloud/distributed tech and some of the latest front end javascript frameworks.

In my latest job search, I was contacted by a seemingly reputable consulting firm, passed three technical panel interviews as a senior tech lead, and was given my highest offer yet.  I couldn't believe it.  It seemed too good to be true, and given this was only a consulting firm and not major player in the industry, I decided to go with my gut and apply for a job that I had set my sights on earlier on, mainly because it was high-profile and involved some tech that I really wanted to get my hands on.  

I applied for that job, taking from the experience, and sold myself instead as a junior to mid-level full-stack engineer.  I was hired, the work is good, the experience is just as I had imagined as I'm now doing what I had only dreamed about 10 years prior.  The only difference is, I voluntarily took a huge dock in pay compared to what I was offered by the other employer.

Part of me feels like I've set myself up, not for failure per se, but in a way that I basically ensured that this gig will be temporary even if it could have led to viable long term employment, since I might get much higher offers again elsewhere, especially with this high-profile experience under my belt.

Did I make the wrong decision?  What do?

Anything to look out for when looking at ads for remote work? I'm not 100% sure this is what I want to do yet and I have some concerns.

Examples:

* Would I be valued as a remote employee as much as an on-site employee?
* Would I have the same consideration with respect to promotions and raises?
* How are remote employees usually managed?
* How do I ensure that I stay in the loop? Would I have the same influence on projects?
* Would the job be as stable and reliable long-term?

And probably other things that aren't really occurring to be right this minute. Any thoughts?",2018-01-18 02:02:48

Since I started the job, the tasks have been manually just by opening multiple browser tabs and do visual comparison and then logging and correcting any inconsistencies to our site.


More recently, I started writing selenium scripts in python to automatically open several websites and webpages and then extract the information to excel documents.

6dqr6b,Starting Salary CE in Toronto,I was recently offered a job as a software engineer at a company with offices north of the 407. I am graduating in April 2018 and the job would start then. I am wondering what a good salary would be for a graduating Computer Engineer with 1.5 years of internship experience.,2017-05-27 23:35:14
6a52vw,Help setting wage range,"In short, I have been going through the gauntlet of interviews for junior dev positions, and it is getting to the point where I need to start thinking about what wage bracket (and other benefits) I should set myself in.  Given that I am new to the job market, I figured I would draw on the infinite wisdom of the internet to help me.

All the jobs I have interviewed for have been some combination of Python and C/C++, and have been for small to mid sized companies.  In terms of my qualifications, I am just coming out of my M.Sc. (non CS but closely related) and have lots of A.I. and Data Science specific experience (ANNs, SNNs, Expert Systems, all sorts of stats, etc.), though those skills are largely irrelevant to most of the positions I have interviewed for (positions range from embedded stuff to A/B testing to networking).  In terms of specific languages, I have 6 years of Python, just over a year of R, and have a passing knowledge (and use of) C/C++ and JavaScript (I suspect jobs using those languages recognize it is just a matter of getting use to the syntax, but maybe I am wrong).  That said, all of my experience, as mentioned, has been very academic and not industry oriented, which probably is a knock against me.

In terms of my location, I am in a city of over a million people in N.A. (eastern), though I am not in a big tech market such as NYC (I would disclose more, but I am always mildly worried potential employers troll these regions of the internet).

Having done some Google'ing, it seems median salary ranges from 50-75k, depending on the source.  That said, I am not 100% confident in those numbers (for the obvious reasons), and thus am going directly to the horse's mouth, so to speak.

As it stands now, my expectation is between 40 and 45k.  Yes I have a Masters and 5+ years of experience, but I have divided that experience in half on the grounds that said experience is academic (actually building large scale stuff for publication, not simply taking classes), which is, I suspect, worth less than industry experience.

Thus my questions to you are: (i) is my salary expectation low, high, or just right?  (ii) if it is low or high, by how much?  (iii) knowing what you know now, what would you have done differently when you entered the job market (that is, what mistakes do most new folks like me make)?  and (iv) other sage pieces of wisdom that will be of value to an idiot like me.

Thanks in advance for any replies.  I am very much fumbling around in the dark when it comes to this (the whole idea of quantifying one's ""worth"" is a strange concept to me).   ",2017-05-09 12:27:09
68naq4,Fired for performance - how should I word it or should I spin it off as a contract role?,"So I used to do a lot of freelance I.T. and short term contract tech work before focusing on programing specifically. It definitely raises some eyebrows since I rarely worked a tech job longer than 1 year. Usually due joining some sketch company on the verge of bankruptcy or focusing on field tech jobs(super bite sized, high pay). I usually pass it off as ""I'm a freelancer, and get paid more than average 9-5"".

Recently started remotely(contract as first) for a great firm as a dev ops and ended up moving there to accept full time. Problem was....I stayed at my parents house while apartment hunting...who were renovating to sell a massive house and needed help(they're elderly). Commute turned out to be 2 hours each way, my parents turned went from annoying OCD clean freaks to angry dictators who monopolized 100% of my free time to fix their dream home(I can go on...). The job required a ton of studying(they switched me to serverless AWS dev ops instead of the front end role I applied for) which I had zero time for between renovating and the super long commute.

My performance plummeted and was fired 3 months in( I don't blame them, I was a zombie running off coffee).


The experience would be hard to explain without listing this job and it's pretty valuable(terraform, AWS, serverless architecture). I could also lie and say it was just a remote contract role(main HQ is elsewhere and local office's new address isnt even online). 

I could tell the truth but I'm afraid the excuse might sound like utter bullshit and raise questions about my former short term work(all with good references but it definitely looks like I have bad luck with 9-5pm..another 3 month role ain't helping).

5i89q9,"Working long hours as a developer with an annual salary, what's unacceptable to you?","To add some context, I've been job hunting a little lately and had a company (won't say who) who offered about $50,000-$60,000 fixed annual salary.

But, they also was up front that they expect much much more than 40 hours of work each week. Let's say I worked an average of 60 hours and was paid something like $56,000 annually. That would be approximately $18/hr. For me, that is somewhat unacceptable. For me I see that, had I been paid hourly with $56,000 as the base amount for working 40 hours each week, I would have gained $29,000 if working the additional 20. That's essentially a 50% difference. I would be better off working only 50 hours and then working a side job for more money, than to depreciation my hourly earnings.

I'm curious on what everyone's cutoffs are when your job is based on a salary. I'm just wanting to make sure I'm not being too rigid in my thought process in this.

I am American & graduated w/ a BS in CS from a great school. After graduating, I booked a flight to Paris and joined the French Foreign Legion for some adventure. Not joking.

I finished my time in the FFL, will be completing an MSCS from a top EU school in 2 months, and was accepted into an M7 US MBA. I started applying for new grad SWE positions in the states about two months ago, but haven't had any luck.

However, a FAANG recruiter reached out to me via LinkedIn to apply for a job that could be described as a mix between consultant & PM. The interviews were 100% behavioral, so I aced it. The pay is approx. 200k, which is a lot more than I have ever made and the job does not sound difficult.

I believe I am very charismatic & good at leading others, but I am afraid of being stuck as a middle manager for the rest of my life vs climbing from new grad -> mid -> senior SWE.

What would my long term career prospects look like if I accept the job? Is there room for growth with a PM like job? Would it ever be feasible/desirable to get an engineering job after? Thank you.",2024-02-24 15:48:39

1812tzi,I need some job advices,"
Hi,

The recent IT job market is quite bad, I’ve resigned and been looking for a junior software engineer position for few months. Finally, I managed to get a chance to join a company recently.

The interview process was easy. No technical test or any technical questions during interview. The interviewer only looked on my resume and asked me about my experiences, explained what I’m going to do if I join the company.

The company is a small company which provides solution from hardware to software development. Hardware manufacturing is done in the head office while software development is done by its branch in other country.

I’m going to work in the head office and responsible for testing the applications that built by the oversea team, develop APIs and probably enterprise projects, showcase the products to clients and look for sales outside.

I haven’t accepted the offer, as it seems like there is little coding work to do if I join the company. I’m worried that there is few achievements I can make since most of the software development works are done by the oversea team. At the same time, I’m also tired in job hunting since I get rejected and ghosted by most of the companies I applied to.

Do you guys think that I should give it a try? 

Thank you for reading this.

Your advices will be greatly appreciated by this lose soul.",2023-11-22 06:34:58

179s2ig,Feeling stuck in career and need advice (25M),"Hey everyone!  
  
I studied Computer Engineering and finished a year ago. during my 4th year of University I worked as a C developer and after some time I understood that I want to do something that involves more problem-solving and ""hardcore"" mathematical thinking, because I found the algorithms course in university quite interesting and challenging. So after one year I started a new position as a Junior Algorithms developer. I finished my studies with a very high average (97) and I would say that I have a lot of potential but didnt have much experience as a developer before starting my first job. I also don't have the highest self esteem (Imposter Syndrome etc.), and I do have the general feeling that although I had great grades, others are probably better than me when it comes to experience.  
  
I am almost 1 year into my Algorithms developer position and I am feeling a bit bored and stuck. I am not really involved in any ""hardcore"" thinking tasks and I feel that I am not really using all my potential. I also don't have much feedback and I am on the same task for the past 8 months, so I dont feel that I am learning new things. It feels that looking around, everyone is making progress and becoming better programmers whereas I am stuck in place - I am using a very specific big data framework and most of my day involves testing different hypotheses (would say this is the ""algorithmic"" part of my job), but after 2 years as a programmer - I can only say that I know how to use (at a beginner/intermediate level) this specific framework, and not much else.  
  
I am trying to learn things by myself - best practices, algorithms, machine learning, so I can be a better ""algorithm developer"" - but it's hard to find the motivation to do so when eventually most of these things are not really required in my daily job. I just want to get really good at something and it feels that I am not getting much progress, and I am asking myself - where will I be in 3 years? will I be much better than I am now? I am not sure.  
  
Lately I became more interested in Startups, because I feel this way I will have to learn and become better and have a broader knowledge, something that might not always be required in a big company. I will also be able to dive into problems that I find interesting and important. But the real thing is that I just want to feel content, and that within time I am becoming really good at what I am doing, and I am trying to understand what I can do to get there.

16ikapk,When is it time to jump ship?,"After being laid off earlier this year (yay 2023), I interviewed with a few dozen companies and finally got an offer. It wasn't great- it definitely wasn't the job I applied for and it was a big pay cut from my previous role- but it was a job, so I took it.

And it's a nightmare.

I report to the senior manager, but I basically work for the team manager. He doesn't code, but he makes all the decisions. He decides when estimates are too high and bullies the team into lowering them, then holds people to those estimates. He agrees to any deadlines senior leaders propose, then demands the team work nights and weekends to achieve them. Because everything has too little time, it's all hacks that barely work. We never have time to test properly, but he blames us for the bugs going into prod.

Giving serious code reviews is questioned- why is this a problem? Why can't we approve this now? - so the codebase is garbage. Everyone just rubber stamps everyone else, with no concern for quality.

Anyone who speaks out about the problems, he ""takes it offline"" so he can bully them quietly and privately. Retros are rare and are focused on how the devs have done things badly. The result is a team with no psychological safety- no one dares to speak up about problems or disagrees.

I've spoken to the senior manager, the same one this manager reports to, and basically he's fully in support of the manager. He wants these deadlines hit too. Nice guy, but he doesn't see any way around this because he too will not ever push back on the deadlines set by those above him.

In a nutshell, this is a management situation in which the managers do not protect the team, they protect themselves. The success is theirs, and the failures are the devs.

I've worked at this for two months, trying to influence change, but it's clear this is how they want things to work. The devs are burned out and most are either quitting or are ready to quit.

When is it time to walk away?

What on earth can be done to try to fix this terrible situation?

Working with the HR team was a great experience. They were kind and quick to respond. However, the interview with the Software Engineering team was a bad experience. The technical interview wasn't ready on the day of the interview, so it had to be delayed. The specification was very generic, so I didn't know what they were specifically looking for. Yet, I passed.  
For the final round interview, I was assigned to one of the higher-ranking officials, and he delayed the interview 3 times until he reassigned my interview back to the initial lead engineer I had interviewed with. The interview was further delayed 2 times, and eventually, a senior engineer interviewed me. He even complimented my code from the second-round interview, and I thought everything went great for the final round interview. I expected to pass.  
After not passing the final interview round, I sent an email asking for feedback on how I could improve so that I could better prepare for my next interviews. The interviewer did not directly respond, but instead had an HR team member reply that I should work on my technical skills, especially the language I used. Wait, wasn't that the whole point of the second-round interview? I passed and he even complimented my code.  
The team also mentioned that they are very busy, so they requested that questions not be sent directly to them, but only responded to through the HR team.

I know how rest api's works i just cant create without looking any resource most likely i can produce anything using google but i am really just good at basic programming and too basic sql queries and really suck at dsa algorithms, but good at modifying the code .
.Anyway the root cause for these events stems from my being laziness and i know that ,i look at the bigger picture get-learn it and do the project this is how my learning process works,probably got adhd anyway, with little bit of work ,since gpt comes out,im considering not to use that during my two-week job preparation.
I am scared i can almost do anything but not just on junior level i guess ,except ai-machine learning things (cuz i havent done any project about them) 

But cant write any proper code on my own ,i need a job or i will be homeless soon ... 
 Had a bad experience with spring framework i got lost in it i also dont good at new java things streams etc know them but cant write them since i did not spend too much time and dont like it because java somehow become verbose to. 
   Im thinking about grinding .net for two weeks create project in it since i dont got bored or overwhelmed while doing it comparing to front end ( it's annoying for me to try to place the boxes correctly in react and i did not really spend too much time learning it but rushing my project to finish cuz of deadline(it was 4 month)).
 I only had one internship last year l2 support since the product is huge i quitted at 1.5 mont because it was boring and tiring as hell.. (new grad considering i dont have any money and need a job fast as possible on this area any area you can suggest on cs to get a job considering my basic skills and the whole process. )

15c9t5j,Thinking about going to school for another degree….computer science. Associates or bachelors?,"I went to college for animation and graduated in the midst of the pandemic where internships just didn’t really exist. Over time I’m thinking the industry might not be for me entirely and I have always had interest in computer science and coding. 

Since I have used a good amount of my federal financial aid, I am thinking about to go back to school and am super afraid the amount it’s going to cost. The community colleges around me unfortunately don’t have computer science transfer options, just associate degrees. It seems like many jobs out there in any field indicate they want a bachelors degrees. I want to make a career switch and I know education is a big part of it, even if I went the self taught route I don’t know where exactly to start nor how to show companies that I would still be a great candidate despite not having a bachelors. 


Or should I suck it and do whatever I can to get money for school to get a bachelors degree. This is a subject I am interested in and also a possibly good industry to make some decent money esp with the current economy.

I’ve been a software engineer for a bit over 5 years.

Any advice on alternative jobs that might work well with my Comp Sci degree and software engineering experience?

Maybe I can try out some sort of IT gig? Any advice?

14qplwh,Advice for my Dad (Senior SWE),"My dad has the following education:  
MS, Applied Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University,  
MS, Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Mason University  
BS, Electrical Engineering, George Mason University  
BS, Physics, ( Some University in Africa)  
WIth the following skills:  
Operating Systems: Linux, Windows, Android, and VxWorks.  
Languages/Frameworks: C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Typescript, T Python, Go, Ruby, Tcl, Go CSS, HTML, and Assembly.  
Software/Platforms: Spring Boot, Dot Net, Rails, PHP, Node.js, Angular, React, Django, and Twitter Bootstrap. Additional Expertise: Extensive UI, API, and database design experience.  
AWS Solutions Architect (2020)  
AZ-305, AZ-500, AZ-204, Az-104, and Az-400 (2022)  
After getting those degrees he has worked 27 years at various tech companies in D.C. as a SWE, his last 15 years of experience has been as a Senior SWE, Lead SWE, and now as a Technical Manager/Lead Solutions Architect at a federal tech consulting firm.  
A couple of the past companies he's worked for: Accenture, Texas Instruments, Raytheon,  
He is an immigrant from Africa and although he speaks great English now he is still not americanized and doesn't get phrases, pop culture, is a bit old fashioned. He does however, dress well, have great hygiene, manners and can be presentable - just not fun or ""high class"". I'm only adding these details so you may understand him better to make recommendations. Due to severe medical debt, a pricey divorce. and paying for my siblings college he lives pretty much pay check to paycheck and has no savings outside of owning his home.  
I'm a 22 year old college student and as my friends and I all graduated this year, I began to reconnect with my him after years of not speaking, and I wondered why he has never managed to make more than 140k a year even when he stayed at companies for close to a decade. I am going into consulting and making just under 100k, while most of my CS friends are making considerably more than that.  
Although I could be wrong, I don't think the problem is that he is a hard worker - he has always worked hours on end even when he comes home and is constantly picking up new certifications and learning new products. He has also told me that he has gotten some offers for better paying companies like Facebook but as a contractor to start which he won't do because of lack of stability. His biggest concern since has little to no savings is making sure wherever he is hired has some sense of job stability.  
Also I'm not sure if this is different for veteran resumes but his descriptions seem a little off:  
Like this is an example from one of the jobs on the resume that I feel like has to be wrong but I'm not sure how to fix it as I'm not versed in CS. Keep in mind most of his previous jobs have been in federal contracting and so I believe he cannot specify projects he's worked on so maybe that contributes as well?

• Performed duties as a full stack software architect.

• Provided Docker containers support.""  
TL;DR: Basically, he's just worked so hard and for so long that I really want him to find a higher paying job. He won't be able to work for more than another 15 years and I want him to maximize his income during that time. Do you have any recommendations of companies to apply to that he would be a good fit or what he could do differently to secure a higher paying job?

14hq9gm,Career opportunities for tech and medicine background,"Not sure if this is the right place for this but figured I'd try to scope out the landscape for job opportunities. A little bit of my background: Graduated from a top 3 CS school with a Bachelor's and Master's in CS, worked for almost a decade as a software engineer in notable startups, was pretty good, decided to switch to medicine with the eventual goal to do both CS and medicine somehow (physician scientist or physician innovator). That's still the goal and currently in wrapping up medicine. However I want to keep my options open in case I don't want to continue jumping through the hoops in medicine.

Anyone know the options for someone with a strong CS background (in the past, probably am rusty now in terms of programming and keeping up to date), and who will have an MD (but no residency)? I don't think I'll be a software engineer at least not a coder in the trenches.

1) Noticed a lot of them don’t have a section for projects- only experience or work experience. 

Is it okay to add personal projects there? So where we have the field “company name”, one would put something like “Personal Project- XXXX” 

I ask since I want to make sure it’s there in the application. I have a “Projects” section on my resume, but noticed it usually doesn’t ask for projects when applying!  


2) When adding stuff to applications in portals/ apps where you manually fill in experience, can I add more experiences than the ones on my resume? Usually I know you can add up to 8, but can’t fit those on my resume.

 I think HCI could be a good graduate field for me and I really love MIT media lab's programs. (I understand that's a lofty goal). But is HCI taken seriously as a field? Are there careers in the field, and do they pay well? Are there professorships? I'd talk to my college career center about it but they sometimes come off as overly optimistic and I need a realistic understanding of what my odds are.

124s6gr,Unsure what I'm doing wrong?,"Hi guys,

Been struggling to get a job since around late august, if not earlier than that. Just trying to get a junior software developer/engineer position, but not having any luck. The majority of positions require years of experience, which is absurd (and I'd be surprised if these employers get even a single hire who isn't overqualified), and the experience I do have is pretty niche (the only internship I got, with the GSoC program, was working on EDK2 with TianoCore). I'm trying to figure out how I can make myself stand out, but have had little luck. I've been approached by companies like Revature, but I've refused after looking at experiences with them and not finding good ones, and I'd like to avoid attempting to go through 30 internships or something just so that I can get a position that I shouldn't have to spend another 3-4 years on after I've already spent $30000 on college and 6 years of my life. I don't know if it's my resume, or something, and though I've considered ""professional resume services,"" I'm hesitant to spend $200 just to get my resume rewritten. I've considered using a service like LawDepot's resume builder, but then I'd have to strip it of its LawDepot-specific stuff. Other than this one job, I don't have any other professional experience, and I don't want to go for a bootcamp (because that would probably cost me a ridiculous amount of money).

1. Prior to accepting my embedded test role, I had the option to work in a software development team in a different company than where I am now that required high-level programming languages (C# and SQL) to develop enterprise applications. I am curious in hindsight if I made a better call taking an embedded test role to get more direct experience in embedded, or if my friend was more correct in saying that it's better to transition to embedded sw dev from an unrelated dev role than it is from a related test role.
2. If a person is interested in trying development out is there a ""time limit"" that would they should try to switch by before they're pigeonholed in test? I heard it should ideally be ASAP (and especially before receiving any kind of promotion in the test role), so I was curious if there's a general amount of time someone would need to stay in the test role before being stuck.

yio3fe,Resume question: Should I include non relevant work experience as a new grad?," Hello all,

I'm 32 and in the spring I graduated with my BS in computer science.

My CS experience pertains to project experience, my role on a research project, and a 6 month long internship. All of this obtained in the last 2 or 3 years.

I also have work experience obtained prior to starting my undergrad such as an office manager role in a commercial real estate office, prior to this role I was an office admin in the same office... Pretty generic/typical office experience overall.

On my resume I have been including a brief summary of my office manager role when applying to entry level SE jobs.. my thought process was that it might reflect that I am a sane, capable, adult who has proven to be a professional, aka ""No need to worry about this new grad, they can hold it together in a corporate environment""

However, after about 60 rejections or so I decided naturally to do another update to my resume to improve my odds, and I'm starting to wonder... when applying to new grad roles, or entry level roles:

* Is the non relevant experience listed on my resume actually hurting me?
* Putting me in a weird box perhaps?
* Flagging me as ""too experienced"" even though I'm technically not?
* Or at worst, could it being showing my age and hurting me in that way possibly?

Any feedback from recruiters here would be greatly welcomed, thank you!",2022-10-31 20:33:24

I am also pursuing a Computer/Software Engineering degree at the moment and this internship is my first “tech” experience.

My goal in the near future is to get into a more general “software engineer intern” position at a bigger tech company since I am very interested in working with some of the more popular technologies rn.

What worries me at the moment is that I won’t be able to leverage this experience in helping me achieve my goal, since my work doesn’t use any popular tech stacks that I hear a lot of companies value.

My work mainly consists of Business Central development using the AL language, creating reports with SSRS and Power BI, and some API testing/validation with Postman. I’ve also been exposed to workflow in Azure DevOps.

I know there’s more to an application than work experience, so I am working on a couple of side projects this summer. I’m just hoping that these 4 months can be beneficial in pushing my career forward in the direction I want.

Can I please get some advice on writing an appealing “experience” description?

Now that I am working full time, they have moved me to a different project and my manager has been rather unresponsive to my questions and updates. I find myself getting stuck quite often and need clarification. However, I feel bad because I know he is incredibly busy, and I don't want to bother him any more than I already have, since a lot of my questions are about stupid errors that are easy for someone with more experience than I have to resolve. However, I also do not want to be seen as a bad or lazy employee. The internship is remote, which makes reaching out to/getting to know people a bit harder than if it was in person. Also, as a nonbinary afab person, it's been hard to adjust to working in a male dominated environment. I have tried to stay busy by beginning a project of my own that mirrors the development I'm doing at my internship (javascript and html/css), it's not as if I slack off and watch netflix on company time, but I still feel really bad about this.

shzlbn,"Start With Solutions Engineering, Or Try to Find JR Developer Roles?","Hi all,

I'm looking for some insight on what first-step career choices in front of me could mean for my future. For some context, I'm in a boot camp that will be over in about a month, and I fully understand that this is just the start of my journey. I'm not expecting to have things handed to me or to be even remotely close to ""done"" by landing my first job. I want to keep learning and advancing.

I just completed my first job interview/code review on Friday for a solutions engineering role at a pretty well established and growing start up in my area. They serve large, world renowned clients in data. The interview went well enough, and I'm expecting to get another interview in the process (I was recommended to this role by a mentor of mine, and he's heard from down the grapevine, so to speak)  as they move toward hiring their new team members. Initially I was given the impression that this would be a good role to get into programming as a professional, but that if I wanted to advance into software engineer roles, I would need to keep learning and advancing in order to move upward, no matter the company. Fine with me, that makes sense.

I have another friend who manages a team at a company that is currently being bought out by Microsoft, and she thinks I should skip over the solutions engineering job, and try to find a JR or entry role in back end, which is looking like a major interest of mine in the programming world, where the other interest is data science, and eventually data engineering. Her expressed concern is that solutions engineers have a hard time moving into software engineering roles once they are in solutions.

Financial considerations of getting a job aside, what truth do you all find in this? Is it sound advice? Should I take the solutions role, if it's offered to me, and continue my education? It offers a generous yearly education stipend. Or, would it be better for me to try to find a JR software engineering job instead?

evgr3d,My Experience with Mphasis,"I tried to see if I would be allowed to make such a post, but I feel like I need to let people know of my experience so that no one else has the same fate. I am also posting anonymously for obvious reasons.

For the uninitiated, Mphasis is a multinational IT services company. 

Anyway, I got my degree in Computer Science back in May, and even though I didn't have an internship (which is super valuable - if you are still in school, do everything you can to get one), and I didn't have a particularly good GPA, I was working diligently to find a job. I wasn't having much luck until...

In late July, I had received my first call from an HR representative at Mphasis - let's call her Jade. Jade told me about this job opportunity and it seemed like the job I would want to take. I would train in Florida, and during training, I would get the chance to choose from a list of clients to work for after training (these clients were scattered across the US). This sounded great to me, as I have been wanting to relocate for quite some time. In addition, the pay was pretty good (especially for someone with no internship). I really wanted this job, and after taking an assessment (and having a video interview)... I actually received an offer to work for Mphasis. After reading the offer letter, I accepted the offer, and I counted down the days until I would begin training (October 7th).

During this time, I had begun working at a supermarket so that I had a source of income. I really enjoyed the job, but I was super excited to go to Florida for training. My last day at that market was September 26th. On the morning of the 27th (10 days before training was scheduled to begin), I got a call from Jade. I was then told that training would be postponed to the 14th of January. I was absolutely devastated, because I knew needed the money for loans. I called the market later that day, asking if I could return in a few weeks. I was swiftly told that I could not.

About a week or two later, Jade called me telling me that she was going to try to get an official confirmation that training would indeed happen on January 14th. My plan was to try to find another tech job by that time, but if I couldn't do so, I would go to Florida. At the end of October, I managed to find a job at another market as a cashier (I am still working there today). 

Around Thanksgiving, I realized that I had not heard from Jade in quite some time, so I decided to send her an email asking for an update. I received no response. A week later, I called her number, and I had the same result. A few weeks later, I called the office (where training was supposed to happen) number and I received no response. I left a voicemail. Obviously, at this point, I knew that training wouldn't happen.

On January 7th, I finally received a call from another representative at Mphasis (albeit from a different office). I spoke to another lady, let's call her Alice. Alice informed me that training had been canceled. Alice also told me that Jade is no longer with the company. I asked Alice why I was never notified of this until that day, and she told me that she could not provide a clear answer. Alice also told me that she found out about training being canceled the night before she called me.

I'm sure that other people on this subreddit and beyond have had positive experiences with Mphasis, but I would advise anyone looking for a tech job to avoid this company. I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy. I am willing to answer any question that any of you may have so long as it doesn't require me to give out any personal information.",2020-01-29 03:03:39

The URBN position will be in a small 3 person team focusing on putting predictive models into production dealing with retail issues as well as some logistics problem solving such as warehouse inventory selection.

cz0rhb,Philosophy Major Wanting to Get Into Software Engineering," I apologize advance if I am posting in the wrong community.

Basically, I'm at a bit of roadblock. I am currently studying philosophy and only have 1 year to go. Originally, my plan was to chose an easy degree in order to finish school quickly, with a good GPA in order to continue to law school. However, the last year I have realized that I no longer want to pursue law. I have taken time to explore other possibilities and decided to take the summer and fall 2019 semesters off in order to determine what I truly want to do with my life. I met with the career services at my university and was directed to various resources in order to have a better understanding of my interests. I have since realized that I am very interested in computer science and software engineering. This should have came to no surprise to me as the classes I enjoyed the most were my courses on formal and bolean logic. I had the opportunity to interview a few individuals in the field in order to confirm my interest. Since then, I have done research online and have been teaching myself to code. I am finding it interesting, yet challenging and engaging, which is exactly want I want in my career. I know that it is the field I want to pursue but I am not sure the best way to attain my goals.

Essentially, I am wanting to know the best way to become a competitive candidate for the field. Although I am close to graduating, I would be willing to take extra time to best prepare myself. Is it worth taking the time to double major in computer science even if it would take another 2-3 years? Or would I be better off adding a related minor, or perhaps an associates from a community college, due to being so close to finishing my degree as is? Any feedback would be appreciated. Thank you.

Should I go back to the first company and ask for another pay rise on account of receiving another offer? They've spent lots of money on me already as I earned a scholarship from them, and they spent money training me up etc. The 2nd company that offered me the initial rise is also very well regarded (moreso than my first company) and I'm wondering would the combination of these things coax them into offering me much better terms to stick with them.  


Is this seen as ""bad?"" Would it be an insult to my first company to ask them for a rise? How would I go about asking for better terms?  


Thanks for any help!",2019-05-06 00:20:35

b5p2yc,What next in the field of cyber security?,"I'm finding myself a bit at a crossroads - not sure how many people are in the cyber security, but I do security compliance.

&#x200B;

Here's a little background about me:

\- I've been out of school for a couple years now (BS in Computer Science) - had a programming gig before I realized that I just didn't like programming like I did before I started school. 

\- Been working in security compliance as a federal contractor - not the most exciting job in the world, but it pays well for what I'm doing.

&#x200B;

I've been thinking about taking certs, but I'm trying to decide what certs would be the best to get. I'm planning on moving in a year from now to be closer to family. I'd like to get a cert before I have start applying for jobs, but I'm not 100% sure what path I'd like to go on. I've asked a bunch of other coworkers on their opinions and plenty of questions about different routes, but I'd like to see what people here have to say.

&#x200B;

My options are:

\- CISA -- This cert would launch me into IT Auditing, which I'm worried about pigeonholing myself into, in case I decide later on it's not for me.

\- Security+

\- CISSP -- This would only give me the Associate level, until I obtain enough experience.

ar3uro,2nd year CS major in community college trying to find something I enjoy to do side projects with and need assistance,"As  the title states im a 2nd year CS major looking to transfer in the  fall, and I know how important side projects are. I am above my classes  in programming knowledge and I find the CS curriculum easy right now. I  am most comfortable with java/c#, but have some experience in c++.

I  have an idea, but I am not sure if it will be worth the effort put in. I  have used a video game engine Unity3D, and I mess around with it  because I enjoy it. I used to work on apps and found that enjoyable as  well until I got to the SQL/database side and never touched it since. I  was wondering if I made a simple (or complex if I get really good) video  game using Unity3D, and create a website for the game as well as an app  for it that could alter the data in the game. It seems like like a huge  task, and I heard interviewers arent that impressed with Unity3D based  on the easiness of it and other interviewers thinking video game  development is ""childish"".

I also heard that creating a huge portfolio of apps would be good as well. I have experience with the Android Studio framework.

I  am just stuck on what to do from here that could still catch my  interest and have me work on it in my limited free time. Any advice is  appreciated.

a5mwqj,How does a CS bachelors graduate get jobs that dont involve app creating.,"Hello all, I am graduating next year hopefully. Im 30 years old, and very happy with my decision to go back to school for CS.

The impression I am getting is 90 percent of the jobs that people with CS degrees are getting involve web apps / business software. 

Thats fine, but what about the people who are doing missle guidance, software for autonomous vehicles, and more technical applications in general. What does the trajectory look like for someone who has a job like that?

I feel like my school has done a great job with basic knowlege but push real hard for local companies that are creating webapp software for boring government programs and stuff. I just dont think I can do that long term and be happy programming buttons and fields. (sorry to generalize like that but all the companies ive talked to has basically used that example as something employees might have to do)

The languages we are taught and use are mostly python and java, but looking out there it seems like all technical application uses lower level languages like C. Will I be stunted for not having deep exposure to these languages? If I want to get a cool technical job what steps can I take now to put me in that trajectory?",2018-12-12 22:06:11
a5izuq,Creating a more realistic Job Post for an IT PM role....,"Hello applicant. The following role requires remote work while you pick your kids up from soccer practice, so please be prepared to work mostly from your phone and come in on Mondays to ask everyone why ""you were never informed of this problem"".

Applicant must have the following skills:

1. Ability to blankly stare at developers while they explain cloud architecture, then to simply say ""The budget only allows the base configuration, so work that out""

2. Repeat in meetings ""I'm not really a technical person"" so that people don't bog you down with details of what your normal job would involve.

3. Miss important decision making meetings, so that when deadlines slip, you can always say that ""difficult"" and ""indecisive"" developers were the problem.

4. Never send email or submit work tickets!!, send text messages with your requests... That way, no one will be able to hold you accountable for the outcomes.

5. Must be able to carefully screen Java Developers on their knowledge about HTML from 1998, back when you were a dev, and then ask a few questions about Java Script from the internet when the candidate is a PHP developer... Then end up hiring a Ruby On Rails developer for a job making Angular-Based mobile apps.

6. Make unscheduled visits to employee desks to make sure they aren't missing for more than 3 minutes, to reduce the company bill for toilet flushing, and to prevent other employees from exchanging ideas with each other about how ""micro-managey"" you are.

7. Create a project plan that doesn't allow employees use of the vacation time they earn. This will either maximize productivity, or ensure they leave after burnout (and before the project budget dries up).

8. Bastardize Agile, or any other methodology you know as much as possible, but expect perfect adherence to the principles from everyone else so that you can blame them for project failure (if the need arises).

Any others? :P

9tgvv3,Will a BSc in SE help me immigrate to a better country?," I've  been programming on and off since I was 17. Two weeks ago, after two  years of being away from programming, I started re-learning C++ and now I  have a pretty straightforward path set for myself and this time, I will  NOT deter from my path. My country is a cesspit, quality of education  in non-state universities are low, professors are just a bunch of  stupid, religious sycophants, they require religious studies, and a lot of girls  there are just a bunch of religious cows. Plus, the campus is so  freaking big I have to take a ride-sharing app just to go to one class  and come back home. We've only got a single subway line, and public  transportation is abysmal.

There's  a nice community college near our home, just 4-5 minutes away, that  offers BSc, or if you want, MS in SE. I just want to get out of this  country, and I doubt I can do it without a degree. So I was wondering,  should I save up and go for the 2019-2021 class? Or having a BSc is just  as good as not having one? Thanks.",2018-11-02 04:15:20

I did something not very wise and left my job and moved home before finding a new job. I've never had issues finding jobs so far in my short career (5 years), so I thought it wouldn't be a problem and I wanted to get out of the place I was living.

But it's about to be August now and I am still unemployed. I feel like I'm a pretty good developer. I'm not one of the 'rockstars', but I've always gotten my sprint work done on time and been a good employee. I feel like I have a pretty good resume, so I'm just not sure what I'm doing wrong. I HAVE bounced around a bit, to find better opportunities and such, so maybe that in combination with my current stretch of no work looks bad? I was always told bouncing around was pretty normal in our field though.

One problem is the place I moved back to has hardly ANY tech (there's only been two jobs I could even apply to), and I went pretty far in the interview process with both companies but didn't get either. So for the last 4-5 months I've been trying to find a remote job, and it seems next to impossible! I do have experience working remotely (not full time but still).

* Email the hiring manager thanking them for their time and saying that I will not be able to further the application process but with no explanation.

* Stop responding to their emails completely.

I have a philosophy degree but am considering a computer science conversion course, and am thinking about what to do with it.

How do these sorts of relationships work? Do scientists use some of their funding to employ programmers and then they work on the research together?

67toqw,Can I list an Incoming Summer Internship on my Resume for Fall Internship Applications?,"Hey guys,
I'm about to start applying to fall internships and I was wondering whether it would be appropriate to list my incoming summer internship. I did a little bit of research on this and the general consensus was not to list a job that I can't talk about yet, however I hadn't seen anybody else ask the question in the specific context of summer --> fall internships. If I did list it, it would just be one line with the title, and no description.
I was hoping a someone could let me know whether recruiters actually care about this, or if I should just forget about listing the summer internship.
Thanks!",2017-04-27 05:28:35
65xcj3,Feeling like maybe I'm not meant to program...,"Hi so I love building / making stuff and am a self taught programmer, mainly focusing on JAVA and I've built a few things in C too (as part of an online course). 
I've been programming for 1.5 years and started looking for work, I've been to a few interviews but failed the technical test (twice). I understand the ideas of programming and the concepts but struggle to implement.
For example, I'm feeling really crap today as one of my assigments is to implement the Fifteen tile game - I've had to copy code because I just can't seem to get my head around the logic, the more I look at it the more confused I get. So even though I've copied the core code, I will still hand in a non-working assignment. This is for a part time evening course in JAVA. I recentley thought I did a good job for other assignments but got a bad mark due to not thinking about one particular test case, causing an inifinite loop. I'm struggling to keep motivated on this journey.
Any advice and experience is appreciated and I appreciate if you can let me know what you think of my site:

63gqiz,Interviewing for Software Developer after 1 year of first job... suggestions?,"Hi
I graduated a little more than a year ago and had a job all lined up. It's a very large company (over 2000 software developers) and I want to try something new and find a niche in a smaller company where I can really get ownership of work. I'm constantly switched from project to project and haven't gotten a good handle on any one area in my current job. 

Anyway, I'm interviewing for position at a smaller company that is a government contractor. Currently I make close to $100k and have only 2 weeks of vacation. What should I ask for from my new company if I should get offered a job? How high should I go? It's definitely a step down for me unless I settle a good salary. I will probably be getting a raise from my current job soon anyway.

5x299h,Experienced software engineer seeking advice/mentor,"To serve as the premise for my question, I need to describe my skills and career history. Let's see if I can do that without it sounding like a resume.

**My education**

I didn't attend university. Instead, I taught myself how to code by quitting my job, obtaining a precious few freelance clients, learning on the job, taking two days to do four hours worth of work, learning really fast, not sleeping much, billing for four hours instead of two days, and barely paying rent. That was 14 years ago.

**My early career**

In my career, I have freelanced and worked for mostly small to medium sized companies. I have been really lucky, in that I have not had to look to strangers for jobs. I have always been referred by friends or colleagues. Even my first job working for someone else came from a random connection I developed while freelancing. 

**My skills**

I have worked mostly with Java, LAMP, and .NET stacks. I am totally comfortable with Linux and the command line, on a server and on a workstation (even though they have me working on a Mac now). Worked with Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, and MSSQL databases, and I am pretty good with scalability strategy around that. I also have done a lot of front end work and a lot of Javascript, but stopped during the jQuery days, so I never really got up to speed with Angular, Backbone, or the like. Working knowledge of Ruby, Python, Perl, ...

**My current company**

Currently I am working as the principal software engineer for small company, making $145k per year with great benefits (well, for a small company). I am a a full time employee under a W-2. We are a contracting and consulting company. We are using that capital to fund internal projects, and we plan to deploy each under their own corporation, allowing employees stake in those corporations. The company is just under two years old. I work remotely and live in Austin, Texas. I fly to the office, in the midwest, about once a year.

**My job**

My company has contracted me out to a 40 hour a week position working for a largish company, working on a delivery team, writing Java. Then I typically spend another 5 - 10 hours putting in odd hours with other clients, sitting in on later-stage sales and client intake meetings to provide a technical voice and to give time estimates. Also I spend this time helping out here and there with other clients, conducting job interviews, doing code reviews, aiding programmers in my company, helping to define process, write documentation.

**My priorities, up till now**

One thing that has always been very important to me in my career is that I keep coding. I've noticed that in most companies, the career track for a software engineer goes something like this: Junior software engineer, mid level software engineer, senior software engineer, tech lead .. At this point you stop coding as much, and you start going to more meetings. You talk about the projects instead of implementing them. Or maybe you start managing people directly, and you work more with the business than with the tech.

For some people, this is right on schedule. They started coding so they could eventually be the big picture guy. But my idea of paradise is being left alone for two weeks with a project to work on. So all throughout my career, I have made that clear to my employers, sometimes even in the job interview. And when it came time to take to my manager about promotions and career advancement, I have always taken the best path I could, as long as I could keep doing actual code.

**Which leads me to my question**

Well, questions, plural.

*One*

I feel like, if I'm going to invest this much time and energy in something, I should make sure I'm getting the most out of it. All throughout my career, I have just gotten random jobs by having friends refer me to their companies. If had really applied myself to a job search, maybe I would have been able to actually find my real level, and be in a better position now.

Like when you apply to colleges, you should apply to colleges you can easily get into, all the way up to colleges that you probably won't get into. Because who knows, maybe you will.

But actually, I don't really have my finger on the pulse of the industry. So what's out there, what's available? I feel like there's a possibility that I could do better than this. But I'm not sure what better even means.

*Two*

I suspect that my policy of insisting that I always work with code has kept me stagnant in my career. Have I imposed my own glass ceiling?

I'm not sure how to make sure I'm happy in my work. Can I find something that fill the need in another way? I want a rewarding, ever growing career that challenges me, and makes me feel proud of my accomplishments. What would that look like?

*Three*

I feel like I could probably be pretty good at starting my own business, building a software product or service of some kind.

Things I have going for me include:

- I have years of experience freelancing, and that has led to a bunch of helpful skills, including: How to deal with clients, how to explain technical things to non-tech people, how to do estimates, an eye for business need as opposed to technical idealism, etc.
- I have a well-rounded set of skills that would allow me to execute on an idea pretty easily.
- I feel like the freedom and passion that drove me early in my career might come back to me and allow me to do some really great work. And might lead me to some real success. I have not built software I owned in a long, long time.

Going against me:

- I have some ideas, but none of them seem like they would make much money. No pet rock yet.
- I want code in my life! So if I'm not, I need to find something equally fulfilling.
- I don't know anyone who I trust to run the business end of things. And I shouldn't have that position -- I am a bad salesman.

**Conclusion**

I know that these questions might need a therapist and not a /r/cscareers post. But I have been feeling like this for a couple of years now, and now I need to really resolve it and figure out where I'm headed.

It's important to note that when I say ""I just want to code"" and ""I'm a bad salesman"", I'm just speaking from experience. I realize that these sound kind of closed minded. In reality, I am ready to not believe everything I think.

I was thinking that maybe I could find and get in contact with someone very high up in the industry. Someone with no bias about me individually (no employers, past or present). I want to explain this all to them and pick their brain. I have considered career counselors, but I'm not really sure they fit the bill. 

Or maybe someone out there will have a suggestion.

5vt0e3,Applied to CS job -> it isn't a CS job (it's IT/support) -> Want to get back on a good path,"Hi all,

I am looking for a new job, to get out of my IT/Operations/Support role.  Fortunately, I have a good educational background in CS (BS EE / BS CS / MS Networked Systems).  Unfortunately, I've spent the last three years in a job sold to me as a mixed system analysis/design and software engineering but turned out to be 110% time Operations/Support.

In these three years, I haven't been progressing as a software engineer...at all...or even developing relevant ""DevOps"" skills work (my company is very infatuated with its internal infrastructure).  Instead of learning how to do things, I feel I've only learned how not to do things.

Right now, the projects I am really interested in tackling at work are:
* A system to gather data from the network I operate (8,000+machines)
* A system to store and allow processing / analysis of that data
* System Design (specifications / performance evaluation)
* ML/AI to operate the system without the need for people

Unfortunately, these avenues are not open to me due to lack of managerial support / available time.

Short story long, I suppose i'm to the point where I want to start in the general direction of what i'd like to focus on/what i'm passionate about, and it seems like web development and ios/mobile app development diverge separate paths. 

I'm more or less self taught and thinking about several bootcamps  or junior college. I'm stacked to the brim with debt and don't have 4 years to spend on a college degree.

Are people from reputable bootcamps and a decent portfolio of work able to land junior iOS dev jobs, or is that a laugh riot pipe dream?

5ay12r,Internship anxiety - any help is appreciated!,"Hi guys,

I started out my career path as a pre-med, student, and only switched to software engineering within the last year. My questions have more to do with software engineering internships.

Moving on: I've currently applied to a bunch of internships, some from a career fair at my school, and some just from online applications. The only face to face interviews I've been getting are from the booths I visited at the career fair.

My question: should I be discouraged that no one from outside the career fair is getting back to me (I'm assuming silent rejections here)? I'm beginning to think I only got these interviews because of my attachment to the school (Boston university), and not because of my actual skills. On the other hand, I'm not sure if outside a career fair, companies start going through applications at a later date, and is in part why I'm not yet hearing back.

As to my resume: I've been able to be a part of an app that helps BU students (don't want to specify further in case people know), and have worked in a lab from a development perspective (basic troubleshooting, etc). I have knowledge (and have used) most of the major languages (C++, Java/C#, Python, ruby, Linux, sql, html/css). I know this is a pretty shallow delve into said skills, but can provide clarification if needed.

I'm super appreciative of anyone who can offer some insight! I REALLY want to gain some good valuable experience at a full time internship, since most of my programming experience has been class-related.",2016-11-03 17:20:01

59qyw7,Am I wasting my time pursuing a career?,"As my username shows, I was convicted of a sex offense (involving my then-22 year old ex-girlfriend) thirteen years ago.  Prior to my incarceration, I had a few basic jobs in the IT field but had never finished my computer science degree, nor did I get any certifications.  During the eight years I spent in prison, I attempted to learn what I could, buying books, mostly on programming.  Since my release, I have been turned down several times for jobs even though there was every indication that I at least met the criteria they were looking for.  I was also told by an acquaintance I knew in high school that I would never be able to work in the field.

Once I told them, I could feel the mood in the room change.  The interview ended shortly after that and I was informed a few days later by letter that they had chosen someone else.

18qod2a,Seeking for advice in choosing between junior data scientist offers,"Currently I'm doing my Master's in computer science, in europe, and I will graduate in January. After that I want to work full time finally, so I applied to several jobs. Fortunately, I succesfully got selected for two jobs. Also I only have 1 year of work experience, so I'm still a Junior, and hence I applied to Junior Data Scientist positions.

The two offers that I received is both Junior Data Scientist positions, howewer, one position is at a bank, and the other one is at a startup with around 200-300 employees. Here are the differences:

Bank:

Only 2 HO/week, with worktime start at 9am until 5:30pm. Lots of protocols and strict rules that I have to obey. Huge amount of customer data, with various projects, from simple data analysis to more advanced modeling. Actually, I don't exactly know what kind of tasks they have there, and what kind of models they use. Also, it could be a stable, long-time workplace for me. Furthermore, they plan to recruit 3 Juniors including me, so I will start with two other Juniors, which imop is not a good scenario, because the managers will compare your performance, and also harder to get attention from the seniors, because they will have to look out for multiple juniors. The team is talented and filled kind people. They told me that most of the time I will have to work on 2-3 projects simoultaneously.

Startup company:

3 HO/week, with more flexible worktime, from 10am to 4pm, and it suits me more because I'm not really a morning person, and getting up early really affects my performance. The company is in the industry for 5 years, and currently has a stable amount of orders, and is still growing. I will be the only Junior on the team, so I could have all the attention from my senior mentor. All the managers that I've met during the interviews had a cool and relaxed attitude, which is very positive for me. They work with NLP/text and time series data, so it is really interesting. They have a SaaS product, that will be in the focus most likely.

So both opportunity seems very interesting. Since both company offers me the same exact salary, there is no good or bad, I think they are both good, but they offering diferent carreer paths. I have some concerns, like what if the startup company won't make it? Or what if they want me to make live codes right away without onboarding? Regarding the bank, what if I won't be sufficient for all those divers projects? But maybe a bank will be looking better in my CV?

So many questions. What would you suggest for such an indecisive newbie data scientist for making the most out of his career? Obviously my main goal is to learn as much as I can at my future job.",2023-12-25 18:43:33

They asked me if I was a team lead, probably to gauge if I had leadership experience. Unfortunately, I said no even though I have experience leading projects and delegating tasks.

Quick background: I'm a Mechanical Engineering graduate transitioning to web development. Currently unemployed, I have two potential job offers and would likely take the first one that comes my way.

My biggest lead is a company that specializes in ERP systems. They're looking to hire a lot of junior NetSuite consultants, so I have a good chance of getting an offer, and the hiring process is moving pretty fast. My concern is that I wouldn't be getting much relevant experience for my desired career path, because I'd be working with NetSuite's SuiteScript, which is based on JavaScript, but is a proprietary language. Besides that however, this is a young company of around 28 employees, and they are offering fully remote work. The people there also seem to be very supportive, and it seems like a great working environment.  
Has anyone here had experience working with erp systems? Would the experience be relevant to web development? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated! ",2023-11-15 17:46:35
17skdg6,Jobs/Career Paths Compatible with 30 hrs/week,"Posting this for my friend who is not on Reddit... please read in full and note that this is more open-ended than just asking for chill SWE jobs.

My friend is a CS PhD student in a top 15 department and worked for 2 years as a SWE before grad school at a nationally known but non-FAANG company. She got excellent performance reviews and was generally able to complete her work in less time than others. However the company required everyone to work >40 hours per week, so she had to spend 40 hrs/wk in the office and logged 45.

She tells me her ideal would be working \~30 hours per week, but she also doesn't want to work ""part-time"", as in practice this means sacrificing benefits and the ability to work on interesting projects and affects the way you are viewed by co-workers and by the company. 

One obvious idea is to try to be a SWE at a chill company, particularly a remote job where hours are not precisely tracked. She could plausibly get all her work done in 30 hours if the standard is 40 (depending on who her co-workers are, perhaps). So my first question is how plausible is this scenario? And any tips for finding such a job?

Alternatively, are there other tech jobs where working 30 hrs/week would be plausible? For more context, my friend most excelled at and enjoyed the ""big picture"" project planning part of the SWE job; she was still good at the code implementation, but it was the big picture where she thrived. Are there ""big picture"" tech jobs that could be done in 30 hrs/week?",2023-11-11 02:15:03

I was working as a automation tester for two years and my contract ended three weeks ago. This was my first job after graduation and I have always wanted be become a developer.   
During the past two years I have been doing a lot of automation. I have coded an application with front and back end that automates browser testing, I have coded an automation framework using a combination of scripts and I have also coded some utility scripts too. Additionally, I also have a AWS certified developer - associate certificate. I don't have any personal projects except for my website where I learned some basics about React while making it.  
I was wondering if anyone has had similar experience of switching from qa to dev. I am unsure what I should do, especially in the current market which isn't that friendly to lower level dev positions.   
Here are a few questions that I have  
\- I am applying for the positions where experience is not mentioned. But what about the ones with a few years of dev experience? Should I try applying for those as well? What about the ones for new grads?  
\- In terms of practicing, it seems that there are a lot of things I can do/learn. I am not sure whether to go for another certificate, do small questions on websites like leetcode or learn about some other framework.  
\- Given the current market climate, I am preparing to have a gap in my resume. My current explanation is that my previous company did not inform us that they are not extending us until a week before the end date. I am unsure how valid this explanation is in an interview and was wondering if there are any better ones  
\- I am also considering doing freelance work purely to get some dev experience for the resume. I was wondering if anyone had done any freelance work and how effective those were in terms of getting a full-time job.

16pf3wb,Resuming CS Career after Illness,"Hello everyone,

  
I was wondering if this supportive community can offer me some pointers regarding my professional situation. I'm coming back from a career break of three years; I experienced health issues on a recurring basis due to which I had to spend extended time in hospitals. The recovery took a long time and I'm much better now.

  
I'm in my mid-30s and in my previous role, I was a machine learning researcher at a corporate research lab in France. I was fortunate to get the opportunity to pursue my PhD in machine learning and optimization at a prestigious university.

  
 I've realized that I can't continue as a researcher due to the demanding and competitive nature of the domain; a role as a data scientist in an organization with reasonable expectations will be a better fit for where I am currently.

  
I'm using my time now to work on a project for my portfolio and also to catch up on important developments in my field over the past couple of years. Part of my work is also preparing for interviews and identifying organizations that can be a good fit for me. 

  
However, I lose the motivation at times since I work from co-working spaces in my home-town; hence, there isn't that supportive environment of like-minded colleagues. As I'm finding my footing, it'll be really helpful to have someone to bounce ideas off and touch base regularly regarding my progress; very much like I used to do with my PhD advisor.

  
I'm feeling awkward reaching out to my advisor and former colleagues since they work in prestigious, competitive places and might not have the time; also during my period of illness I could not maintain contact with my professional circle. 

  
Any thoughts or suggestions will be most helpful. Thanks.",2023-09-22 16:44:11

I made just enough money to cover my rent and basic necessities, but beyond that things were tight. Life was not enjoyable, and I knew I had to work hard to get into a decent career.  
  
One night in the breakroom, I started looking into a career involving programming (something I dabbled in through middle and high school). Because I had bills to pay I knew that going back to college (I already have a degree in Biology) in person would not be feasable, so I started looking into online degree programs in computer science. After a few months of researching, I decided to enroll in Western Governors University's computer science program. For the next two and a half years I dedicated all of my free time to completing the degree. The degree program seemed to hit all of the vanilla CS degree courses (DS&A, discrete math, software engineering, etc.) plus earn me a certificate in Project+ (project management certification). I was able to graduate from the degree program in June, with my capstone being an AI image recognition software written in Python w/tensorflow. During the degree program I also went out of my way to earn a Network+ certification and got a help desk job that pays a little more than what I was making at the Amazon warehouse.  
  
Since June, I have been focusing on developing my Java development skills (I really enjoy programming in Java). I completed the university of Helsinki's Java Programming MOOC (parts 1 and 2) and took that knowledge, combined with previous JavaFX experience, and created a simple multiplayer chess GUI. I have a few projects from my degree program written in various languages that I could include in a portfolio, however I really feel like I want to include projects that are wholly mine.  
  
I feel like I have come so far and accomplished so much, but I don't have any connections to the world of programming and because of this, it seems impossible to gauge what I need to do in order to get that first junior software engineer position. Should I continue on and self-learn about Spring boot, React, Database integration, etc and make a portfolio with applications utilizing these technologies or am I at the point where a position is within my reach? From my perspective, it seems like what I need to do is learn more tools and incorporate them into full-stack applications that can go into a portfolio, and then MAYBE I will be ready. Am I just overthinking this??

After a couple of years working in non-profits I got a little jaded by job instability and transitioned to a non-technical career with an energy/climate focused startup. There I was introduced to software development for the first time in my life, which I was very quickly intrigued by. In 2020 I decided to enroll in a web dev bootcamp while keeping my full time job. After about a year, I completed the bootcamp and was able to quickly transition into a technical path with the same company. I've been in my software development role for about a year an a half now. The transition was one of the best personal and financial choices I've ever made. I finally am on a career path that I am proud of and want to develop further.

My question is, should I continue my education by considering a post-bacc CS program. I really love software development and I can write code just fine, but there is a part of me that is very curious and just wants to go deeper.

10fmvnc,Looking for advice as a new grad SWE," I’m set to graduate this spring with a job lined up requiring relocation to the Bay Area. I interned there this past summer and am grateful to have received a return offer.

Thing is I currently live in the Midwest, and if given the option between the two areas, would rather stay to be closer to family/friends/gf. I’m currently interviewing for roles in the area and remote, but have struggled to gain traction with companies that can offer compensation/prestige close to what I already have.

My relocation to the Bay Area would not be to live with my best friends, work my dream job, or be closer to home, but rather because it was the best salary/company combo I could land a job with.

I’m facing a lot of uncertainty right now and am looking for advice on how to proceed.

* Should I grind extra hard these next few months to find a comparable job that allows me to stay in the Midwest?
* How should I feel about moving to the Bay Area with complete intention to interview for opportunities to move back while I’m there?
* How helpful for my career track would prioritizing the job at a bigger tech company over a lesser known company in a location I’d rather live in be?

I've recently been let go of a coveted position in the tech industry due to a variety of reasons (performance issues, problems outside of work and mental health played a role). Overall, the position wasn't for me but I wouldn't know that unless I tried it. Anyway, after being out of the industry for 4+ months, I've spent my time learning about what other positions I could pivot to and I've worked hard to sharpen up my knowledge to get me there. However, now that I'm having a hard time finding work, it seems like I'm starting back at square one. I realized that upon my exit from the company, I had to sign a ""non-compete"" agreement and that may be contributing to why I'm not getting hired. It almost seems like all of my hard work and experience doesn't matter anymore.

To be honest, I'm frustrated and a little discouraged because I'm a hard worker and I'd love to have another opportunity but it seems bleak. Has anyone ever been through something similar? If so, what did you do to overcome it?",2022-12-27 21:08:51

yvyvy6,Resumes for impact,"(this is my first posting from an account with my actual name vs my alt)

I was an software dev, manager, director and now I run a technical recruiting agency and one thing I've consistently seen with resume that get rejected (either at my review before they are submitted to prospective hiring managers or by the hiring managers themselves) is that developers/engineers do not call out the impact of their work. 

For example, I see this all the time: 


> Write Cypress tests in TypeScript to increase test coverage of the features owned by the team as an embedded QE.

On the surface, its 'fine', because that is the person's actual job. 

But, it doesn't stand out from the dozens of other resumes where they literally say the same thing. 

OTH: 

> Write Cypress tests in TypeScript to increase test coverage to ~60% of the 11  features owned by the team as an embedded QE.


Does call out the actual impact of this persons work. 

So, some free advice for you: look at your job duties less like a items report of what you did and more of how you impacted the team, company, product etc. Even the impact might seem small or not important the fact you are aware of it, tracking it and analyze makes you stand out.",2022-11-15 14:31:20

I imagine some of you can help since you'll know more about me finding a new job or finding freelance work. I'm a dev with 15years of experience. My current job is a dead end so in January I'll resign and I was thinking I should switch to freelance instead of find another job. The problem at all the jobs I ever had top salary in my department is 88K USD (or 120K here in canada). Usually smaller companies hire me since they don't care that I don't have a degree. Everyone depends on me and I got bored doing all the work with little benefit

I want to try freelance, At my job I use SQL (Sql Server, postgresql, sqite), write lots of automated scripts and develop our websites using asp.net. I don't mind switching to html/css/js when doing freelance as long as I can host the content on my own servers and reuse my code on all the sites I do.

The problem is how do I go from a nobody who never done freelance to having enough work to break even on salary in about 6 months? I would like to be paid no less than $50/hr but I hear there's always a guy in a poor country who'd do it for $7/hr which makes me think I need to target companies close to me.

I was thinking I could try to get a client or two and work weekends for a little while but I heard many projects only last a week and if it takes 5hours a week to find a project then it seems like freelance would have too much overhead to be worth it unless I can find large projects?",2022-10-31 21:50:30

I've known it for a while, but I'm an engineer at heart (all A's in math/science in school). I enjoy solving technical problems and am hoping for some guidance navigating a transition into CS (though I'm open to other suggestions). I had some CS basics in HS & some intro courses in college & the industry values certs more than most (requiring less time investment to get started).

What is the fastest means of moving into a career as a developer?  Which languages (&/or skillsets) have the longest staying power (i.e. are least likely to change significantly in the near term).  Pretty sure I'd take aim at some certs rather than going back to school, but advice welcome here too (which ones, are university bootcamps worth the name recognition?, etc).  How significant is the hurdle getting someone to give me a shot with only certs (any recommended plans of attack, projects, etc)?

w8fe7q,Need Advice: Leaving the city for the mountains,"I received an offer from a reputable company in a domain that I'm interested in growing in. TC is high for MCOL area but would be low for a HCOL. Except that I would need to relocate to Utah. 

I think it would be cool to ski/do outdoors stuff for a winter, but after living in a tier 1 city (NYC, Chicago, SF),  I really enjoy the stimulation and walkability of a city. With that, I think I would only like to be in Utah for a ski season or at least have the optionality of choosing where to live. 

The company does have offices in ""bigger"" cities, so that could be an option.  That would require switching teams, though, and ideally I would like to be able to see some decisions through and stay longer than a year. 

My gut is to maybe continue searching for a role that has remote options, or search somewhere in a city that's accommodative to both city life and outdoors life like a Seattle, any California city or Denver.

My current job is fine. It's a cushy job in a tech arm of a non-tech company. I typically do above what I'm asked with pretty minimal effort. Tech is so old though and I get an existential crisis just thinking about how I'm stagnating.

dsqs5y,Join a startup company vs large corporation,"Hey guys!

I need some advice or suggestion about my next job opportunity. I recently got offered a position at a startup in the finance industry and I was also offered a position at a fairly large company with 2,000 employees.

Startup Company compensation & benefits:

* $90,000 salary
* healthcare, dental, vision, 
* 1 week paid vacation, 
* 5 sick days.
* ping pong table, game room
* Friday catered lunch
* no equity
* MacBook pro
* Casual

* $90,000 salary
* healthcare, dental, vision
* 3 weeks paid vacation
* 7 days sick days
* 401k
* pay for certification/learning/school 
* Business attire

I am having trouble making a decision between the two. Some red flags I have about the startup is they are only 2 years old with no revenue. They raised $10 million pre-seed with no working product at the moment. Their last 2 developers quit halfway through the project and now they are urgently hiring developers to help finish out the final features so they can start selling their application to their list of waiting clients. Their CEO is very nice and I can see myself getting along with the team. They have a cool office environment with that is casual and it's downtown with walking distance to all the restaurants and bars. They have a small team of 1 scrum master/pm, 1 lead developer, 1 front end developer, 1 designer, and I would come on board as their backend developer. They are working on a mobile app within the finance industry which is exciting.

The large company is very stable grossing over $200 - $500 million per year and I would be working with a large team. They have 200 in house developers and 100 offshore developers. The company is also close to home as it's only an 8-minute drive. I would be a back end developer working on maintaining code and not really learning new technology. Most of their systems are already built out so I would be responsible for bug fixes a majority of the time.

dpq5gq,General question about jumping from IT to CS,"Hey Reddit,

Just looking for some advice on this one. Currently, I work in desktop support. Been doing it for about 6 years now. Haven't made any real progress in terms of degree, certifications, or career in general. Made a few jumps, more desktop support, for a little more money in my pocket. I'm not happy in support. I don't know that Infrastructure is going to make me any happier, albeit it would bring a bigger pay check. Here's my conundrum: I'm 33 y/o, and will turn 34 in 2020. I have about 38 (some won't apply to a BS in CS, so maybe less) credits towards a General Studies AA. I'm pretty weak in math, though I really want to learn it and last time I took Algebra, roughly 10 years ago, I did well after my second attempt and finding a good professor and in an effort to truly learn mathematics I've bought some second hand text books for Algebra and Trig and am currently working through them. 

TL;DR I guess what I'm getting at is if I graduate with a degree in CS, at the age of 37 (at best if I go full time) with only desktop support under my belt (maybe sys or network admin if I pick up a cert or two and find a role within that time frame), what are the prospects for someone like me finding a job in the CS realm? More specifically, security side, reverse engineering, malware analysis type stuff, 0 day exploit research, vulnerability research, etc. 

Is there anything I could do to sweeten the deal? To make myself more employable?

Be brutally honest. Thanks.",2019-10-31 16:39:56

So to give a brief background on myself I'm 26 years old and currently a Junior SQL Dev. I've been a Dev for almost 3 years now and I do enjoy it. I enjoy learning new things, being challenged and creating. I also enjoy troubleshooting

&#x200B;

My first job as a Dev was working on a application which had [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) for a front end and a SQL DB for the back end. I enjoyed the role but had to leave as I was spending a lot of time doing nothing as there was no work coming and the work place became quite toxic. It was enough to affect my health

&#x200B;

My current job is purely SQL along with SSRS and some SSIS however again the work has dried up. I spend a lot of time running the same scripts over and over again daily or data entry. There's not much chance to test anything as there's only the production server and that's it. Any other learning is frowned up on as well (micro managing boss)

&#x200B;

Unfortunately due to health reasons I couldn't carry on with my degree when I was younger so I'm on a loosing front with that. I'm basically competing against people who on paper have a lot more to offer than I do.

&#x200B;

However instead of complaining and my depression / anxiety getting worse I want to make a change. I learn programming languages in my spare time. Been learning C# with plans to learn more to do with .NET and .NET Core. I have knowledge of Javascript and Angular so I'm flexible enough to learn whatever I need to

&#x200B;

At the end of the course I had to find myself an internship. I got one at a small start up, and they decided to hire me after the internship was over with the help of a government subsidy. My boss was more than happy when he saw I also have a degree in Liberal Arts, considering most of the people I work with don't have English as their first language. He decides to use me as his lackey for documentation writing. 

&#x200B;

Let me give a brief rundown on my tasks at this company for the past 8 months:

\- Front-End development with HTML, LESS, and a bit of AngularJS

\- Hot Fixes on front and back end

\- Requirement gathering for projects I wasn't going to work on

\- Documentation writing for projects I wasn't going to work on

\- Then, around June he wanted me to design - all on my own - an entirely new API micro service able to consume several other APIs from other companies and be able to be agile enough to work with the requirements of 50+ other companies with their own requirements regarding data transmission, as well as make calls to other micro services in our system. So for this I did:

\- Requirement gathering

\- Documentation writing

\- UML2.0 Diagrams

\- Oh, and this all has to be done with MongoDB in Lumen using an Apache server in a Docker container. I've used none of these technologies before except for Apache. I've also never worked with micro services.

&#x200B;

So now the time has come to actually implement the project, and I am just feeling completely overwhelmed and falling into a depression. I told my boss I haven't received enough experience on this job in order to implement this, even with the help of one other programmer (who's still in school for his bachelor's btw). I told my boss I'm still a junior developer and I don't have enough experience to do this properly and that I need a team leader to guide me. His response was I'm no longer a junior dev I'm an intermediate dev now...

&#x200B;

My biggest fear is that I've been taken advantage of by writing so much documentation, that I'm actually a worse programmer now than at the beginning of my internship, and that now I won't be able to find a job if I started applying to other companies even though I'm in Montreal. 

Looking for advice please!

I frequently have this issue come up where now I want to run a *slightly different* experiment, or plot things in a slightly different manner, and now I have to re-write a bunch of code or refactor. I want to improve my code so that this stops being necessary.

I was wondering if there's some kind of easy visual tool people use to make it clear exactly which pieces of data are encapsulated or returned. I'm thinking I could just make diagrams like this myself in paint, but I assume there's a vast amount of effort that other people have put into making tools like this.

Any thoughts?

8jv0tl,Internship interview this Friday with a branch's Software Engineering Manager. What to expect?,"Well I'm really curious as to what to expect. This company is global, with offices in NA, EU, and AS which has me wondering if it will be more technical, geared towards course work/projects I have done, or the more likely a balance of the two. If anyone has any experience with this level of interview I would really love to talk with you about your experience with the process. 


Follow-up:
It went well I believe. Nothing really technical, more about just talking about my favorite/least favorite classes and how far along I was in school. I think a technical interview may be next in line as he said he was going to talk to a few people(engineers I'm assuming - hopefully about when they are available) and to contact him if I do not hear back in a few business days.

8dqtpg,Choosing the right grad school,"I'm trying to make a career in Data Science and am applying to grad school programs in data science. I have finished an undergrad degree in Physics and Applied Math from a big state school and have the following options to choose from. (These are programs I have already been admitted to)

1. [Rutgers MSDS Stats Track](http://msds-stat.rutgers.edu/msds-academics/msds-req)

2. [UPenn MSE Data Science] (https://dats.seas.upenn.edu/programofstudy/)

3. [Simon Fraser University MS Big Data, Canada] (https://www.sfu.ca/computing/current-students/graduate-students/academic-programs/bigdata/about.html)


I am currently an international student in the US and immigration is sort of a big deal for me. Canada is significantly easier to immigrate to once you have a Canadian degree and the SFU program is also significantly cheaper (almost half the price of Rutgers or UPenn).

I'm really confused about which program to choose. The Rutgers and SFU programs have the advantage of a practical work component built into the program but UPenn is just a better school overall.

Canada is easier to immigrate to but does not have as many job opportunities as the US.

Does anyone know anything about any of these programs or any advice in general? I'm pretty confused and have less than 2 weeks to make a decision.

6q7111,Recent college graduate switching to Software Engineering - Advice on how to layout a plan for the next 2-3 years?,"Hi everyone! I recently graduated from college double majoring in Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering. I am currently working for a mid-sized construction/electrical company as an engineer helping to design security and electronic systems for federal clients. The job is more electrical engineering than anything else, I accepted the offer because it was close to home and so I could do my Masters in Software Engineering at the same time (part time obviously, for now at least).

My primary goal at the moment is to get 1-2 years of experience under my belt because any kind of engineering experience out of school is better than nothing. I want to transition into a Software Engineering job because I found the programming classes I took in school far more interesting than my main curriculum and it pays better. In terms of work/school balance, what is the best way to approach the coming years so that I can be the strongest candidate possible when I eventually look for a new job? Financially I am pretty flexible so I can go full time and focus on school once I feel I have enough valuable experience at my current job and finish my masters quickly.

Some important notes:
-My undergraduate degree is from a top school, but the Masters program I am starting in the fall is from a decent university in the area.
-The most relevant experience I will be gaining involves programming and testing our systems before installing them for our clients, the software used is typically pretty high-level so I'm not sure how applicable this is for job recruiters
-As part of my job, I'll be getting my top-secret security clearance in about a year and a half.
-My current job pays 73K, how will this affect my job search when I switch fields, if at all?

Any kind of advice would be a big help!

6ogfaf,What should I do with the next year of my life? Help me get on track,"Hey everyone. I majored in bio and became super interested in CS when I was a senior, at which point it was too late to change majors. 

-----

I got a job at a little biomed company where I work on imaging software which is paired with a web service for updates, file transfers, etc. If it makes any difference, the desktop software is in C++ and some UI is in Win32 (ancient) while other UI components were built using C# and WPF. The web service was built using ASP.NET with a basic administrator UI built using Angular 4. I have gained a lot of understanding of how to implement and test security when building web apps and also when building physical networks, and I have learned a lot about relational DB design and data analysis. The tech and techniques we use are ancient but I get a surprising amount of leeway to come up with my own projects and experiments. I get paid $50k US per year but it's a high COL area so I have been living at home until I can make a bit more. 

-----

I have been taking classes after work - so far: Intro to CS, a Java programming course, a C++ course, discrete math, web app development with C#.NET, and computer architecture. I want to eventually work on healthcare software (or any software) for a major company. 

**Here's my question:** should I keep my current job which is fairly laid back and focus on taking a bunch of classes or should I focus on finding a more challenging job which might pay more and be a better learning experience? 

Relevant factors:

* I'm not sure I can even find a decent job since I haven't taken many CS classes
* I think that if I stay at my current job I can manage to take data structures, algorithms, and computer language theory in the fall and software engineering and operating systems in the spring which in my understanding would basically amount to a core CS education

6fiiwk,The challenges of a junior dev reporting to a manager and working with a team that won't set you up for success,"I'm in a bit of dilemma. I could use some advice.

I've been a software developer for over three years now. The first two years, I was a PHP developer, and I was really good at the stack that we used. I pioneered a lot of things pertaining to the products we created, including implementing object-oriented programming, setting up local dev environments, and writing scripts to deploy code. I even started messing with frameworks before my department changed stacks. I had absolutely no problem with coding; I am self-taught, in that I have a degree in business management but fell into web development.

About a year and a half ago, my department changed it's stack to Java web apps. There is a bit of a learning curve here, and I feel like that alone has caused me some problems. Java is NOT the same as PHP, not even by a long shot. Learning Java, Spring, ORMs, Eclipse, and other web dev technologies associated with Java has been difficult enough. I've learned to appreciate the language after some time, though.

My problem is the way my team and manager works. It's almost a cardinal sin to ask a question that someone else knows. If you ask a question that someone else knows, there is this idea that because they know it, it should be easy for you to figure out as well, and they either won't respond, or give you a very vague answer. I don't really work well this way. I feel like it's a waste of time. If I know something that someone else needs to know, I'm always more than willing to share knowledge and give them step-by-step instructions on how something works. I don't see value in vetting someone just for the sake of vetting them. If my company hired someone, then they trusted their skill set enough to have them on the team. There is no need to further complicate things (in my opinion) by making someone dig for an answer that is not going to benefit their software development education, or stress them out.

For example, if I'm working on legacy code, and I can't figure out how to build a particular project, I'd ask the person who originally coded it what I was doing wrong. Either I won't get any response at all, or I'll get a really vague or sarcastic response. I understand to some degree that it is annoying when people ask questions, but it's become a bit of a thing in my department and I'm confused as to where this leaves me in terms of being a software developer, because I was so good at my previous stack but feel like I suck at my job now.

My Dev team has tripled in the last three years. A lot of the people I work with are used to a ""wear multiple hats"" environment. However, i don't think that works well when the company is growing as well as the team. You can't (in my opinion) have twenty Devs that do everything. At some point, you have to start breaking things up into teams, specialties, etc... It's different when there are only five Devs doing everything, but when there are over twenty Devs on a team, it seems like the whole ""Welp! Figure it out!"" approach is a bad idea.

This has caused me stress beyond belief. It's made me feel worthless that it takes me hours or days to figure out something that someone can teach me how to do in ten minutes, and it's made me question my career choice. On the one hand, if something is so easy (I tell myself) then why can't I figure it out in a timely manner? On the other hand, I use the following analogy. If there is a needle in a haystack, and someone knows exactly where the needle is, then there is no value in making someone else looking for the needle look through the whole haystack. They put in the work to understand what a haystack is, what a needle is, where the haystack is, so just tell them where the needle is. Of course, if you know the needle is in the back of the haystack on the bottom, it's ""easy"" for you to find it. But it doesn't mean that it's easy for someone else who has no idea where it is, staring at 1,000,000 other pieces of hay, to find it.

My manager is one of the biggest offenders of this, so telling him is going to do me no good. I have people on my team that have no problem sharing knowledge, pair programming, walking me through an API or script that they built, but then I have other people who just... won't.

I am not a genius, but I don't think I'm stupid either. I've built a lot of apps from the ground up for the company I work for. I just think that this team mentality doesn't gel well with my work style, and I'm stuck on what I should do.

Am I not cut out to be a web developer? Is there something I'm doing wrong? Am I not crazy? Is this common in software development teams? Any feedback is greatly appreciated!",2017-06-06 01:01:41

5m43ia,2 months into new job at well known company... not happy,"tldr; I'm a bootcamp grad that has been doing front-end/fullstack work for 3 years. I quit my last job and joined a well known social site and now after 2 months... I'm just really not that happy with it.

In the job search that lead to this job I was pretty well sought after and with 3 offers in hand it really became a hard choice. At the last minute I went with this job to expand my horizons of Javascript frameworks and to join an established company with tons of users. The only thing that I didn't think too much about, was that they use Backbone which I had very little experience with. I didn't think it'd be that big of a deal, but overall the codebase is pretty monstrous and fragmented.

Furthermore, the SF office that I'm in is the satellite office. So we're in a shared space that doesn't really evoke the company's culture much at all.

Anyway... any advice or thoughts? Stories of being in a similar space? I've told myself I owe it to the company and to me to at least stick it out 6 months. But after coming back after the Christmas break, this first week has just felt depressing.",2017-01-05 03:52:49

5g08ex,Salary disclosure: Interview Offer,"At what point should you disclose your current salary/compensation package from your current employer if the recruiter asks?

I recently interviewed at a large tech company. The interview went well and the next day, I heard they wanted to proceed to hire me. They mentioned the next step would be to meet with the hiring manager to learn more about the role. Then, The recruiter asked me to disclose my current salary. Following advice from others, I decided to not disclose - I was curious to know what they'd offer me first. However, I wasn't prepared for the conversation to go right into salary so I was taken back. I asked if they could state a range for the position but they didn't yield.  I told them I wasn't able to disclose my #s. They didn't bother to ask me what range of salary I was interested in and I failed to ask (head smack). They told me their company likes to get the total compensation package numbers from an interviewee's employer so they can be competitive. 

At what point is it clear that you can disclose your total compensation package if the company you are interviewing needs to know? Should I contact the recruiter now -- before I meet with the hiring manager next week -- to provide those numbers?
Or did I just set myself up to be lowballed? :(

This is my first time doing this.

1bhrr6l,"To be ""a software engineer"", or not to be, that is the question","Hi Reddit,  
  
Quick disclaimer before I begin: this is my first-ever post on Reddit, so apologies if it lacks polish in terms of general Reddit etiquette.  
  
So, I graduated with a degree in CS in 2020 and have been working as a software engineer ever since. I've switched jobs twice so far: the first time due to a really pathetic work environment/culture, and the second due to a role that just wasn't providing the kind of learning in terms of industry standards that I was looking for.  
  
I'm currently working for an Irish-based startup and have been with them for slightly over a year now. The work culture is great, and the people are reasonably enjoyable to interact with, but I feel like I'm stagnating again in terms of general career progression and things/milestones to look forward to, which makes it feel like I should potentially think about switching again. However, the last thing I'd want to do is to switch to another engineering role that will eventually boil down to the same kind of dead end that I find myself in now, so I was wondering if you all could provide any advice in terms of what the best thing to do in this situation might be?  
  
I enjoy coding, but I won't say I'm passionate about it in the way that people who ""dream"" about code are. What I enjoy most is building things from scratch and solving interesting and new problems along the way, but as things currently stand, most of my time on a daily basis is spent solving bugs related to others' code, which I absolutely hate doing by this point. I don't think my passion for problem-solving is in any way tied down to the software engineering industry or the practice of coding in general, so I was thinking that it might be time to make a complete career switch from software to something else entirely. But I thought I might try to get a better understanding of some of the other opportunities in the industry that I might not know of before making an informed decision in this regard.  
  
The other option I was thinking about was pursuing a master's and maybe specialising in a niche that has more interesting work opportunities in store. But again, I think it would be dumb to do so without getting a better idea of what the day-to-day for said opportunities might look like, so here I am.  
  
What kind of advice would you give to someone in a position like mine?

Is resolving tickets/bugs and integrating the occasional feature into an already existing behemoth of a code base all day with little to nothing more to look forward to all there really is in software engineering roles, or am I missing something here?

What other CS-related career options do you think exist out there that might be worthwhile exploring?

Is it time for an MBA and moving into sales/marketing or banking instead?  
  
Thanks in advance for the advice!",2024-03-18 14:14:47
1bhimwj,Integration Specialist to Developer?,"Context

Degree: Information Systems 
Grad Date: December 2024

Took a position as an Integration Specialist for a medium size enterprise. My job primarily involves writing middleware for our various systems to communicate with each other. Job description includes:

-Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, or equivalent training and work experience

-Proficiency in scripting languages such as Python, PowerShell, or JavaScript for automation purposes.

-Hands-on experience with integration platforms and technologies such as RESTful APIs, webhooks, and middleware solutions.

-Knowledge of DevOps practices and tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)

-Experience with Google Cloud Platform services and APIs

I was promoted to this position from an intern after writing code and automation for the IT team I'm on.

It's not a dev position, but it seems ""Development Adjacent"", and it's my first job out of school.

I am seeking some advice. I'm beginning to feel that my new job might not be the right fit for me. It's been almost six months, and I'm struggling to clarify and define my role. The company has never had this position before, and I was brought in to essentially carve out my own path. However, I'm starting to doubt the necessity of this role. There's significant overlap with other teams, leading me to question the value I am adding. If my role were eliminated today, I don't think it would be noticeably missed. I've shared these concerns with my manager, who has been very supportive. He encourages me to be more vocal and make my presence known.

While I have been attempting to support other teams' projects, I often feel completely isolated. I dislike the idea of leaving a job after such a short period, as I've stayed in all my previous positions for at least three years. I believe part of my current discomfort stems from the startup culture, which is new to me, given my background in well-established companies.

I'm set to graduate in March, and recently, I had a job offer from a certain tech consulting company (below big 4) for a Business Analyst role after going through three interviews. But things took an unexpected turn during the offer meeting.  
They mentioned feeling I might be a better fit for an engineer position and asked me to consider it. Keen on knowing more, I requested details about the engineer role. The recruiter scheduled a video meeting, but surprise – it was another interview, this time with an engineer from their team.  
Then, just this Monday, they scheduled another meeting, this time only with my second interviewer. When I reiterated my preference for the business analyst position, I was hit with unexpected news. They mentioned a lack of headcount for the business analyst role and, unfortunately, rescinded the offer altogether.  
Here's the kicker – I turned down four other offers for this position, and now I'm left with no job offer just three months shy of graduation. I'm feeling devastated and disrespected by this turn of events.

The second interviewer told me he'd talk to the upper management for an extra position in the Business analyst team and he'd get back to me by the end of January and that I could take the offer then if it still stands, but I don't have much hope for it to be honest.

  
I'm at a loss for what to do. Should I reach out to them via email? I feel utterly lost and unsure of my next steps. This whole process cost me a month, and now I'm going into finals. Barely any positions recruiting at this time of the year and I doubt most available ones are hiring to work from April. This just might be the worst Christmas ever to be honest.

I graduated about a year ago, and I have been working for a bit less than a year right now in a remote job that pays around 100k total. I live with my girlfriend in the west coast (not somewhere expensive) for a bit over a year but recently got a job in New York for around 180k total.  
If I were to take the NY job, I would probably commute to work which takes 45 minutes one way (I'll be staying with my parents in outskirts of Queens), and I would have to stop living with my gf. Long distance is going to put a strain on our relationship, but the company in NY not only pays more, it's also in person and is more reputable.

189059u,Navigating Career Transition Challenges in Software Engineering,"
I found myself in a challenging position while navigating the transition from marketing to pursuing a career in computer science. I hold a bachelor's degree in marketing and later earned an AA degree in computer science, although without any internship experience.

Currently, I'm actively seeking software engineer opportunities, but I've encountered two main issues. For internships, companies often require candidates to be enrolled students, which doesn't align with my current status. On the other hand, entry-level SWE jobs demand internship or industry experience, which I currently lack. This leaves me uncertain about the ideal position to pursue given my circumstances.

Although I've gained knowledge in OOP languages (Python, C++, Java), data structures, Linux, and some web programming languages (HTML, Javascript, PHP), and self-learned algorithms, React, and coding skills through online materials and LeetCode practice, job listings often specify additional skills like Ruby on Rails, AWS, .NET, C#, Angular, TypeScript, among others. I wonder if it's necessary to master all these languages or if I can secure an entry-level SWE position and gradually acquire more skills on the job.

Feeling lost despite investing considerable time in self-study, I've heard stories of individuals completing bootcamps within a few months and successfully landing full-time jobs. I'm curious about the key to their success and whether there's a trick to streamline the process.

Currently, I allocate time to job searching, practicing LeetCode, and advancing my OOP languages through online courses. However, I'm contemplating whether to invest more time in building additional projects. Presently, I only have a few web programming projects creating simple websites, but my goal is a full-stack position. Should I focus on expanding my project portfolio, and if so, what types of projects and languages would be beneficial for securing a junior full-stack SWE job?

Balancing between LeetCode and project development also poses a dilemma. Your insights are invaluable as I grapple with confusion and diminishing confidence. Time constraints intensify the pressure to excel in every language, and I'm uncertain about the path forward. Your suggestions mean a lot.",2023-12-02 09:32:00

I am currently pursuing my masters in computer science. Alittle about my background. I have my bachelors in biological science. When I entered university to get my bachelors, the goal was always something in the medical field. However, things didn't really work out and I got a job as a quality control chemist after graduation. It was an okay job but I couldn't see myself doing this all my life. I tried to get into dental school but I wasn't accepted. So I had to reassess things. Now I decide to go into computer science and I have really always loved technology. I have always been the person to take things apart to see how they work. I really got into building computers during my sophomore year. My sister always told me to do computer science even while I was getting my bachelors because she knew I told technology. So that's what I decided. I enroll in a masters program for computer science and began April 2022. I currently have completed all the introductory/foundation courses which include, data structures and algorithms I and II, systems I and II, introduction to programming, and discrete mathematics. I have also just completed a object-oriented software development course which is the only non introductory/foundation course I have take so far. Now I really would like to get an internship position and I know that is MUCH easier said then done. It really early days regarding the number of applications but I have applied to roughly 50 or a little more and have heard nothing. I know I need to apply a lot more especially in my case. I really just cant seem to get my foot in the door for the computer science field. I'm looking for anything, even unpaid internships I would take, just something in the computer science field to gain experience. I have experience in program in java, python, C, and very little in C++. I have contacted my schools career help for students, and they recommend to contact alumni on LinkedIn and ask them for any tips on how they went about getting into the computer science field. This hasn't produced any results. What do you guys recommend? Should I look for an entry level IT or customer service jobs in order to buff up my resume. Should I do bootcamps online? Should I just continue to apply for internships? Should I work on my own projects to improve my GitHub? I'm just in need of some help, what do you guys recommend I do?

10qdskr,"I have a BA in History and don't know if I should pursue a second Bacc in CS, an MS in CS, or attempt self teaching","**Background:**

I have a BA in history with a heavy amount of premedical coursework, that includes calculus, a year or 2 of physics, and statistics. Realized I didn’t wanna be in medicine a bit too late so here I am. I've studied CS at a CC for about a year now and have really enjoyed and found it kind of easy for myself, though perhaps that's premature of me to say, still, I know I enjoy it.

**The Quandary, as it were**

I would like to work in software development but I'm not sure what path I should be taking. Presently I see 3ish. I'm in the process of also discussing all this with career and academic advisors at a couple universities as well, but thought I ought to ask here.

1. Go back to alma mater, UCI for a second BS. I would not need to take GEs, all my CC classes would transfer over, (would probably take 2 years, would give me greater access to peers and mentors, internships, career advising, research opportunities, and so on).

2. Use extension classes as a sort of self guided post baccalaureate and then possibly pursue an MS (if I don't manage to land a job). This would be cheaper, and could be a bit faster. 

3. I attempt the self taught route knowing full well it will take the longest since I work best when I have an imposed deadline to hold myself accountable to (finals, project deadlines, etc) and peers who I can try to mentor / be mentored by. I hear people in the industry make it via this route all the time but also know, thinking reasonably, that I will progress more slowly than if I am in some program.

It seems clear to me that the networking opportunities that going back to college would give me decent ROI, but then I hear all the time ""Oh you don't need a CS degree to transition into the tech industry."" Overall extension courses will take less time and likely be cheaper than the second BS but I suspect I will have no guarantee of getting placement into the classes I want and less access to career center services and internships, and may have a harder time getting accepted into an MS or PhD program. Additionally I am unsure if having no BS could hurt my chances when looking for jobs in the future. The fact is, I can either spend 1-1.5 years and get no degree or spend 2-2.5 years and get one. In the long run, the second BS only costs maybe one extra year, so yeah. What do you redditors think?",2023-01-31 23:19:49

yqxpep,Tech Lead vs. Start-up,"Hello all,

I am an engineer in my late 20s. I am currently debating between becoming tech lead at my current company or joining as one of the founding engineer of a friends startup. A lot of folks here have experience at startups and such, so I'm eager to get peoples' opinions.

I also want to say that I am very grateful to have these options.

Some things that may separate me from others:

* I value WLB above all else. That doesn't mean working 40 hours a week, but rather having the time to spend with my family, friends, and significant other, as well as dedicate time to things like travel, fitness, etc. I can pull crazy hours as long as I can budget in time for other things in my life.
* I am optimizing for learning as much as possible at this stage in my career. Money is nice, but I don't have expensive tastes.
* My goal in 5-10 years is to be an Engineering Director at some point later in my career working on technically-interesting, impactful, mission-driven problems.

**Tech Lead Gig**

So I have been at my company, which is a relatively-unknown but successful small business, for around 2 years now. A co-worked and I invented a new system that is of interest to some customers. The tech is really interesting, though I will keep it vague for NDA reasons. It involves sensors, which happens to be my background. We've gotten it from 0 to 1, so the next phase will be a customer buying around \~20 units for a \~$6M contract. I will lead a team of 4-6.

I am currently the only person left at the company who understands how the system works, and I sort of want to get it over the finish line. I think this project is more technically interesting than the startup, but I anticipate around 3 months of hell when this first starts up, as we cut some corners to get the system out the door. Frankly, it was already somewhat hellish (pretty insane hours) to get it to this point in the first place. The first bit will basically be adding a bunch of unit and functional tests as well as integrating with Docker and what not. Then, it will be all about ensuring overall functionality in its use case environment.

A little about the company as a whole:

* It's around \~500 people
* The people here are really smart, but skew older. I'd be able to learn a lot from them
* Pretty decent WLB, which I value more than pay. Plus \~4.5 weeks of PTO.
* \~$135k salary, which is decent for where I live. This would likely rise since I would likely get promoted when I start leading the team to Senior Engineer.
* I have also been invited to join the equity pool in the company, with a vesting period of 5 years, with a 1 year interval of shares. Shares have historically grown by 15-25%, and is in environmental monitoring (won't go into more detail), so it is uncorrelated with the market. Share amounts TBD.

What I think the pros are vs. the other position:

* I would gain experience in leading a small team.
* More experienced co-workers, so I'd have some mentorship on how to lead a team.
* The tech is way cooler
* I have a ""fall-back"" if I need help, since there are other leaders I could learn from
* Probably better WLB. I honestly value time with friends, my significant other, my hobbies, and travel more than $$$. As long as I have enough to meet my basic needs and save some for a nest egg and a house, I'm pretty happy.
* Perks such as health insurance, free snacks, transportation stipend, etc.

The cons:

* In-person work. It would be cool to be fully remote so I can travel.
* Lower $$$
* The IT infrastructure at this company makes me want to use a power drill on my head sometimes.
* This company is *terrible* at recruiting. I don't know who would be placed on my team, and I don't know if I'd be doing most of the work. I have done most of the work thus far, though the other guy who has since left was talented as well.

**Start-up**

The start-up is through an old co-worker I respect a lot. I won't go into detail, but it is in the government space. As part of the start-up, I would be the founding engineer. I'd be hauling ass to build product, which is a full-stack app. It's honestly a more interesting mission than the other company.

About the company:

* \~$5M in seed funding
* Growing at an astronomical pace. They already have 7 large customers and there is no correlation with the general markets in the space they are in.
* Currently aiming for a horizontal monopoly in the space they are in
* Their competitors are terrible, so their customers are eager to get on contract
* \~$145k base salary, with 2% equity stake
* CEO is a former co-worker. He has outlined a scenario in which there are tens of millions in ARR. I'm generally skeptical, but honestly I see his projections as possible.

The pros:

* Really cool mission (won't dive too into it)
* More $$$, both in terms of current salary and growth of equity
* The opportunity to build both a team and the tech from the ground up, which would be cool.
* More autonomy to build product
* More influence on direction of the company.
* The scaling challenges are far more interesting at this start-up, so I think there would be a lot of cool things to learn on the software architecture front compared to the other company.

The cons:

* Likely not much WLB in the beginning, which is something I value more than $$$ to some extent. I'm willing to haul ass, but I am afraid I won't have time for other parts of my life.
* We're going into a recession. The CEO has budgeted things in such a way that we have around 2 years to weather the recession, but it's still something to consider.
* Awesome but younger team.
* Full-stack development is rewarding but sort of boring to me.

**Decision Timeline**

I am currently waiting for \~3-6 months for the contract at my company to clear before becoming tech lead. My old co-worker stated that he would ideally want me to start within 6 months, but will always try to have a spot open for me.",2022-11-09 22:32:55

xjm914,I am a 22-year-old PM/CTO/GM/Everything else and need some recs,"To give the title a bit more context. I got hired on as a developer for a small company back last March.  We then realized after hiring me the software needed a complete overhaul as it was terribly built. 

They hired me a contracting team who works very well and we are well underway developing this new application. In order to maintain and continue to develop long term, we need to now hire a full team of developers, to get away from contracting.

The team and structure are as follows:

* Manager / Head Engineer
   * Deals with the politics, project design, and organization, and facilitates projects amongst NLA and 365 (me)
* One Lead Engineer:
   * Take project design, and delegate out to Lower level developers based on the focus of the developer
* 5 Software Engineers:
   * 1 Front end (Design) :
      * Design and User interface implementation
   * 2 backend :
      * Backend communication
   * 1 DB Specialist: 
      * Design, install, maintain, and repair databases

w87lgp,Computer Science Vs Computer Engineering Degree for Undergrad,"Hello. I would like to get another perspective on this:   
I am a university student who is debating between a computer science and a computer engineering degree. I currently am a computer science student, but after this semester I will have to choose which degree I want to get in order to graduate on time. 

I haven't really taken any true computer engineering courses to see if I like them however, I have taken 3 CS classes and liked them all. However, I am thinking of computer engineering due to the fact that I think the job prospects are more in line to what job I want to do. 

My father is in IT (typical IT architecture job) and I've seen how his job is, and I want nothing to do with it. While I like writing code, I can't see myself sitting in front of a screen the whole day and having virtual meetings. I want to do something more than that...I've considered Data Science as a field, due to the fact that it seems to be less of a desk job (writing reports, making presentations, relating my work to the real world etc). I would like to have a job that works a bit hardware side, but I'm not sure if I want to make the commitment to CE. Again, I love programming but it's not all that I want to do. I want to relate it to projects in the real world.

Another option I have is to minor in physics, or take a large amount of my elective classes in CE (they don't let you minor in engineering), and graduate with a CS degree and some hardware background and try for jobs that are less programming intensive.

Does anyone have any suggestions, both in which degree would be better as well as subfields that would be good for me while searching for internships. I have no interest working for a FAANG company (too stressful, bad work life balance) and am looking for aerospace related jobs.

w22ef3,Experience transfer - Wordpress full stack (Js/Html/Css/PHP) --> JS full stack (React/Node),"Hi all,  


I'm a jack of all trades (marketing / sales / dev / product and people management) and self employed at the moment - but looking to transition into a career in programming as I fell in love with it. I'd like to begin focusing on mastery of one area, and move away from being average at a lot of things, and get great at programming.

I've been learning React/Node and love the backend. I chose this stack because I wanted the backend exposure, and it also has a utility for our current ""low code"" software - although we're yet to implement anything. 

My ultimate goal would be to work as a SWE in a fast paced startup setting - although I'd also be happy working in a corporate setting.

I have a big network of marketing agency owners due to my current company, and one of them offered a job in the space as a full stack Wordpress dev. I'm familiar with the front end of WP as well as the file structure (and html/js/css) - but haven't touched PHP as of yet which is what the backend runs on. 

They're aware of this and are OK with it given my track record of learning quick.

This job would be pumping out simple brochure style websites for small businesses mostly - dentists, roofers, etc.

My question:

I'd love the experience of working with a team - as well as a chance to work in a non entrepreneurial setting. I'd also love the opportunity to tackle a new language (PHP) and become competent with it.

However, if I know my eventual goal is to work on actual apps (as opposed to basic websites) in a non-agency setting would this experience make me look unqualified or not a good fit?

I'm simply looking to get my foot in the door in the industry and am feeling self conscious of my self employed background. My thought is this could be a ""bridge"" into an employment setting.",2022-07-18 15:38:23

v8m7fa,Complete beginner: Just curious about what's out there for my interests.,"So, I have no interest at all in web development. It's really something that I don't want to do. 

I feel like most of my interests are lower level things with lower level languages. I like the idea of working on things like Linux, compilers, cli/tui applications, game development (to an extent, and I can explain why I'm not the biggest fan of it), and so on. I'm sure there would be far more, but the gist is that while I'm very new to programming and bad at it, the thing that gets me excited about coding is the actual coding part. 

I've seen videos of people effectively just slapping 20 blocks of pre-written code and making something cool out of it, but that isn't what I want to do. I want to hard code something and create stuff, even if that stuff isn't revolutionary. I don't know if what I'm saying is coherent, but I want to write code, that's it.

The language that I'm by far the most interested in (and the one I started with), is Rust. I understand the basic syntax of C because of CS50, but I wouldn't say I know it. But if I couldn't do anything with Rust, C would definitely be my next choice.

I'm terrible at math (literally at like, Algebra 1 skills right now because I didn't do math for a decade). So, it's going to take at least a year or two to study through Discrete, Linear Algebra, Calc, etc. 

So, are there any areas that fit my interests while not requiring particularly difficult math? I know things like compilers are completely out of the question. I plan on learning all the math needed, but I can't rush it.

17s3eeh,How do I get my foot in the door in Software/Machine Learning Engineering?,"I worked for a Fortune 200 company for about a year as a Firmware QA Engineer and took two years off to get my master's degree in CS (graduated May 2023; focused primarily on path planning/AI). I now live in Asia and I'm moving back to the US, but l I'm discouraged by the job hunting process and countless Entry-Level positions requiring years of experience. I was earning close to 6 figures almost 4 years ago and now I find myself not qualified on paper for many positions that pay the same, regardless of inflation. I can't seem to find a single job posting that fits my skills, yet feel I'm intelligent and can learn anything if I'm given a chance. I've thought about doing a project or something that incorporates all of these tools, but it will take me a while to learn everything and incorporate them all to impress a recruiter.. and I can't seem to think of any good project ideas to begin with.

I'm currently torn between spending my time searching for jobs and learning new skills to get a job I'd enjoy, however learning said skills may require more time than I'm happy about. Specifically, every job I'm interested in requires experience with NLP - LLMs/Gen AI, Computer Vision - PyTorch/TensorFlow, AWS, MLOps - Vertex AI/AWS Sagemaker, or NoSQL databases - MongoDB/DynamoDB. I have some experience with all the basic supervised learning, I created a CNN using TensorFlow that achieved somewhat decent results, etc. but I don't know how to frame this to recruiters.

Firstly, having these skills ARE DEFINITELY NOT entry-level, so I have no clue why recruiters are requesting those skills for entry-level jobs, but I have a few questions:

1. How do I know which jobs I should apply for and which ones I should pass up? (I'm hoping to have a job by February 1st, 2024 which is around when I'll be moving back, but I know the hiring season is in a lull during November - January usually)
2. Is there usually a time frame from which the job was posted where I shouldn't bother applying anymore? (like 2 weeks, or after 50 applicants or something)
3. Any industries I should check out?
4. Any specific companies that are desperate and pay well? (I need to support my immigrant spouse as well)
5. Any tips on where to look for more realistic expectations for entry-level jobs? (LinkedIn seems to primarily have mid-senior level positions and I've noticed most companies that mark their job postings as entry-level on there are typically mid-senior and marked improperly; Indeed seems kinda trash; Ai-jobs.com is pretty much empty)
6. Any other constructive and realistic advice?
7. My thoughts were always that I should apply to FAANG or FAAMG companies because I've had an easier time getting rejections, assessment requests, etc. from them. Does anyone know a way I can just get into one of those companies on the ground floor and work my way up since I seem to be underqualified for the ML/AI jobs I'm interested in?
8. Is it worth hiring someone to find a job for me?

Thanks in advance for any advice you can give!",2023-11-10 12:54:21

17luqji,How to stay updated in tech?,"Hi everyone,  
Hope this post finds you well! I am a budding software engineer and right now I see a lot of new technical skills coming up. I am very interested in learning them. For example, I have basic understanding of how full stack development works. But, I want to learn Node JS, Django and stuff like that. I want to explore what Hadoop or Spark is, and want to learn where and why I should Redis over any other DB. I want to keep myself updated and I am genuinely curious of how software engineering is evolving.  
How do I go about this? Should I like work on side projects (on my own) and try to implement the basics of the technologies and build an end-to-end system? or should I take a course to understand them? Can anyone give me advice on how to go about this?  
Also just curious, Is anyone developing their skills over the weekends? I would love to connect with you and talk more about the process.  
I appreciate your time!",2023-11-02 03:39:31

172a990,"What kind of job is ""easy"" in coding so that I can build an acting career on the side?","Dear redditors of CSCAREERS,

my background is as follows:  


* I have a university degree in computer science with 3 years of paid experience in java programming (spring boot with a bit of front end)
* And a university degree in acting  

My goal is to build  tech career as my main source of income and work on the tech job for 4 days a week.  
With the remaining time I'd like to build an acing career.  
Because I'm pursuing two careers I'm wondering if I can build a tech career that is really ""easy"" so that by the end of the day I have brain capacity left to think about acting.
 
What criteria for the tech job should I look out for?  

My guesses are:  
* fully remote  
* flexible working hours  
* working on a single project without jumping between 3 different projects  
* working for a company that offers one software solution. Not a company that offers different solutions to different customers  
* becoming really really good at coding and becoming indispensable for the company

I'd be curious about what you think! Looking forward to your replies!",2023-10-07 16:22:46
167jate,Full time work before graduating with a BS in CS?,"  
I understand that this question might be a bit challenging given the numerous posts about unemployment hardships here, but I believe it's worth exploring.  
  
I currently reside in the southern United States, and after years of pursuing my undergraduate degree (I had to take a hiatus due to health issues), I find myself with only 9 courses left to complete. Unfortunately, my current university's schedule is rather unconventional, leading me to take 4 courses this semester, another 4 in the upcoming spring, and just a single course next fall, with my graduation date set for December 2024. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, my current job and living situation are now in jeopardy, possibly requiring me to relocate.  
  
Assuming I can utilize my savings and resources to continue as a full-time student next semester, I'm curious if anyone knows of companies, firms, or businesses in the continental United States that are open to hiring individuals before they graduate. Currently, I am engaged in an unpaid remote internship to gain experience, and I've arranged to take my last course remotely next fall. However, given the possibility of having to move, I would prefer to relocate to a place where I can apply my skills and degree, rather than settling for another dead-end job until graduation.  
  
Have any of you encountered someone in a similar situation or have any advice to offer? I'm not aiming for a position at a prestigious tech giant like Tesla or a FAANG company. Instead, I simply want to avoid wasting more time in a dead-end job and would be willing to move across the country for the right opportunity.",2023-09-01 21:13:59

14dzmcm,Bad interview questions for a C programming position in network domain.,"

I recently had a few interviews for senior C software programming positions for companies whose products are mostly in Network field in Vietnam. The questions are so bad, in my opinion. And I would like to share them here, to see who would agree with me.  
  
They asked about networking experience. In particular they asked me about the job I did 6 years ago as a telecom technician. It is fine for a bit, but then it took half an hour to ask about BTS (4G station), 4G layer 3 messages.  
  
Then they asked about STP (spanning tree protocols for L2 in a switch. Hell! the protocols in telecom networks are different from those in computer network, and do they really expect a telecom engineer would really explain bits in that protocol?  
  
This At least they asked some questions about OOP, and I called it a day.  
  
Hell, they didn't even ask about Kernel, what system call would be used to say, read input, or how to check Kernel log.  
  
Seriously, I tried to review a bit about network programming such as the system call to set up TCP/IP socket, and tried to scram a Udemy course that teaches to build a protocol from scratch.  
  
I kind of find a common feedback from those people: you have some experience of programming but lack of knowledge in product, domain, etc. In our team your level would be fresher, or junior. Here is the pay, 25 mil vnd or a little bit more than 1 grand USD per month.  
  
By they way, they are western , USA based companies, that has R&D centers around the world, India, Korea, etc.  
  
Is it exploitation, or lack of knowledge or just simply bad interviewing? What is your opinion?",2023-06-20 03:26:24

Essentially a PLC programming/design role in which I would occasionally travel for commissioning. Would this be beneficial for pursuing careers in CS?  I think they mostly use ladder logic but they mentioned they would appreciate the skills I could bring to the team as a CS student.

I work full-time so I’m a part time student. I have a background of 8 years In distribution including leadership/supervisor roles for 6 years. I’m currently in a specialist/analyst role managing inventory replenishments. Being a part time student I still have ~3.5 years of schooling left. However I’ve been trying to find opportunities to better align my experience while I’m still in school.

I’m on the fence so what do you think? My pros/cons are pretty much just cons but if it helps my career in the long term that’s a big pro.

The job offer is about 10% less base pay than what I currently make and would be hourly opposed to my current role which is salary. They have quarterly bonuses (undisclosed amounts I imagine they’re pretty small). The working hours would be more & the commute is double my current commute. They said travel is 10%-30% and is all paid for by the company of course.

I work remote and he has a job as a full-stack software engineer making 100k. Now that we're getting closer to our 30s I want to move back to Seattle to be closer to family, buy a house, have kids, etc. but the SAD thing is still an issue so I would ideally like to fuck off to Hawaii or South America or something from like January-February at least. Basically, I'm wondering if this dream scenario could work:

* Hubby doesn't really want to work remote full time, so this would be a full-stack engineering job that would be groovy with him working remotely for two months out of the year so he can go to a sunny place with me. 
* It would be cool if he could make somewhere in the 130k + range because we want to save to buy a house in Seattle. He has 5 yrs experience and is in a leadership role currently (pardon my ignorance, but he, um, checks everyone's code before it is pushed? He also designs/architects projects from the ground up.) He's underpaid for what he does because we don't live in a tech area currently. IMO, he's a crazy hot commodity.

uojrbs,Are backend developer jobs fading,"I have no background in tech, and my degree is in journalism. I currently do tech support for an SAAS company, which mostly involves telling people how to reset their passwords.

I want to switch careers, so I've been learning some python. After I have a grasp of the language, I'll probably pick up frameworks like Django and Flask.

Now the thing is I am totally blind / visually impaired. This means while I have no problem coding in the backend, which mostly involves logic, frontend development where I need to see the effects of what I am doing is a different beast altogether.

Part of my learning process includes looking at job ads, and focusing on the skills they ask for. From what I see, 99% of job posts are looking for fullstack developers. The few that are advertised as backend still require knowledge of frontend technologies like CSS, Vue, etc.

The only companies I see with backend roles are big organisations like Google, Amazon, Automattic, etc. But as someone without a degree or experience, hoping to lend a job with one of these would be optimistic to the point of being naive.

Other paths I've looked at are dba, data engineering, and devops / cloud. Data careers usually require experience, and I think you would also have to deal with visualisation, which I can't do. While I can do some things in cloud, screenreading technologies don't work with virtual machines, which is a big thing in cloud computing.

ehgztz,"Just graduated with a Master's, not sure what to do","Hi,

I just graduated this year with a Master's in CS. My undergrad wasn't in CS and I wanted to switch to CS very close to the end of my degree. However, instead of doing a second major in CS I did a 1 year Master's program at my school, which allowed me to finish quicker as well as get a scholarship for it. I went to a good private school in the Midwest. I'm also an International student.

However I still don't really feel confident with my coding skills, even if I've taken a bunch of advanced classes. I was really struggling with them for most of the time so I'm really just beginning to do Leetcode now. I'm also not sure what sorts of jobs or salary I should be aiming for because I've really only spent about 1.5 years coding. I've just been applying to lots of jobs through Glassdoor and Angellist and sometimes reaching out to the corresponding technical recruiters on LinkedIn as well. I'm trying to focus a little more on getting a front-end role because I feel like that's what I'm more interested/comfortable with, even if I haven't done work with frontend stuff like Javascript since last May. I'm not sure if I'm up to par to be able to apply to like Google or Amazon or those companies. I thought that I would spend 1-2 years in a smaller company and then try to push for position in the bigger ones then. 

Based on my work visa situation I have until the end of April to get an offer in the US to stay here and I'm wondering what are the best things for me to be doing right now? I'm kind of lost and feel scared about being able to find work during that time limit, so I'm making this post for any input from the users here.

 One thing I had in mind was to do more React projects to get my skills back up to speed, as well as doing a small project with Angular, Django, Ruby on Rails etc as well just to get them on my resume?

The pay, terms, and the job description (B is much more ml research focused, while A needs a software engineer with ml background) are better at B. I really liked the office and people seemed great. Interviews also seemed tougher in B, so I was more excited about a positive answer.

* growth and promotion opportunities when being in a branch office
* the impact being in a branch office could have when applying to other companies in the future

# How good are my chances in the US job market right know?

Hello, this year I had to flee my country due to political persecution. I'm in the process of seeking political asylum in the US, and if everything goes well I should have a work permit in about 6 months from now. **Knock on Wood!**

Now, I graduated December last year in Industrial Engineering from Venezuela but found my passion in Android Developer and have been working 2 years full time in the field, 1 year for a Venezuelan company and another year for a Spanish company. Before these 2 years of Android Development I worked 1.5 years for a marketing agency in Miami doing Facebook/Google Ads.

So was wondering if I really had a chance of getting an Android Dev position here in the US after getting my work permit, this oncoming months will be really hard and full of tuff decisions, so I want to know if my goals are even realistic.

Thank you all in advance, I dont mind brutal honesty!",2021-07-07 00:30:26

cwu1lh,Feelings of impostor syndrome,"I am a software engineer working in the Maine area. Long story short in a very short amount of time I have been able to job hop/negotiate my way from my initial position as a junior dev ($60,000) to a senior developer position ($100,000). I graduated last Spring and I sort of feel like most of my success has been more related to my soft skills than my actual development skills.

I have been told in the past that I exhibit strong development skills but in my head I always feel like I am very lacking in specific areas. For instance I know that I am significantly weaker on the back end than the front end. I can build out an API if I am asked to but I usually struggle and the tasks always seem to take significant amounts of time.

On several occasions I have seen other junior developers decimate tasks that I can recall having struggled deeply with and it makes me wonder why I am given the praise I am given and why I have been given the opportunities I have been given.

I come home each night and read through a weekly queue of articles and documents related to my tech stack in order to stay up to date but I still feel like I don’t have a firm grasp on what I need to know. I don’t really know how I was given a senior development position and I don’t really feel like I deserve it. There are others on my team who are just not in a good position to negotiate. I work with several very talented foreigners who simply cannot use the tactics I use to negotiate because they require sponsorship to stay in the US and therefore cannot very easily find other companies from which to leverage salary increases. One person in particular I feel is stronger than me, yet she shared her salary with me and she is only making $70,000.

I don’t really know if I am looking for advice or if I am looking for anyone else out there that is in my position. I am fully aware of impostor syndrome but I still feel like I am heading towards some sort of inevitability if I continue to rise while feeling as though my skills are stagnating.",2019-08-29 01:25:01

aiuvx0,USA or Europe ?,"I am recent graduate with a MS in CS from a Unversity in the Midwest. I did my Barchelors in the UK. I got an offer for a Business Analyst position in Orange County , CA for 50k starting with first months rent payed. I will only be using Dell Boomi for integration. It is a field I do not want to get into because I do not want to follow that career path as there is no actually coding done and if I want to transition to programming later Ill have to start from 0. I can work for any employer in the US from 3.5 years. Later I will need to apply for H1b if I want to stay.

I have 0 technical experience but I do have 5 years of professional experience in other sectors. I am an EU citizen and I am thinking to move back to Europe instead and get a job there.

I know that in Europe I would only dream for a 50k starting salary but at the same time in Orange County I know I will save nothing due to high CoL. I do not have any offers in Europe currently.

I know life there in Europe is better, more relaxed, food is better, work life balance is better, more holidays, I will not have to drive which I dont like, women are more beautiful etc.

However the US is a much bigger market, with higher salaries,lower taxes and if I want to start my own business at some point I will have easier time due to less bureaucracy and higher chances of succedding due to openness to a 330 million market.

During the end of my 2nd year(basically 3rd), I was getting extremely bored that my productivity dropped dramatically so I asked for a transfer to a new location to see if it would spicy my interest, but it went to no avail. 

I don't feel like I learned much in these 4 years either nor do I want to even talk about the subject matter. I also feel my thinking process has slowed dramatically... perhaps due to depression due to this boredom.

In all honesty, I do not know why I decided to go into embedded software instead of general software (especially since embedded software jobs are being shipped more and more to oversees leaving defense as the more the primary employer) become a data scientist, or many of the other jobs that utilize other degrees. But I did actually choose to do a masters in EE simply because all of my family member who are guys are electrical engineers.

I feel like if I take the neuroscience one, I miss on building my understanding about programming language and how they work low level (which would directly help my CS career), while if I take the Compilers module i would miss out on understanding more about neuroscience, which might come useful later in my career as a researcher/further studying.

sixe0k,Wanted: Recommendations for solid mid-sized consultancies specializing in mobile app development,"**Caveat:** A solid tech consultancy that also does mobile work and has enough mobile work to keep a \[React Native\] developer busy is fine.

**Background**

I have worked for not so great consultancies before and I am currently in-house at a mid-sized services company that is creating a managed marketplace for their sector of the market.  The devs are better here but the team has been run like a free-form democracy for most of my time here. All new work had to be proposed, discussed and agreed on before proceeding.  The manager for some reason would not delegate authority to one of the senior guys for day to day technical decisions and team rules (e.g., code review req, code testing etc). Now there is an important new project, and two senior members have been delegated authority over I very small team.  Both situations have left me feeling completely suffocated. These are good guys, don't get me wrong, but the result of the former situation was confusion, duplicate work, occasional team paralysis, and an unhealthy interest in each others business.  In the latter situation, any sense of autonomy has been completely siphoned away.

When I was at my last consultancy, about 14 devs (split evenly between front and back) had a dev manager and an architect, the latter ran the Sprints.  They were fricking awesome.  The dev manager always kept us fed with a sprint-sized portion of work, and the architect kept us on our toes.  He had this amazing ability to size people's technical capability and delegate responsibility accordingly. If you weren't getting after what you were asked to do, standups could be a little embarrassing. Which was great in hindsight, because it kept us worried about our own business, not that of our peers.  He actively fostered a collegial spirit, so even though we pursued our tasks, we did not do so in a way that interfered with each other.  The project itself was a nightmare, but so well did this system work, we actually had three Happy Hour reunions after the project was over and most of us had left the company.

This \[latter\] story is meant to express that I strongly prefer an environment with clearly delegated authority, managed by people equipped to delegate appropriately.  Or alternatively, to be given autonomy over building a large chunk of a design.  The latter is a situation I have been lucky to have on two occasions now.  My code usually hits production without needing a lot of QA and is generally bug-free.

**Why the Question**

On one hand, my sense is I would have the same complaints about most ""in-house"" gigs.  I am just not built for that kind of environment.  On the other hand, consultancies can be ridiculous.  Shoddy work, fleecing clients, less talented developers (where I have worked anyways), automated HR policies that can burn you on the yearly in spite of great reviews.  I want to know if there are any mid-sized consultancies that really care about doing a good job, provide a paycheck that won't injure pride, and generally have good people.",2022-02-02 19:25:26

db5653,Best things to learn to get into an aerospace software career,"I am 1 year out of school and have been working 1 year in the field as a front-end web developer.

cjby72,Free to pick one of many jobs in the software industry - which one to go for though?,"
I'm not expecting anyone to give me a clear answer like ""the perfect job for me"". I would be incredibly grateful though if you could give me general advice.

I'll give you a short introduction to put you into the picture:

**Professional Background**

Officially I have 5 years experience in Software Development. All of it at the same big global company. 2 out of these years were spent on an apprenticeship (which in my country makes you a qualified professional). 3 years I've been working on SaaS platform. First year as Level 1 supporter and full stack developer. Second year as Level 2-3 support and full stack developer. Third year as application consultant (mostly working as an intermediate with global key-customers/account managers and our development team).

November last year I took up a new job in the same departement but in a [data mart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mart) team as a Test Engineer while starting my part-time studies in [Information Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_science) (*""Information science is a field primarily concerned with the analysis, collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval, movement, dissemination, and protection of information""*, not the same as Computer Science which focuses more on algorithms and data structures to put it bluntly).

The last 4 months I've finally got the chance to use my frontend skills with HTML/CSS and JS6 to create a web app to check our developer's code with the click of a button. (connected to API).

All the time I've been worknig in Agile teams which, I guess, is the new standard in the industry.

**Personal Background**

I've been trying to come up with a set of fitting descriptions of my personality. I've made a list of things I do without hesiation in me free time:

- improve myself
- learn about sci-tech
- think about problems
- connect with people (socializing; I've been told I'm a great listener/conversation partner)
- brainstorm
- consume sci-fi (especially cyberpunk related stuff)
- optimize repetitive tasks, create tools or frameworks
- think and read about reality, psychology and ethics
- learn about cyber security (DEF CON talks, books like ""The Art of Invisibility"" by Kevin Mitnick)

To give you some more input, these are the things I've come up with when brainstorming this topic:

* I really like to invent things. I often think about problems and how to solve them (and actually solve them)

* I'm really good with tweaking and optimizing my life. Over a course of 3 years I've gone from mad-workaholic to chill-productive-person by extracting my workload to trello with quarterly changes of workflows/frameworks

* I'm afraid that my ego is holding me back from unleashing my potential. I LOVE science fiction and I always wanted to be a hacker. Growing up I learned that that path isn't really legal and holds big bad consequences, so I basically dropped it

* I study information science and I'm really good with creating classifications and sorting files/data - you could call it a obsession of me

**My situation** is as follows:

- the JS-based web app I've been working on at my new job will be finished and deployed in the next PI (end of September). My boss/PO asked me what I wanted to do after that (implying I could choose from many possiblities)
- I get requests/invitations from recruiters every day due to my history with Java at my last job (even though I don't really like to program in Java)
- I've stopped coding at home as I need the time to balance the stress from work with working out, socializing and shutting my brain off by playing video games

I've had a hard time coming up with a plan for my future and I'm not even sure whether I want to stay a Software Developer. 

I work in central Europe and with my partner doing their PhD I have some prospect to be moving to another country within the EU, UK or North America. Thus, I want to make sure I pick up skills / credit that are highly-valuable on a global scale (on which [I found some data here](https://futureskills.pearson.com/)). 

I understand that most Software Development is outsourced these days (heck, ît's always a bit of a fight getting a programming project assigned to you at work instead of your outsourced colleagues). Thus, I'm partly open to look into more ""Western"" jobs.

I fairly good with learning languages so I thought about picking up Chinese while I'm still studying for the next 3 years. I need a good reason to, though (more than the usual ""it's the English of the future"" argument). Other than that I speak English, French and German.

I feel like I'm at this ""inbetween situation"" with low-payed outsourced colleagues picking up the work I could do and highly-educated (master or PhD level) colleagues getting the high-payed data-related jobs. I basicalyl want to find a nice niche where a normal guy with my background and with a big amount of discipline can fit in. I thought this ""Tester"" thing could be that but right now I feel like either it's not a job well enough defined to market *or* simply not as exciting as [James Bach makes it out to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILkT_HV9DVU).

In regards to my partner's high chances of changing countries in the near future I've been considering to either become independent or find a remote job in the mid-future. Positions that would prepare me for that would also make sense to pick up.

From my past jobs I have enjoyed the following activities:

- implementing frontend functionalities
- troubleshooting bugs all across the stack (from the GUI to APIs to server logs)
- consulting key customers (listening to their wishes and telling them what's possible to implement)
- traveling and attending workshops every once in a while

I have been thinking about getting myself certified as a Scrum Master as it kinda fits my personal interests. I'm not sure though whether that's a step up or a deadend.",2019-07-29 14:26:44

It's happened to me, also.

Do you guys feel that way, too?  It kind of makes me miss the old days when you just came to work and got your stuff done without any debates about how scrum meetings should be run, debates about whether or not (or how much) requirements documentation is needed, debates about whether we're using Lean or Agile or Scrum or Waterfall, whether we're doing it right or not, etc. etc.

The goal is to ultimately go into a machine learning research type position, which will most likely require a PhD which in turn requires a master's. 

I know that REUs look good for grad school applications, but turning down Amazon is a very difficult dilemma due to the prestige it brings to the table. This makes it difficult to decide if an internship at a great company is better or worse than an REU, in the context of getting into grad school.

I'm interested in applying to a more STEM related master's program after I graduate. I've currently been looking at a Masters in Computational Engineering and Science which seems rather interesting and right up my alley. 

I am a Computer Science minor and have taken up to 400 level CS courses (including data structures, algorithms and complexities, discrete math, machine learning).

I'll have taken courses like Linear Algebra, Bayesian Statistics, Prob Theory, Diff Equ by the time I graduate but I know that Real Analysis is the ultimate upper level course to have.

t4vu9i,Career change support/advice,"Hello,

I’ve been in sales for the last 6 years and it’s been a constant struggle of commission check to commission check. It’s put my family through so much stress and I’m sick of it and want a stable career.

My State, Utah, has been completely overtaken by the tech industry and anything tech/coding/cs seems to be where the kind of money and possibly working remote opportunities would be.

But idk where to start or what to do. I’ve been told to take a coding bootcamp type program and I could walk out making 75K a year. Which didn’t work out for me in the past. I took a coding bootcamp from a company called Thinkful in 2016. I was still extremely noobish and struggled to find a job. I went to a few interviews but didn’t get anywhere. I ultimately put it on hold so I could get a retail sales job to support my new baby and eventually transitioned into Real Estate sales thinking I’d do half as well as my friends who got into it were doing. Thinkful started offering the 6 months job guarantee thing like right after my class and it’s been so long it’s fuzzy, but I’m pretty sure I asked if they would honor that for me too… but they said no.

I will do anything it takes. Within 3-4 months I’d like to have any kind of CS job so I can start making money. Idc if it’s minimal. But I have to start somewhere.

What kind of code, or niche programming would you recommend somebody start that leads to a job path quickly? I heard some good things about SQL recently but tbh I don’t know anything about it.

If there’s anybody here that’s in Utah or works for a company that offers remote jobs that has advice on how I can work my way into the industry please let me know. Id even be open for a zoom call or something too.

Oh PS here’s my old GitHub: https://github.com/darkstar93

My code isn’t terrible, but it’s not great either. Obviously very beginner for the time, and it’s been years since I’ve touched it. I couldn’t get a job then, and I doubt I could get a job with these projects as a resume now… so I’d like to improve to become job ready.

Thank you!

TLDR; Wen’t to a bootcamp ton 2016 and couldn’t find a job. Got into sales out of desperation to pay bills. Want to get off commissions and find a stable coding/tech/cs job now. Looking for advice on how to be job ready ASAP to support family. I live in Utah.

rf0f4d,Preparing for Applying to New Job,"So the main question is: How should I prioritize my efforts to present myself best before applying to a new job?

**Background:** Mostly self taught with a few key classes both online and at a university. Was fortunate and landed my first job almost two years ago. The job uses a .Net stack (.Net, Angular, SSMS). The apps we build are mostly CRUD apps for administrative staff at a University. I've since relocated and the jobs in the area I'm in trend much more towards Java and React or Node and React/Vue. I feel the learning curve won't be too bad, but there will be one. 

Before I got my first job, I had written a few personal projects in Flask/Django with Vanilla JS. I knew the projects were bad back then, but now I'm embarrassed to look at them. I was able to buy a domain and I put the projects up online using AWS free services and hosted a ""portfolio site"". I think it was those projects and the deeper dive into hosting them that got me my first job. I also had a fairly consistent commit history in my personal Github account. But at this point, they just don't represent my technical abilities or thought process.

Since I started working in the field two years ago, I've essentially stopped contributing to any side projects. I'll sometimes work outside of hours to do some testing with new tools I've learned; and I'll do some reading/research on things to help me with work, but I don't have a single line of code to show for it. I ran out of unpaid AWS services with my projects so I took my site and everything down. My personal Github account hasn't seen a commit in over a year and a half. So while I've spent a lot of time developing, it's nothing I can present to a potential new employer in any way. 

So I've relocated, I'm looking to change things up, hopefully get a pay raise, and find a company with more room for career growth. I have some thoughts on actions I can take to boost my chances of getting the job, but I'm not sure what the highest priorities should be. 

1. Take some time to create personal projects in the stacks found more often in my new location to demonstrate I have experience within the frameworks. 
2. Clean up and improve my old projects and get them back online. This could take some serious work to clean them up to anything presentable.
3. Focus on interview prep and the often recommended ""Leetcode"". The tech interview at my first job wasn't that challenging but I'm concerned my algorithm skills aren't as good as they should be. 
4. Don't worry about the rest and just focus on putting together specifically tailored resumes and cover letters to as many positions as possible. 
5. Something else that I've missed.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",2021-12-12 22:48:01
qzreff,[Serious] Need Career Advise to switch from Networking to Development,"Hello guys,

This is my first post on reddit. So, please excuse me. I have completed my B Tech CSE in 2021 from a Tier-2 college ( stands at 90s in NIRF ranking ) and got placed in Network Engineer role in one of the FAANGs. Although I was interested in software/coding roles, I had accepted this since I thought pandemic would affect placements (we had placements in 2020) and because of the good CTC (15 lpa) but I'm regretting it now. The role doesn't involve a bit of coding and it's been 5 months now and I'm just working on operations and I'm not learning anything other than networking. I'm afraid that if I stay few more years in this role, I would not be able to switch to dev role at all. And I don't want a career in Networking.

Should I talk with my manager and inform him that I'm more interested in software/dev roles ?

At this point, I feel that I have the following options :

1. Try to switch to SDE role ASAP but it's insanely hard to get interviews since I have only 5 months of experience and that too is not in the relevant domain.
2. Go for MBA after a couple of years since I have a decent academics - 97% / 97.5% / 9 GPA. But, I'm not interested in Managerial roles and interested in technical role.
3. Go for M Tech by trying for GATE and get into a dev role since I already have good experience in giving interviews for product based companies.

I have undergrad/pre-phd education in statistics, math & prob. I also have a few finance credentials.

I'll be done my MS in about a year and I'm not sure what my options are going to look like, I could stay in my industry or start looking more broadly.

 I'm not sure if FANG companies would value my skillset? 

""Data science"" positions seem like they would result in a major paycut since it seems like if you have some stats background + programming experience then you qualify.

With people depending on me I can't take a major paycut, are there any organizations out there that are likely to value what I bring to the table ?",2019-09-25 14:06:47

b191w5,Feeling lost...,"Hi, first post here and I’m not exactly sure if this is the right place to post, but I could use some advice. 

So I’m currently in my last semester of undergrad. I’m finishing up my bachelors degree in Bioinformatics but I’m completely at a loss as to what to do with it. 

My program is structured in that I’m essentially a Biology major with a CS minor, but I realized it’s not very helpful. I originally chose this path because I was premed and I was fascinated with programming and what it could do.

However, over time I’ve become jaded, as I struggled with the weedout premed courses of my major (biochem, organic chem, physics) and became disillusioned with the general premed culture (the toxicity is huge, and I’m not a fan of cramming info only to regurgitate it for an exam and then forget about it all right after).

I was planning on switching halfway through junior year, but decided against it due to time and money constraints, as  at that point I’ve already finished practically 80% of the curriculum. 

I honestly wish I switched then and there, as my GPA isn’t so hot, its in the sub 3.0 range, about 0.1 points under, so I don’t think grad school is an option anymore. 

I have some knowledge of stats and programming, but its mostly linked towards data parsing and visualization, so I mainly work with Perl and Bash, SQL, and some R, but I still have much to learn compared to the average CS major.

I don’t have much research experience, the few that I do have were mostly wet lab benchwork, so no data analytics here. I don’t have any tech internships, with internships I do have being in the sociopolitical field.

How should I approach the job search? As this is the part I find most daunting. I like research but I can’t see myself doing that as a career, as I’m kind of sick of academia, especially anything biochem related and I feel that everything is going to become automated soon. I also want to transition into tech. I like the concept of creating things and challenges don’t scare me.

Sorry for the long post but I’m just feeling really lost and anxious as graduations right around the corner and I’m trying to find a job, but I feel so under-qualified  for any position I come across. I’d really just like some advice on how to best approach my situation.

an95nw,"In my position, is it worth taking graduate classes (or a certificate program)?","I’m a recent PhD graduate in electrical engineering (more on the physics and laboratory experiment side of things). I’ve been working at my current niche job for a little over a year and I’m unhappy (both due to the job and the place I relocated too). I’m also finding myself less- and less-passionate about my field and just burned out in general. I’ve been looking at potential “data science” jobs and they seem appealing: In my current role I often feel like expensive human glue and I’d rather be focused on projects. There are many interesting-sounding data science jobs in places I’d actually like to live.

It seems, however, that many of the more interesting listings revolve around R and Machine Learning, which I have no experience with. I have some programming experience with Matlab (which I taught twice) and Python. At my current job, I do a lot of data analysis and have learned how to effectively present complex data using packaged software (JMP) and internal homemade tools, however my lack of focused programming training feels lacking.

My current company will reimburse for online courses or straight-up pay for a Masters (but that would be a hard sell to my boss who would have to approve). The course I was looking at is Machine Learning at Stanford, but other recommendations are appreciated.",2019-02-05 01:54:11
a034n2,Degree in CSE or CS,"Hello everyone, 


I will be taking my first semester as part of the computer Science engineering program at my school, under the focus of Computer Science (UT Arlington). 

However, I never had the intention of wanting to go into engineering (I didnt really realize this until I got in). 

My friend mentioned though that with a CSE degree, your range broadens of opportunities, even if you apply for normal CS jobs. 

I have yet to take any of the coursework, but was wondering if getting a degree in CSE makes a big difference in the CS Job market (not Engineering job market), compared to someone with a regular CS degree?

P.S end goal is to do Industry work in some aspect of AI 

Any feedback is appreciated ",2018-11-24 22:52:41

8bp80n,Teaching abroad for a few years now.,"Hey.  I'm a self-taught programmer.  I'm solid in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React and NodeJS, I've used Firebase, MongoDB and SQL a bit, as well as PHP.  I'm less familiar with python.  My main area of interest is React-Native, and I've pushed a few apps to production now.  Done a little bit of UI and Graphic design, basically been taking projects and building up a little portfolio.

I've been teaching abroad for a few years, and I should be returning to the USA around the age of 31.  My goal has always been to build up a portfolio and score a job.  

I'm wondering what my best steps would be to get a job as quick as possible once I'm back - where the best regions to go would be, and if it even IS POSSIBLE after having been out of the 'real career' for so long.  Am I ... -sigh- too old?  

To be clear, I've never had a professional developer job, but I've been self-teaching for around 5 years with the goal of doing dev long term.  I feel totally ready, but I'm sure there are holes.  I'm ready to fill them, whatever it takes.  I love building stuff, plain and simple.  But the fact of the matter is, I suck at the job getting process. So yeah.

88fhai,Need advice. Too late to get an internship for summer? Options?,"I really need to be able to get an internship for the summer so I can pay for school, I was planning to do a semester of summer school but life happened and I'm in need of more finances, so I ended up applying late.

I went to a local job fair recently and most companies have told me that they're filled for the summer. I have a decent amount of experience and a lot of the recruiters were pretty impressed with my resume, it just seems I was late on the application. What else can I do to either get an internship for the summer or use my skillset to gain some income so I can pay for school? 


Any advice would be welcome! All else fails I plan to do summer school and a part-time job at min wage and try again for the fall semester but that would be less than optimal since it will be my last year and I have to do my honours project over two semesters (fall and winter).

81ari1,Columbia MS CS,"Hi All! Need some opinions on the Columbia MS CS - I keep hearing around that it's a ""cash cow"" program. However, is this necessarily a knock against it? My friend (international student) was accepted but went to a community college-type undergraduate program (though a CS major). She wants to leverage the brand name to parlay into a PhD. If she takes the thesis track and tries to pair up with a professor for research, is this feasible? I really don't have familiarity with formalized CS degrees, so can't give her any advice.

If a PhD isn't feasible, how well does the MS CS do in job placements with no prior work experience? Sponsorship would also be needed...

Any guidance would be much appreciated! Thank you!",2018-03-02 01:47:14
7zu1pg,Underperforming teammate is making my life a hell,"TLDR; Needy coworker is a pain to work with. Makes me want to quit.

I have been struggling with one of my teammates and I could use your advice. I joined as a junior not so long ago and have been progressing quickly. My tech lead, let's call him Dan, is a great engineer and amazing to work with. I feel really lucky to be able to work with him and learn from him. Unfortunately, both of us find it pretty hard to work with the other engineer, let's call him Tom. Tom is a pretty slow engineer, even though he's been working at our company the longest and he should know the product inside out. But that's not the main problem. The main issue is his attitude. He asks a lot of stupid questions before doing his own research. Now, before you judge me and tell me that we all once asked stupid questions, YES, I know, trust me, I know, I asked many stupid questions but not without doing my own research first. Real life example: code reviews. With Dan, they're a breeze. He points out the important bits that are missing and offers useful advice, in a friendly manner. With Tom, code reviews are a nightmare. He does not take the time to read through the changes and try to understand them. Instead, he expects you to explain everything. He will ask questions about basic logic or worse, state that something is wrong or useless in a passive aggressive way when he's clearly in the wrong. It's a lot of back and forth about stupid things that are right there in the code. Dan has been complaining about Tom to his manager for some time. Everybody who works/worked with Tom more closely knows how difficult it is to deal with him. I tried to be understanding but I don't like the fact that he's being held to such a low standard. Everybody's trying to manage around him. Dan just started ignoring his code review comments and told me to do the same. The worst part: Dan is leaving. So I'll be left with Tom. He's proven many times that his judgement is poor and I'm not comfortable with him having the ""final"" word because he's been here longer. I like my job and the rest of my team, but thinking about how my day-to-day will be now filled with interactions with Tom makes me want to leave. Dan told me to just tell our manager that Tom is crossing the line (=fire him). Have you ever been in a similar situation? How do you deal with a teammate like that? I know that no team is perfect, but every single person who worked with Tom complained about his attitude (PM complained about his performance but that's another story) so it's not like I'm being this lone asshole whose life mission is to get him fired. I just can't stand working with him.

1108zxj,"I accidentally came across my senior engineer on an online video game, now he’s being distant at work.","I know this is a crazy situation, I still can’t believe it but it happened. Honestly, if I wasn’t terrified of getting fired during this market, I’d would find this situation funny hilarious.

During stand ups, My senior engineer has a *very* distinct sound in his background. It’s  like a vacuum, but the pitch of the sound gets really low, then quickly becomes high-pitch. He was always a quiet, but very cheerful person with a thick Spanish accent. He also lives with his brother, who calls him by his nickname.

Last Monday, I played COD late at night, and almost immediately, I heard somebody from the other team with that same vacuum pitch. They were winning and we started arguing, and that’s when he finally started talking. It was exact same accent, and at that point, I was willing to put money that it was my senior.

Near the end of the game, both of us were completely trash talking each other (nothing hateful, just small banter, apparently he’s very competitive). It felt so out of character for him, he was laughing a lot; it was entertaining. As a joke, I called him out by his nickname, and he immediately goes quiet. I reached out to him after the game saying that it’s me, and he doesn’t respond at all. 

The next day, his attitude is now cold. He’s very silent during our calls, and isn’t explaining things the way he used to in the past. I sent him a message during closing saying that I hoped I didn’t offend him during the game, and I actually really respect them. He claims he has no idea what I’m talking about, and just brushed me off. He remained dismissive the remainder of the week

Now it’s the weekend and Im trying to catch up on work, but Im lost on how to proceed with him. I feel like he’s practically cutting me off. Im not sure what to do at this point. I even recorded the footage from the game, I heard it over again, and there was nothing offensive. He even started the trash talking. This feels so unreal, and I never thought something like this could happen.

Edit: For reference, I have 4.5 years of experience. I carry my weight really well in the team and serve as a mentor for junior developers. I’d  find it hilarious if one of the juniors came up to me and mentioned we met online

Edit: I’m going to clarify a couple of things, since there are a couple of misconceptions that are spreading

1) My senior and I have been the only devs for nearly 2 years until 2020. We managed to hire a ton of new graduates ever since the Covid outbreak, and now we have a fully fledged team. There’s a lot of work, but we have meetings to discuss how to properly mentor juniors and planning for tasks.

2) We were on really close terms. I knew a lot about his personal life and vice versa. we were friendly. We’ve had plenty of banter during our work meetings when we worked alone. This isn’t some dude I just decided to friendly to. This was a friend that I knew for nearly half a decade. That’s why I’m shocked at his response

3) I did not bother him repeatedly about this situation. The moment he went silent after I introduced myself during the game, i got the hint dropped it. It wasn’t until I realized that work is currently being affected since our encounter that I sent an apology, hoping to mediate things and continue things as they were before.

4) his nickname was something his brother called since they were kids. He personally enjoys the nickname and even has that set as his name in meetings. Everybody at work and his friends call him by it. Some juniors don’t even know his full first name.

5) I record a lot of gameplay, it’s not something that I did out of context. I went to check on the recording because I wanted to verify if there was anything I said that was vulgar/offensive that might have led to this. He DOESNT know I have gameplay saved. There was NOTHING malicious, from both of us. if he’s uncomfortable with the gameplay, i’d delete it in an instant.

6) my main issue is that his self-destructive attitude is blocking our development process. I’m perfectly okay with pretending this never happened. But he’s not addressing tasks / helping juniors nor is he acknowledging the issue. A lot of work is getting funneled towards me. I DONT mind working a 9-5, 40 hr week, but there are juniors who are need guidance, and if I abandon them, they are more likely going to fired, especially during this market.

I thought this was a harmless scenario, and I hoped for advice to address how we can make things better. Instead, I’m met with pitchforks about I fucked his life over, deserving to get fired along with the rest of the team. Seriously, hop off the echo chamber hive mind and quit exacerbating a situation far beyond then it really is. He needs to grow up and acknowledge that there’s an issue instead of letting us burn in quiet. 

Everybody on this thread is trying to explain why he acted this way, but it definitely doesn’t justify his actions. Nobody deserves to lose their way to pay bills or provide food on the table over something as ridiculous as this. Y’all heartless bastards need to grow the fuck up.",2023-02-12 06:26:35

The FTC has proposed a rule to ban non-competes, and retroactively invalidate old ones.

For those not familiar, many tech companies outside of California force employees to sign horrible non-competes that prevent you from getting other jobs related to that. These are downright evil.

Why?

1. They can be super broad, capturing massive industries or technologies

2. They can include ""lists of competitors that we can add to at any time""

3. They apply to nearly everyone, not just those with sensitive information

4. They are absolute bullshit. These contracts essentially would prevent you from working at companies with the exact skillset you grew.

How would you feel if you were desperate for a job right now and dealing with this?

Please, please, please go make a public comment here before the FTC stops taking comments. Discuss how it restricts competition.

11epk68,What is your unethical CS career's advice?,Let's make this sub spicy,2023-03-01 00:54:55
18bj8pz,"Many of you are ruining this sub, and you don't even know it.","TLDR: Stop framing every opinion as fact.

The worst part of this sub is not the amount of bad advice (which is already astounding on its own). It's the amount of kids who are confidently incorrect and voice their inexperienced opinions as fact. 

The problem is the new grads who think their limited experience is representative of the whole industry. The problem is the college kids who think their limited interactions with CS folks makes them an expert. The problem is the high schoolers who see the above commenters and blindly regurgitate that garbage.

The problem is that the above people almost always fail to qualify their statements with what their background actually is. 

* They fail to say, ""I've seen others say....""
* They fail to say, ""As someone still in college, I think....""
* Instead, they say, ""This is how things are.""

For a sub about career questions/advice, how are the newly initiated supposed to differentiate the hot garbage from actual, useful advice? (Hint: They don't! Because y'all love to upvote the disinformation to the top too!)

Here's a taste of my own experiences interacting with people from this sub:

* Someone suggested big tech has about the same WLB as a ""chill government job."" What did they do when I confronted them about it? They tried to straw man me by saying I believe all big tech was 60 hour work weeks.
* Someone was overinflating Bay Area rent prices. What did they do when I confronted them about it? They proudly claimed that their Canadian ass knew better than my 20+ years of living here because they looked up the price of a specific apartment in SF next to a train station.
* Someone claimed something iffy about the hiring process (I forgot what by now). What did they do when I asked them for a source for their statement? They referred to their astounding experience of setting up career fairs...as a student.

There's a reason why more experienced folks think this sub has become trash. It's become flooded with ego-boosted kids who comment as if they've never been wrong a single time in their lives. It's full of the CS-stereotype kids who like to double down on their mistakes because they're insecure about the possibility of being wrong. Oh, you've had 4 years of college experience? Congrats! You still don't know shit.

But there's a solution! Simply qualify your statements. It's ok to voice your opinion. And we're all wrong sometimes. But don't give others a false impression of how accurate your comments are by framing every single opinion as fact.

141os12,This Sub Needs to Go Dark on June 12th,"For those who are unfamiliar with upcoming changes to Reddit API, [this thread has a great summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/140pqxs/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/) of what's happening.

All of us, whether we are current or aspiring professionals, should understand better than the general populace how important it is to have an accessible API in software development. I understand that Reddit is a for-profit company who needs to make money. However, these upcoming changes are delusional at best and would practically end all third-party apps and bots out there. 

We need to be in solidarity and go dark on June 12th. Whether it is 48 hours, one week, or permanent, we can't just sit here and pretend that nothing is happening.


**EDIT:**

Thanks everyone for sharing your opinions. It's interesting to others' opinions on both the core topic itself (the changes to Reddit API) and on the blackout.

I want to clarify a few things based on the responses and comments I've seen so far. Note that this is my opinion, I am not trying to represent how others feel about this issue.

Here it goes.

> Reddit is a private company, they have the right to make money however they want and be profitable.

I don't disagree with this. I've worked in a tech company who charged others to access our API before. They are allowed to put any pricing model and restrictions they deem to fit. At the same time, I do not agree with the pricing model they are proposing. Its exorbitant rate would drive third party apps, bots, moderation tools, etc out of existence. 

> Third party apps should not get API access for free and keep the profit.

I am not saying they should either too. Developing and maintaining API is not cheap. Reddit should be compensated and make profit off of it. At the same time, again, the rate they're proposing is way beyond what any 3rd party developers could afford.

> Just use the official app or site

For some people, the official app and site work fine for them. But for many others, the experience is day and night. I've tried the official app, Relay, RIF, and Apollo. To me personally, the official app is almost unusable and a deal breaker if I had to use it. I've heard the same sentiment from other people in the last few days as well. 

Let's not also forget, Reddit did NOT develop mobile app for a long time. It took so many 3rd party developers for Reddit to finally decide that they need to release their own. Users relied (and still continue to rely on) these 3rd party apps to access Reddit when the there was no official mobile app and the mobile site was horrendously bad. Reddit not listening to a community that it's made out of has been a pattern for a long time. 

Also, I have heard that the official app is not exactly accessible friendly. I'm lucky that I don't need accessibility features, but I understand how important it is to make contents accessible to all users. Those who have dealt with ADA complaints and WCAG should understand this. 

> Blackout won't do or affect anything

This depends on by how you'd measure the impacts of a blackout. From financial standpoint, a 48 hours blackout on **some** subreddits probably won't mean anything. Reddit will still be there. The site, app, or API will still continue to work. 

To me, however, this is about putting our voice out there. Let's be honest. Reddit's from tech product perspective, relatively, is not much more extraordinary than a lot of sites out there. What Reddit has is its users, its communities. Reddit is nothing without its users. Voicing our disagreement and discontent is not nothing. Let's not forget what happened to Digg; it's still active by the way, but relatively tiny to what it used to be.

**Final thoughts (for now)**

It's up to you whether to support this blackout or not. To me, Reddit's power is its community, and it is important for Reddit to listen to the community. Reddit can (and should) be profitable, but I'm afraid that the way they are approaching their API business model is going to drive many user base away and thus breaking many of its subreddits and communities.",2023-06-05 19:19:40
152g5dm,"Years ago, I accidentally deleted the entire credit_cards table of $100 million corp, on my 3rd day on the job.","This was back in the mid-2000s. It was my first programming job at a mid-sized corporation. I had been programming professionally for some 3 years in that language. I was hired as a Junior.

On my third day, I logged into what I thought was my newly-setup dev environment, into the /admin section, and clicked on the link to PhpMyAdmin in the top right corner of the page.

Every single employee had access to this link, and it wasn't password protected or anything.

Then, inside PhpMyAdmin, there were all these rows of what I thought was junk data in the `credit_cards` table, so I just did a `TRUNCATE credit_cards;` and went on with writing code.

Less than a minute later, a phone started ringing downstairs. Then one-by-one everyone's cell phone went off. This was in the days before slack. We sometimes used Skype for messaging.

Someone came running downstairs: ""WE CAN'T FIND ANYONE's CREDIT CARDS AND THE CHARGING PAGE IS JUST A WHITE SCREEN!""

I told my boss, well, I did just truncate the credit card table on my DEV box.

He took one look at my screen and said, ""Nope. You did that on Production.""

""What?! Production admin has the same simple login as dev? There's no password for PhpMyAdmin? and it didn't even ask for a login to the MySQL server!""

Long story short, they soon found out that the database backups hadn't been running for the last 7 months, either. They restored the cards up til January, but then, I wrote a SQL query to find all the affected customers, some 25,000 orders affected since.

Customer Service had to call them all back and grab their credit card info again, over a period of weeks.

My next ticket was, at my strong insistence, to remove the PhpMyAdmin link from the Production Admin (that all the hundreds of employees had access to), while a senior dev analyed the Apache logs for ""unauthorized access"", which they found lots of. Then, I made some code changes that gave dev, qa, staging and prod different colored navbars so no one would be so easily-confused by what site they were on.

It actually led to the arrest and imprisonment of a customer service woman who had been using stolen credit cards (from that table, nothing was encrypted (!!)) to buy lunch for months and months and never been caught. One day, they set up a sting operation and she was the only one with steak for lunch that day. FBI came and escorted her out.",2023-07-17 22:28:37
15wf2w9,Name and shame: OpenAI,"Saw the Tesla post and thought I'd post about my experience with openAI.       

Had a recruiter for OpenAI reach out about a role. Went throught their interview loop: 
1. They needed a week to create an interview loop. In the meantime, they weren't willing to answer any questions about how their profit-share equity works.       
2. 4-8 hour unpaid take home assignment, creating a solution using the openAI APIs amongst other methods, then writing a paper of what methods were tried and why the openAI API was finally chosen.      
3. 5-person panel interview         
The 5-person panel insterview is where things went astray. I was interviewing for a solutions role, but when I get to the panel interview, it a full stack software engineering interview?      
Somehow, in the midst of the interview process, OpenAI decided that the job should be a full stack software engineering job, instead of a solutions engineering job.     
No communication prior to the 5 panel interview; no reimbursement for the time spent on the take home.      
I realize openAI might be really interesting to work at, but the entire interview process really showed how immature their hiring process is. Expect it to be like interviewing at a startup, not a 500+ company worth 12B.         

Edit: I don't know why everyone thinks OpenAI pays well.... most offers are 250+500, where the 500 is a profit share, not a regular vesting RSU. Heads up, even with the millions in ARR, OpenAI is not making any profit, not to mention the litany of litigation headed their way.",2023-08-20 15:57:43

1226hcn,I'm worried about AI taking our jobs,"Last week, I had to implement some backend logic for one of our internal api's that takes an integer input and generates sequential numerical output.  The catch is that in order to maintain backwards compatibility with some of our legacy enterprise systems, we need to set every value that's divisible by three to match a key representing our ""flexible and interoperable zero-downtime zero-data-loss"" service or ""Fizz"" for short.  Any values divisible by five will be integrated with our ""Backend Utility for Zero-downtime Zoning"" service, so we represent them with the phrase ""Buzz.""  Values that are divisible by both 3 and 5 receive the designation, ""FizzBuzz.""  This task would normally take me all day, but I asked ChatGPT to create a python script that could produce the expected output and it did it instantly.  The code works flawlessly too.

This isn't the first time chatGPT solved a complex problem for me.  A few weeks ago, we had a P1 emergency when bad data from a botched sftp ticket messed up the data in our CRM system.  The nodes storing the customer interactions were in the wrong order and we needed to reverse them so the latest interactions were readily accessible.  It uses an unusual data structure to hold information, where each node contains a pointer to the next node and the only way to get to the end is to traverse the entire structure, so I asked chatGPT for code to reverse the data structure and it did it in seconds.

Finally, we're rolling out a fraudulent transaction detection system ahead of our next security audit.  The goal is to detect fraudulent transactions by looking for patterns and anomalies in financial data, particularly by looking for pairs of transactions that add up to a suspiciously large amount.  I asked chatGPT for a solution and it suggested we use a hash table to store the amounts of each transaction along with their unique identifiers (such as transaction IDs or customer IDs). Then we iterate through the transactions and check if the difference between the target amount (e.g., a large transaction threshold) and the current transaction amount is already in the hash table. If it is, then there exists a pair of transactions that add up to the target amount, and this could be flagged as a suspicious pattern.

# What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

# What's the plan?

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

12xx9qo,Anyone ever left a chill job for higher pay and regretted it?,"I have a PhD in computer engineering and work a chill job in telecommunications. My job is basically to validate 5g connectivity and ensure customers have service. There's no coding at all as it's mainly a gui where we set parameters and what not. I get 150k with good benefits, and there's extremely good job security. My company hasn't laid off anyone, and I love this job because it's remote. I don't do much work at all, and when sites are down, I've automated the scripts needed to reset parameters for recovering them.  Consequently, I'm getting paid to watch Netflix and sleep all day. I literally haven't done any work since February other than join our weekly team meeting. 

 I get a lot of LinkedIn recruiters sharing 200k+ job interview offers with me in regards to my PhD field of study (system security). I haven't entertained them since they're all in office. I'm mainly scared about getting a manager that micromanages and having to actually do work that can't be automated lol 😅. I'm conflicted between hearing faang layoffs/shit job security, but also seeing their 300/400k+ salaries, so I feel like I'm leaving money on the table by literally sleeping through what should be my hustle years. With my current company, I'll hit 180k in 2 years, 220k in another 3, and staff engineer in another 4 topping at 300k.  Any thoughts would help!


Edit:

 Thanks everyone for their comments! Did not expect this much feedback 😅. I've decided to stay and keep coasting while leetcoding to keep skills sharp. Just wanted to clarify that I won't over employ due to potential risks, and I'm not smart enough to come up and execute a business. I also wanted to add that another reason for wanting higher TC was to be able to buy a house given current interest rates (detailed numbers in the comments). The 300k is only after 9* years when you basically get auto promoted to staff assuming your manager is happy with your performance. 

A lot of people asked how I got this job/how they can get this job. You likely need a MS or PhD in EE/CE/CS or have a couple of YOE with a BS. These types of jobs specifically look to see if you have experience with RF and know 3gpp standards. Apply to companies like Verizon, at&t, dish, mavenir, etc. I mainly got this job because my manager wanted a PhD signing important papers and knew I'd have the skills to quickly learn and get up to speed with managing active sites.",2023-04-24 21:31:45
154zaox,Wow my team at Adobe put up a job offer for a SWE position and they received 850 applications in the first day.,"Edit: I meant job posting, not job offer sorry for the typo

My supervisor was telling us in stand up today and he said that he spent some time just looking at the first \~100 applicants or so and said that most are people laid off from FAANG, or people at unicorns, and they all have several years of experience. They already shut the post down because they were overwhelmed sorting through all the applicants.

This is for a mid-level position, I am not sure of the TC, it is fully remote.

This is crazy.

I even asked my manager if I could apply to it internally (I'm in DevOps / SRE and desperately trying to get out since my SWE skills are stagnating) but he said I didn't have enough experience which is fair since I am a new grad.

&#x200B;

12cwjep,I quit my job and am scared lol,"In a company wide meeting, my boss yelled and swore at me over something minor. I had just  pushed a feature that was performing successfully and passed QA without a problem. He disagreed with a minor design decision that could be adjusted very quickly and without a problem, and yelled ""I'm fucking sick of these bad decisions"" and ""you'll be an SDE 1 forever!"". For context, I haven't actually messed up so far in the company, but he's a really volatile boss. 

I confronted him after the meeting, settled the design problem first and then told him I didn't think that was appropriate and warranted. He told me to ""grow a pair"". I have self respect so that was it for me.

My damn self respect has me unemployed though. How's the job market looking for a software engineer who has American citizenship and only about a year of experience?

EDIT:
I stayed for about a week after the event and tried to coast while applying for jobs/talked to people around the company. Problem was that the event had a lot of people shook and talks about company culture were being brought up all the time. Although that was good, the boss started taking it out on me and I couldn't stomach it, so I collected my March paycheck and sent in my resignation. The Senior engineers and manager I talked to all supported my decision and offered references for my job search which was nice. They all appreciated my work at the company as well. I *should* have stayed and coasted, but my mental health was worn out.

EDIT 2: 
For those asking for name and shame, I'd love to but I'm actually scared. In the unlikely chance he finds out, he'll probably make it a problem since he's actually very successful in the software industry. I'll name and shame as soon as I find a job.

107prke,LPT: Want to be the first to apply to new LinkedIn job listings? Here's how:,"LinkedIn gives you the opportunity to filter jobs posted within the last 24 hours through the dropdown menu, but what if you want listings that have been posted within the last hour or less? You can actually customize that with the url parameters. For example, here is the standard 24-hour filtered url:

    https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3433084183&distance=25&f_TPR=r86400&geoId=103644278&keywords=frontend%20developer

Well, if you notice in the url, you'll see `&f_TPR=r86400`. Uncoincidentally, there are 86,400 seconds in a day. So, you can alter that value to whatever you want in seconds. For instance, one hour would be `3600`, and so on.

Good luck and happy job hunting!

edit: No, it may not be life-changing, but for those who don't have the longest resume, it's a good tactic to hit up an application immediately after it's posted. I've personally received more responses from applications posted within the last 15 minutes than anything else.",2023-01-09 20:57:15

Using AI to display which of these 4 options from this drop-down menu the user would most likely choose first is silly.

13utta4,I GOT AN OFFER!!!,"After getting fired from my first job 6 months in back in 2021 I went into a state of depression and burnout. I could no longer find joy in programming, with time however, I recovered. I am now as motivated as when I first started out. I got back up on my feet after I started building out my passion project which reignited that spark.

I started applying at the worst time possible, when I could have easily gotten an offer during the hiring surge in early 2022 (Clickup was literally hiring HTML/CSS Developers). However, I came to realize that if I had managed to get my first job in 2021 with no relevant experience, I could do it again in 2023 with the hiring freeze and layoffs, even if the odds seems stacked against me.

This offer is a 70% increase in salary from my previous job! I am still in a state of shock to just know that someone would be willing to pay me this much, especially since I have no educational background and was an unemployed loser. They use the latest tech and are also a mid-sized company!

Estimation Time: 2 months and 15 days of jobs searching.I started low and then eventually worked my way up to 100+ applications a day. Around 30 interviews/phone calls. 5 final stages. One offer was about to be on the table until they realized I didn’t have a degree (this really put a chip on my shoulder).

And not a single damn Leetcode interview through the graces of God.Background: I have no degree, and completely self-taught. I got my first job at 19 only after one term of university and dropped out.

Here’s how I got back into the market with such a huge gap on my resume. Note: this is just based on my experience and presumptions.

1. Mass apply, it quite literally is a numbers game. If there are thousands of job listings out there, eventually one will say yes. Do be careful of recruiting agencies, I tend to avoid job listings by them since they seem to be a waste of time.
2. Exaggerate, embellish your work/experience but NEVER lie. You’re here to brag about yourself and how cool you are. The company is also doing the same so it’s okay to do the same.
3. Polish your resume, this is REALLY important. Make it look structured and not something a kid could easily do.
4. F\*ck cover letters
5. If you’re new to the industry, don’t ever apply jobs that uses myworkday job applications, they’re a WASTE of time.
6. Most offers for juniors will require relocation sadly.
7. NEVER talk sh\*t about your previous employers
8. Ask questions, not just any questions but GOOD questions. Show you’re interested in the company as well as trying to succeed. You’ll also learn a lot if they’re a sh\*tty company to begin with.
9. Jobs with 200+ applications? Apply anyways, I’ve gotten responses from them before.
10. Have decent projects that you could talk about and explain your approach to building things
11. Hone in on your “tell me about yourself“ answer and recite it. Make it interesting and RELEVANT
12. Don’t forget to smile :D
13. If you’re religious, pray. Count your blessings and do it with the right intentions. Ask yourself why do you want a dev job? To continue being a resentful pr\*ck? To one day help and lead others? To support your family? To support yourself? Greed?
14. EDIT: Also don't be disheartened if your interview didn't go well. I always use them as practice for my next one!

13m82vk,I feel for everyone here.,"I've been in the industry for 15+ years now and reading through these posts just makes me incredibly sad.  Even just 2 years ago my email inbox used to be swollen with recruiter emails begging me to move and take a job, now I get 1 a month which is clearly machine generated and based solely on my title listed on LinkedIn.

Out of curiosity I looked through different job sites and there really is not alot out there locally, but at least with remote work its a bit easier to look for a job that isn't co-located, but staying in the same timezone is still desirable.

4 years ago I went on the job hunt which is where I first encountered Hacker Rank and Leet Code tests and I gotta say, fuck the software developers / business people who came up with that.  They took the stress of tech interviewing from an 11 to 25, and simply ate up all my free time with bullshit timed assessments.

I hope everyone struggling out there finds a job soon and hopefully things will recover.  Good luck, keep your chin up and make sure you take at least 1 hour out of your day where you just exist in the moment and don't think about all this shit.",2023-05-19 21:18:59

Microsoft Employee Count:

* 2019: **144k Employees**
* 2020: **163k Employees**
* 2021: **181k Employees**
* 2022: **221k Employees**
* 2022 (Q4): **211k Employees** (Post Layoffs)

Few important factors to consider here:

* No, CS careers aren't going away
* Bloated/unorganized hiring lead to recent layoffs, some factors:
   * cheap money (especially early in pandemic where interest rates were low)
   * companies with artificial / over estimated valuations
   * companies that struggled with profit already, but confused excess capital for growth
   * companies with shitty business practices and/or shitty growth strategies
      * I think the writing was on the wall for a lot of these companies
* Fortune 100 companies don't represent the entirety of the CS labor market, there are ton of medium - large companies in serious need of qualified CS talent.
* Crypto was already doomed.
* Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, (Insert ""cool"" high paying tech company here), aren't the only companies, rethink what motivates you in your career goals if your only goal until now was to work for a mega tech corp, maybe it's not its cracked up to be?
* This is indeed a challenging time, especially for new grads/juniors who saw the crazy opportunities of the last two years as companies rapidly expanded but now literally can't get a call back, but fear not - there are still plenty of companies hiring, and while nobody here can really speak to which direction the high paying, or general CS career market will trend in the coming year - this field isn't going away and the demand for qualified candidates will grow, the bar will be raised, but there will be more demand as time goes on, so for now persevere and good luck.

11xng9v,Very Valuable Advice I found on Blind to Cope Up the Layoffs,"""As an engineer who has been through this way too many times, I'll try to give a real answer:

1. Do your job to the best of your ability because its what you are a professional. To be in upper management you have to know how to play politics, to be an engineer you have to actually understand your trade. Do your best so you can look yourself in the mirror and know your worth isn't what a bean counter says it is. Its about self-respect. and if you end up laid off or even PIPed, you can hold your head high. That confidence will move you to the front of the line for the interviews to come.

2. Keep records of what you do. Once a month update your resume. Stand back and look at what you did in a way that will stand out when interviewing. Don't wait until after you are locked out - write it down now while you can review your own work.

3. Listen to your teammates - are they allies or adversaries? Are their review comments helpful or building a case against you in the next ranking. Not everyone is your friend and not everyone is your enemy. Always treat both with respect, but don't be naïve. Quickly discovering who is on your side is the number one thing you can do to protect yourself when politics are played.

4. Talk to your manager, regularly. Never assume they know what you are doing even if they are in stand up. Get yourself on their calendar at least every other week. Make your work visible to them, document it every week. If they like you, it will be used to defend you. If they hate you, they will let you know where you stand earlier.

5. Be visible to your skip level and to other team leads This protects you if your manager isn't liked. I've seen way too many great engineers suffer because of a manager that wasn't liked by their boss.

6. Pay attention in all hands - not the pre-prepared, highly sanitized slides but listen careful for how they respond to questions. Management are employees too - they have been told what they cannot share but they will slip up. Micro-mistakes usually. Chat with a least one co-worker about what you heard, they will hear something different.

7. Watch how your company (all companies actually) treats its employees in bad times - take note of the companies that violate their principles when things get hard. Watch which ones do rolling layoffs, forced URA, prefer hiring over promoting. Do they offer remote and then demand RTO? Take note of this - its indicates a company that doesn't respect you.

8. Watch what the CEO does - does he play follow the leader? Is he afraid of making announcements? Does he hold all-hands and then announce a controversial policy the next day? Take note of this - these are weak leaders and forecasts more of the same in the future.

9. Remember, if you are laid off - its never your fault. I know this seems like an obvious thing, but your mind goes there and will stay there. Layoffs are always mistakes made by upper management - they over hired, they tried to market something that wasn't selling, or they just want their stock options to go up. If you do #1, then don't blame yourself - you did your job. If you did 2-5 you did everything you could to protect yourself. If you did 6-8 you knew it was coming.

10. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you spend time every day becoming better - do a LC problem, update your resume, spend 30 minutes learning something that will get your next job. Take the power back into your hands.

If this sounds like a ""get over it"" post - it isn't. I just spent 30 minutes typing it out because of Gobble's weak leadership. I'm in the same boat, but I decided to think about the 10 things I could do. #11 is GTFO when I find something that makes me not worry as much. Respect matters more than a big paycheck. Most of big tech has now told us who they are, never forget.""

15icf9y,Made fun of during a live coding round for using JavaScript,"Is this not a good language to use? I am more familiar with it and have been applying to SWE roles for a while (I am in devops / sre at the moment and desperately trying to get out).. I feel like I just blew my chances of getting an offer because of this.. I am still shaking a bit, I feel genuinely awful.

I got past the online assessment, which was 2 leet code easy / mediums.. I also used JavaScript there with no issues at all.

Then I eventually moved on to the live coding round where I was asked a Leet Code medium (it was similar to the question ""number of islands"").

I told him I would prefer to use JavaScript since I am most comfortable with it, and he literally laughed out loud.

I smiled as well because I didn't know how to react, so then I think he thought I was joking and asked me again which language I would prefer to use.

So I told him once again, I am most comfortable with JavaScript and then he got super serious and said that JavaScript is not the language to use for coding problems, he said that I clearly didn't prepare enough or else I would be using a real language.

I honestly didn't know how to react, I am a pretty shy / nervous person in general and I started feeling super embarrassed, I could feel my face blushing.

I asked if I could do it in pseudocode then, but he told me no.

He asked if I have ever used other programming languages, and I told him that I have used Java, C++ and Python as part of my CS degree but I don't remember them too much.

He kind of scoffed at me and told me to use any of the 3 languages I had just mentioned

So I tried my best to do it in Java, since it's pretty similar to JavaScript in syntax.. but at this point I was so embarrassed and nervous... my syntax was totally off and I could barely even focus on the question or what the solution was.

So I tried my best, and as I was typing it out he basically just kept shaking his head and muttering ""no no no"" under his breath.

Needless to say I was unable to finish the question and when he realized that, he just told me to stop and moved on to the next part (behavioural questions), which I did terribly on too because I was feeling so bad and nervous.

Before the it ended, he told me next time to prepare better and to actually use a real programming language. I kind of just nodded and said ok thanks.

I have been feeling awful ever since, and to be quite honest with you, I even cried. I just felt very bad and feel like I will not be able to switch to being a SWE any time soon.

Now every time I get an email from a recruiter I've no interest in, I ask about it being fully remote and if it's not, I use that as the reasoning for not wanting to proceed any further.

The endless optimism and success stories that seem to scream fakeness can be hard to swallow, especially when you’re on a job hunt that feels like it’s going nowhere. That being said, I 100% credit LinkedIn for helping me land where I am today. Here’s the method I used. I hope it helps!

Full disclosure: I am a military veteran, and that played into me being a fit for this position. Also, I feel extremely fortunate that I slid into this position in August of last year, which seems to be right before the entire industry cracked down hard. So I realize that my situation is not an exact match for most job seekers in this field today. However, I think the method I used to find the job is applicable regardless.

As a career-changer and fresh graduate of a coding bootcamp with ZERO coding experience prior to the boot camp (I was a sixth grade Latin teacher before changing over), I did everything I could to get a job. As weeks and months passed, I was starting to feel hopeless as the hundreds of applications I put out yielded no results. I tried LinkedIn’s Easy Apply. I tried customizing my resumes. I tried cover letters. I was listening to job hunting podcasts, trying to glean tips. I was networking like crazy, including following SWE influencers, and reading every scrap of their advice. Worked on side projects. Was cramming as much Leetcode as I could into my day. But no results, ever. 95% of companies never even acknowledged my application. And it seems like this is where so many people in this sub are stuck. Just… Crickets.

One day out of desperation I changed tracks and it changed my job search completely. I realized I was networking with the wrong people. So much of my network was fellow bootcamp grads, job seekers, and SWEs. But most of the time, SWEs aren’t the ones doing the hiring. So my feed was totally filled with people posting about work or looking for work.

I started my new strategy by making a list of 20 companies I thought I might like to work at, based on name, reputation, product, or just valuation. I followed those companies, so I would see all the posts where someone tagged that company. Then I went to their company page on LinkedIn and scrolled their People tab, looking for anyone with a job title like Recruiter/Talent/Hiring Manager, etc. Anyone I saw that looked like they hired for SWE positions, I followed them too. I stopped following people with the “Looking for work” green banner (Yeah this is rude, but it worked for me).

So then my feed was filled with recruiters and companies posting about open positions, rather than people making sad posts looking for work. Doing this I also discovered a happy side effect: recruiters are connected to other recruiters, so when they Liked another recruiter’s post, I’d see that too (and follow them). When I saw somebody post a job that I might be a fit for, I messaged the recruiter directly and referenced the post they’d made. Within a couple weeks of this, I had interviews at Lyft, Google (This interview was AWFUL, but good for the experience? Lol), and Oracle, without actually applying to those companies. Eventually, I accepted a position at Oracle and have been working there for about a year now.

I hope this method can help someone else, because cold applying for thousands of positions really sucks. I’ve been there. Without LinkedIn, I wouldn’t be where I am now.",2023-08-02 00:01:26

10q61ix,Blind leading the blind,"I regularly browse this subreddit, as well as a few other sources of info (slack channels, youtube, forums, etc), and have noticed a disturbing trend among most of them.

People who have never had a SWE job giving SWE career advice, and generally people who have no idea what they're taking about giving pointers to newbies who may not know that they are also newbies, and are at best spitballing.

12quqjk,"Rant: The frustration of being hired as a remote employee, only for the company to start enforcing return-to-office","This is just me griping, but I was hired as a remote employee by a company that I really like, but happens to be owned by a megacompany whose name starts with A and ends with Mazon, which recently announced that all employees in all orgs must work in the office 3+ days a week. This includes my company, even though they have always been a hybrid workplace even pre-pandemic. 

So now I'm facing down driving an hour each way to get to an office where none of my coworkers actually work, AND they've announced that they no longer will subsidize parking. Previously managers were allowed to grant remote work exceptions, but when the parent company announced RTO, they elevated that requirement from manager to senior VP level. My org does not have a senior VP. This has totally killed my joy for what started as the best job I've ever had. 

To others who have been in this situation, how did you cope? I'm working on brushing up my resume but I'm not optimistic given the current tech climate and the tens of thousands of laid off engineers also looking for jobs. Part of me wants to just not comply, but I'm trying to get savings together for a big life event and if I end up fired with 6 months between jobs, while I'll 100% be okay, it'd set back my timeline by such a long time.

Both times my PIP feedback has been the same. I'm just not fast enough. What takes another engineer 3 days takes me 2 weeks. I get all my work done eventually. It just takes me longer than others.

10s5s5o,Manager isn't happy that my rule-based system is outperforming a machine learning-based system and I don't know how else I can convince him.,"I graduated with a MSCS doing research in ML (specifically NLP) and it's been about 8 months since I joined the startup that I'm at. The startup works with e-commerce data and providing AI solutions to e-commerce vendors.

One of the tasks that I was assigned was to design a system that receives a product name as input and outputs the product's category - a very typical e-commerce solution scenario. My manager insisted that I use ""start-of-the-art"" approaches in NLP to do this. I tried this and that approach and got reasonable results, but I also found that using a simple string matching approach using regular expressions and different logical branches for different scenarios not only achieves better performance but is much more robust.

It's been about a month since I've been pitching this to my manager and he won't budge. He was in disbelief that what I did was correct and keeps insisting that we ""double check""... I've shown him charts where ML-based approaches don't generalize, edge cases where string matching outperforms ML (which is very often), showed that the cost of hosting a ML-based approach would be much more expensive, etc. but nothing.

I don't know what else to do at this point. There's pressure from above to deploy this project but I feel like my manager's indecisiveness is the biggest bottleneck. I keep asking him what exactly it is that's holding him back but he just keeps saying ""well it's just such a simple approach that I'm doubtful it'll be better than SOTA NLP approaches."" I'm _this_ close to telling him that in the real world ML is often not needed but I feel like that'd offend him. What else should I do in this situation? I'm feeling genuinely lost.

**Edit**
I'm just adding this edit here because I see the same reply being posted over and over: some form of ""but is string matching generalizable/scalable?"" And my conclusion (for now) is YES.

I'm using a dictionary-based approach with rules that I reviewed with some of my colleagues. I have various datasets of product name-category pairs from multiple vendors. One thing that the language models have in common? They all seem to generalize poorly across product names that follow different distributions. Why does this matter? Well we can never be 100% sure that the data our clients input will follow the distribution of our training data.

On the other hand the rule-based approach doesn't care what the distribution is. As long as some piece of text matches the regex and the rule, you're good to go.

In addition this model is handling the first part of a larger pipeline: the results for this module are used for subsequent pieces. That means that precision is extremely important, which also means string matching will usually outperform neural networks that show high false positive rates.",2023-02-03 00:24:07

16wtgb9,"FYI: the guy who ""Name and Shamed"" his employer on this subreddit lost the defamation lawsuit against him","A little while ago there was a series of posts that blew up on this sub from a guy who worked for Loanstreet and decided to ""Name and Shame"" them on this subreddit, claiming that they ""cheated him out of equity"". The OP later updated that Loanstreet was suing him in federal court for defamation, and appeared quite confident he would win. 

I had a bad feeling about this case, and I decided to follow the updates on Pacer. A couple weeks ago, the judge released her opinion, finding that the defendant did indeed defame and disparage his former employer, and that his accusations against them were not true. She also dismissed all of his counterclaims against Loanstreet.

I guess this is a good lesson to 1. Watch what you say online, and take a deep breath before deciding to ""Name and Shame"" an employer you feel has wronged you. 2. Be skeptical of what you read on reddit, disgruntled employees are not always reliable narrators. 



Some highlights from the opinion:


>[Defendant]’s allegations that Lampl “just pocketed
the options he promised me” and “is a rich con man,” or that
LoanStreet “withheld $100k in options that they promised [[Defendant]]
before [he] was hired,” “is a fraudulent, exploitative mess,”
“cheat[s] people just to make [their] big piles of cash a little
bigger,” “cheated [[Defendant]] out of equity,” and “defrauded [[Defendant]]
out of over $100k” are simply untrue... More than that, his accusations have specific, obvious
–- and in some cases legal -- meaning and are plainly refuted by
the black-and-white terms of the Offer Letter and Option Agreement. 
Because his statements necessarily “produce a different effect on
the reader than would a report containing the precise truth,”
...they must be considered false


-

>Here, all of [Defendant]’s statements were meant to expose
LoanStreet and Lampl to public opprobrium and shame. Indeed, the
stated goal in the headline of his Reddit posts was to “Name and
Shame” LoanStreet.

-

>However, we doubt that [Defendant]’s statements constitute “a
matter of public interest.” The Court is mindful of § 76-a’s text
stating that the term “public interest” “shall be construed
broadly, and shall mean any subject other than a purely private matter.” Here, though, [Defendant]’s
statements involved “an internal complaint about the behavior of
a fellow employee,”...and [Defendant]’s former employer, which [Defendant] admits in his
posts is a “small company” of “[less than] 30 people.” .. Whether and when a single employee was entitled to
certain vested stock options under the terms of his unique
contracts at a company of less than 30 employees is likely not a
matter of public interest. Indeed, to the extent that [Defendant]
believed he was “cheated” and “defrauded” by LoanStreet and Lampl,
he could have pursued that theory in a court of law. 

-

>The Court is concerned that it would be
inappropriate –- and inconsistent with legislative intent -- to
reward [Defendant] for his behavior by finding that his calculated (and
false) attacks on LoanStreet and Lampl can transform a purely
private gripe into a matter of public concern. As such, we are
skeptical that New York’s anti-SLAPP law applies here


-

>Although [Defendant] denies having made his statements with actual
malice...we infer [Defendant]’s
reckless disregard for the truth from his obvious ill will towards
LoanStreet and Lampl together with the indisputable facts which
contradict his statements... First,
[Defendant]’s ill will is evident from his calculated decision to wait
the full “requisite year” for his “non-disparagement clause to
expire,” ...before embarking on a
multifaceted smear campaign to attack plaintiffs using charged --
and in some cases abusive -- language. If that were not
sufficient, [Defendant] amplified his posts in the hopes that LoanStreet
would face maximum ridicule, even paying for advertisements
bearing titles such as “LoanStreet horror story – LoanStreet
careers,” and “LoanStreet horror story – ‘a terrible place to
work.’” The Court thus has no doubt that [Defendant]
was motivated by personal animus towards plaintiffs such that “malice was the one and only cause for the publication” of his
statements. 


-


 >“when read in the full context of the
posts, as defendant urges the Court to do, it is clear that even
the most vitriolic of the bunch — remarks such as, ‘[Lampl] is a
rich con man’ and ‘[LoanStreet] is a fraudulent, exploitative mess’
— relate to the specific accusation that LoanStreet and Lampl
defrauded defendant by unlawfully withholding $100,000 in stock
options.”


-


 >Even assuming that [Defendant] was discharging a moral duty in
making his statements or maintained a common interest with the
viewers of his posts -- both highly dubious assumptions-- his
defenses would fail, as these two qualified privileges are defeated
if the statements at issue were “published excessively, i.e., [they
were] made to persons with an insufficient interest in it for it
to warrant protection.”  Here, [Defendant] posted his statements
on prominent, public social media and workplace review websites to
an audience that had no obvious interest in LoanStreet and then
amplified them further using paid Google advertisements. One might, for example, question the conviction with which [Defendant] felt a “moral duty” when he waited the requisite year for his non-disparagement agreement to
expire before launching his online campaign...[Defendant] cannot simultaneously maximize the audience
for his statements then hide behind qualified privileges which
explicitly do not apply to such excessive publication.",2023-10-01 06:14:27

13xf2x7,Name and shame: TradingHub,"This has genuinely got to be the worst interview process I have ever been through, bit of a long one but will include a TL:DR at the bottom.

Coming from someone who has been through 30+ interview stages for graduate roles, I have never dealt with the level of disorganization and sheer lack of effort shown by the recruiters at TradingHub. They're a small FinTech company with a great salary offer and location I really wanted to be in, which is why I stuck it out so long, looking back I should've stopped putting up with their shit after the second or third interview. There were 5 of them.

I applied a few months ago, and got an automatic response with a hackerrank test shortly. Eager to speed up the process, I took the test on the same day, but didn't recieve a response until over a month later. I then had a call with the head of recruitment to ""judge my suitability for the role"", after 2 weeks of what I assume was carefully deliberating whether my skills and character matched the role, he set up another call with me and the head of businesss, which was another non-technical chat and basically a waste of my time. Both of these calls where nothing more than me hearing about how great the company was and barely any questions about my skills or experience.

After yet another week of silence I heard back to learn that I would be doing a pair programming interview next with a software engineer, finally, a real interview! To be fair to them this was the best interview stage by far and I did really enjoy it. It was fun to work with a real senior software engineer and learn a bit from him. Luckily (or so I thought) I ended up impressing him and progressing to the final interview stage after literally a MONTH of waiting. Please also note that the entire time I was emailing the head of recruitment who was supposed to be managing my process, who kept assuring me I'd find out next week and that they were just interviewing a lot of people. I told him I wished to progesss to the last stage as quickly as possible as I had exams just round the corner, but this didn't seem to speed things up at all.

I finally progressed to the last interview stage which was 2 weeks ago and right in the middle of my exams. I had a decent chat with a senior at the company who did ask some pretty good questions about my skills and experience, but after now emailing the head of recruitment twice without a response it appears I'm not recieving one at all. I was lucky enough to recieve an offer from a different company last week which I have since accepted, but to go through 5 interview stages over the course of 3 months to be ghosted at the last stage is beyond frustrating.

TL:DR - 5 interview stages, taking weeks or even months to reply inbetween stages and then ghosting right after the final interview.",2023-06-01 11:29:44

Is the market really this bad?,"Last summer I graduated with no job and little internship experience, didn’t spend much effort applying to jobs but still got interviews and an entry level job offer within a few weeks. I got laid off two months ago with one year of work experience. Since then I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs with several different iterations of my resume, which I got professionally reviewed, and I’ve gotten nothing except a single interview invitation which was followed by a rejection email with no explanation the next day. I don’t know what to do. Is it me or is this just how it is right now?",2023-08-01 13:22:02
16f7poq,"for those of you who were laid off from a high paying tech job, how did you recover?","I was laid off from a 270k\~ job (190k base) and there is no way in fuck I'm going to be anywhere near that on my next job.

to make matters worse, after the pandemic happened, I moved back to the midwest, and tech jobs here are scarce.

now im stuck in the midwest with no job. im trying to figure out what to do with my life at this point. should i move to nyc? boston? chicago? back to la?

i have 4 months of severance and 150k in the bank so its not like im in the shitter but i highly doubt i'll be able to get the same type of job. im gonna have to get whatever and continue looking until i get something decent.

has this ever happened to anyone here? what did you do?",2023-09-10 18:31:57

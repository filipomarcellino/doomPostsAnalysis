nvy7cj,My Reddit account cost me my next SDE job(95% sure),"So, this happened, I got rejected for- having a reddit account and being unbelievably stupid.   
I am Senior software engineer and was interviewing for a startup which just got huge funding. I got through first 4 rounds.  
Now here comes the last Engineering manager round. I was pretty confident. He asked me two Leetcode hard problems and I was able to do both. For the next question he asked me to open Reddit. Pretty weird, right ? Basically he just wanted to show me how reddit/subreddits/subcomments looks and design a database for it.  
Here comes the stupid part- I opened reddit from the browser I had logged in with my personal account. He asked me to open a post and to my great luck, all the usernames in that post were similar to these - pusyman34, hairylicker, largenuts. And he was trying to explain me how he needs me to design a database with these users. I was barely controlling my laughter at that moment. I started designing database and so far interview was going pretty interactive but now he kind of got distracted and started to check something else on his computer. He wasn't focussing on anything I was saying and he was just replying ""Yeah sure, it will work"". 10 minutes into the question and he suddenly said -""okay I think I am done here."" I was answering all his questions, we had still 30 mins left and this guy wanted to leave the discussion. Then it hit me like a train. He must have seen my username, searched my account and must have been seeing my posts and comments. And my account was just posts about trolling and hating corporate, 9-5, managers and whole software world basically.  
Interview Result - Rejected  
Feedback- LLD knowledge not up to mark(I was not asked a single question on LLD in any of my interview)   
My reddit account - now deleted

Edit- Some of you are thinking interviewer asked me to open my reddit account. No, he asked me to open reddit. I was the dumbass who opened it in the browser I was logged in.",2021-06-09 15:11:08

Last summer, **I was overwhelmed by the positive response** of online forums for workers in the technology industry **when** **I** [**shared**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o3jpfc/name_and_shame_loanstreet_ny_cheated_me_out_of/) [**the**](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-LoanStreet-NY-RVW48628117.htm) [**true story**](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Name-Shame-LoanStreet-NY-cheated-me-out-of-equity-rRKGJAj3) of how my former employer, [LoanStreet](https://www.loan-street.com/) (NY), cheated me out of equity compensation and fired me without warning in the middle of the COVID hiring freeze. Thousands of people went out of their way to read, upvote, and comment on my posts, spreading the message far and wide. **It was amazing to see people from around the world join forces to protect vulnerable, at-will workers from exploitative opportunists.**

**In response, LoanStreet and its** [**CEO Ian Lampl**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-lampl-b7a5b684/) **have** [**sued me**](https://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nysdce/1:2021cv06166/563584) **for at least three million dollars in U.S. federal court.** They are throwing the kitchen sink at me, accusing me of breach of contract, defamation, injurious falsehood, unfair competition, and false designation of origin. **All the accusations are either false or are attempts to enforce contract provisions that are illegal under federal labor law.**

**To LoanStreet and CEO Ian Lampl: US law is on my side and I will prevail in court. Common sense and morality are on my side and I will prevail in the court of public opinion.** My donors and I can and will keep this fight up as long as is needed to ensure you cannot blindside anyone else, and to set a legal precedent that will protect all American workers from companies like you. Multiple former LoanStreet employees who feel you took advantage of them have reached out to thank me for standing up to you. You got away with discreetly abusing employees for a long time, but now you are reaping what you sowed.

# Subpoena

**Last Friday,** [**LoanStreet (NY)**](https://www.loan-street.com/) **and its** [**CEO Ian Lampl**](https://www.loan-street.com/company#hs_cos_wrapper_widget_1542403709654) **asked a federal judge to force Reddit to de-anonymize** ***every*** **post and comment I've written in my entire life by revealing** ***every*** **username I have** ***ever*** \*\*used.\*\***^(1)**

If you want to experience a company praise your work for over a year only to fire you without warning or severance in the middle of a pandemic, screw you out of promised compensation, *and* punish you for talking about it by trying to bankrupt you and publicly link you to every Reddit comment or post you've written under any username since you were born, LoanStreet is the company for you!

**Publicly identifying the Reddit usernames that I used when I was in middle school and/or only for posts unrelated to LoanStreet can serve no purpose, in my opinion, other than to try to harass and embarrass me and to intimidate other exploited employees into silence.**

Just when you think LoanStreet can't stoop any lower, they do. **At this point, no one is making the dangers of working at LoanStreet clearer than LoanStreet itself.**

# Commentary

I want to address a few things that have been brought up in the comments on my posts:

* I completely agree that people should be skeptical of any claims they hear, including any that LoanStreet or I might have made. That said, **I wouldn't be risking millions of dollars in penalties for lying if I didn't know that I haven't.**
* Last summer, LoanStreet threatened to sue me unless I took down all of my posts and paid for the ""reputation management"" costs it had incurred as a result of my posts.^(2) So while I respect the right of real Redditors to be skeptical of and to disagree with me, I encourage everyone to keep in mind that **LoanStreet has admitted to paying professional stooges to counteract my story** (and the stories of other former employees it has baselessly accused me of authoring). While LoanStreet has not revealed the specifics of these manipulations, be on the lookout for odd clusters of comments, upvotes, and downvotes on posts about LoanStreet. Where there is sensuous bootlicking, there could well be money changing hands.
* **Do not threaten violence or joke about committing violence against anyone from LoanStreet**. The right way to fight for justice is by sharing accurate information about LoanStreet's labor practices and protecting access to that information.
* **Just because a non-disparagement clause is in a signed contract** [**does not mean it's legal**](https://www.reuters.com/article/labor-nondisparagement/law-firms-broad-non-disparagement-pact-violated-labor-law-nlrb-general-counsel-idUSL2N27V1RN)**.**
* **None of the factual or legal claims in LoanStreet's legal complaint have been vetted by a judge or jury yet.** Take them with a grain of salt. Many will not age well.
* **Most workers who are exploited cannot afford to fight back. Those of us who can, must.** LoanStreet would only pay severance to the people it abruptly fired^(3) if they signed permanent non-disparagement agreements. It forced these people - who, for example, had kids, were pregnant, and/or had a spouse already out of work during the pandemic - to choose between protecting their families from financial strain and protecting other workers from LoanStreet's exploitation. I doubt I would have taken on the risks I have if I had had a spouse or child that I was endangering by doing so. I am inspired to continue fighting by the former LoanStreet employees and people around the world who have thanked me for standing up for what's right. Ideally, this episode causes companies in general to think twice before exploiting their employees and empowers workers with knowledge of [their rights](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/employee-rights).
* I am comfortable accepting the risk of some employers passing on me over this in the future. Those aren't companies I would want to work for, anyway. I currently have a good job with a company I trust and I have no doubt I could find another. I think you'll find that most people, including hiring managers, believe that vulnerable, at-will workers should be able to warn each other about egregiously exploitative companies.

1. [Link to LoanStreet's requested subpoena](https://we.tl/t-rZw13hIUPT), which would force Reddit to hand over ""Documents sufficient to show the identity of all Reddit user names used by \[me\]"" (Request No. 4). Together with the earlier instruction that ""The use of any tense of any verb shall be considered to also include within its meanings all other tenses of the verb so used"" (Instruction 7), LoanStreet and Lampl want to force Reddit to reveal *every* username I have *ever* used, regardless of its relevance to their claims.
2.

osxhf6,Here's few things I am telling junior developers in 1:1 and it's working out pretty well,"It's very basic thing but often ignored so thought to put it out.

I don't know if you would believe it or not, but some junior developers are shit scared when they join any team. I had a couple in my previous job, one in a job before that and a few now. 

Some go well along with the flow and throw in so much productivity. Some, however, aren't able to perform at their full potential even though they know a bunch of stuff and super technical.

Usually what blocks them is company/team/project specific things which they aren't able to figure out on their own.

I used to be that guy 7 years ago. Asking my senior peers was such an issue for me. There was a sense of judgement which held me off from asking more than a predetermined number of questions to any senior guy in the team. Part of this also had to do something with the fact how douchebag some of the senior devs in my team were. A few would literally reply with wink emojis and sarcastic replies when I asked them for a help in solving merge conflicts in my initial years, after I tried to figure out on my own by staying awake whole night reading git articles and exploring stackoverflow like a maniac. Trust me, no matter how simple you think it is and that junior guy should know this, sometimes it literally is impossible for them.

Some junior guys break out in company washrooms too.

Seriously, some senior devs don't have tolerance around taking more than 4-5 questions a day from junior devs and it can be seen/felt through their body language. Their main excuse is they should figure it out on their own, but sometimes it's soul killing to the junior guys. Trust me, I have been there.

Keeping my past in mind, I tell these things repeatedly to any new intern/junior who joins in my team.

""Hey, look, feel free to ask as many questions you want. I personally prefer to get asked more questions from you. The more you ask, the more we both learn. And, you know what, your mind will tell you to not ask more questions when you already asked me 4 doubts in a day (at this statement, they show their smiling/nodding face in video chat because it's the fact for them), but, don't listen to your mind. Thats' the limit you set in your mind thinking it's not ok to ask more than a few doubts a day to any person. I would be ok even if you ask me 50-100 things a day. So, feel free to throw them in my slack and never feel hesitated to ask your questions. Even if you personally think, this might be a silly doubt, throw it in. I will never judge you for that.""

This gives them so much confidence and assurity to get unblocked fast and be more productive. Not only that, they speak highly of you with upper management and HRs which gets you additional brownie points. So, it's a WIN WIN.

Tldr: Be nice to junior devs. You were also junior once.",2021-07-27 23:05:57
oxx25o,Does the job search make anyone else want to cry?,"I just got like my 15h rejection in a row, this time with feedback on a hackerrank that said ""Our engineering leadership thought that your HackerRank solution was a bit convoluted and not what we are looking for currently."" Except that I know I'm a good engineer and my solution was not at all convoluted. All my former coworkers were happy with my work. My bosses were happy and gave me good performance reviews. Maybe they're annoyed I used functions instead of having everything in a for loop or that I used camel case. I don't fucking know. I just know that I'm tired of answering questions correctly and getting rejected.

I've been out of the job force for nearly a year now. I'm going to be homeless in a few months. And literally every place rejects me after I correctly answer a tech question.

Update to [this original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o3jpfc/name_and_shame_loanstreet_ny_cheated_me_out_of/)

**LoanStreet seems to be at work trying to sweep their misconduct under the rug so they can continue to mistreat employees with impunity.**

This morning **Glassdoor** emailed me to let me know they had **removed my post**:

*We determined your review does not meet these guidelines because you have mentioned or discussed yourself or another individual by name, title or association. As part of our guidelines,* ***we do not allow users*** *within their reviews* ***to single out*** *themselves or* ***non-C-level executives*** *in a negative light. We only permit discussion of specific individuals when they are C-level executives and therefore represent the public face of the company and have great influence over the broad work environment.*

**The thing is, all the people named in my Glassdoor review are C-level executives:**

* Cofounder/CEO Ian Lampl
* Cofounder/former COO Christopher Wu
* CTO Larry Adams (he's listed as VP Engineering on LoanStreet's website, but there is no engineering/tech manager above him)

I had already been through multiple rounds of review with Glassdoor prior to the review being posted. In the end, **a senior member of the Glassdoor content review team confirmed that my review met guidelines and was approved. Screenshot** [here](https://imgur.com/a/cBQQLkh)**.**

It's disappointing to see Glassdoor allow a company to hide an approved post that dozens of people marked as helpful (thank you, r/cscareerquestions!). I will try to get the post back up.

**Glassdoor may have lost its spine, but please upvote** [**my Blind post**](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Name-Shame-LoanStreet-NY-cheated-me-out-of-equity-rRKGJAj3) **to get the word out.**

Finally, **thank you to the mods of** r/cscareerquestions and to Reddit **for showing some integrity and allowing us to** do what members of communities should do: **warn each other of predators** so that only one person needs to be hurt before the entire group learns how to be safe.

oosru6,I went to the office for the first time. I fucking hated it.,"Not my main account because I know some of my coworkers/friends browse this sub and would recognize me.  I just want to rant and encourage people to keep looking for remote jobs and make the transition if they can/prefer it.

So last week, after a year or so working from home, I had to go back (for the first time in my career) into the office. According to my company, we should work from the office because it will increase collaboration and people will perform better.  Bunch of bs, but I had no other choice at the moment.

So first things first, instead of waking up at 8:20 and join a useless meeting at 8:30, be on mute and proceed to go make my breakfast and take my dog for a walk,  I now have to wake up at 7, get properly dressed (no more comfortable clothes), make sure I have lunch and breakfast prepped, get on the highway, drive, get there at 8:15, mindless chit chat till 8:30, join the same useless meeting on zoom (with coworkers from around the globe, what's the f. point? ) and now I HAVE to/MUST pretend to pay attention to something that has no relation to what I work with because well, I got no more flexibility on my surrounding environment.

At home, I invested in a nice work setup. I have a nice chair, a stand-up desk, wireless keyboard/mouse/headphones, 2 monitors that I can adjust, plus a private kitchen to make my snacks, and teas.

The first time I went to the office and I saw the work environment I felt ridiculous. It's a fucking cubicle, with a shitty keyboard, mouse, and headset. The best part is that the cubicle doesn't have tall walls so I can literally see/hear everything, including other people's monitors.  The monitors, of course, are facing the hallway, so you can't see who's walking behind you, but whoever walks past you can freely see what you are doing.  Manager's dream.

I also have to wait in line now if I want to make some tea or something, delightful.

At home, I am able to have a quiet environment and be super productive. When I get a card, depending on what it is, I can finish it in 2-4 hours, and then I can focus on doing something else for the rest of the day (learning/training, other meetings, or just not work at all since I was able to be productive).

At the office, because of being constantly watched, I became lazy just to have something to hold on to/last for the rest of the day. I also noticed that my team members do the same.  Also for me, IT IS EXTREMELY HARD to actually focus with a lot of background noise and as I mentioned above, because of the cubicles, every time someone gets up (every 10 mins), or gets a phone call, my attention is drawn to that and I lose what focus I had.

The company kept saying we will be more productive at the office. That's the opposite of what I am seeing. My team is now taking longer for cards, and the amount of time wasted in the office is ridiculous. The number of people, mindless walking around, chit-chatting in cubicles, going out for lunch/ coffee breaks just to fill in the time is a joke(nothing wrong with that IMO, but I'd rather do that at home).

I loved having a private bathroom at my house. I can go and do whatever I want to do in peace. At the office, welcome to the shitty stalls and pooping side by side because, yes, I do love the smell of people farting in the morning.

The people that wanted to go back into the office, after a week of going to work and lunches and whatnot, started to mention some stuff during the stand-ups and I quote:

""Are you guys feeling more tired than usual?  I forgot I didn't enjoy the commute""

""Man I forgot it sucked to have to prep a meal every day and wait in line in the cafeteria to reheat it""

""I actually didn't realize I was saving money eating at home, I spent over 100 dollars last week on coffee and lunch"".

At home, after work, I could go for a jog right away or just go watch some Netflix and chill out.

At the office after a long, tiring day? Nope, get in the car, you are going to waste 40 minutes in stressful traffic to get home.

&#x200B;

I am FUCKING glad, I am putting in my 2 weeks this Wednesday and going fully remote. I started looking 4 months ago when the company announced their plans because I was feeling that this office thing would be horrible. I tried it out and it just doesn't work for me.

If you are looking for a remote role, keep applying/interviewing, you will get something too.

If you like/prefer going to the office that is fine. I am not trying to say we should all be remote. Companies should offer FLEXIBILITY to let employees choose where to work from.

We have different personalities and different preferences. Just because some people enjoy going into the office (or because management needs control) doesn't mean everyone has to.

&#x200B;

I am gladly never going to or near an office ever again.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Went to the office for the first time in my life. I hated it and makes no sense to me.  Companies should let employees decide where to work from. If they can't offer that and make their employee's lives easier/better, they should/will lose all their talent to companies that do.

&#x200B;

EDIT 1: There seems to be a lot of people saying that I am entitled. For a bit of background, I started working a couple of years ago as a dishwasher and made my way to where I am right now. I never had an easy path nor a college degree (I am self-taught with a small coding Bootcamp).

Just because I prefer having a better quality of life/work, doesn't mean I am entitled. Instead of bickering with each other about who works harder or whatever, we should focus on having a better quality of life and trying to make it the norm. If you are working 6 days a week and you feel proud, good for you but I don't want that for me.",2021-07-21 15:56:35
kqd16b,A plea to future and junior developers,"I’ve been a developer for 17 years and I want to talk about someone I’ve met literally hundred of times and I guarantee you will work with one day: Bob.

Bob has been a professional developer for 10 years. Whenever he touches someone else’s code he complains endlessly about how stupid they were or how bad the code is. At the same time, he’s never really considered the readability of his code by another person. It’s not tricky because he understands it.

He’s worked at small companies where peer reviews weren’t a thing when he was learning unfortunately and he’s now developed an ego that make him immune to all criticism. Anyone who critiqued his code would be wrong 100% of the time because he’s a senior lead grandmaster engineer. He’s the only one who knows how [system he built] works so he’s invaluable to the company. They train people to tiptoe around his “difficult personality” or whatever euphemism the project team has assigned to him being an asshole.

Bob’s code is never as good as he thinks it is. It’s full of idiomatic quirks he developed over time like a programming accent that nobody else checked him on. It suffers because:

-	It will never be better than his limited knowledge. He’s a cup full of water and there’s no room for more water. Anything he doesn’t want to learn is a “fad of the week.”
-	Anyone reading his code becomes a forensic investigator who needs to decipher his little quirks instead of focusing on the problem being solved.

Don’t be like Bob. He’s toxic. He’s miserable to work with and creates a culture of mediocrity. His name (whatever it is at your office) is a slur for a difficult person.

To every junior engineer out there please burn into your mind:

-	Any code written more than 10 seconds ago is immediately garbage that was written by someone who was dumber than they are now. Good developers all have a shared understanding not to speak these thoughts aloud.
-	All code is written for two audiences: the machine reading it and the poor slob who has to update/fix it in 4 years (maybe you). Tricky code is a middle finger to that second audience meant to show how smart you think you are.
-	Every criticism you get is a gift, seek them out. You are not your code. Beg for criticism. Even when they’re not right, trying to understand why they think they are is a valuable thought exercise. Start with the premise your wrong. Even if it’s not phrased constructively take the part you need (the feedback) and ignore how it’s delivered. 
-	The more you think you know the more your ego will try to sabotage your growth by convincing you you’re always right and shutting out new knowledge.
-	Refusing to admit you’re wrong about something is a show of insecurity. Admitting you’re wrong about something (especially to a junior developer) is a flex that shows your knowledge/skills/authority isn’t challenged by new information.
-	Unless you’re entry level, helping less experienced/knowledgeable folks constructively is an implied part of your job.

[UPDATE: Name & Shame: LoanStreet (NY) wants federal judge to force Reddit to de-anonymize every post and comment I've written in my entire life](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qh2xho/name_shame_loanstreet_ny_wants_federal_judge_to/)
********

I worked for [**LoanStreet in NYC**](https://www.loan-street.com/). Small company. <30 people. [**Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswu000) **told me my equity would start vesting after 12 months.** **After I started, they told me that they actually meant 12 months after the next quarterly board meeting, and I would only start to vest after 16 months.** I asked them to change it. They dragged their feet for months, pretending to work on it. **After 15 months of praising my work, they abruptly fired me just as COVID froze tech hiring, refused to vest any of the promised equity, and the head of HR (who is also the wife of the CEO and who had spoken to me warmly just the night before) refused to answer my phone calls asking for an explanation.** LoanStreet is run by fancy lawyers and they were crafty with the offer letter language so I had no legal case. The offer letter said the details of the equity compensation would come in a different document, which they didn't provide for almost a year after I joined. **If it was a good-faith error, they could have done the right thing and granted me what I earned. They chose not to.**

**The only problem I was aware of was that the** [**CTO Larry Adams**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larry-adams-2a20b07) **was upset with me because I discovered one of his favorite engineers had broken mission-critical code, and I fixed it.** Basically this guy was making changes to financial code he didn't understand, and had erroneously +1'd in one place so he ended up -1'ing in a bunch of other places to offset the initial error and get the tests to pass even though some key, untested functionality was now broken. The engineer didn't remember why he had made the change and refused to help me investigate why tests were failing. I privately spoke to him to ask him to be careful with the code in that area because it was tricky, to leave comments if he writes something that might be confusing to another reader, and to feel free to ask me for help in that area since it was my niche in the company. I was trying to do him a favor by not making a more public stink about it. He immediately complained to the CTO, who called me 30 min later to sternly tell me that there was no error because we had tests that would have caught it and to scold me for going out of my lane. I wrote a failing test proving that the error existed and that our tests were incomplete. Then I fixed the error. He brusquely told me to fix anything I had broken by making that change. At the next retro ""needs improvement"" section I said I hoped we could affirm a team norm of being responsible for your code: being able to explain it and to help fix things if it breaks something. Larry Adams got mad and shut down the conversation. **For the next few weeks he worked behind my back to get me fired.**

[**Cofounder/CEO Ian Lampl**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-lampl-b7a5b684/), his wife and [**head of HR Alyssa Guttman**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssa-guttman-37133a4)**,** [**COO Christopher Wu**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswu222)**,** [**CTO Larry Adams**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larry-a-2a20111), and [**General Counsel Thaddeus Pittney**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tlpitney) are the people chiefly responsible for what happened.

Copying my [**Glassdoor review**](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-LoanStreet-NY-RVW48294594.htm) below. Please follow the link and mark it as helpful so that the message is amplified and as many people are warned as possible. LoanStreet fires people without warning and makes severance dependent on signing a permanent non-disparagement agreement, so we need to elevate the negative reviews they do have.** They have no legal fees because many of the top people are lawyers, and so they intimidate people into keeping their stories to themselves, even with ""anonymous"" outlets like Glassdoor available.

**Pros**

*They are willing to give boot camp grads a chance*

**Cons**

*TLDR: Stay far, far away unless you're truly desperate. LoanStreet is a raging dumpster fire and you will get burned like many before. After 15 months of praising my work - and as COVID froze the hiring markets in 2020 - they abruptly fired me and withheld $100k in options that they promised me before I was hired.*

*The annualized turnover rate in the small NYC office during my time there was around 50%. Every two months or so, someone was fired who said they weren’t given any warning and the company would tell the same story that this person was given many warnings and opportunities to respond to feedback. I saw a lot of good workers blindsided, some leaving in tears. I thought it was fishy and eventually it happened to me, despite always having received glowing praise from leadership.*

*Any promises made to you to entice you to sign an offer should be regarded with extreme skepticism. Get everything in writing and reviewed by a good lawyer.*

*After hiring employees with a promise of unlimited PTO, management rolled out a PTO tracking tool that explicitly capped PTO at 15 days per year.*

*Before I joined, Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu told me that the first quarter of my stock options would vest after a year. My offer letter said details on the equity compensation would be provided in a separate equity agreement. I wasn't provided that agreement for nearly a year after my start date, and you can imagine my surprise when I saw that I wouldn't begin to vest until nearly 16 months of employment. After 15 months of work, I was abruptly fired and didn't receive a single option.*

*Because the offer letter omitted the details of the equity compensation, labor lawyers told me I had no case. Keep in mind, LoanStreet is run by lawyers who used to worth at Cravath, a very prestigious and lucrative NYC law firm. I suspect they knew exactly what they were doing when they wrote the offer letter. If it was just a good-faith mistake, they could have done the right thing and granted me the options I earned. They chose not to.*

*Placing my trust in LoanStreet was a costly mistake. If you're reading this, please don’t be fooled by the Series B funding or the impressive pedigrees of the leaders; this place is a fraudulent, exploitative mess and you have a good chance of being fired within a year.*

*CEO Ian Lampl is the ringleader of this racket, but Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu, CTO Larry Adams and the rest of leadership are his spineless sycophants. They either agree with Lampl's despicable abuses of his employees or are too cowardly to stand up for what's right.*

*This group will twist employees’ arms to post positive reviews after they see this one, just like they have in the past, but this review is the real story and just the tip of the iceberg, given LoanStreet's practice of paying fired employees to sign permanent non-disparagement agreements.*

*You deserve to be treated with dignity. Work elsewhere.*

**Advice to Management**

*Your exploitation of people is disgusting. Look in the mirror and ask yourselves how your loved ones would feel if they knew that you cheat people just to make your big piles of cash a little bigger*",2021-06-19 16:20:34
ouk1at,Pay attention to what's going on with Blizzard,"Hey guys - if you have the time, take a minute to read a couple of the anecdotes of women who worked at Blizzard, [here](https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srp3fb) and [here](https://wtbrecognition.blogspot.com/2021/07/my-experiences-at-blizzard-entertainment.html?m=1).

This sub trends young and trends male, so to that audience, I want to warn you all how easy it is to become acclimated to a culture, even a toxic one.  

When I was 22 I started working for a company that was an acquired startup of almost all men and a handful of women.  It didn't have the problems that Blizzard has - it was far from ""frat boy"" - it was more Office Space-esque cynicism.  It affected me far more than I realized, because as a young professional, I sought approval from my older peers and bosses.  I wanted to *fit in*, so I behaved the way they did.  And it hurt me personally and professionally.  I was completely blind to it at the time, but in hindsight, I was surrounded by bitter, jaded, poisonous people, and I became that way myself.

I know it seems slimy to call the perpretrators at Blizzard victims too, but many of them are, because work does that to you.  When you spend 40 hours a week for years on end with a group of people, their behavior and attitudes (aka, their culture) *will* affect you, no matter how hard you think it won't.

Don't let that happen to you.  If you find yourself at a company that tolerates anything even approaching the way Blizzard let its male employees treat its female employees, do something about it, or quit, or both.  I know the market is tough and that's easier said than done, but even if your conscience doesn't demand it, guilt by association is a real thing.  Blizzard was an amazing name on your resume until about a week ago.  Now it's a liability.

If there's one explanation for the Blizzard debacle, it's that evil perpetuates when good men do nothing.

EDIT: To be clear - I'm not blaming the victims here, nor am I suggesting perpetrators are blameless.  I am warning you to steer clear of situations that might require you choose between your conscience or your job.  If you are forced to make the wrong choice too many times, it could have negative, lasting effects on you.",2021-07-30 12:54:01
lja3lc,Please take care of your body,"It bothers me so much when I see all the people at work all frail and hunched over at their desks. I get you are supposed to work hard for the company but not at the expense of your health. So many colleagues with diabetes and high blood pressure, sheesh. Please exercise regularly and eat healthy. Me personally, I exercise well but my diet is outta wack.  So even I have to work on this. CS careers lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Let’s fix this. Sending positive vibes. Peace out.",2021-02-13 21:46:49
rdn3z9,lnterview From Hell,"I just went through my Microsoft onsite for new grad and literally just had the worst interview experience of my life. Interviewer showed up with his camera turned off and wanted to go straight to coding. He gave me a question and I explained my approach and then he wanted me to solve it using a stack DFS instead of recursion, which I had never done before so I struggled a bit. I usually have some scratch paper in hand so I can visualize things, but he told me that I wasn't allowed to do that and to use the Codepair scratchpad. Later as I looked to the side to think for a second, he asked me ""why the fuck are you looking to the side"" (verbatim) and to focus on the screen, to which I apologized and kept going. He wasn't really angry, in fact he was laughing when he said it but at this point I was extremely uncomfortable and it was impossible to think through the problem. I was explaining my thought process and when I said something about popping a node from the stack he deadass replied ""Ayee pop it like it's hot"".

He then started getting impatient when I couldn't solve the problem and he started throwing out a lot of curse words in his hints (that weren't ever helpful) and then said ""C'mon you're a \[T10 uni\] student, show me some code"", which is probably one of the most demoralizing things I've been told. He ended it and asked me if I had any questions. I asked him how he liked Microsoft and he said you learn a lot but ""the pay is shit and the work is boring."" I thanked him for his time and he said yeah and dc'ed (this was the first interview of the loop). Got rejected the next day.

qc50hf,Please don't neglect your communication skills in favor of improving your leetcode skills,"One thing I found that doesn't appear enough on this SR is communication. I tend to see any variation of ""Is this offer good?"" or, ""Why do I have to grind leetcode?!"". Most of the on-the-job posts consist of ""I am in a toxic environment"" or ""Should I change jobs?""

I have a piece of career advice for anyone who is fairly new to the field that I think could prove helpful. 

First, a little about me as while I'm not going to hinder my anonymity I do feel I'm in a position where I can rightly prescribe advice to newer SE's / grads / those still school: I'm a Principal Engineer, and have a wide array of experience across operations (including release / implementation) as well as experience developing user-facing code, and internal tooling used organization-wide. I've worked in the DOD, networking space, e-commerce, and fin-tech. 

Jobs I've held include:

* Software engineer (senior/staff/principal)
* DevOps Engineer
* Lead DevOps engineer
* Lead Site Reliability Engineer
* Tech Lead
* Software Development Manager
* Director of Operations

One of the greatest skill deficiencies I see in engineers has always been communication. Communication is a very important part of our job. It allows us to promote our ideas, defend our solutions, play the Devil's Advocate, request help, refuse help, patronize others as well as compliment them. We can use communication to self-promote or self-deprecate. Communication literally sets us apart from every other species on this planet; that's not to say other species can't communicate, but that you won't see one chimpanzee explaining to another what the functional use of a blow-hole in Blue Whales is after explaining the nuances in their childrens' respective behavior while foraging for food. 

Here is a hard reality for many engineers: ***Even if you are the best software developer at your entire company, getting others (employees, external customers, internal customers) to actually use what you wrote is a different beast than writing a tool.***

Here is another hard reality: ***Many tasks rely on others to ""un-block us"". There are of course times when the blocker is stubborn enough that solid communication doesn't help, but solid communication never hurts.*** 

It's not uncommon for a developer to feel like a priority queue that relies on other priority queues which are poorly optimized, and plagued with race-conditions. 

Below are some points I'd like to make on the subject of communication:

**Being direct is not mutually exclusive with being polite**. I often find overtly rude people fall on the ""I'm just direct and straightforward!"" excuse as though it actually is an excuse for their rudeness. Consider different ways to say the same thing. This SR, and many others, while not inherently controversial (rudeness is often derived from controversial topics), is plagued with what I'd call ""direct rudeness"". Most of us who have posted here at one point or another have been faced with someone who disagreed but failed to do so in a way that made us feel any productive discussion was possible. 

Consider the following two versions of the same sentence (email threads I've actually witnessed, redacted of course):

>Hello \_\_\_\_\_, you are writing a tool that duplicates work done in a tool I've already written. You need to do a better job of communicating what you're working on so we aren't constantly creating duplicate work and wasting time.

However, consider had it been structured slightly differently:

>Hello \_\_\_\_\_, I noticed you're contributing to a tool which I found here(assume a link to source). I'd like to learn more about your specific needs and perhaps discuss whether $TOOL\_I\_ALREADY\_WROTE would fit them, and if not perhaps we could discuss continuing your thread of work towards enhancing the existing tool-set by adding any features you find it's lacking, as there is certainly some overlap. It'd be great if we could avoid duplicate efforts and enhance a tool that's already in use by the organization. Let me know your thoughts.

Both sentences communicate the same message, but the former puts the recipient on the defensive and immediately raises a few barriers in their mind. Upon receiving it they will be texting / chatting most of their close-colleagues about what a jerk you were. You turned your potential meeting on the topic into a street brawl instead of a discussion. Sometimes it can work out, but why cause additional stress? 

I'd argue that the second version of the sentence still gets the point across but puts the recipient and relative ease and opens a dialogue. To expand upon it a bit more in the second version we acknowledge that the recipient is writing a tool, and raise the concern on the overlapping functionality of that tool with an existing one. The purpose of the email is clearly stated as a goal; avoiding overlap. It's not an accusation but a goal and the use of 'we' puts a collective goal in the recipient's mind. Closing with ""Let me know your thoughts."" opens a dialogue whereas the over-directness of the first version never actually indicates any interest in a dialogue or common goal.

**Everyone is busy, even when they aren't.** We all need things from colleagues, and some colleagues are naturally more busy than others, and some seem like they're never actually working on anything. It's not our job as developers / individual contributors to judge another's workload (and if it is you should evaluate your company's situation). Many things are cyclical and you may be faced with situations where you need a thing done by someone you do not particularly enjoy working with. I have found strategies in communicating with such people that have been effective, for the most part. 

People love when you acknowledge ""how busy they are"" even when they aren't ever really busy from your perspective. Consider two people asking you for help:

>Hey \_\_\_\_, can you please do \_\_\_\_ for me? This is very urgent and blocking $IMPORTANT\_THING.

Consider that your $IMPORTANT\_THING isn't always their $IMPORTANT\_THING. Your emergency isn't always theirs. In a company that is unified it certainly should be, and we should all be empathetic and helpful when we can and have the bandwidth, but it's not always the hand we're dealt. Consider this slight change:

>Hey \_\_\_\_, I know you're really busy and I'm sorry to bother you! We have an urgent ongoing issue and I'd really, really appreciate it if you could take some time to look!

Keep in mind these are all suggestions and things that have worked for me, but I've had much better luck with using the second version over the first. To reiterate: People love to appear busy. Especially at work. I don't know what it is about perpetually being busy, but it's a badge of honor in our work culture and to not be busy is to not be relevant. ***Also keep in mind that you yourself are not a metric by which to judge people. If you put in 80 hours a week at your salaried job, that's your prerogative. Do not hold that expectation of others.***

**Strong opinions are still opinions.** This one is very relevant in our field as there are many subjects which are inherently based on opinions which draw a lot of controversy. Spaces vs tabs, programming syntax, which language to use, which tools to use, log formatting, etc.. Sometimes we're opinionated about the problems that need to be solved. Do they need to be solved? What's the reason we're solving it?

Always be self-aware of when you're prescribing your opinion vs. when you're prescribing factual-based information. Pick your battles. If you like tabs, and the project uses spaces, that is not the battle to pick. It's not even really worth a mention unless you can do it without being a jerk. If you want to prescribe your strong opinions onto others then be prepared to back up why you wish to do so.

I recommend being objective, always. Do not make statements that cannot be backed up with other objective statements and explanations.

Identify why you're so strongly opinionated. Can you present your opinion in a way which shows it derives some mutual benefit?

Sometimes one opinion can be stronger than another opinion but this is usually rooted in **facts or history.** For example, the spaces vs. tabs talk is inherently based on opinion. If you walk into a project which uses tabs, and you are a spaces person, you ***do not just reformat the whole project to spaces. This will only make you appear to be an asshole.*** This is also a case where your ***opinion is wrong. Not in that one is superior to the other, but the fact that now when I run a diff in SCM across to revisions, you just created a shit-ton of change where there actually was none, making debugging harder and all because you felt your opinion was superior.*** 

**In closing -** I just wanted to possibly help some others in their communication style by providing some examples where I saw what I'd consider communication miss / failure, and examples that have personally worked wonders for me. I'm open to any additional input / advice / suggestions that could help others, as well, including if you want to indicate anywhere you disagree with the things I've said and make suggestions I might not have considered.

Just always be aware that if you aren't communicating at your job, something is wrong. If you aren't communicating ***effectively*** then you are going to hit unnecessary hurdles in your career; a career that is inherently difficult to navigate given the constant churn on technological advancement / changes. I highly recommend any new engineer to host as many lunch and learns, and project demos as they can (code you wrote, tools you wrote, etc..) to improve these skills early in their career, as it will pay massive dividends in the years to come. As for written communication, if you are communicating something that feels edgy / difficult, then sit on it for a bit and proof-read / reread it. Pretend you're the recipient and how you'd respond if you received it from yourself. Consider your relationship with the person you're sending to, and how they respond to and consume various types of communication. Always be learning about your peers and learn how to navigate their personalities in ways that increases your success without inhibiting theirs.

Well, my manager told me that it was a ""bad look"" for me to be taking PTO 2 months into the job, and that I had no need to take it this early.

qikbq1,"I'm a lead software engineer with 10 YOE, I just bombed a coding quiz with a very simple problem, it happens to everyone.","I'm currently a lead engineer at a F500 company.  Been at my current job for 4 of those 10 years.  I've worked at small startups to enterprise software company's.  I'd definitely consider myself ""senior"".


I just got to the 4th round of interviews for a new company, first was recruiter screen, then manager phone screen, then online coding assessment and finally this in person coding assessment.  I nailed the first 2 interviews as well as the take home coding assessment. 

Then came the live-coding session.  I was asked to solve a problem with an n-sized tic tac toe board determine whether X's won, O's won, nobody can win, or if we don't have enough data to determine if X or O has won.  

At the start I asked some clarifying questions then if I could use my IDE.  They said I had to use this browser version of essentially sublime text (no code completion, no auto formatting, etc).  I just froze, I was sitting starting at my two for loops and shitty code after about 30 minutes and realized I had no idea what I was doing in the moment.   I was talking through my thought process the whole time and the interviewers were just silent, it was awkward.  As soon as the interview ended and I thought more on the problem I realized like 3 solutions.

I've never bombed an interview this bad but I guess after 10 years I was due to bomb an interview eventually.  Really sucks and I know that interview wasn't representative of my skills, but it happens.

So, don't be upset if you freeze during interviews, it happens to everyone.

od4wu5,Stop asking if a CS degree is worth it if you are young and haven't started college yet,"I've noticed a lot of these posts over the last year and the theme seems to be fairly common...""I'm 16, 20, whatever"" + ""I don't want to go to college"" + ""I just want to start working"" + ""How do I get a job as a developer?""

Well, to be brutally honest, you probably won't. Yes, you can self teach yourself everything you need to know over 2-4 years, maybe 1 if you really cram, and you can build up a portfolio. So then what is your plan to get a developer job? You're going to nail the technical assessments? Ok, cool. How are you going to get the interviews? Your resume, assuming you put a lot of effort into making it look good, will always look like shit compared to even people who went to a boot camp let alone got a CS degree and are competing for that entry level job as well.

Look, it's no secret that college is overpriced, it's expensive, you won't learn specific job skills like React there, etc. etc. I get that plenty of people get into the industry without a CS degree. I'm one of them. However, I also was able to get dev experience at my old job and get a couple interviews because of having 1.5 YOE of dev experience to get my current job. My old job I only got because I have a bachelor and master's degree in a field that old job was interested in. Oh yeah, I sent out 200 applications and got 2 interviews. 1 offer. The interview that resulted in an offer came from a referral I got by dumb luck.

The thing is that theoretically you could teach yourself everything you need to know in far less than 4 years and for damn near free with all the resources out there. If you have never gone to college yet though, you're about to graduate HS, etc. though it just amazes me at the stupidity of the idea of not wanting to go to college and just take the easy way out. You're not taking the easy way out by eschewing college and a CS degree. You're taking the hard way out because you're going to be one of those baby turtles hatching on the beach and trying to make it to the water. A few will make it...most will get eaten.

If you want to roll the dice with your life and career, sure go for it, I guess you can always go to college after you most likely fail to get an entry level job self teaching yourself. The only cost to you is time which of course you'll never get back. I personally don't understand why you would intentionally try to sabotage your life though. As an aside, if you're older and thinking of breaking into the field at the age of 25, 30, 35, etc. don't worry about this comment. I'm 37 and just broke in a couple years ago myself. I do feel like I need to ""catch up"" in terms of career but it's fine. Time is indeed a very real cost though and should be considered when making important life decisions.

And to be clear, this is specifically directed at people who are of traditional college age, or about to be, who have no debt, kids, etc. getting in the way of them going to college. I just wanted to point out, as someone who is self taught themselves, that going the self-taught route is brutal as fuck and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

Edited to add: Some people seem to misunderstand the intent of this post. Not sure if I could have worded it better or their reading comprehension is terrible. At any rate, I'm not saying you're nothing or somehow ""less"" for not going to college. I'm saying that HR / recruiters will most likely filter out your resume for stronger resumes because the vast majority of your competition will have degrees and you won't. It has nothing to do with how good you are at development. It has everything to do with how qualified HR / recruiters think you are for the job posting they're trying to fill. It's common sense but enough people are questioning it that I guess I'll use a very simplistic example. 1 entry level job posting gets 600 applications. Very common thing to happen. Let's say 300 applications have CS degrees, 200 have boot camp certs, 100 are self taught. They want to pick 20 or 30 to interview. Why even look at the self taught? Hell it may be tough for the boot camp certs to get interviews. From the standpoint of trying to find candidates, most likely they'll pull the best looking 20-30 resumes from the CS degree applicants. It just is what it is.",2021-07-03 19:43:00
r67an5,"Fired on my 5th day because I asked a ""basic question"" on my 4th day.","About me: 21F, I have roughly a little less than a year worth of experience as a dev. Bootcamp graduate. Based in the UK.

**How the interview process went:**

* CEO: \*is impressed by resume, thinks I'll be a great fit
* Lead dev: \*Asks me some React questions - I answer them. Asks me if I know Redux and I said no.
* Lead dev: \*Gives me a React challenge which is apparently one of the features of their product. I finish it and add some extra features I think will make the app have a better user experience.
* CEO a few days later \*says lead dev was really impressed by my work

I get an offer. I am very happy. **The lead dev seems extremely nice and tells me to ask him any question whenever I might need help or get stuck.**

Day 1 - Day - 3: I see that the codebase is really messy. Some parts use JavaScript, some use TypeScript. Some use class components, some use functional components. Some files are extremely massive which can be broken down into smaller components/chunks. I was already told that they hired lousy devs in the past and that the codebase is trash now. I am given to implement some design changes for the login, sign up and a forgot password page. It's my first day and I dunno where is what, I make some simple changes on my own branch. Second and third day, I am almost done. Just some design tweaks here and there.

These 3 days I asked the lead dev lots of questions, most were on git as I was struggling to rebase my branch off of development and merging with development instead of master. He happily helped me and in some cases he told me to problem solve it on my own, which I successfully did.

Day 4: I have to make two components interact with each other and from the codebase it wasn't obvious to me that they are parent-child. Even though I dunno Redux, I thought that is possibly the only way to implement the interaction. I ask the lead dev about it (previously he told me before my first day that he will give me a crash course on it) and he said **we'll jump on a call soon** (we work remotely) - so ***he*** **offered to help**.

He sees the problem and lets me realize that they are parent child, and so I can just pass props (no prop drilling required). I had to pass the prop from child (written as function) to parent (written in class) and I got a bit confused and asked him what will be the best way to tackle it - he says \`${myName} that's very basic\`. I realize its probably a dumb question and asked him not to worry about it and that I'll figure it out.

**NOTE**: I know I'm expected to know React, which I do and would have solved this on my own - just got slightly confused and since we were already on a call and I have been told before that I can ask for help whenever I need, I went ahead and asked it. As you know I was initially expecting some Redux topics to get knowledge on and how it has been used on the codebase.

Day 5: Starts with a meeting, where the CEO says that the lead dev said that I ask a lot of questions that I can just ""google"". The lead dev said I asked a very basic question and that I don't know how to pass props. Funny thing? - the feature I worked, I literally made an extra component myself to keep my files cleaner. The component is of course reusable and can be used throughout the codebase. So I respectfully told him that if I didn't know how to pass props I couldn't have created the component and used it.

He didn't reply to that and just closed of saying I wouldn't be a good fit. He further added something like, ""Ik I said, you can ask for help/ask questions. Well that isn't quite true"". I was shocked.

P.S: Worst thing about this experience? The first 3 days of my work, I had 3 interviews (one with a *very* big company). When I got the job, I cancelled interviews with all 3.",2021-12-01 05:24:13

In my [last post](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oz52ww/just_got_fired_what_to_do_next/) I had been fired for a very minor company policy infraction at a larger company.  As an update, I found another job pretty quickly with a small company, but that turned out to be kind of a nightmare.  It motivated me to hit the books and study hard for another round of interviews, which helped me land a great new gig!  I went from making $110k TC at the company that fired me to $205k TC at my new gig!  And it's all remote, so I don't have to move!  It's been a sucky few months, but everything worked out in the end.

l6evby,Software Engineer 3 Years of Experience - My Path to from 77k TC to 300k+ (70 LC),"Hey all - just accepted an amazing offer with a great company and I wanted to share my interviewing experience over the course of the last two months! This post is to serve as a recap for me, and a source of information for you all who are in similar spots. And as always...a little bit of a humblebrag. I'm happy to answer any questions for anybody who has them.  

My first job out of school was for 77k, my second job was 140k -> 165k after a promotion, and my third job is over 300k now.

Here are my interview stats from this interview run. Each step marks where the process ended for me, either by being denied or by ending the process myself.

**Offers:** 

1. Microsoft
2. Bay Area Tech Startup 
3. Capital One

**On-sites:** 

1. Amazon (cancelled due to offer)
2. Google (cancelled due to offer)
3. Spotify (cancelled due to offer)
4. Attentive (denied)

**Tech Phone Round/Take-home Round:** 

1. Hudson River Trading
2. Robinhood
3. Oscar Health
4. Capsule
5. Audible
6. Datadog
7. LinkedIn
8. Peloton 

**Recruiter Phone Screen Round:** 

1. Roblox
2. Blend
3. Palantir
4. Candid

**No Interview After Cold Apply/Referral:** 34 companies including Uber/Lyft/FB/Twitter  

And of the above, below are the companies I got referrals to versus the companies I got in through a recruiter (they reached out to me/I reached out to them)

**Referrals:** Facebook, Microsoft, Linkedin, Twitter, Peloton, Spotify

**In Through Recruiter:** Google, Amazon, Palantir, Candid, Capital One, Attentive, Instacart, Audible, Datadog

***Offer Details:***

I accepted an offer from one of the companies I got an offer from. My base is 170k, stock is 150k yearly. 

***Key Things Learned***:

1. No matter who you are, it's a numbers game at the end of the day. Don't take things personally, and do as many interviews as you possibly can 
2. Network, network, network. I kept a list of former teammates and companies they left for, people I've met online through various forums who work at big companies, IRL friends who work at big companies, etc etc. And when I went to interview, I hit all of them up and asked for a referral. It was a crucial part of the process
3. Time your process well. I interviewed with a bunch of ""sub-tier"" companies to get real world practice after I was done with Leetcode/mock interviews/other practice. I had my Capital One and Attentive onsites before any important ones, and they were crucial in my later onsites. Case in point, I failed my first onsite (Attentive) but passed my next 3 
4. For practicing Leetcode, quality > quantity. I did about 70 Leetcodes spread across graphs, trees, dynamic programming, string puzzles, array puzzles, linked lists, LRU cache/binary search/hash map from arrays type questions, etc. If you can't pick up on the general patterns by then, you should work on your approach and question quality
5. Work on your resume. Go on resume review sites and pay for reviews. Post every week in this subreddit. It's important
6. Know your language. Practice/document all syntax things you will need to do all types of questions. Don't let this be the thing that fails you 
6. Document all of your Leetcode studying/DS Algo studying/behavorial answer prep in Google drive or something.  Here are my documents:

I highly recommend making stuff like this yourself. It is super helpful in staying organized, keeping stuff fresh and committed to your mind, and it will always be there next time you interview :)

mjlhr0,"This week marks one year since the day I was fired out of nowhere, and now I make more money than the guy who fired me","This is mostly a spite post, but I was also at the lowest point of my life 365 days ago, and it'd be neat if I could help even one person who's in the same position I was a year ago.

My first job out of college paid $71k in LCOL area. That's the median salary for new SWEs in that city, and I always saw myself as an average person, so I was happy with the median. The company had kind of a bad reputation for giving horrible raises, to the point where new software engineers often made more than ones who'd been there for a few years--because offers for new employees kept up with the market, but raises didn't (A salary for a senior SWE was around $78k, only about 10% more than I was making as a new grad). They also had a nasty penchant for laying off senior engineers and replacing them with busloads of recent college grads. But my plan was to just leave before I became a senior. I was a new grad without a lot of experience so I guess I just didn't think it through.

I graduated January 2020, worked there for a few months until early April 2020, and got positive feedback literally up until the week before I was fired. No one ever communicated to me that I had done anything to put my employment in danger. When I was fired, my manager brought up that I had left work 7 minutes early a month beforehand, and that I had merged my branch into master on Github instead of doing it through the command line *on my literal first day on the job.* It might also be worth pointing out that I'm a woman and that another person from my team was fired that day, also a woman. I don't know if it was a coincidence or not.

In retrospect, I think this was effectively a layoff. I didn't really see it that way at the time. I kept thinking that I must be so bad at my job if I thought I was doing well but then ended up getting fired. I suffer from low self confidence, and this didn't exactly help.

I managed to get a new job 2 weeks later, making a bit more money in a similar COL area. I excelled at the new company and was given a 4% raise at my performance review, plus a 3.5% bonus. Meanwhile my friends at the old company were telling me that their performance reviews were pushed back multiple times, and when they finally got their raises, they barely even outpaced their rising health insurance costs.

Now that it's been about a year, I decided to start job searching and just signed a 6 figure offer. I never pictured myself making 6 figures, much less that I'd be making that much a mere 18 months after I graduated college. My confidence is at an all-time high, I feel *good* about myself as an engineer for possibly the first time in my entire life, and I'm excited about what the future holds for me.

The absolute cherry on top is that the average salary for a manager at my previous company is around $90k. I don't just make more than the guy who fired me; I make a *lot* more. Hell, I make more than I likely ever would've made at that company, even if I'd worked there my whole life.

The message I hope anyone struggling takes away from this is that no one manager or company can define your value! Getting fired was the absolute best thing that ever happened to me. I really don't know how much time I would've wasted in that horrible, toxic environment before I got it together and left on my own. I can't believe the difference 365 days can make, and I'm so, *so* grateful that I didn't let my old manager destroy my confidence.",2021-04-04 00:54:43
o8zdqu,"These tech ""influencers"" are the reason why you don't have a job in the tech industry","I've been in the tech market as a Data Scientist in Silicon Valley enough to recognize that at this point, tech ""influencers"" in Youtube, MOOCs, Kaggle, etc. are now the ones preventing entry level applicants from getting their first technical job in the tech industry. Now bear in mind what I see is in the Data field, but I think I can abstract it out to the software field as a whole.

These people give the worst and just purely wrong advice you can imagine in the tech industry and profit off of the naive young applicants who make up majority of the scammer's audience. For instance, in the data field, all these ""experts"" claim that a lifecycle of a data science project in industry ends with heavy Machine learning solutions. Anyone who has successfully derived meaningful value out of data science in their company knows that this is absolutely the wrong approach to project management and project scoping. But the young inexperienced ones listen to these advices when most of these ""experts"" and ""influencers"" haven't worked in the field in a long time.

I don't know if it's fair to mention names, but we all know who these people are: Jo. Tech, S. Raval. These ""influencers"" run down stream to lesser influential people on medium/towardsdatscience.com/etc. who again have little experience in industry themselves but are pumping out garbage content that sounds deceivingly attractive with hot words like ""edge computing"", ""deep reinforcement learning"", when only a tiny fraction in the industry actually uses these tech. I know, working in an AI automation company myself.

So why do they to this? It's painfully clear; they just want to sell courses or make money on medium.  They are only interested in their own brand, they have little of your own interest. How can you tell? How can you distinguish legitimate content from illegitimate content? By this simple trick; if there's something they would lose if their words are found inaccurate, you know it's illegitimate content.

This is what I mean. I mentor Berkeley/Stanford students all the time, being an Alma Mater in there. If my advice to them on finding employment turns out to be wrong, I have little if not nothing to lose. Because I have nothing to gain whether or not my advice turns out to be correct. But that's not the case for these ""influencers"". This is what I mean. If their advice turns out to be wrong, it has implications on their revenue, their branding, their ability to sell courses.

I suppose why I find this so frustrating is that these snake oil salesmen are giving all the wrong advices for their own ridiculous brands and money making schemes which puts young aspirants and their career prospects to jeopardy. They say they're being moral and altruistic and actually caring about the people who are having difficult time getting jobs, when they're just abusing and taking advantage of the naïveté. I experienced this personally, when I wrote something very minor on subreddit long ago about basically how business intuition is very important in the data field, and all these commenters lashed out at me in droves, saying ridiculous things like ""project design"" in a term I apparently made up since they haven't heard of it from the course-peddlers (wat the f?)

These influences have real-life effects. I interview data scientists/analysts all the time for my company, and these applicants basically say/do the same thing that I hear from these influencers, such as applying ML methods to non-ML problems just because it's ""cool"", they took courses on it, etc. It's such a turn off and a clear signal that these people have been taught the wrong things in their MOOCs, self-taught journey.

My suggestion for young applicants is that rather than listening to these ""influencers"" online, reach out to actual Data Scientists/programmers/etc. who have been in the industry for a long time and ask them directly about the market. They're usually happy to dispense advice, which I can guarantee are much more sound and solid.

**Edit: I actually don't mind Tech Lead as much as others here. I know he's had issues with CSDojo and other youtubers. That part sucks. But his rants about the ridiculousness of the tech industry is pretty spot on. I actually don't mind Jo Tech's new videos too, they're pretty funny. But their courses, yea that's the crap I'm talking about. I haven't taken Clement's courses, don't know, but  just be careful about people in general who's more interested in their own brands than you.**

**Andrew Ng, he's interesting I find him both part of the problem and the solution. He's definitely course-peddling obviously and sells the dream to thousands of young data hopefuls when obvious getting DL certifications from Coursera is NOT going to get them a job. Or be actually used at work unless you have a Phd. But Ng's general wisdom on integrating AI to companies in SaaS or manufacturing is extremely valuable.**

**The ones I'm mostly frustrated about are these writers on towards data science or linkedin** **or youtube who have huge influence as a content-promoter but who has never really worked as a Data Scientist. Some of people are like A. Miller, who never actually worked as a Data Scientist, or those who come from Semi-conductor background but somehow call themselves as a Data Scientist. I've also seen interns who've never worked full time giving advice on Data Science. That sh%t is ridiculous.**

okdb1o,[UPDATE] Something I have to get off my chest,"This is an update to a post I made about 3 months ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mq2q2m/something\_i\_have\_to\_get\_off\_my\_chest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mq2q2m/something_i_have_to_get_off_my_chest/)

One correction on that previous post: he's definitely mid-level, not junior. While he's only been with our company just shy of 2 years, he's got about 8 years total industry experience. I apologize for incorrectly listing him as junior.

I went on my 2 week vacation about a month ago. Like I said, I was completely incommunicado for the duration and it was the absolute best thing for my health, both mentally and physically. I spent the first week hiking and camping, and the second just home taking care of little projects that I had been neglecting.

When I got back, all hell broke loose. Apparently there was an MQ issue that caused customer updates to not make it into our system for about 4 hours. Before I left, I created a detailed wiki entry that detailed how to deal with this exact situation, including screenshots and step-by-step guidance on how to resolve the issue. I also sat down with him and went line by line through the wiki and validated that he had the appropriate access to the various systems needed to resolve the issue. I also stickied a link to the wiki, which contained various other troubleshooting steps for other common issues, in Slack. He apparently forgot all about it and eventually someone from the Ops team did a search, found the wiki, and resolved the problem in about 5 minutes.

But that's not all! There was also an issue that caused one of our test environments to go down. Instead of taking a look or maybe engaging the Ops team to resolve, he just ignored it. Problem is, the CI/CD pipeline won't deploy to higher environments unless the lower ones pass, so not only was code not deployed to UAT, but we missed a production deployment deadline. I also looked in JIRA and no progress whatsoever was made on any of his tickets. I'm not sure what he did in those 2 weeks, but working wasn't it.

I had a meeting with my boss and he wasn't pleased. They tried messaging me on Slack, sending me emails, and calling me, but again I was completely off the grid. I explained to him everything I did to get this developer up to speed, but it fell on deaf ears. He mentioned this was going in my performance review and that I'd be docked on my yearly bonus.

That last bit flipped a switch in my head and I decided to reach out to an old recruiter friend and he quickly got me in touch with another company. It's larger than my current outfit and offers better pay, benefits, and perks. Oh, and I can also work remote 100%, which is great because the company is 2 states away. I'm putting in my 2 weeks notice this Friday. I don't want to deal with this management and this situation any more, and frankly, I don't have to.

ofa0of,I got brain cancer. Should I give up my internship..?,"I was supposed to intern at a FAANG company this summer, but I recently found out that there was something abnormal in my brain MRI result. I postponed the internship to the latest possible date and got a surgery to find out what it exactly is. Turns out, I have cancer at the age of 21. One consolation in sadness is that the tumor is very small and they think that the whole chemo process would take about only 4 months. However, I won’t be able to meet the starting date for the internship anymore. I worked really hard and have been looking forward to this…. The question is do I tell the company about my situation honestly and ask if they could save me a spot for next summer, or do I just forfeit it? I’m worried that telling them that I have cancer would give me disadvantages when I try to get a full-time job. Does anyone have any ideas about this? Thank you..

EDITED : 

Hey guys, I don't know how to show my appreciation for all the support/advice and heartwarming comments.. Never have I ever thought I would get so much love and comfort from strangers on Reddit. I couldn't reply to every comment since there were too many, but I did just finish every single one of them and gathered some commonly asked questions to answer!

&#x200B;

* Don’t do the internship, take care of your health first
   * I won't be doing the internship during the chemotherapy. Of course, health comes first to me as well, I just wanted to decide whether or not I should tell them about my cancer and ask for a spot next year, since I thought maybe telling them about my cancer could affect me later on when I look for jobs.
* Can’t you work during your chemo?
   * I'm currently outside the country where my family is, and I'll be getting the necessary treatments here. So even if I wanted to, I wouldn't be able to... unless they allow remote working from outside of US.
* Props to op for making this fake sob story up
   * thanks
* How did you know you had cancer? any symptoms?
   * Lots of people were asking this. I didn't feel too comfortable sharing this at first, but I got so much support and advice from you guys so... My tumor is near the pituitary gland, and I was suffering from Diabetes Insipidus, where you drink a shit ton of water(crazy thirsty) and pee every 20-30 minutes since your brain doesn't release the hormone that prevents diuretic action.(ofc I didn't know what it was for like 10 months) I got blood tests and urine tests several times, but everything came out normal. The doctor could suspect that it is Diabetes Insipidus only after I brought it up. Then, Brain MRI and PET scan, and biopsy to find out what it is.
* Did you remove the tumor during the surgery?
   * No, the surgery was solely for biopsy.
* Do doctors think you’re going to make a full recovery?
   * Yes, I was diagnosed with Germinoma, with a very small tumor size too. They think it would take 2-3 times of chemotherapy and 6 weeks of radiation therapy. around 4 months of treatments
* Work on side projects/learn if you can
   * I thought I was finally done with side projects after securing an internship but I'll try to work on side projects and do more leetcodes..
* Plus you now get to look like Jeff Bezos
   * Fuck.
* Beware of the laws around cancer and disability
   * This is probably really important to know.. Does anyone know where I could find more information about this?

Anyways, thank you so much everyone once again. Also, I really appreciate everyone who messaged me to give help/advice. I just emailed the company to connect me to an HR person so that I can stay in touch with him/her to discuss some health issues. I'm a young healthy big boy, and like many of you guys have said, I will kick this tumor shit out of my brain ASAP and keep you guys updated. Feel free to ask any questions about cancer or whatever here and I'll be more than happy to answer them. Sending love and huge hugs to everyone!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥",2021-07-07 02:41:06
lwgjwm,"I don't care how smart you are, one thing I've learned is that if you're bad at explaining things (even things you understand perfectly) to someone else, you will never succeed as much as someone who can.

Just a reminder to everyone out there, if you're not feeling valued, PLEASE look elsewhere. I keep reading about people who want to stay at their current company but want a raise.. it mostly doesn't work that way. You shouldn't be married to your company if they don't value you.

m37oyl,how to deal with a co-worker who works 16 hours a day and makes the rest of us look like lazy bums? We simply refuse to throw our lives and health away to keep up with his absurd pace,"We are a team of 4, the 3 of us have a healthy working schedule, except....*him* We will call him Z. Z is becoming a catalyst which may lead to us getting fired. Z finishes his tickets/features in 3 days, these are tickets which require at least 2-3 weeks of programing. He does this by working insane hours, literally all day and night almost. He sends us messages at 4am with his new design and would completely disregard the design we worked on as a team, he would go to the managers during the morning reviews/briefs and tell them 

>""I cannot proceed to the next story/feature because the other 3 havent completed their part yet"" 

We are at our wits end, even our lead hates this guy, makes all of us look like fucking lazy bums. We cannot go to HR because HR protects the company and this guy is producing at an insane pace so they will always take his side even if its unhealthy. we literally do not know what to do and are all secretly looking for a different job since we refuse to go with this absurd situation. Our dev lead talked to him about how this is unsustainable and even though hes productive, he will burn out. He just shrugged all of our advice and told us to mind our business.

mnnogu,My entire job is bullshit. Do I just play along?,"I work for a federal agency where we don't do any real work. Every work day is just spent sitting in meetings where we ""review"" projects that our consultants put together. Everyone on the team has job titles like ""computer scientist"" and ""data scientist"" but none of them actually have any real knowledge about their respective fields. Every meeting is a two hour long cringe-fest where everybody takes turns spouting nonsense while using big words and buzzwords that don't actually mean anything.

The hilarious thing is that even the consultants and contractors are clearly bullshitting. They can obviously tell that none of the feds actually understand any of the material, so they just use the same powerpoint slides every week with slight changes made, babble on for a couple hours, dropping the same buzzwords while the feds nod their heads like play along. 

No actual work gets done here. I've been with the agency for almost a year and we're still ""running iterations"" and ""refining our models"". There's a policy letter that we've probably spent hundreds of hours in meetings on and we still haven't even drafted a page worth of material yet. 

So here's the problem. My boss is getting upset about my lack of participation in the bullshit meetings. It also feels a bit demeaning and even shameful to do absolutely nothing at work like this. I'm still very early in my career. Should I try to find something else or should I just learn to bullshit and be grateful for an easy job?",2021-04-09 18:37:16

qp0fdt,"Observation: A lot of popular advice on this sub can be overly bitter, cynical, and if not borderline toxic.","As someone who have done 10+ years of IC work and is now in management, through tiny startups and unicorns and multiple FAANG companies, I have to say it's really concerning how absolutely awful some of the highly upvoted advice/suggestions here can be.

I've noticed the trend for when someone asks a question for how they should proceed to handle a tough/less-than-ideal situation they are in, very often the most cynical, hostile or sometimes downright *malicious* answers are also the most upvoted. I understand the appeal of ""justice boner"" against bad bosses or coworkers and how cathartic it can be to dick slap everyone in the room and then set the room on fire when you are frustrated, but very often the *feel good* thing to do is not the *right* thing to do.

I agree there are a lot of assholes in the industry, and there *are* a ton of shitty companies out there with toxic work culture. I've had my own shares of WTFs throughout my career. But that's just life, and I try not to let the assholes I meet in life to turn myself into an asshole as well. I also definitely do not assume the next person I meet will be an asshole just because the last person I met was one. My personal experience tells me most people are not sociopaths and they will treat you similarly in how you treat them. And if you've had a career where *everyone* was being unhelpful, cynical or even hostile toward you, then maybe do some introspection and figure out if you've caused some of that. 

Considering most of this sub are people who are in school or just started their career, it's really concerning how the sub paints the whole software engineering industry as a dog-eat-dog, everyone dislikes everyone, employees vs. employers death match zero sum game. The reality is there are a ton of people who can use your help and would in-turn help you as well if you just give them benefit of the doubt. 

I'm a little bit emotional on this issue because personally **I've fucked up a ton** throughout my career, but I often had people who went out of their way to help me, give me feedback and benefit of the doubt and helped me improve and get over and learn from my screw ups. That's why I strive to do the same for others these days. If everyone treated me the same way people advice others on this sub, I would be in a pretty bad place right now.

Obviously very often things won't go your way, and the best attempts can go to waste. But you should still try to affect things for the better. 

**Edit**: One final point, people *can* change. Case in point: When I joined a <10 ppl Y-Combinator startup, I was 25 years old and I was the oldest person in the company. The CEO/CTO were great and smart guys, but had the management experience and emotional maturity as you'd expect from most early-20 somethings. We made a ton of mistakes in product, business, and engineering alike, and at one point I was *fired* from the company because I introduced a bad bug in the code base.

But guess what, instead of writing them off as ""toxic dumb managers"" we kept in touch and remained friends since and we were able to view in retrospective at some of the dumb decisions we all made. They both ended up growing a ton personally and professionally and did very well in their subsequent companies and I even raised money from one of them for a successful startup, and I'll be doing the same again for my next one.",2021-11-07 23:14:10
kxok9g,FINALLY GOT AN OFFER!!! YEAYYY!!!,"Graduated last year with a CS degree. July 2020 to be exact.Since then till today, I have applied to 370 jobs and HECKIN FINALLY got an offer today! God is great! I guess I got a total of 10-20 interviews. Reached till the last round of 3. Make a list of all the companies you apply to! I mainly used Glassdoor, Indeed and LinkedIn to find jobs.

A little about me: I'm based in Vancouver, Canada and the job is remote. Which is great because I can't afford a car. I've no past internship/work experience. I learned React because I like front-end and also coz i needed to fill my resume with projects lol. Learned Postgres as well. Refined my skills on data structures and algorithms.

It was inspiring to see so many of you get jobs, it really motivated me that if I just keep trying my day will come as well, and all thanks to Almighty it did. Fully agree that it's just a numbers game and you need to just apply, apply and apply AND constantly update your resume if you keep making better/impressive projects + improve your coding skills. Also make your resume one page. Highlight key features. Make sure recruiters can spot all key things on your resume with one easy glance. If you've LinkedIn Premium try messaging recruiters/CEOs (yes I even messaged CEOs lol, you've NOTHING to lose - worst case they ignore you). One CEO to my surprise, was even kind enough to get back to me. 

My prep days these last 5-6 months since I graduated was 90% working on projects/learning new tech stacks/polishing resume and 10% applying to jobs. Had loooong days, working almost the full day 0930/1030 am till 7-8 pm. After that I relaxed, had a chill dinner and watched Lost till I go to bed at 11/1130 pm.

A little nervous tho because I really wanna excel at the company, do well and contribute a lot. So if any of you have any advice on how to not feel nervous during the initial days and be confident - I'll appreciate it!

To everyone who's still applying and looking for jobs, fam YOUR DAY WILL COME GOD WILLING! Keep working hard/keep polishing your resume and you'll get that job!

Like you're reading my success story today, I'll be reading yours *soon*! ;)

PS: if possible and if you're religious try to pray, it keeps you humble, calm and peaceful.",2021-01-15 06:10:43
m3geg8,"Kinda sadistic, but I am enjoying it.","I am at this very moment living the days that so many of us only dream of. 

The joy of seeing people (who took your efforts, skills and work ethic for granted) genuinely struggle and suffer.

The story:
I having been working at my current company for 3 years now. I learnt everything about my process in my early days because I wanted to, and not because someone told me to.

My early efforts made me very good at my job. This led to the manager to believe that my job is very easy.

Cut to covid times, and all the core members except me had left the company. The manager hired all new peeps, and even a new TL. It was kinda insulting that they hired someone from outside to be my TL even though I had more experience in this process.

During the lockdown, after giving all the new members initial training, I asked everyone to keep going through the code, this will raise many queries and to please bring those queries to my attention. During the 9-10 months I didn't receive even 1 query from any of them. They all had been basically enjoying their ""honeymoon"". Being paid for doing nothing.

Still, I didn't mind, coz I was more in contact with my client than my manager. And I enjoyed the work. 

Problem began when the new TL started to ""act like TL"". He would join in on calls that didn't directly concern him. Ask me about updates on particular tickets which he didn't know anything about. He would speak out of turn in the daily stand-ups in front of clients, and then in private would try to pin it on me when he got an egg to the face for saying something stupid in the stand up.

So, what none of them knew was I had been busy this whole lockdown upskilling. Got my AWS certificate""S"", learnt and built practice projects on Spring and React.

Cut to last month. I received an offer from a pretty big company with a 200% hike (because I was already being way underpaid according to industry standards).

I issue my resignation, and my manager basically scoffs at me. His whole air was like ""what you do isn't difficult, you're easily replaceable"". A couple of weeks go by and I had been slowly taking myself out of the operations. Letting the other guys handle the client calls and work tickets. 

And then yesterday it happened. My manager calls me. Starts talking bs crap like how I have been holding up during the covid. Trying to make small talk. I test it like any other conversation and talk to him casually. After about 5 mins of pointless blabbering, he says, he'll counter the other offer and with a 20% hike. I politely declined it. Told him it's time for me to see the outside world. He ends the conversation abruptly in visible frustration. I have told my TL that I am happy to address any queries while I am still there. But the thing is, my notice period isn't long enough to cover the whole project(350k lines of code with a large chunk being legacy code, that has been there since 2008). And my TL knows it.

I am just endlessly giggling internally seeing them struggle just to have a productive conversation with the client. The client is clearly getting frustrated, my manager is under pressure from the client to get the issues fixed and my TL is just in a very sad place. This makes me happy. It's sadistic, I know. But I am just a human.



TL;DR
Enjoyed my work. Made it look effortless. Manager thought my job is very easy. Was overlooked for promotion and never got a decent raise. Issued my resignation, now they're suffering trying to figure out how the hell I was doing it.

Edit:
MY GOD!! never thought my post would get this much attention. Everyone here has made me feel even happier.

Edit: Addressing the other side.
I see that some aren't as approving of my post as others. To them, I would like to say thank you for bringing the other side of the coin into perspective. I assure you all, my intention was never to put anyone in a difficult situation. I just took a better job, everything else just happened by consequence. I am sure the people who are negatively affected by my switch aren't intrinsicly bad people, but I also feel this was a lesson they all had to learn someday.",2021-03-12 12:19:12

ogc2kj,Just landed first junior software development role by going old-school and emailing local small to mid-sized software companies directly.,"I have had a terrible 5% success rate using indeed and linkedIn because there are just SO MANY applicants to jobs so mostly I get an email saying I have not been selected, so I tried a new approach...

When I reached out to local companies saying I was looking for a junior developer role around 50% said they would be open to taking on a junior developer or intern!

They all responded by saying something like either:

1. ""Yes, love your energy and enthusiasm and we have an opportunity for a junior dev or intern""
2. ""Great enthusiasm unfortunately we are not looking for a developer and/or our team is too small for an intern, good luck!""

I highly recommend emailing the software company you are interested in directly if they are a small to mid sized company by reaching them at their email that is usually in their contact page, if there is no contact email they have a form and just fill out something like:

""Hello <Insert Company Name> Team,

My name is AlienAlgen94 and I am a computer science <student/graduate/bootcamper/freelancer> and I am looking for a junior developer or software development intern role with <insert company name here>.

An email similar to the above email got me my current job and I got 3 other offers that I had to turn down because I picked the best one (hopefully haha).

Try it out, google:

software companies <target city>

then email each of the ones you are interested in (or all of them lol)

All the companies appreciated how direct and honest I was and it impressed all of them so I highly recommend this method for success finding an internship or junior dev role in 2021.

Good luck and happy coding careers!

&#x200B;

Edit: As mentioned in the comments feel free to leave out the ""money conversation"" entirely or until they are interested and have said yes they will take an intern or junior developer.

TLDR: 1. search ""software companies <your target city>"" 2. Email them directly with info like your resume, available start date, target pay rate, hours available and links to github and linkedin. 3. Watch as 50% of companies email you saying they are willing to take you as an intern or junior dev.",2021-07-08 17:30:48
qwthbl,I Did It. I Finally Found A Dream Position. No Internship Experience And Mid-30's Something Guy. Thank you for the help everyone!,"I feel this type of obligatory post for this subreddit, so here it is. A bit about myself, I returned to school for computer science in my 30's. I came from a healthcare background where I worked in the realm of physical therapy. I started school in 2018 and finished in 2021. Due to some circumstances, I could not get any internship experience, and I knew this was going to hinder me.

The process was tedious. There were 400 or so job applications. 200 LC questions, which I actually enjoyed and will continue to do them.  I worked on three different side projects. I received plenty bunch of ""We love your personality/enthusiasm, but we need someone with more experience.""  I eventually reached a point of stopping caring, or I was numb to the generic email rejection. When I achieved that mindset, things were much more freeing.

In the last few weeks, I casually entertained the hiring process with different companies and attended career fairs. In one career fair, I had some was quick banter with someone, and I was invited for an interview a few days later.  After that, I offered me an SRE position. I conditionally accepted it. They said it's fully remote, FT, full benefits, and unlimited PTO. There is room for me to move laterally and vertically.

They asked about my salary range, and I said I'd need to get back to them since I didn't research this topic much. After some research and discussion with other people in the field, I concluded on $80000 - $85000. They agreed.

A couple of days later, I got another call from a company that I interviewed with, and they offered me a $100000 full-stack role, but they have a hybrid working model. I asked them to give me a few days to decide.

With the help of this subreddit,  with the notion, ""It is okay to ask for more money. "" I decided that I would ask for a small salary bump from the original company. I asked them for $92500, to which they agreed.

Yes, I know this isn't FANG money, but I don't care. The position is entirely remote, with good benefits and good PTO. Furthermore, with no internship experience, I'd be a bloody fool to say no. As well, I confirmed this is more of a SWE engineering role that, DevOps, so I'll be writing code, which I'm excited for

The silly thing about this whole interview process for this company. . .I wasn't asked a single LC question.",2021-11-18 16:27:52

nork5y,I DON'T wanna be an asshole but I've had it with the new guy after 3 months,"So my company is fully remote right now. Recently (3 months ag) my boss, a smart and chill guy hired 4 new Data Scientists.

He wanted capable junior DS persons who would be starting a role where at least 1 year prior DS experience was the minimum requirement.

This new guy S, from day 1 annoyed me.

I was demoing some stuff I spent a couple of months working on and his commentary throughout my whole demo was saying things like, ""Oh yea, this looks easy"" or ""Nice work, yea I can definitely build something like this and fix those bugs you mentioned"".

My initial impression was that he was gonna be a hot-shot show-off and I was fine with that once he did his job. I knew once he started, he'd run into the same issues I did and learn to not prematurely say something is 'easy'.

Well, he was put on a different project for the first 6 weeks and my friend had NOTHING but complaints about him.

Saying his work ethic was horrible, how he'd disappear for entire days and then say, oh my slack wasn't working etc.

My colleague complained to the manager who gave him a stern warning and deducted pay for the missing days.

I assumed he'd buck up after that, **however for the last month he's been assigned to work with me.**

I have 3 other employees (2 from his batch that joined 3 months ago) who work under me.

This guy, wow it's ludicrous how annoying, inefficient, and how poor his communication has been.

I ask for daily updates, not even a meeting every day, just a tiny update. I've gotten 2 in the last month.

I called him Friday after getting no updates since Tuesday. His response was, ""Remember I told you slack doesn't send me notifications, so I didn't know I needed to update you. So yes, I'm still working on that API, i think I found a way to do it now, but getting the info I need is proving problematic"".

Mind you, he had a month to create a simple API that connected to a few a other APIs to collate, clean and standardize some data we needed. It should not take more than a day to do this.

It's been a month officially and he still has nothing to show expect ONE simply notebook of him using a similar API that someone already made. We can use that API but it's not free, so I asked him to make it for us.

What do I do? I've sent him resources, tutorials, gave him instructions on how to do it. 

I don't get updates, I don't get questions......all i get is him snickering about how he's making good progress.

&#x200B;

Now, it's partially my boss's fault for hiring him as my boss didn't want to do coding interviews. He said he trusted that someone who did a full CS master's Data Science degree would be capable enough.",2021-05-31 03:09:02
rsxs5r,Why people in StackOverflow is so incredibly disrespectful?,"I’m not a total beginner, I have 2 years of professional experience but from time to time I post in SO if I get stuck or whenever I want to read more opinions about a particular problem.

The thing is that usually the guys which answer your question always do it being cocky or just insinuating that you were dumb for not finding the solution (or not applying the solution they like).

Where does this people come from? Never experienced a similar level of disrespect towards beginners nor towards any kind of IT professional. 

I don’t know, it’s just that I try to compare my behavior when someone at the office says something stupid or doesn’t know how to do a particular task… I would never insinuate they are stupid, I will try to support and teach them.

There’s something in SO that promotes this kind of behavior? Redditors and users around other forums or discord servers I enjoy seem very polite and give pretty elaborated answers.",2021-12-31 16:40:04
mu0ny2,Candidate: If you don't provide a flexible working environment post pandemic I'm not working for you. Companies: *surprised Pikachu*,"My company has had major financial troubles since the pandemic began. So I've slowly been looking for work over the past few months. My wife works too and we live well below our means and have a lot in savings so there's no rush. 

What I've encountered is a lot of misleading job postings and/or offers regarding working remote vs. in office post pandemic. For example:

- Posts labeled as remote then in the description ""remote until after covid"". Bait and switch nonsense. 


- Companies already back in the office for months, well before vaccines. 5 days a week in the office was expected even though they did well with people working remotely. 


- Companies offering flex between in office and remote during the initial interviews, but backpedal as you interview further


-  One company who said ""your entire team has to determine whether or not you can work from home that day"". Yeah, because I want a committee to decide whether or not I can leave my wife home alone with a strange contractor who is working on the house that day. Fuck that. 

So some of these places I bailed early, and others I bailed after I got an offer and got the real truth in the final interviews. Their reaction was always the same, total shock that I would remove myself from contention or turn down an offer because I was unable to choose my working environment. Some even reached out to me twice and sent me surveys asking what happened (I never respond to these, they know already). 

Full disclosure, I just want flexibility to determine whether or not I want to be in the office that day, or remote, or full remote. Trust is an important part of any relationship, and right away if I don't have that trust from an employer than our relationship is already off to a bad start. I don't want to be treated like a baby and/or lied to. 

Also there is a massive financial cost to consider with owning an extra vehicle/gas/wear and tear/and above all time when commuting. That is a huge financial factor that I just can't gloss over as a candidate. 

So yeah, talented candidates are going to shop around for flexibility in the future and companies will either have to adapt or get left behind. Remote flexibility is not only the future, but the present in tech. 

What do you think is the future of employees who demand flexibility like this? Have you turned down offers due to remote or lack thereof?",2021-04-19 13:31:39
mmow7l,"My boss asked me to do something I consider unethical. I want to refuse, but how?","I'm an intern at a tech startup. Our company is trying to develop a messaging app that will also include the ability to take/send photos and videos.

He thinks it'll be a fun easter egg that will get more users to want to try the app, but I see serious danger in being able to take a picture of an unsuspecting person. I mentioned this in a meeting, but my boss's consensus seems to be that we should just keep in the app until we get in trouble. 

Besides that strategy being highly questionable, I really think this needs to be stopped before serious legal boundaries are crossed. I'm just an intern, how should I go about trying to resolve this situation?",2021-04-08 10:32:44

nayre6,"Sick of companies saying they are ""startups"" as an excuse to give their workforce a poor work/life balance","I have been interviewing over the last few months and recently I was talking to one company on the east coast. They told me that I'll likely be working longer hours because ""it's a startup"". The company has been around for over a decade and it is publicly traded, this is not a startup! 

My last company had employees work 2 full time jobs for the price of 1 salary. The CEO told us ""this is just expected out of you at a startup"". They had been around since 2008 and were profitable. This is not a startup!

I interviewed at a digital agency and they told me I would have to meet tight deadlines and work late due to customer needs because again, ""it's a startup"". The company was again over 10 years old and didn't even have any sort of equity. Again, not a startup!

ktzjx2,Story of my average joe CS journey,"Hey guys,

I've been lurking here a while and have seen some posts referencing how they feel this subreddit is toxic or depressing, and also asking about what happens to ""average joe"" CS students.  I'd like to share my story if anyone cares.

I started my CS degree at a community college for two years, then a I transferred to a no name liberal arts college.  If anything this school would be considered below average honestly.  I never grinded leetcode, worked on personal projects, or really learned anything outside of the school curriculum.  In my junior year I mass applied to internships. 

I was asked to come in for an interview with a super small company that had maybe 20 employees if you include the interns.  One of my interview questions was literally fizzbuzz.  I was offered the internship and stayed there for about a year being paid minimum wage.  Getting paid to program while a college student instead of working in retail?  Hell yeah.  I didn't care at all it wasn't a prestigious or high paying internship.

In my senior year I mass applied to jobs and received two interviews.  One with a government agency and one with a medium sized company I'm sure no one would have heard of.  Neither interview was particularly challenging or included any leetcode. I accepted an offer from the medium sized company for a salary of 70k with a 3k sign on bonus.  I also received a conditional job offer from the government pending what looked to be a fairly intensive background check.  I declined that offer since I'd have to move.

My point is if you're gunning for FAANG then by all means shoot for the moon, I wish you the best.  But if you're just some college student who's worrying if they'll even find a job after graduation just relax.  There's plenty of opportunities out there your degree will open for you that are just fine comfortable jobs.  And if you don't find one immediately after graduation, still relax. The overwhelming majority of college students won't.  Most major in something much less employable than CS and spend years after being a fresh graduate to find their ""grown up"" job.  It's not ideal but no one seems to care as much as on this subreddit.  You'll all be fine.",2021-01-09 21:12:25

p2ra74,I GOT THE JOB,"I’m still in shock about what’s happening. I’m a software engineering Intern at a big tech company. It literally seems surreal with how amazing everything was. My team was amazing, the WLB was phenomenal (I took ~5 days off in total and never worked more than 45 hours a week), my teammates had nothing but great things to say. I was told I was receiving the offer this morning and had a meeting with my recruiter at the end of the day. $180,000/yr (salary, stocks, and performance bonus) + $60,000 sign-on. Absolutely blowing away every expectation and I have to ask if I’m dreaming. As a person who’s filled with TONS of self-doubt, receiving this offer just validated the dozens upon dozens of hours spent in office hours, studying, struggling, and crying every week was not in vain 🥲

Wanted to throw a little positivity out there! Keep your head high and know what you’re grinding for. Keep going!

Edit: Just want to add that while I undoubtably have a ton of privilege, there are some judgments that are incorrect. I went to school on 90% aid (the rest outside private loans). I’m about 60 grand in debt. My graduate program would’ve costed over 100 grand, but I have it paid for by a scholarship. I don’t have legacy, didn’t have private tutors, went to a public school, and my college apps were free due to financial circumstances (which again, was the only reason I applied to the schools in the first place).",2021-08-12 01:52:50

m6d1pt,Here's why you dont get a chance to match their offer,"started position about a year ago.  quickly realized being underpaid. everyone one the team says I should get more, they are impressed with the quality of work I perform. ok. gave it some time, talked to my pm who is very friendly with us and is more of 'us'  in us (engineers) vs them (management) situation. He basically told me I definitely should be paid more, but we don't have a concept of 'raise' here and we're not really growing, so there isn't really much money to go around. The only way he got a raise was when he got another offer from someone else. Told I may be better off somewhere else.

shit, it grinds my gears so much every time they praise my work without backing it up by some actions. I couldn't give less fucks about your 'thank's and 'great job's... I'm being paid less than the guy who fucking does nothing. and the more they praise the more annoying it becomes. If im so freaking awesome where's my bonus? no bonus - means I'm not awesome? (or rather you don't think I worth it) 

&#x200B;

fuck. anyhow. So I decided to reply to some of my linkedin messages just to see what's out there. Sure enough, 2 weeks later I get an offer with 30% raise, double pto, and some other misc things. gave my 2 weeks notices and refused to discuss an offer to see what they can do about it.    


either appreciate what you have or fuck off. words mean nothing. we are polite and professional in the workplace by default. Back it up by some action, otherwise what you do is called lying.",2021-03-16 16:30:37
nio8ny,How do you deal with coworkers like this?,"How do you compete with coworkers who eat, breathe and live programming and have nothing else going on in their lives?

I'll give an example that happened to me: The manager assigned a new project to be worked on by me and one other dev, I'll call him Ben. The idea was the whole project would take a few weeks to complete, and me and Ben would split the work evenly. At the beginning, me and Ben had a meeting and divided the project into small subtasks, and agreed to each do half the tasks. But Ben worked over time every day and the weekend too (I saw him committing code to the repository late at night on Saturday), and finished his half of the tasks very quickly. Then he started giving me unsolicited ""tips"" on how to do my tasks (of course cc'ing the manager), and then he outright just started doing my tasks for me. The entire project got finished in a week, and Ben did 90% of the work. Ben is not smarter or more efficient than me, he's just willing to work unlimited over time. Of course Ben made sure the manager was aware he did most of the work and now the manager is very impressed with Ben. I have no problem with people getting credit for working hard, but I do have a problem with being made to look mediocre compared to someone just because I have a work-life balance and they don't. Note that I am in no way a slacker, I don't goof off during work, I'm not slow or anything, I put in a solid 8 hours every Monday to Friday. I'm just unwilling to work any more than that. I have worked on several different teams during my career and it looks like there's a Ben on every team. How do you deal with such people? Advice from managers would be especially helpful.",2021-05-22 17:59:38
o0wgv7,I rejected an intern applicant yesterday and still feel like shit,"I thought it might be interesting to give the experienced perspective on interviewing someone...

Yesterday, I was asked to interview an intern applicant. I'm not sure why it was so late, but my guess is it was some combination of 'team had an intern that backed out and this was an emergency backfill' and 'this applicant is connected to an executive so someone pulled strings to get him an opportunity this late'. Anyway, the interview being so late in the year makes me pretty confident that this was his last shot at getting an internship.

The interview was really straightforward...a fizzbuzz equivalent just to break the ice, then working through a previous, simple problem we'd hit on the job to see what working with him would be like. I'd planned a third question to get to what his interests and strengths and everything were, but he never made progress on the second question. 

He wasn't awful. He was just worse than other applicants we'd rejected in the past, and after the interview the other interviewer and I both felt that the cost of mentoring this applicant would not be something we'd personally want to take on so it felt wrong to push that onto someone else. If I had to give him advice it would be that you can never really shut down in an interview...you have to constantly make your thoughts obvious, engage with the interviewer, etc., and even admit if you're just stuck and will run out of time, but it's so circumstantial that I don't know that it would be helpful.

Anyway...main summary is that I was only given a tiny sliver of time to evaluate this person, and a large investment on the company's side is at stake (intern mentoring is time consuming), so even though there's not enough information to say 'this person is incompetent', there isn't enough to say 'this person is worth the investment right now', so I had to decline knowing fully how much this will harm his career prospects and how much this is all based on luck. Maybe he slept poorly? Maybe my phrasing was hard to follow when I tried to steer? There's no way to know and the whole situation just sucks.",2021-06-16 04:17:14

Old post: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/onmtqf/amazing_review_no_raise_other_concerns/

I practiced Leet Code Easy to Medium, Educative.io's grokking system design, and object oriented design.

Did about 40+ interviews and failed miserably for the first 15 (didn't complete) and was rejected right away. 

I then really upped my LC practice which led to the about 5 2nd rounds out of the next 10. I bombed out of those on unoptimal solutions or inadequate answers. 

Then I practiced building a react application, watched YT videos on answering behavioral questions. I also practiced System design and OOP design. Read Building Microservices and Designing Data Intensive Applications.

For my final 10 interviews, I made it to 4 final rounds. Went 1/4 on final rounds. Only needed 1. 

Went from TC 130k (115k + bonus + 401k match) to 274k (200k + 20% bonus + ~~RSU~~).

Edit: meant ISOs not RSU. $40k worth.",2021-09-07 17:46:56
py8y5m,I cried at a meeting today due to feeling overwhelmed and stressed. Feel like I just lost any legitimacy and credibility to my coworkers,"I’m a 29F and have been working for 5 years mostly on front-end. I joined this team which works full stack and though I’ve been on this team ~6 months, a lot of the concepts relating to the backend are foreign to me still such as database stuff and concurrency. 

There was a meeting today in the office with me and 2 guys on the team who are the experts. They are in their early 40s and have decades of industry experience. 

They went over my PRs and pretty much shredded my code to pieces. They interrogated me about the system but I obviously am not as familiar about the codebase as they are and I couldn’t defend myself technically and it was humiliating. 

They then started arguing about the code between themselves for 10 minutes meanwhile I have nothing insightful to contribute so I am just sitting in this meeting room trying to figure out what pieces are relevant to my project which I’ve spent the last 3 weeks working on vs them just arguing in some ego/dominance contest and I didn’t even feel like I was in the room anymore or part of the conversation. 

I felt so defeated and discouraged. For these 6 months I have been trying to make a really good impression and prove myself, especially with this project. I just want them and the team to respect me and take me seriously as an engineer but it’s obvious that I am not anywhere close to that level yet and that I am not a good engineer 

I also have just been feeling super isolated and lonely on this team. There is pretty much zero diversity on this team, the people aren’t exactly that friendly, and they have all been working together longer than I have.

One of the guys apologized to me in the hallway after the meeting and said he hadn’t realized he had been so harsh. 

I appreciate his apology but then again it’s not his responsibility to manage my feelings. It should be on me to be less sensitive and to be a better engineer. 

I feel like after today, there is zero chance they willl ever take me seriously or respect me given that my natural response is to tear up when I am overwhelmed and feel powerless.

Should I just quit this team and move on? Its  been 6 months and I still feel like I know nothing. I’m just tired of trying and stilll always being subpar.


Edit/update: thank you so much for all the support and love ❤️ you guys make me feel not alone in this anymore. 

In the morning, I am going to give my two weeks notice, step back, take a rest / mini sabbatical from tech,  and then find a team with a culture I resonate with more. 

I realized that I really don’t resonate with the culture or communication style of this current team and that there is a mismatch here. Not just because of what happened today but because I still don’t feel integrated on the team at all, I feel emotionally exhausted and need a long break, I don’t feel like I am getting the support I need, and I don’t see myself matching with the culture no matter how long I am on the team. 

Thank you for all the help. It’s very much appreciated",2021-09-30 00:59:51

mq1la5,My UPS horror story and why you shouldn’t trust them,"I interned with UPS in their corporate office this past summer and was given a contingent offer in October based on if I graduated successfully (graduated Dec 2020), as well as the typical stuff (background check, reference checks, etc). I passed all the contingencies listed on the offer letter with no issue. 

So I accept the offer in October and now seemingly have a job setup post graduation, great! Early December rolls around and I email the HR person I received the offer from initially, no response. I wait about 3 weeks, by now I have graduated and am expecting to start work soon. I email again, no response. Another 2 weeks goes by, I email again, but CC my former boss from the summer that I was told per the offer letter I would be working for again - no response from either. 

At this point, it is February and I have not heard a word from UPS since I accepted the offer months prior. Keep in mind, I did not apply to a single job once I accepted the position because I assumed I was setup and was satisfied with the role. 

After being ghosting for many emails, I directly emailed my old boss asking what was up and if he could contact HR for me since I was unable to. He responded and said he would and keep me updated. 3 weeks go by - nothing. I email him again and he responses saying HR said “the offer was contingent on if there was a position available and it seems like there isn’t any open positions”. There was never a mention of this on the offer letter, which included salary, a signing bonus, and more. The offer listed listed the contingencies very clearly and it simply wasn’t one of them. Also keep in mind I am working in the corporate office within the F&A department...(you’d think there’s plenty of jobs involving data science or analysis) 

At this point I am fuming and no longer want to be affiliated with the company even if they wanted me. Luckily I was able to find a job soon after getting kicked in the balls by UPS so it did not delay my progress too bad, but the way this was handled with the lack of care really shows a lot about this company. 

If you take anything away from this, know that:

1) If you are given an official offer letter, it means nothing. It can be rescinded for no reason with no legitimate explanation. 
2) HR is horribly ran at this company, at least at the corporate office working within F&A. They do not care about you and don’t even have the heart to respond to one email when you have accepted a job. 
3) They seemingly tried to screw over a former intern that was newly entering a spotty job market after graduating college, by pulling an offer because of a contingency that was never mentioned in any capacity.

kotf7u,You don't have to be a Software Engineer,"I'm posting my experience moving from software engineering to sales engineering because I'm seeing a lot of posts from people who are unhappy with software engineering or even just worried if software engineering is the right career for them; **you don't have to be a software engineer.** 

**TLDR:** Knowing how to develop software opens the door to many other roles, and many roles would benefit from having someone who knew how to code. I used to be a software engineer, but now I'm having way more fun as a sales engineer. I have friends who became UX/UI designers, and their frontend development knowledge really helps with prototyping. These are just a few examples of alternative roles. 

------


I studied computer engineering and then worked full time as a software engineer for 2 years. I loved working on projects in college, but I hated working as a software engineer; I went from working on fun projects where I had a lot of control over the project to mostly maintaining code. It sucked having little say in the projects I was working on. 

A **lot** of my close friends started switching over to client-facing engineering roles; we were always really social, but coding all day wasn't our thing. I left my software engineering role and joined a start-up as a **post-sales engineer** (an engineer focused on supporting a GTM team *after* the prospect signs a deal) at a SaaS startup. 

The pay was the same as my software engineering role, but I only spent about 30% of my day coding. I spent the rest of the day working with customers and collaborating with other post-sales & engineering teams. The work consisted of integrating our product with theirs to troubleshooting our product for a customer. It was refreshing going from coding all day to client-facing communication. 

I left the company and joined as a **pre-sales engineer** (an engineer focused on supporting a GTM team *before* the prospect signs a deal) at another SaaS company recently. Similar to the last role, there isn't lots of coding involved, but this role is focused on convincing prospects that our tool was the right tool for them. Because of that, the role is a lot more flexible and engaging, and I have a lot of control over how I want to tackle each prospect. I also have a lot more say in how our organization/company operates since I'm exposed to EPD and our prospects directly.

This job is what I loved about college, and I'm glad I was able to find it. I'm hoping those who are discouraged by software engineering take some time to research some other roles that involve coding. My example is just me going to a client-facing engineering role, but I have friends who transitioned to UX/UI design, data science, marketing analytics, sales ops, etc. There are tons of roles where your software development skills would come in handy. 

Of course, you'll need to develop the additional skills to succeed in the role, but you might already have those skills in your belt. For example, if you're outspoken and good at explaining complex concepts to non-technical people, you have what it takes to be a sales engineer.

-----

For those who are interested in client-facing engineering roles, there are **tons** of different names for the roles, and companies often use the same names for different types of roles (a solutions engineer can be post-sales at one company and pre-sales at another). I'm going to share some names I've seen for these types of roles for you to search up yourself. You can also mix and match a bunch of these words and find similar roles lol.

Partner Engineer, Sales Engineer, Solutions Engineer, Solutions Consultant, Solutions Architect, Technical Sales Engineer, Technical Account Manager, Customer Success Engineer, Success Architect

lkdk8g,I collected around 1081+ jobs from companies that hire without whiteboard questions,"Hey everyone,

Even as a mid level dev with several years of experience, I have always found it difficult to solve problems on the whiteboard. I'm more of a practical person who can come up with solutions in front of a screen and ever since I left college, it's only been even more difficult to get back into the Leetcode grind.

I don't have much of an appetite for FAANG companies anyway. I figured I would start setting up a section for Hiring Without Whiteboards on my job board to categorise it.

ohcowe,Take stories in here with a grain of salt (with example),"There's many posts in here about how people have ""great qualifications"" but can't find a job, causing everyone to circlejerk about how bad the market is, and vice-versa for people who find jobs with minimum qualifications. The problem is that little context is given, and these posts skew readers' attitudes towards the industry in harmful ways.

For example, I know someone who on paper looks amazing: 3.8 GPA in Computer Science BS, Computer Science MS with a good thesis project, three semesters as a tutor, side projects, etc. However, it's been 11 months since she graduated and she's unemployed, despite having applied to hundreds of places.

If she posted on here, everyone would think ""wow, the job market is horrible"". The truth is, she cheated through most of her classes and took the easiest electives possible, she was a tutor for a class where no one showed up to tutoring, and her final master's project was part of a group where she did minimal work. She has minimal to no work ethic, has turned down interviews because she did not want to get up too early, etc. She doesn't want to do any leetcode or prep because it is ""irrelevant to the job"", but it's obvious to people who know her that it is out of laziness.

If I were to hear all of her stats in a vacuum, or a reddit post, I'd be impressed, but it doesn't reflect reality at all. **Some people are just lazy/incompetent,** and everyone needs to stop blaming the ""job market"" when unemployment is at a huge low. I've seen posts on here where almost everyone agreed with the OP that the job market was terrible, not even entertaining the remote possibility that the OP was just not good at CS. Everyone I know with a good work ethic and who can code well has a decent/good job, no matter their GPA or college.

**The point of this post** is that many stories on here should only make you question the poster's capabilities, not the job market, and that you should not become disheartened from the posts.",2021-07-10 05:24:30

They had a few good internships, and interviewed very well. They came across as smart, self-aware, and pleasant. Their Algorithms and Data Structures skills were 'meh'. Nothing great. They missed some of the big insights in the problems and struggled a bit with different ways to approach the problem, but they were able to talk through it well and there were no red flags in their code. They did well on everything but the coding and still got an offer. It's not always about the coding, your personality and speaking skills matter too.

Making it seem that if someone finds troubles with it, you have a problem cause ‘everyone can do it’. Now celebrities endorse that learning how to code should be mandatory. As if you learn it, suddenly you become smarter, as if you do anything else you will not be so smart and logical.

It makes me want to punch something will all these pushes and dreams that this is it for you, the only way to be rich. Guess what? You can be rich by pursuing something else too.

nv50d3,My company drinks the Kool-aid so much that it might as well be a cult,"I’ve been working for years at a small “startup” that has been around for over a decade (you know, the type of place that calls itself a startup to pay you less). In 2020 the company had a 15% drop in revenue and laid off 50% of engineering without warning one morning. Yes, that's all it took for them to have a panic attack and fire everyone.

Since then, everyone left had their 401k match cut, got their raises frozen, and had to do the work of 2 or more people. The company culture got fucking toxic. Managers started to micromanage employees, employees were not allowed to speak out about anything, slack conversations basically disappeared, our 1 on 1’s were recorded, and we had 7 status meetings in a week.

Yet the company kept pushing the narrative that we are a happy bunch and everything is perfect. In fact, our new CEO said 2020 was our best year financially ever, but we still are operating at 50% staff with the same output expectatios. Magically, all negative reviews from 2018 onward seemed to have disappeared from Glassdoor too, it's a miracle!

The worst part is that a lot of people are drinking the Kool-aid and saying everything is perfect. They really believe we are changing the world. It's fucking time clock software. When I bring up the company's glaring issues some people (not all) say everything is perfect or “it could be worse”.  They talk about the company's “values” like they are gospel.

mxl911,$200k+ TC offer | What I did to prepare,"I recently landed two offers from two Silicon Valley-based tech companies.

These were the only two companies I interviewed for.

I am writing this post to document the things I did to prepare for interviews and answer questions I had throughout the process in the hopes it might help someone in the future.

Please make sure you draw from a wide variety of sources and hear others' testimonials when planning for interviews. Feel free to ask in the comments anything I haven't addressed.

# Technical Preparation

**How many LeetCode questions did you do?**

* 106 completed (\~120 attempted)
   * 36 Easy
   * 66 Medium
   * 4 Hard

**How did you decide which LeetCode questions to do?**

1. I had LeetCode Premium and went straight for the questions asked by the companies I was applying to
2. For any questions I struggled with, I added two of the 'Similar Questions' or two questions from 'Related Topics' to my favorites and solved them later
3. I then went through [this list of 75 questions](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) and solved any I hadn't solved yet
4. Finally, I sorted all the questions by frequency and went down the list, prioritizing medium-difficulty questions

**How much time did you spend on each question?**

About an hour, sometimes less and sometimes more. If I couldn't come up with an algorithm within an hour and a half, I would look at the solution, save the problem for later, and move on to the next one.

**Is there a point where you begin recognizing patterns?**

It was a real struggle when I first started out. I was able to solve most easy questions but was pretty clueless on most medium questions. Things started to come together after I solved about 100 problems, but there were still a lot of problems I glanced at afterwards that I was unable to solve. If I got to do 150-200 problems (before landing an offer), I feel like I would've been in a really good position.

**Tips for solving these questions?**

* *Understand every possible method of solving each question you do.* In every one of my interviews, I was asked to solve each question at least two different ways. Be sure to find multiple solutions to each problem by either going through the problem's 'Discussion' section or, if you have LC Premium, the 'Solution' article
* *Don't just come up with the algorithm. Implement the solution and pass every test case.* A lot of times, implementation is the most difficult aspect of a problem. Also, in the process of implementing your solution, you might realize your algorithm is incorrect or doesn't address every edge case. Struggling through the implementation will ingrain the solution much more deeply in your mind
* *Review old questions*. This is self explanatory. Don't do too many problems without making sure you remember how to do ones you did a while back.
* *Depth over breadth.* 150-200 problems should be all it takes to cover everything you need to know. If you have done this many and are still struggling, you probably don't truly understand the problems you've done and rather are simply memorizing the solutions.

**Is LeetCode Premium worth it?**

I felt so, and here's why:

* Having access to the company-specific problems was *invaluable*. If there is one reason to subscribe, it is this
* Some of the questions locked for free users are questions that build the foundation for understanding how to solve many other questions
* The solution articles are often really detailed and well-written. They'll cover almost every way to solve each problem — something that you won't get from every Discussion post

My only warning is to not rely on the debugger they give you. You're not going to get a debugger in an interview. Get used to debugging by printing stuff to the console.

A Leetcode Premium subscription definitely isn't necessary if you can't afford it.

***Cracking the Coding Interview*** **or LeetCode?**

I did both. I started off going through Cracking the Coding Interview. I only went through the chapters on Strings, Arrays, Linked Lists, Dynamic Programming & Recursion, Trees, Greedy, and System Design. The introductory segment for each chapter is really great as it covers a lot of the basic concepts you need to solve a wide variety of problems in each category. See if you can't get a used copy of the book for cheap.

# Background & Other Preparation

**What other preparation did you do besides LeetCode?** Before each of my first several rounds of interviews, I went through a list of common questions I might be asked about each project I listed on my resume, rehearsing my answers out loud. I made sure I could summarize what I am currently doing in under 30 seconds.

One thing I want to warn you of is that you'll want to make sure you're prepared for *system design* questions (e.g. design TinyURL). LeetCode does not have any practice problems for this, so just be aware that these problems exist.

I'd also recommend reading *Clean Code* by Robert Cecil Martin. I got asked a lot how I would change my code for a production environment, and reading this gave me a lot of material to work with. It will also just make you a better software developer in general.

**What's your background?** I am 24 years old and have a little under two years of experience as a software consultant for an investment bank. My main skill is Java/Spring Boot but I also know a little bit of React.js and Vue.js. My resume really isn't that impressive, so don't let a weak resume stop you from shooting your shot.

**How long before you got an offer?** 2.5 months since I sent out my first application. This is also about how much time I spent grinding LeetCode. I got both of my offers in the same week.

**Where did you find jobs to apply for?** LinkedIn. Nowhere else.

# Thoughts on the Tech Interview Process

I hate it. I think it's really stupid. Some of the questions I came across on LeetCode had me thinking, ""They can't seriously expect a human being to solve this in under 45 minutes."" Some questions are just glorified IQ tests that prove nothing about your ability as a software developer. Some questions are so ridiculously mundane I wonder why they get asked at all. If these are your thoughts, just know you are not alone.

Unfortunately, tech companies do not care about your feelings. If you refuse to prepare for these questions out of spite, someone else who wants it more will step up to the plate and happily take those offers from you. Figure out what it's worth to you. Good luck

# Edits

I'll address some other things here based on questions I'm frequently getting asked.

**Which companies gave you an offer? Are there really companies in NC that pay that much?** I'm not at liberty to say which companies gave me an offer. What I will say is there are a ton of tech companies with offices in the RTP area that extend offers making mine look like a government welfare check. Google, Nvidia, and SAS are just a few examples. There are some other really solid companies here too, like IBM and RBC.

**How did you find those opportunities?** Set your location preferences in LinkedIn to 'North Carolina' and you'll see all the available jobs in the area.

**What did the rest of your resume look like?** I had a summer internship at a tiny company where I wrote maybe 100 lines of code. I had a research assistant position where I basically just put together datasets for my supervisor to use in her research. I also volunteered as a web developer for a hospital my senior year. I listed any technologies and languages I had ever touched but left out anything I couldn't talk about at a high level. My resume really isn't that impressive and I never got asked about these trivial roles.

**What is your comp package?** 138k base + 14k bonus target + 50k equity over 3 years (edit: 150k equity total). There's also 401k matching and a discounted stock purchase plan but I haven't calculated what those are worth.

**Are you getting paid by LeetCode?** No. I am just documenting my experience here. I am well aware that you can get a job without ever touching LeetCode or a similar site. However, landing a job without any practice is extremely unrealistic for the large majority of people, myself included. Feel free to use HackerRank or whatever else is out there. Or trust your smarts and go into your interviews blind.",2021-04-24 14:39:16
m158xp,"My manager went through hell to get me a promotion a month ago, but now I got a job offer in the big leagues. How do I talk do her?","
A little more context from title: last month I got a job offer from another company a bit bigger than my current employer, and it would double my salary. I talked to my manager and she insisted I listen to a counter offer, she threw numbers at me but they didn’t hit at least equal to the other offer, so I declined. She then escalated it to her manager, we talked and while he got closer to what I wanted, it wasn’t enough, so I stood my ground and opted to go to the new company. Then, he escalated things to HIS manager which is basically second to the CEO himself, and his manager finally offered me the same amount from the job offer, so I decided to stay and declined the job offer. 


Fast forward to last week, I get an email from Big A stating that I passed the virtual on-site and they want to hire me. The salary they offered is almost 3 times the one I have right now, which is a lot, and obviously working in big tech will look great on my resume. There’s no way I can decline this, but I feel bad for making my employers scrape the bottom of the barrel to pay me what I thought as deserving, so how do I go about telling them I’ll leave anyway without burning any bridges?",2021-03-09 12:18:56
qlzp9m,"PSA: If your company promises you something but doesn't have it in writing, it doesn't exist","Time and time again I've seen this play out.   
Your company is going through a re-org, or shutting down a project, or cutting the budget. Middle management will gather everyone in the room and play the good cop. They will go on about how they ""are in talks with senior leadership"" or ""senior leadership has agreed to X"" or ""senior leadership really wants to make this work for all of you"". Maybe they will float the idea of people who stay on will get equity, or a bonus, or how this change is actually good because now they are starting a super progressive, skunks-work R&D ultra modern tech stack project, etc etc.

It's all bullshit and they never intend to any of it. Hell, senior leadership could even be ignorant of what middle management is promising, their mandate to your manager could have simply been ""retain your employees for X weeks"".

ldnkkw,Went From 90k to 140k by Managing Phone Screens Really Well,"I am very fortunate to have gotten an offer for \~140k (mostly all base, as is customary in Chicago), while I was just at \~90k  TC (for those of you who are curious,  I am a 2019 grad and have been at the same company since then) - and I did not do any big LeetCode grind or anything like that (maybe 20 LeetCode easies and mediums total in a one month period).  However, one tactic I found really useful, was managing recruiter phone screens strategically.

&#x200B;

1. I set up a system to weed out really poor recruiter outreach.  Most outreach is absolute shit - like roles that do not match with my experience at all, or have really poor compensation.  I simply stopped replying to to most bad recruiter outreach where the recruiter clearly did not make an effort (like sending me job descriptions asking for 7+ years of experience).  This was kind of brutal maybe, but I am not going to spend 30 mins every day replying to all the crap I get on LinkedIn DMs and email.  I spent about 15 hours creating email filters to weed out bad outreach and prioritize high quality outreach (this may have been a bit obsessive).  I asked for comp ranges typically before hopping on a call.
2. When asked for comp expectations in the call, I would NOT talk about my current pay (it is actually illegal for recruiters to ask for it in Illinois).  When I was asked about expectations, I would very clearly mention the compensation range of companies I was talking to.  So I would say something like this: ""I have been talking to companies mostly in the 120-140k total compensation range, so I would like to target something in that range if we are going to move forward"".   Earlier in the process, these ranges were smaller, but as we went along, those numbers got bigger.  I think I started off talking to companies in the 100-110k range, and this tactic helped move that range up. This was transparent, and it seemed to work well for me (transparency can help - who would have thought).  As I went further along this process, I would let the recruiter calling me know if I had on-sites scheduled, or was approaching the pre-offer stage at other companies.  This made them seem to move faster and advocate for higher pay for me to whoever they were representing.  I even had one recruiter who, when he heard I was close to an offer, get back to me the same day after a phone screen with an expedited interview process involving a call with the VP engineering \*the same day\*.

&#x200B;

Just thought I would share my experience.  I did not really do anything special for interviews or interview prep, but I think I managed those phone screens really well, and that is not something we talk about often on this sub IMO.  A lot of us could get disproportionately great results for the effort invested by being more mindful about key points in the process that we tend to not focus on/not like (particularly when you are asked about comp expectations).  This is an opinion formed from anecdotal observations and personal experience, so take it for what it's worth.  Also, luck played a huge role, of course.",2021-02-06 02:15:23

rmcx4d,Reminder: Don’t forget to be humble!,"Hey everyone, just a PSA/ reminder.

I know it’s a bit different than your usual post, but I would like to remind everyone here that humility and respect is extremely important in our personal life and career.

I’ve been seeing people shit on others for not getting into a FAANG, comparing salaries to the point where 300k TC comp makes someone feel like shit compared to a friend that makes 500k, etc. really? 

First foremost, many of us needs to realize that a job that often pays 70k-170k TC out of college at age 22 is extremely fortunate. Yes, we worked hard for it, but many others have in their respective fields, even if it pays less. Many of us make double or triple the average household income in the US at a very young age. Don’t expect others to have the same financials as you, and don’t compare. Comparing doesn’t do shit. 

Be happy with where you’re at. It’s never a bad thing to push yourself in your career and be the best developer/engineer you can be, but there’s no reason to bring anyone else down in the process. Everyone has their own life and their own pace. 

Sorry for the long post, have a great day everyone!",2021-12-22 19:36:45

lkrmyr,Drug Addict to Big Tech SWE - My Story,"    Hey guys, I wanted to share my story with the community for inspiration and encouragement. I simplified it as much as possible but it's still pretty long. I hope you enjoy and get something out of it. Happy to answer questions.

I grew up middle to upper-middle class in a small town in the US. There were some issues in my family— divorce, mental illness, etc, but they are good people and I don’t blame them for anything that happened. In school I was “gifted” and got good test scores but never was a great student. I struggled to pay attention and always preferred messing around with my friends and playing video games to studying. I loved computers and technology but never really had a direction. This lack of work ethic would come back to bite me later on. I did the absolute minimum to apply for colleges but ended up getting into a state university because my teachers and parents pushed me (thanks guys).

Around this time I started smoking weed and I loved it. It coincided with me moving away from home, so I could get away with smoking all the time. It was just weed in college after all. Harmless, right? Soon I was smoking multiple times a day and partying on the weekends, not taking school seriously at all. I didn’t even declare a major. I started dabbling in other stuff— Adderall to study, ecstasy and acid at an EDM show, Xanax or Vicodin to chill out. People would express concern about my behavior but I was in denial. My life started falling apart. I flunked out of school. I was always high, always broke, relationships falling apart from my shitty behavior, working shitty jobs to buy drugs first and then pay rent if there was money left over. At some point I got introduced to heroin and that was the beginning of the end.

I descended really quickly into full-blown addiction. I completely destroyed my life, did terrible things to people I cared about. I got a really nasty spine injury while intoxicated and still have the side effects. At one point I almost died from an overdose. I only survived because someone found me in the bathroom. I woke up in an ambulance. I was totally broken as a person, facing homelessness, living off food stamps. It was by far the worst time of my life and I won’t say any more about it.

Eventually I asked for help and spent a year bouncing in and out of treatment, community support groups, etc and eventually managed to get sober. Happy to go more in depth on how I did it but it was a lot of work as well as help from other people in my life.

I reached out to the school I flunked out of and ended up talking to a dean. I told him my story and he helped me get back in. I was broke but loans, grants, and cheap in-state tuition came through for me. At one point I had three part-time jobs in addition to my classes. I picked engineering since I could get a 4-year degree and start making money right away, but switched to computer science because it was fun and I couldn’t get into the engineering program due to my shit GPA. I am very, very glad I switched to CS.

It was hard trying to stay sober and go to school and work and learn how to program in my mid-20s. At one point I slipped up and relapsed, but I again reached out to the people around me for help and got back on track. I was fat and lonely and wanted to date, so I started working on my fitness, learning to dress better, putting myself out there on dating apps— these are other things I’m very glad I did. All this shit sucked and I was unhappy but I kept going. It’s not like I had a better option. My classes were hard but I kept trying and gradually built up my work ethic. Through persistent effort I started to do well in school for the first time. I was making friends, I lost weight and found some sports I really enjoyed, and I was even going on dates.

Eventually I went to a career fair and found out you were supposed to get an internship. What? I applied for a few and got demolished in the single interview I had. I took classes over the summer instead. The next year I went to the career fair and went to literally every table. I failed the interviews cause I still didn’t know what I was doing but I followed up via email on my prospects and found a program where someone had dropped out and they needed a replacement. Nice! This was my big break. They hired me with almost no interview.

I was absolutely terrible in my internship, working with kids way younger than me who somehow were way smarter than me, but I kept showing up. I built relationships with my coworkers and they let me work part-time during the school year and full-time in the summer my last two years of school. Not because I was some bright shining talent but because I showed up reliably and was pleasant to be around. I was never any good but I learned a lot and earned enough money to stop taking out loans (huge win).

The fall before my graduation I knew a lot more about the job market and what interviews were like. I got a book on coding interview prep and practiced as much as I could. I went to every job fair and found every new grad hiring program I could online. I applied and got a ton of rejections— but also a ton of interviews. I ended up graduating with 8 job offers. Most of them were for smaller companies in my state but one of them was at a big coastal tech company with comp in the mid six figures. I seriously could not believe it and accepted.

Life has been fantastic since then. I’m over five years sober from drugs and booze and engaged to be married to a great person (and a doctor!) I have a job I enjoy that can be challenging and stressful but is ultimately very rewarding. I work on cool technology with people I respect and learn from. I like where I am but I keep my skills sharp in case the time comes for me to move to a different company. I never would have thought I would have this lifestyle or earn this kind of money— more than any of my friends or family and I’m still very early in my career. One thing I absolutely cannot forget is that every day is a choice to keep working and doing what I need to do to keep my life on track. It would be so easy to fuck it up and go back to where I was.

Lessons learned:

&#x200B;

1. Fix your problems. If you have something wrong in your life, mental illness, toxic relationship, addiction, family issues, whatever, get it under control however you can. Sometimes that means separating yourself from people that are messing your life up. Once your life is in order, everything else will fall into place.
2. Do whatever it takes. I had to desperately seek recovery to get and stay sober. It had to be my top priority and I barely made it. But I did it. When I applied this to other parts of my life such as fitness and my career, those took off as well. Learn computer science fundamentals (data structures and algorithms). Practice coding problems— they will make you smarter and the best jobs will test your knowledge in interviews. I’ve seen people on this sub make all kinds of excuses why they don’t do this, but let’s be honest, it’s just laziness. You can do it. Keep working at it until you get where you want to be. We have it easier than pretty much any other profession.
3. Be a three-dimensional person. Take care of your body— it’s meant to move and not to sit in front of a screen all day. If you’re overweight, learn how calories work and fix it. Find hobbies you can get into and relate to other people about. Video games don’t count. Pick something interesting. Side projects are fine but you need to have a life outside of tech. I have made a lot of friends through my hobbies. Learn to present yourself well. Dress well, practice good hygiene, develop social skills. Don’t be a stereotypical smelly weirdo nerd. All of this is learnable. I was a fucking creature when I first got sober and now I am a well-rounded member of society.  
**edit**: An addition to this one is pick a high-quality news source such as New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Economist and pay for a subscription. Keep up to date on what's going on in your country and the world so you can talk to others and be part of it. Learn to differentiate between news, opinion pieces, and toxic bullshit that gets shared on social media. Having a political opinion is good but stay away from extremes.
4. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. I was poisoned by self-pity but the truth is, life is hard and unfair. No one is going to fix your problems for you. And yes, some people are born lucky and everything just falls into their laps. If you want to have a great life you need to go out and build it piece by piece. Let go of your entitled bullshit and accept that you’re going to have to struggle and do things you don’t want to in order to grow and be happy.
5. Drugs and booze and other vices— many people are able to do these things occasionally and function fine. I am not one of them. You need to be honest with yourself about this. If you go to a party once every few weeks, you’re probably ok. If you’re smoking weed every day, sorry to tell you but you might have a drug problem. Cut that shit out. It will only hold you back. If you are an addict like me the only option is to stop completely. Resources are out there to help you stop.
6. Don’t live in the past— I can never take back all the pain I caused, the bad choices I made, the injury I got. All I can do is try to make it right and do my best to do better going forward.
7. Anything is possible. I quit heroin and came back from death. I am a mediocre engineer but very successful because I keep trying. You don’t have to be born special to kick ass, it just takes hustle.

**TLDR:** Started doing drugs, stopped with enormous difficulty, went to school, hustled hard, got a great job",2021-02-16 00:43:58

phjabh,Why does everyone in our field act like a dick?,"I am in college right now getting my bachelors in computer science. I was wondering why the people in my major and field all act like dicks. When I ask for someone's help almost always they brag about how they have X amount of years of coding experience and then tell me to pay more attention to the lectures. I feel as though I am way behind everyone else and my class and it doesn't help that I have to rely solely on the TA's and professor. If I ask for help with a single syntax error there is not reason to be a dickhead to me. Sorry for the rant, I just wanted to know why people in our field tend to be dicks to each other.

edit: A lot of people are saying that I am the problem because I am not practicing ""critical thinking skills"". The syntax error is just an example. Here is an example of what happened Tuesday, In class we were building a taco organizer that organizes tacos based on 1: type 2: price 3: location (that should let you know how early on we are in our coding classes.) I was getting a syntax on this line exactly

"" return ""Taco Name:""+this.name+"" Location:""+this.location+"" Price:""+this.price;"" 

I initially had 

return ""Taco Name:""+this.name+"" Location:""+this.location+"" Price:""+this.price+;""

and was wondering why I was getting a syntax. So I asked the guy next to me and he said ""Maybe you should pay more attention to the lecture."" and then proceeded to tell me he has 4 year of coding experience.

p638m3,The One Thing Wrong With Remote,"Not exaaactly a new grad, I guess? Joined my org as the only junior on the team post graduation towards the end of 2020. It's been remote and great. I spent ~6 months in a learning curve. Org culture is great. I've been appreciated at work, so it's not the whines of the fallen either.


Org opened on-site *optionally*. Decided to visit one day just to feel the 'vibe' of bullpens. Most of my team moved cities, so only had like one senior person on the team with me. And we mostly chilled the whole day, I was told stuff about the people I was working with that I could never find out remote. We discussed work for like an hour and BOY OH BOY. I learnt so much! I learnt how skilled Devs think in terms of projects, how they approach problem, what to use what not to use. Faced a common system issue that I would usually take 2 hours to resolve, and sr gave me a solution and it was resolved within minutes. Everything was surreally efficient.


I get why people who have had experience in the industry might want to stay remote. But that leaves the newer grads with a lot steeper learning curve. Things are terrible on this end. I love the WFH benefits but for at least the first 2 years of my career, I should be able to work with an in-person team. So while there's a whole 'give us remote' agenda being spread everywhere, I'd urge y'all to consider this point too?


---------------------------------&
EDIT : 
Ok wow this got a lot of traction. I want to address some major themes that I found in the comments.

* I am not advocating WFO.  I'm simply saying that if we are continuing with WFH the way it is, this is a significant problem that needs to be addressed ASAP.

* My company does not have terrible documentation. Everyone's helpful, and we actually had half-remote model since way before the pandemic. So I'm talking about a general issue and not one caused due to mismanagement.

* Yes, in a sort of optional WFH model, if best-case scenario, I get to meet 4/10 people on the team - it's still great for me because I get to learn from their experience, their knowledge, their perspective. I'm still sort of missing out the load of information that the other experienced 60% people have to offer, but I guess something is better than nothing.

* I get that there's no personal incentive for the sr. Devs to come to work once in a while to offer technical mentorship. But if this continues, we're gonna end up with ~shitty~ not-the-best Devs when y'all retire. 

* I don't think this experience can be replicated in remote at least with the current structure followed by companies. I can ping people when I'm going through an issue and the issue is resolved.
But this is about bigger the questions that I don't know that I can ask, those that don't even occur to me.

Even as a Sr Dev I don't think anyone in remote goes ""Oh let me ping the new grad to show them how I filter this huge data for getting the most value from it"". And it's not a question that I can ask either because I thought I could just go through the whole data to figure stuff out, don't need help here. 
In office though, if I notice them doing it and I go ""oh why did you do this"" there's an explanation behind it. Other way round, if the sr sees me there they'll just go ""hey, I think this is something you should see"". And there's a lot more learning there.",2021-08-17 12:56:27
pbyn4v,Anyone else feel like LeetCode encourages bad programming practices?,"I'm a mid-level Data Analyst (Spend roughly 50% of my time coding), and previously I worked as a software engineer. Both places are fairly well known financial firms. In total, 5 years of experience. 

I've recently been doing LeetCode mediums and hards to prep for an upcoming interview with one of the Big Tech Companies, it will be my first ever interview with one of the Big Tech companies. However I seem to continously get dinged by not optimizing for space/memory. 

With 5 years of experience, I feel I've been conditioned to substitute memory optimization for the ability to easily refactor the code if requirements change. I can count on one hand the number of real-world issues I came across where memory was a problem, and even then moving from grotesquely unoptimized to semi-optimized did wonders. 

However, looking at many of the ""optimal"" answers for many LeetCode Hards, a small requirement change would require a near total rewrite of the solution. Which, in my experience, requirements will almost always change. In my line of work, it's not a matter of if requirements will change, but how many times they will.

What do you all think? Am I the odd man out?

If anyone works at one of the Big Tech companies, do requirements not change there? How often do you find yourself optimizing for memory versus refactoring due to requirement changes?",2021-08-26 12:37:33

I think success stories are often less impactful than they could be because there is always a sense of ""well you must have had x, or you were privileged in the following y,z ways."" I don't intend to complete resolve that by sharing my background but rather just to make it less ambiguous. Some people will always have some excuse as to why they weren't or can't be successful. My goal isn't to make it sound like a ""if I can do it, anyone can story.""

# About me

I grew up in a lower-middle class family in the US. My parents had a nasty divorce when I was young and there was constant custody battles, I attended many schools, had no friends, and was constantly bullied. The police were not uncommon visitors to my house. In high school, things settled and I gained some notion of stability. Up until then, I had no vision of a future, no idea of how I could possibly make it in the world and no confidence. This began to change after I became inspired by the Japanese Anime Dragon Ball Z (yeah I know). It awaken me to the fact that one could self-improve through discipline and perseverance. This initially took the form of physical conditioning and after a while my confidence grew and for the first time I a ""passion."" From this came my first vision of a future - I set out to join the military with the goal of becoming a Navy SEAL.

I graduated high school (with a 2.1 GPA) and attempted to enroll in the Navy. However, I soon discovered I am medically disqualified from service. I had an undiagnosed kidney issue that barred me from enlisting. However I remained hopeful that if I could get it treated I may still enlist. So I began a 2 year process of treating the disease in hopes that I could get the levels of proteinuria (the diagnostic) to an acceptable level. But after being strung along by recruiters, I eventually got a hold of the recruiting command who said that even if my condition was cured, I would never be elidable for service - in any military service. The mere history of having it was permanently disqualified. That didn't matter in the end because the kidney disease is IgA nephropathy and is incurable and progressive. So here I was back to square one with no hope of a future.

I worked for a time as a fitness instructor and I continued to work on myself, personally. I soon become inspired again. I had always been interested in science, but I never thought I had a future in it.  However, I had gained the confidence to pursue the academic route. I knew I wouldn't get into a decent university with the traditional route given my academic history (GPA 2.1, and ACT 18). So I went to a community college and did very well which allowed me to transfer to a good university from there. I took out student loans to cover tuition and expenses. By this time I was able to claim myself as an independent on the FAFSA and thus allowed me to get enough loans and grants to cover most expenses.

I had set graduate and pursue an MD/PhD. I wanted to practice medicine and I liked science. Most MD/PhD programs are completely funded and thus would allow me financially to pursue an MD. However, I failed in this pursuit. I had one particularly rough semester which sent me into a spiral of depression and self-doubt. I believed that since these programs were extremely competitive, there would be no way I could achieve success. In hindsight, I probably still could have been admitted. A big failure on my part was my failure to seek mental help. I had a certain sense of pride which prevented me from doing so. All my success until had been self-driven and I believed no one but me could help me, I didn't have the capacity to ask for help.

My depression spiraled and I was at risk of getting dropped from my program (biology). One semester I failed 3 out of the 5 classes I was enrolled in. I eventually completed my required courses by the skin of my teeth and graduated with a 2.7 GPA, but I found myself again (in my eyes) back to square one. Only now with a massive amount of student debt. I realized I could get some lab tech job, but I had no desire to pursue this route. The pay is poor and the work is not intellectually challenging. I was tired of being strapped for cash, living paycheck to paycheck and I thought if my life was worth living, I needed to have a decent income. So I went back to doing what I though could amount to a decent pay - fitness trainer.

I worked as a fitness trainer for a few years but I began to realize, this is a dead-end career for me. It was too intellectually unstimulated and I did not have the personality required for a long and successful career. I hated approaching people and I hated pressuring people to buy training. Eventually I heard about machine learning/deep learning. Up until then, I had no interest in CS or programming. But learning about deep neural networks greatly intrigued me. The level of empiricism involved reminded me of the natural sciences - experimentation, observation, etc. So that's when I started reading about the CS field as whole and I became even more fascinated - not to mention the pay is good.

# My pivot into CS

Until then, I had presuppositions about what it meant to be a programmer/SWE. One of the big ones I had was that you had to be really good at typing in order to be a successful programmer, which was unappealing to me because I've always sucked at typing and had no confidence I could be proficient to a high level. I have large muscular hands with little finger dexterity. Obviously, I eventually realized this was ridiculous. So now I had my third inspiration for the future - become a software engineer. But with a BS in biology and a 2.7 GPA, I had to find a way to find a way.

After researching what the best approach was for me I decided that pursing a masters degree in CS would be best. That way I could feel like my bachelors was not a complete failure and I could theoretically graduate and have a job in just 2 years. I was ineligible for most graduate programs because of my undergrad (most need 3.0 at a minimum). However, I landed on DePaul University's Master of Science in Computer Science which had a 2.5 GPA minimum. Just as important, they allowed you the option to test out of the introductory CS coursework if you can pass the proficiency exams. This was huge for me because it meant I could save over $20000 and graduate a year sooner. The FAFSA direct grad loans were just enough to cover full-time tuition. I applied and was accepted to the program, to begin the following Autumn quarter. This gave me about 5 months to self-study and attempt to pass the proficiency exams (you only get one chance).

# My CS journey

To do this, I discovered the ample amount of study resources available online. This included, reddit, edx, coursera, and youtube. However, the most valuable resources I discovered came from the open-sourced materials and lectures from elite universities like Berkeley, Stanford, and MIT. I ""audited"" several courses in preparation. Here are the audited courses and the corresponding DePaul courses I used to prepare for.

I also realized that gaining some experience ASAP was crucial, so I began sending out applications for internships anywhere and everywhere. I was lucky enough to encounter a programming internship at a university research center which specialized in biomedical research. I think my bachelors in biology helped me land this even know I had no formal experience in programming. I started the summer before my first quarter began and I worked as an intern there the entire time I was in graduate school.

During my studies, I continually supplemented with additional material, auditing other courses. I wanted to land a good job after graduation and while I was glad to be admitted to DePaul's MSCS, the program was weak and I knew if I wanted a good job I would have to go above and beyond the coursework. I graduated with a 3.9 GPA and landed a new grad role at a F100 making 120k in a med CoL area at 34 years old.

I prepared for new grad roles through all the ways you frequently read about on here. Grinding leetcode (about 30 easy, 80 med, 10 hard over 2 months), doing mock interviews on platforms like Pramp, and applying to lots of places. I couldn't grind any more than that because I was working (20 hours/week) and going to school fulltime. I failed several interviews. However, all you need is one success and eventually I found it.",2021-12-07 02:34:57
r6osqe,"My company sent out a non-anonymous survey asking employees if they were gay, trans, and what their race is","I am a remote developer for a midsize software company. The company has been going through a ton of turmoil at the executive level and the culture there is rocky at best. But the pay and the benefits are good and I just keep my head down and work on my stories and no one bothers me (which I like).

Recently the company sent out non-anonymous surveys tied to our email and slack handles about the workplace. I honestly had no intention of filling it out because there are no upsides for me. Then we get a message that they required every single employee to complete the survey (lol) from HR.

To my surprise, there are questions on there blatantly asking if I was gay, trans, and what my race is. I work from home and slang code, why is this necessary? Thankfully you could decline to answer, but I found it very off putting. Why the fuck is my employer asking me what is in between my legs and what kind of legs I like to go in between? It's just rude and completely out of line.

Not long after this, half of our HR department announced they are resigning. Apologies if this is not completely CS related but I needed some kind of perspective. Is this a normal? Some sort of weird red flag? What do you think?",2021-12-01 20:49:13
nt3m4m,I absolutely DESPISE the software dev culture,"I enjoy being a regular SE. I love having a simple, unassuming, position where I just put in my 9 to 5 monday through friday fixing shit or adding simple brain-dead features, while listening to some Pandora.

I love the simple joy doing my simple work of problem solving well, and then im out by 5pm so I can get back to my gardening, or cooking dinner, or enjoying some TV / gaming time. I have zero desire to be part of some new thing, app, feature, etc, though that doesnt seem to stop my fellow colleagues and bosses from constantly trying.

And in the middle of all this, I recently realized why I despise the ""tech"" culture. I hate interacting with my colleagues and coworkers, and the progressive culture surrounding software development.

It seems normal for everyone to be this arrogant elitist hyper competitive know-it-alls. And they sure are hell bent on playing this ""one-up-man-ship"" game constantly.

What spawned this rant was this past week, some little punk got annoyed with me because my pull request got approved, while his got rejected, on a project he and I were working on. 

He wanted to escalate the issue and argue with our boss (and his boss's boss) why his shouldve been accepted (the senior devs explained why it was rejected in the notes), and wrote this long email to me basing his whole reasoning on ""*...everything is so wrong with the company when they can accept a [my] request from some GED having college dropout coder wannabe...*"".

I dont know why, but ever since that email (he apologized later), its been festering in my mind ever since. And its made me realize how much I can not stand developers, and the tech culture in general.

I love what I do, I enjoy it. The things I dont enjoy... Are other software developers",2021-06-05 19:40:20
p06prm,Take the stories on here about job searching with a grain of salt,"I feel like every other day there's a post where someone's been searching for a job for 6-12 months and unable to find *anything*. For others looking out there, please think of those scenarios as the exception and NOT the norm. Most of the time those people looking either have terrible resumes or perform extremely poorly in their interviews. 

Now, don't get me wrong, I totally get that the entry level market has become pretty competitive lately and it's definitely a numbers game. But I feel like I read so many stories about people complaining and they either don't post their resume or they don't talk about their interview experiences. I guarantee a 5 minute conversation with some of these people would demonstrate why they're failing their interviews since people really underestimate how far soft skills can take you (or the fact that they might not be as good as they think). What they also leave out is that they're *only* applying to FAANG or similar companies without putting in the proper preparation. Obviously these top paying companies are going to expect serious talent, so having a half assed resume or shit interviewing skills is just not going to cut it. BUT - not every company will interview like FAANG companies, and their interview processes are much shorter so it's not impossible to end up with jobs are these kinds of places.

This is just my two cents obviously, but I don't want these kinds of posts deterring people from entering the field. Feels like every other day we see a dramatic post about this so I wanted to add my thoughts in about it. Would love to hear what other people think!",2021-08-08 02:45:35

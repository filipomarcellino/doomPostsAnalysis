1b76qha,I did it. Fresh Grad. 35 years old. 2.8 GPA. 95k salary.,"Just wanted to put a bit of positivity out there since this sub gets mostly negative posts.  At 32 I'd decided that I fucking hate sales, I had no degree, and I saw no other real option for growth without one.  I saw that Software Engineer degrees were the #1 job on US World Report or something like that, and the salaries looked great, so I signed up for that degree plan in night school because I'd always liked computers.  I had no fucking idea how difficult this degree was going to be.  I have no passion for math and honestly not a huge interest in programming before, but I stuck with it and a few years later got my degree this last December.  In the beginning of last fall, I honestly thought I'd made the worst mistake of my life.  I sat here and read this sub and looked on YouTube about how there's no jobs, and was basically having complete breakdowns several times a week.  I was a mess.  I also, had almost no idea how to code because the degree plan had just kicked my ass, so I was just barely keeping passing in my classes.  From August to December, I went on Leetcode every day, and submitted applications every day.  It was a fucking nightmare.  I had no idea how to do even the most basic Leetcode questions.  For two months, it was staring at every single Leetcode question and having no idea how to do it, meanwhile just getting job rejection letters in my e-mail.  Over and over and over.  Day after day- failure and rejection constantly.  But I went to every job fair my school offered and got there three hours before they opened so I could be first in line, and filled out about 800 job applications (which I know isn't many compared to some people I see on here).  Anyways, eventually I landed a great Development Engineer job and didn't even have to do any coding in the interview.  High fresh grad salary for the area (North Texas) and a job I really enjoy.    


Even if you fucked off through school, even if you fucked off through your 20's like I did, you can still turn this around.  There ARE jobs- but you have to bust your ass to get yourself in front of as many as possible, and you probably have to spend months getting rejections too.  And for everyone that feels discouraged starting late, my completely unrelated work experience that every fuckface resume review person I sat down with told me would make me less hirable, was what made my boss told me made my resume stand out from the 300 he looked through.  It's not the scarlet letter they say it is.  ",2024-03-05 14:38:56
19ajyuq,"With all of the talk about DEI, I want to address the real elephant in the room. Indian managers who hire other Indians almost exclusively","I can‚Äôt be the only one who has started to notice this trend. First generation Indian gets a management role, and they hire 30 of their kinsmen as fast as they can. 

We have a new manager that is fighting tooth and nail to hire people on visas, when there are perfectly qualified people here locally who I‚Äôm sure need the opportunity in this job climate. *Maybe* this was acceptable during talent shortages but the industry is hemorrhaging jobs and this trend needs to be addressed yesterday.


 I think it‚Äôs time to start the dialogue.",2024-01-19 14:10:52
1bmm97t,My company just decided to stop hiring self taught candidates for junior positions.,"I'm pretty surprised to be honest and did not expect it, especially considering I joined as a junior several years ago completely self taught (then later went on to get my degree as the company paid for it).

We're a big tech company, fully remote, starting pay for juniors is around \~150k USD.

According to upper management, it's because the volume of self-taught applicants is too high (a few thousand per posting) and the quality of self-taught applicants is too low. Apparently a lot of teams have hired self taught developers and it's gone very bad.

So as a result, the company announced Friday that it would no longer be hiring self-taught applicants and instead will require candidates to have a degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or Software Engineering.

Anyone else experienced this?",2024-03-24 14:38:02
18xk52u,Coworker got fired for memes,"We have a slack channel for memes, and everything in there is boomer humor or super vanilla.  My coworker (and actually a good buddy of mine) sends some good ones periodically (but still very relaxed).

In the thread, he mentioned that he was joking around and mentioned the he has some ‚Äúillegal‚Äù company memes.  Well, a few people hit him up privately to see.  He shared them over DM, someone in leadership found out, and he was let go this morning.

They‚Äôre actually not anything really extreme (definitely not actually ‚Äúillegal‚Äù or harmful).  

They‚Äôre ‚Äúillegal‚Äù in the sense that they poke fun at the company pre/post acquisition, and they make fun of some vendors and clients (without actually naming names, but everyone knows who the meme is referring to).

How do I know this?  Because I was the one who made them.  Thank god he‚Äôs been a fucking bro and took the firing in the chin without implicating me.

So happy new year to all of you, too.  Hopefully I don‚Äôt get notice later today that I‚Äôm toast, too

Edit:  I didn‚Äôt send it to him on slack or a company machine, so I‚Äôm not implicated unless he says something.  I‚Äôm not dumb.  

He‚Äôs not dumb either, I think he just doesn‚Äôt care anymore.  We got acquired in Jan 2023 and it‚Äôs been a shitshow to say the least since then.  He told me he‚Äôs looking forward to some fun-employment.

I initially found out when he texted me this morning ‚Äúya boy got fired LMAO ü§£‚Äù

Just thought it‚Äôs a funnyish story to share.",2024-01-03 14:04:09
1b3ddb3,Everyone at my big tech company is so unproductive because we're all preparing to be cut.,"I'm a mid-level SWE in one of the FAANG companies, and this miasma of layoffs and PIP has been in the air for so long that morale and productivity have just fallen off a cliff. I feel relatively stable in my position, but I'm now spending half my workdays upskilling and getting back in the habit of Leetcode problems. I'm not submitting applications to other jobs yet, but I don't see how this can be rational for the companies. If cuts need to be made, just make them, but this slow burn seems to just be crushing productivity.",2024-02-29 22:24:37
1az738q,"Why isn‚Äôt there more of a backlash against outsourcing, especially to India?","I‚Äôve seen a lot of companies such as Google laying off workers in the US and hiring in India.

Heard Meta is doing this as well.

I worked for a company that after hiring an Indian CTO, a ton of US workers (operations and SWEs) were laid off or pipped and hiring was exclusively done in India.

Nothing against Indians but this is clearly becoming a problem.

I mean take a look at what is happening to Canada.

Also, in my experience, Indians have bias for their own nationals. I‚Äôve worked in Indian majority teams with an Indian manager and seen non-Indians being put in perf and managed out and Indians promoting their own up the ranks. Also, I know that many Indian managers tend to favor hiring Indians on visas so they can exercise a greater level of control over their reports than a non-Indian.

I‚Äôm seeing this everywhere and no one gives a sh*t. ",2024-02-24 22:15:58
192w2k3,I‚Äôm giving up,"7 yoe and been laid off for a year. I‚Äôm so god damn tired of interviewing and grinding the job hunt. Just  had my last interview today. I was so nervous and burnt out that I was on the verge of tears and considered not showing up at the last second. Ended up telling myself to just wing it and that this would be my last attempt.

It actually feels great to accept my fate. I just wasn‚Äôt meant for this industry I guess. I only studied CS in college because its what everyone pressured me to major in‚Ä¶I never enjoyed the corporate lifestyle and constant upskilling grind either. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm gonna do next‚Ä¶stock shelves, go back to school, declare bankruptcy, live under a bridge, suck dick for cash‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm ready to accept my fate. It can‚Äôt be any worse than this shit. Farewell, former CS peers.",2024-01-10 01:35:46
1aliiqb,Name & Shame: Sourcegraph,"I had a few interviews with Sourcegraph and they ghosted me but that's not the name and shame part.  The last interview I had with them was pretty conversational.  I had a background in some of the problems they were working on and during the conversation I brought up a sort of improvement/trick I had figured out in the past and the interviewer said it was something they had never considered before and seemed really interested in it which I thought was a good sign.  But unfortunately they ghosted me after that.  But here's the crazy part.  Sourcegraph has some open source repos and out of curiosity I decided to look at one the other day.  I looked at a few of the recent PRs and one of them caught my eye.  The PR was the EXACT improvement/trick that I brought up in my interview.  I look at who created the PR and, of course, it was the guy who interviewed me.  I looked at the date and it was about a week after my interview happened.  So this place ghosted me AND used me for free consulting.  I'm actually kind of flattered.",2024-02-08 00:32:31
195gvq0,"Kevin Bourrillion, creator of libraries like Guava, Guice, Lay Off after 19 years","[https://twitter.com/kevinb9n](https://twitter.com/kevinb9n)

For those who wonder why this post is significant, it's to reveal it doesn't matter how competent one is, in a layoff, anyone is in chopping block.

Kevin Bourrillion's works include: Guava, Guice, AutoValue, Error Prone, google-java-format

[https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Guava/](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Guava/)

This guy has created the foundation of many Java libraries such as Guava and Guice. The rest of the world is using the libraries he developed and those libraries are essentially the de facto libraries in the industry.

After 19 years at Google, he was part of the lay off.

It shows that it doesn't matter how talented you are in this field, at end of day, you are just a number at an excel file. Very few in the world can claim to be as talented as him in this field (at least in terms of achievements in the software engineering sector).

It also shows that it doesn't matter how impactful the projects one does is (his works is the foundation of much of this industry), what matters end of day is company revenue/profits. While the work he did transformed libraries in Java, it didn't bring revenue.

I am also posting this so everyone here comes to understand anyone can be in lay offs. It doesn't matter if you work 996 (9AM to 9PM 6 days a week) or create projects that transform the industry. There doesn't need to be any warnings.

Anyways, I'm dumbfounded how such a person was in lay off at Google. That kind of talent is extremely rare in this industry. Why let go instead of moving him into another project? But I guess at end of day, everyone is just a number.",2024-01-13 05:45:57
1arr4au,"1.5 years since graduating, no internships/experience, 1000+ apps, mid school, low gpa, no referal, just signed my offer","great pay. fully remote. I feel extremely lucky. My first and only interview. More then thrilled. Was seriously considering pivoting to electricians apprenticeship. 

I leet coded every day, built side projects constantly, made some open source contributions.

Strangely, the thing that I spoke about most in all my interviews was the non-tech related experience on my resume which is only recently added as a single line at the end. 

I certainly attribute most of this to luck and don't think I am more qualified then anyone else to give any kind of advice but here is what I think made a difference:

* filter positions on linkedIn by newest or by those with under 10 applicants. Getting in first is probably most important.
* Search for more then just ""Junior Dev"" or ""SWE"" jobs. Use keywords like code or coding that will come up in the description but not the job title. This will allow you to find positions with unique titles that are more hidden in the results and receive less applicants
* If you aren't a super stud stop applying to big tech positions. Find tech companies that serve currently thriving sectors like biomedical and healthcare.
* add your non-tech work experience. I only added my most recent job as a single line but people really seemed to like that I had worked in a diverse fast paced environment before especially in the behavior interviews.

EDIT:
I have no idea how many jobs I applied for so 1k is a bs number. Probably like 10-20 a week for a solid 6 months to a year.

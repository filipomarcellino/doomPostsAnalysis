Tesla expanded massively during Covid, as of now half of the dev team(including me) don’t have parking space or desk. It’s physically impossible for everyone to return to office.

sgktuv,The DEFINITIVE way on how to LeetCode properly. (Hint: You are most likely doing it wrong!),"Will keep it short and simple.

I'm a new grad, and I received several offers from top companies and well known unicorns / startups.

How did I do it? Leetcode.

That's the name of the game currently. If you can do Leetcode, you WILL get a top offer from a top company. Thats all there is to it.

**Here is how to properly leetcode:**

DO NOT attempt to solve any questions on your own (YET!). Yes, you heard me right. I know I sound crazy. But solving ANYTHING on your own is a complete and utter waste of time. Don't even spend 5 minutes on a problem. You do not have the base knowledge yet. You will simply be getting frustrated, and spinning your wheels.

So, what do you do? simple.

1. Go to grokking the coding interview (no DONT buy it. Waste of money) and look at their list of patterns.
2. Pick one pattern, and go to leetcode. Search for problems with that pattern.
3. Go through each problem for the pattern, and go STRAIGHT to the solution. Do not even spend 1 second trying to solve the problem. WASTE OF TIME.
4. Understand the solution DEEPLY. Make notes. Google things you don't understand. Watch videos on youtube about the solution. Go to the discussion section on leetcode and see what others came up with. Play around with the solution, modify variables, etc. Basically... UNDERSTAND THE SOLUTION AS DEEPLY AS YOU CAN
5. Move on to the next problem, and repeat.
6. After you have done this for enough problems, you will feel a lightbulb going off in your head. Congrats, now you know how to solve this pattern!
7. Go back and pick a new pattern, and do the same thing.

Because you aren't wasting time spending hours on a problem, in just 1-3 weeks, you will have a deep understanding of all the major patterns and common solutions to these patterns. You will be able to recognize how to break down a problem into specific patterns, etc.

Once you have done 300-400 problems like this (it sounds like a lot, but remember.. you are NOT wasting hours per problem trying to solve it.. so you will go through A LOT of problems in a short amount of time.. the key is NOT to memorize, but to UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS), you can start going through company specific questions on leetcode by buying premium. You will notice you can solve them now on your own!

Congrats, you just saved yourself months and months of headache and frustration.",2022-01-30 22:28:50

uxqaf9,[Update] I broke production and now my tech lead says he doesn't trust me,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uurkw4/i_broke_production_and_now_my_tech_lead_says_he/)

I actually can't believe how this turned out. I think this might be the best thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life.

I ended up having it out with my tech lead. We got into a couple of heated exchanges when I pushed the cause of this incident back on him since he knew production was vulnerable, and failed to address the root issue for over a year. He didn't like that, so he tried to have me demoted and removed from any development tasks, so I quit on the spot. The next day, the CEO called me, and we had a pretty productive chat about the whole situation. Our chat ended with with him telling me, ""I like you. I respect you, and I am definitely listening to what you're saying. I hope we can work together again sometime in the future in some capacity.""

&#x200B;

Now for the best part...

&#x200B;

I had mentioned in some response comments in the previous thread that I had been applying for jobs the previous week before this incident occurred.  As of today, I got an offer for a much larger, more established company for a 100% remote position with a 133% increase in salary, full benefits and all.

&#x200B;

As for what's next, It's a 2 week process for on-boarding at the new place which is mostly handled on their end, so I'm going on vacation. I'm taking my girlfriend to every beach town in California for the next 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

Edit: I forgot to mention that the tech lead went to the client and named me personally as the one who broke their production DB. That sent me over the edge with him which is what made me walk on the spot.",2022-05-25 20:27:10
zdjsux,"PSA: Don't answer Indeed's questions, it could get you fired.","Y'know those questions Indeed asks you about current and previous jobs while you're applying?
I just got fired because I answered some of those questions honestly. I thought it was anonymous (I could swear they told me that it was anonymous....) well it turns out that it mentions your position.

Since I'm the only person at my company with that position it was clear who answered the question naming my company as toxic.

Well, just like a toxic employer, they fired me for it.

UPDATE: I found a job about a week after being fired. It pays a lot less, but it's a much better environment.

Fuck you Indeed!",2022-12-05 21:09:59
uczkay,"Referrals Are King - A Shithead Guide On Successfully Applying To Jobs, Even - ESPECIALLY - When You're A Shithead.","I must introduce this guide first with this preamble: I cannot for the life of me believe that people are *not* doing this. I mean that literally - I believe, and to a larger degree, I hope, that this is all useless information.

However, I have helped close to three dozen friends go from getting nearly zero interviews or even responses, to getting them all the time, just by... get ready for it... this one simple trick.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your primary strategy for applying to jobs is by going to [indeed.com](https://indeed.com), [monster.com](https://monster.com), [jobs.linkedin.com](https://jobs.linkedin.com) \- etc, and hitting submit on an application, then I am so happy to inform you that you're just doing this wrong. I have applied to many jobs this way, and I have sparingly seen a response. Why? Because I'm a shithead, and no one wants to hire a shithead.

So, what did I do instead, and what did all my other shithead friends do instead?

# What The Hell To Do Instead

HAVE A RESUME THAT LOOKS GOOD

I have seen so many resumes from newgrads and junior engineers with the most *blegh* looking resumes. I am not talking content here - by now, I hope you know how to make your resume sound, and this is not going to be a guide on how to make your resume *sound* good. But for the love of God, if you're making your resume on microsoft word, do yourself a favor and [make yourself a resume on overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv) Or whatever you want. Make it look good. Overleaf makes it hella easy, especially if you're a developer. Don't know LaTeX? Neither do I, and I got by just fine, and, remember, I'm a shithead. You can figure it out, I promise.

Okay, have a nice looking resume? Good.

&#x200B;

# Use LinkedIn to Contact People. Seriously.

I have never, ever, *ever*, sent an application randomly through one of those crap-chute websites and expected to ever hear anything back. And guess what? Lo and behold, I nearly never hear back. So, here's what I do.

Let's say I want to apply to a Spotify job. I'll go to Spotify's ""careers at spotify"" page, and look for two, three maximum, roles that sound right for me. Then, I go on [linkedin.com](https://linkedin.com) and search ""Spotify"" and land on their company page. You should see something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/uoIPIXH).

Then, I click on the [People](https://imgur.com/a/ZBT5oOg) tab.

Then, I look at the [filters that are immediately available.](https://imgur.com/a/TQRLKxk)

And I apply some filters!

You want people in Engineering. You want people who went to your college. You want people who studied what you studied. You want people who are first, second, or even third connections. Just add as many filters as *you* can. The more related they are to you, the better!

Then, start mass-adding people that clear the filters. If they are already a connection - great, send them a message. If they went to your school (this is very helpful) - great, send them a message. If they have your first name - great, send them a message.

If they share fuck-all with you, great, send them a message!

But they have to accept your connection first, of course, if you don't have Linkedin premium. A lot of them will. Some of them won't. Whatever, doesn't matter. You really just want 1-3 people.

Once you have at least one person accept your connection request, send them a message! You don't want more than a paragraph. 1-2 sentences telling them why you are messaging them, 1-2 sentences introducing yourself, and 1-2 sentences to just shoot the shit. Something like:

""Hey, my name is Texzone, and I am messaging you because I am interested in a job at Spotify. These roles I have sent below seem like a great fit for me (send roles after sending the intro message), and, I would love if you could refer me. I am a newgrad interested in backend development with a focus in data engineering, and I have some experience under my belt that I think would be beneficial to Spotify. \[insert line about your qualifications; seriously, Keep It Simple, Stupid\]. Thank you so much for everything, and have a great day!""

That's it.

""*But* u/texzone\*, that's so annoying! I'm surely harassing them by doing this!""\*

You idiot. You know, if they refer you and you get accepted, most companies have a bonus that they offer the employee! It ranges anywhere from 2k-10k. And all they have to do is drag-and-drop your resume on some shitty internal portal, then continue picking their nose while watching whatever tiktok nonsense they were watching when you messaged them.

Even if they don't get any money out of it, people like helping other people. Really, it's true. They do.

And, with a referral, you are almost *guaranteed* an interview if you:

1.	Have a clean looking resume and it sounds good.
2.	You are applying to a role that matches your background/experience, at least loosely.
3.	That's it.
4.	Yeah that's really it.
5.	I swear.

Easy. I have applied to dozens upon dozens of jobs this way, and I have gotten interviews at nearly every single damn one. My resume isnt amazing. My experience isn't way out there. My friends? A lot of them had a clean looking resume, but had shit-all for experience. But they all got interviews as well.

&#x200B;

I am sharing this because I am forced to believe people aren't doing this, and are instead hitting submit on some portal. This is by far the worst god damn way to ever apply *anywhere* nowadays. Unless your resume is filled with jargon, years of experience, and a sprinkle of FAANG, forget this ever being a smart way to apply to jobs.

So, that's how I, a shithead, have gotten over a hundred (I'm seriously not kidding) interviews over three cycles of job hunts that lasted about 3-5 months each. I applied once when I graduated, once during COVID, and just finished a job hunt right now.

I *now* have some impressive stuff on my resume, thankfully. I look less and less like a shithead, and more like a professional - much to the dismay of the world - and I *still* don't ever hear back (rarely) from applying to jobs ""normally."" I still do apply normally - I'll send out applications every month or so, even when I'm working, so I can keep interviewing and stay ontop of my interviewing game. But from, say, 50 applications I send out, I'll maybe hear one  response.

But when I apply the way I described above? If the person delivered, and referred me, I never *don't* hear back. Neither do my friends. And I will almost always find someone to refer me. So... yeah, I hope this helps.

&#x200B;

Note: I guess this may not work for super small startups. Whatever.

# FAQs

1.	Is this method something you would recommend for internships?
   1. No, not really - this method is something that I strongly encourage for full time jobs. Internships, co-ops, etc - those are a different beast and I know nothing about that. A college internship? ...Maybe. A High school one? ...Unlikely.
2.	***AM I SUPPOSED TO SUBMIT MY APPLICATION BEFORE OR AFTER THEY REFER ME***
   1. ***VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY MUCH AFTER! DONT APPLY, LET THEM APPLY FOR YOU!*** If you apply before they refer you, well, then, you applied, and they can no longer refer you. So don't apply unless they explicitly tell you to do so.
3.	Am I supposed to contact recruiters?
   1. Yes. They are excellent. Yes, do contact them. But honestly I've just never really had much luck with them.
4.	Do I attach my resume unprompted?
   1. Up to you really. I usually don't. But you can. Especially if u like it

This strategy may not be so effective anymore. Good luck, its rough out there right now.",2022-04-27 09:29:55
xxg9ag,Now I understand why it took me so long to land an entry level job,"I’m on a small team. After posting a jr level job, we had +200 applicants on the first week. Most of these per our manager “are on the back burner and won’t even be looked at”. 

My team and I started conducting interviews and we have only done two of them so far and they are both referrals only. Two interviews next week, also only referrals. Everything is moving really slowly and one of the guys we interviewed only exposure to SWD is from a bootcamp he hasn’t finished yet. I was going to give him a LC medium but I asked him FizzBuzz instead and he wasn’t able to even begin it.

Long story short, if you are a new grad or barley starting your career, to increase your chances at landing something, PLEASE network! There’s no one size fits all solution for this shitty mess, but I have found that DMing recruiters, hiring managers, going to career fairs, anything you got to do to put your name above a stack of +200 resumes, 97% of them which will likely not even be touched, really helps (didn’t do any of this until towards the end of my first job hunt hence the title). An influx of bootcamp grads/students, combined with covid, recessions, hiring freezes, and God only knows what else is the reason folks.

Also, no hate on the new people coming into the field or the bootcamp students. Keep grinding, keep working hard, keep learning new stuff! We are all going to make it, provided you stick to it and see it all the way through. But be honest and realistic with yourself as well.

zfp5wl,Should we start refusing coding challenges?,"I've been a software developer for the past 10 years. Yesterday, some colleagues and I were discussing how awful the software developer interviews have become.

We have been asked ridiculous trivia questions, given timed online tests, insane take-home projects, and unrelated coding tasks. There is a long-lasting trend from companies wanting to replicate the hiring process of FAANG. What these companies seem to forget is that FAANG offers huge compensation and benefits, usually not comparable to what they provide.

Many years ago, an ex-googler published the ""Cracking The Coding Interview"" and I think this book has become, whether intentionally or not, a negative influence in today's hiring practices for many software development positions.

What bugs me is that the tech industry has lost respect for developers, especially senior developers. There seems to be an unspoken assumption that everything a senior dev has accomplished in his career is a lie and he must prove himself each time with a Hackerrank test. Other professions won't allow this kind of bullshit. You don't ask accountants to give sample audits before hiring them, do you?

This needs to stop.

Should we start refusing coding challenges?",2022-12-08 04:40:17
s4rkbe,After 6 years of struggle. I made it bros/gals. Signed 100k package.,"2016 - Graduated with below 2.5 GPA. No job, just my johnson in my hand.

2017 - Live at home NEET, crazy depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. Burned an entire year watching anime, netflix, and movies. Also sleeping 12 to 16 hours a day. Waking up and smoking enough weed to put an elephant asleep because every waking moment was extremely painful.

2018 - start of therapy and medication.  Had to learn how to function as a human again. While also trying to cram leetcode and general cs theory

2019 - Condition improve, but continued to try to learn too many things at once. Didn't help that I was living in abusive home enviorment. Managed to land a internship that paid $10 and hour for 3 month.

2020 -  Switched to an ad agency for $25/hr. Covid happen and was laid off during the height of pandemic. Couldn't code at home because of abusive enviorment. Rented a co-working space when everyone was staying home. Was practically living there because I could not afford to move out. Stayed for 3 months, because I could not afford $250 a month open desk. Spent another 3 month working my mall's outdoor food court 12 hours a day. 

2021 - Got a better deal from co working space for $100 a month. Was practically living at the co working space again. A small win, but there was increase of random violence at home. Took remaining amount of money, and left the country. Was able to focus on building a product. Applied, and interviewed for a job November. Received and signed offer in December.

2022 - I start working.

What I learned

1. Don't try to learning everything at once. Focus on one thing at a time.
2. Be brave and leave a toxic home enviorment. You won't be able to actually digest material if you are in constant state of fight or flight.
3. Watch out for coding anxiety. Don't code for the sake of coding. Think about what you want to achieve. Use bloom taxonomy to learn deeply.
4. Take your time, and pace yourself accordingly.
5. Believe in the process and believe in yourself.  


Took god damn 6 years because I was constantly in state of anxiety and flight mode. Took me 6 months to readjust to a healthy baseline. FML but I made it and so can you. Don't give up. To the bitter end.

Edit1. I was a non-cs major that majored in accounting. My 3rd year i have a 3.0 to 3.2 gpa. Always loved tech but coming from an extremely poor family i was never introduced or had guidance to coding until college. I do recall learning how to make a website with dreamweaver as a freshie. But I loved tech since i was a kid.

I believe coding is just the modern day carpenter and anyone can do it.

Edit2. I did not get FANNG nor was asked an algro question. Though doing tons of leetcode allowed me practice visually mapping algros and cleaned up my coding logic.",2022-01-15 19:05:49
ujjhpi,"Not all can make top 5% salaries - by definition, but all would make more if they research salaries, job hop, negotiate, stack competing offers, rather than not. Here's how:","Here's some general advice that if everyone followed, salaries across the country would go up (We've seen this happen already with the service industry! #GreatResignation /r/WorkReform ). And of course, so could yours if you follow it.

&#x200B;

* Don't try to ""get a job""
   * You are offering a service, selling your labor. imagine you're a basket weaver. Selling baskets is your only source of income. You just opened shop, if I show up and offer $10, would you take it right away? or would you research how much baskets are being sold in your area first? they could be going for $1000 instead of $10. And of course, you would set the price right? not the first customer to walk in.
   * So research. like you would if you are a business owner. at the minimum, once a year, because salaries change fast!
      * Know not just how much people get paid in FAANG, tier 1, startups, average F500, banks, etc
      * but know as well their WLB, weekly hours, etc
      * Do NOT be the guy that thinks that everyone in good paying companies works >40h and thus, doesn't try to go into these companies, or accepts >40h and bad WLB because they are paid well - you can have both
      * Do not be the guy that assumes but doesn't verify, that to reach X salary you must pass leetcode hard and get into FAANG or Quant, when many lesser prestigious companies have started paying higher and higher - be the guy that verifies
   * Your labor is worth what you decide, not what the first company decides
* Keep your secrets, reveal your strengths
   * You are letting companies blindly bid on your employment - which is even more advantageous than selling on a shop like the example above
   * it's a blind auction. And you are in control of the information, they don't know if you already have offers for 200k, if you are earning 180k right now, etc
   * Keep them in the dark of what doesn't help you and inform them of information that helps you
      * You got a Google offer? tell everyone
      * Google low balled you to SDE3 instead of 4? Just mention Google offer, not the pay / level
      * No name company offered big bucks? Just leave the name out, show the number
      * You are making more than their offer? reveal
      * You are making less? keep it
      * reveal the best, hide the worst
   * if you say you earn X, now the negotiation is more restricted to X + 10% - 30% even though they had budget for more. not completely impossible to negotiate more, but harder
   * and never say ""can you do 100k?"" you just cut yourself out of the rest of the budget, now you look rude if you then say there's another offer you are considering, etc
* Write down all offers. keep track
   * write down what was said verbally, the written offer might change
      * the offer is more than the written contract. Hints about good WLB, red flags about long hours, there's a ping pong table at the office and you are a fanatic for ping pong...
      * on the other hand, what's not in written contract is not guaranteed, and a lot of things don't get written down like a ping pong table
   * you might forget things as this could be a long process
* ""Never say the first number"" is good but not enough. And not always possible. Better is: ""Never say the *last number*""
   * if you can be the first to ask about pay before they ask you, then great, ask them for a range. Keep in mind, the range they give you is not truly the highest they are willing to pay
   * if they insist hard on asking a number from you first, before interviewing to avoid wasting time, don't say ""the minimum I would take.."" or ""I would sign for...""
   * Do not, ever, put a hard ceiling or limit on what you would accept!
   * when you say any number, always keep higher pay as a possibility
   * Answer if you have to: ""I'm looking for at least average/above average market pay for my experience, which would be at least X""
   * then you are not an asshole if you come back with an offer of X + 40k, and they cannot tell you that you said you would accept X - you never said that
* Stack offers. Don't stop interviewing because 1 company made an offer - you are just getting started
   * keep your job as long as you can - it's leverage
   * keep interviewing as long as you can - you gain leverage with each offer
   * first thing you do when you get an offer - ask for time to decide, more on this later
   * When you get an offer that expires after 10 days, only sign it on the 9th day. Let them sweat, let them consider offering you more - so really do, unprompted even
   * leave all offers open
      * you might think it's good to tell 'no' to the company that offered you 100k after you get a 150k offer - don't
      * never say 'no', or that you are moving on, or going for other opportunities
      * leave every door open until the day you sign your best offer
      * you might be surprised that the cheap-ass offer suddenly becomes your best offer
   * Inform all other companies, hell, even the ones that rejected you before if you have a recruiter email, about the best offers you received
      * ""Hello X,  I just wanted to updated you on my thoughts regarding the decision to join *COMPANY*. I just received a strong/competitive/enticing offer from *CORP*. I am still very excited to join your team as I had a great experience during the interviews, as such can we ...
      * for companies you are still interviewing ""..can we expedite the interview process as my timeline is now tight?""
      * for companies that made you an offer "".. can we revisit the offer and make this work? The offer I received is... X salary, Y RSU..""
* How to get more offers
   * You might be feeling hopeless. you applied to 200 jobs, passed only 3 resume screens, passed only 1 on-site, and have only 1 offer
   * you will be tempted to accept
   * you will doubt yourself and think you got lucky to get 1 offer
   * As I said, you are only getting started.
      * Linkedin, find recruiters, say you are very excited about their company, want to interview, etc..
      * say you already have an offer from X
      * Watch them scramble to get you (the better X company is)
   * Then do it again when/if you get an offer from Y where Y in (F, A, N, G, tier1List, unicornList)
      * You might be surprised how many resume screens you will skip straight to interviews, because if you passed Y's interviews, you can probably pass their own interviews. your weak CV doesn't matter as much now
   * going back to applying seems crazy: but you are not starting from zero - you have proof of your competitiveness now, x10000 more proof than a resume can give
* referrals, referrals, referrals
   * Your friend saying ""hey, my friend is looking for a job"" = not great, another guy trying to get his friend a job
      * but definitely helpful, and do that to try to get your first offers!
   * ""hey, my friend got an offer from X, he's really good, would you like to interview him before he accepts?"" = wow I just got a chance at fishing a competitive candidate because of this guy is in my network! I'm on a time limit to get this guy!
   * So absolutely leverage your network
      * ask them to refer you to their companies to get your first offer
      * re-contact everyone AGAIN when you have an offer
      * heck, re-contact everyone ***again*** and ask for referral ***again*** if you get your first FAANG offer, suddenly the referrals that did nothing, that went ignored, will be calling back because you are the guy they heard about twice and is now about to get fished by Google
* Exploding offers (when they ask you to sign in less than 2-3 days)
   * these might be one of the hardest things to deal with if circumstances are wrong
      * No job, no other offers? You're fucked. Either accept, or if you have balls of steel and confidence that you will get other offers? then keep applying
   * exploding offers are negotiable too. everything is. deadlines are.
      * show them the offers that are bigger (and don't necessarily tell deadlines unless they keep insisting about the expiration)
      * ""My offers for X and Y will expire significantly later, and I want to take time to make this important decision of which company I will work with for the next years. I will get back to you at that timeline""
      * insist that you, while very excited to work for them, want to finish X recruiting process, and or go into your cave/lake side house/spend the weekend with family/reflecting on all the opportunities you have before making a decision
   * Calling this bluff is hard - but worth it for many circumstances. usually companies that do this don't have great offers - that's exactly why they do it
   * if you need a job, there's zero shame in taking this kind of offer, in letting their bluff win. next year, you will have more leverage (a job, +1 YoE)
* Say that you cannot reach a final decision without first sleeping over it, or talking to your family, or spending a weekend reflecting, anything.
   * prepare this line
   * when you are on the phone, and you are being told your offer, don't say ""amazing, what's the start date"" - then the negotiation is over, or if you re-open the negotiation, it will be bitter and hard and won't be a very successful one
      * don't also say ""can you do +30k"". they'll do that or 20-25k and it's over. never finish a negotiation early, never close doors voluntarily - they say you can decide in a week, then ask for 2 weeks, and decide on the last day
   * with email it's easier - with phone it's more rewarding if you are a fucking boss with better social skills than a recruiter
   * Instead reply:
      * ""thank you for your offer, I am very excited about *COMPANY*, I loved meeting the *TEAM* / *STAFF,* and I know I will be a good fit and I'm happy you agreed as well. I'm not ready to discuss the offer at this point, but I am confident we can find a package both sides would be happy with. I will still sleep on/reflect over the weekend/talk to my family about this before making a decision""
   * when you are not the sole decision maker, you will be pressured less. because the other side can't talk to your family to convince them - this is huge if you are not the most confident person, and can be persuaded to say 'yes' by a strong willed recruiter
* be excited, positive, kind, never rude
   * you want them to want you, and no one wants someone that isn't happy to work for you
   * even when you get a low ball offer, don't reply in a negative manner
      * ""thank you for your offer, I am excited about \[... same as above...\] I believe am good fit and I'm happy you agreed as well. The offer is not meeting my expectations, but I'm sure we can work on this and find a package both sides would be happy with. At the moment, I've been offered... "" and show them your Ace of Spaces offer
      * if you are lacking a trump card offer, then instead say ""..for my level of experience and considering the market value, we should work towards X value"" and then keep applying
   * never say you are negotiating, or 'lets negotiate' or 'I want to negotiate'
      * instead say ""let's work towards finding a package we are both happy with""
      * ""i'm excited about joining the company, but for the sake of my family I have to re-consider because the salary is
* Companies have no idea if you are good.
   * that's why they almost never offer the full amount they would be willing to pay, the real amount, the amount only available after a recruiter goes to his superior to increase the budget
   * even after 6 or 7 interviews. on-site. leetcode hards. Companies are stillreluctant to hire you, even those that made you an offer.
   * but if you have other offers, this signals more strongly than the interviews that you are competitive
   * just like a married man with a wedding ring is much more vetted to not be a total creep, to be at least a somewhat decent partner, and thus more attractive or easier to be around, if you have a job vs not having one, if you have multiple offers vs not, you are vetted, you have proof, that you are a hot piece of juicy steak
* You are also blind to their budget
   * You might think that because you were offered 100k at first, this company would never pay you 200k
      * Yet on blind, blogs, and here in /r/cscareerquestions many people have gone from 120k to 200k, or on rarer occasions even more, at the same company, same position, same interview performance, just from having higher offers
   * Don't believe when you are told the max is X, the range is X to Y, just keep the door open: meaning, the way you reply to them is neither accepting the offer, or giving up on the company
      * to each company/offer, you are either reflecting/talking to your family, or if their offer is less than another offer, you have emailed them about it and are waiting for them to get back to you with a counter-offer (again, keep track of what each company is doing, who is the blocker, you or them, don't leave anyone without reply for more than a day!)
* Finally, you have tried your best, you are tired of applying, or the deadlines for several offers are coming in the next 2-3 days
   * time to pull your trump card
   * Contact your favorite company/offer (not necessarily the highest offer!)
   * Say ""I'm very exci-- you know by now
   * ""I have this and that offer, can you do X to help with my decision, and I will sign?""
   * if( company never did a counter-offer )
      * then X = +20% of original offer
   * else if ( company is not the highest offer )
      * then X = highest offer (and maybe +10%)
   * else
      * X = +10%
   * This is on top of the possible counter-offers you got in the previous phase
   * No one gives their best price on the first offer, so ask for extra 20% from original offers at least. if you followed the advice from earlier, they already increased their first offer
   * Don't make the same company counter-offer over and over, except with this trump card, then you can ask for either your highest offer (of course, why would you take less than highest?\*) or for 10% if it's already the highest offer as a bonus that you will sign and stop considering others
   * this is the one and only time you will put a hard limit on your pay
   * the only circumstance that you reveal the number that would make you sign now
   * never go back on your word and take that offer to another company, because you could have done earlier in the process, to get that same amount of $$$ while being polite in your negotiation, not like a lying asshole. You might the higher pay anyway, but you do it at the expense of burning a recruiter/company after saying you would sign if they did X. And I don't believe doing that can get you a significantly higher pay than this strategy that it would be worth it
   * then sign on the last day of expiration (beware off by 1 errors, check if 0-indexed or 1-indexed)
* bonus\*: Pay is not all you can negotiate. More vacation days, work from home, etc. but going that way right at the beginning of negotiation, will make it hard to compare offers. it's easy to compare 140k and 150k, but hard to compare 140k+5 extra vacation or 150k, or compare 140k plus some equipment you like and 150k
   * so start with salary. later, if there's something you prefer over higher salary, ask for that in your trump card move
      * of course, negotiating full-remote when you are about to sign, might not work at all if the company doesn't do full-remote
* bonus: ""Oh shit, a company went back on their offer"" Immediately re-contact your second best offer, explain that the position was closed / the project abandoned (aka not your fault, you didn't kill the founders dog) and hope for the best

v4nuay,The irony of using Tesla's return-to-office mandate to bash WFH,"When Elon Musk sent an email the other day demanding that all his staff come back to the office or face dismissal, I saw a lot of posts on Linkedin from the anti-WFH crowd along the lines that ""See, even a company as big as Tesla can't function with its staff working from home"" or ""Tesla only became as successful as it did because of the people who came to work"".

A short time later Elon revealed that he's concerned about the economy and intends to reduce Tesla's workforce by 10%. It's pretty clear that he issued the mandate hoping that some of his staff would choose to resign rather than return to the office.

Does anyone else find it ironic that proponents of the anti-WFH voice used this example, which was orchestrated to make people quit their jobs, to try and prove their point that everyone should return to the office?

Seems more to me like working from home was too effective and that's what most people would prefer to do. But everyone's different and adults should be given the opportunity to decide what works best for them.",2022-06-04 12:27:15

Does this mean that US companies cannot employ people in Russia at all? Sounds pretty insane. Can anyone elucidate?

Edit: This post is probably gonna get locked after I say this but to be clear if you are one of the people commenting here of the opinion that it's GOOD for Russians to lose their jobs because of who their leader is, maybe you should educate yourself just a tiny bit about the active imperial military invasions the US has done and the millions we've killed without any consequences overseas as recently as in the last 20 years. Next time think about that before you start saying it's good for civilians to have their lives ruined for the actions of their leaders. ",2022-03-01 18:10:23
rw3p8u,"PSA: If you want to know why a big company rejected you, send them a GDPR request","FANG and other big companies keep the data that you generated while interviewing with them forever.    
   
Under GDPR, they are *required* to provide you with this data request. Just send them an email with a request for this data and they must comply (say in the email that it is a formal notification of a GDPR request).
  
 
I have personally tested this with a couple of FAANG companies and the response was quite surprising. There was an interview that I felt went great but the interviewer thought I didn't know how to use a std::vector and thus rated my coding skills as bad (even though I did know how to perfectly use a fucking vector as I use one almost every day in my job).   


    
A lot of information will be redacted from these documents but it is still a useful source of feedback!


EDIT: Many people seem to think that ""running a background check"" can easily reveal whether you are a European resident or not. It's not that simple, one could easily hold dual nationality without it showing up anywhere. That have no way of knowing at all

   
   
EDIT 2: The way this works is that large companies have entire departments that deal with these sorts of requests. A sample email you could send is:

xlptfl,"I asked 500 people on this r/learnprogramming if they were able to become software engineers. Out of the 267 that responded, only 12 told me they made it.","This post is not meant to discourage anyone. Nor is it a statistically valid study. I was just curious and decided to do a fun experiment.

I have been hearing recently about how everyone should ""learn to code"", and how there are mass amounts of people going into computer science in university, or teaching themselves to code.

What puzzled me is that if there are so many people entering the field, why is it still paying so much? why are companies saying they can't find engineers? Something was not adding up and I decided to investigate.

So I spent a few months asking \~500 people on this sub if they were able to teach themselves enough to become an actual software engineer and get a job. I made sure to find people who had posted at least 1-1.5 years ago, but I went back and dug up to 3 years ago.

Out of the 500 people I asked, I had a response rate of 267. Some took several weeks, sometimes months to get back to me. To be quite honest, I'm surprised at how high the response rate was (typically the average for ""surveys"" like this is around 30%).

What I asked was quite simple:

1. Were you able to get a position as a software engineer?
2. If the answer to #1 is no, are you still looking?
3. If the answer to #2 is no, why did you stop?

These are the most common answers that I received:

Question # 1:

\- 12 / 267 (roughly 4.5%) of respondents said they were able to become software engineers and find a job.

Question # 2:

\- Of the remaining 255, 29 of them (roughly 11%) were still looking to get a job in the field

Question # 3:

Since this was open ended, there were various reasons but I grouped up the most common answers, with many respondents giving multiple answers:

1. ""I realized I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would"" - 191 out of 226 people (84%)
2. ""I didn't learn enough to be job ready"" - 175 out of 226 people (77%)
3. ""I got bored with programming"" - 143 out of 226 people (63%)
4. ""It was too difficult / had trouble understanding"" - 108 out of 226 people (48%)
5. ""I did not receive any interviews"" - 58 out of 226 people (26%)
6. ""Decided to pursue other areas in tech"" - 45 out of 226 people (20%)
7. ""Got rejected several times in interviews and gave up"" - 27 out of 226 people (12%)

&#x200B;

Anyways, that was my little experiment. I'm sure I could have asked better questions, or maybe visualized all of this data is a neat way (I might still do that). But the results were a bit surprising. Less than 5% were actually able to find a job, which explains my initial questions at the start of this post. Companies are dying to hire engineers because there still isn't that large of a percentage of people who actually are willing to do the work.

But yeah, this was just a fun little experiment. Don't use these stats for anything official. I am not a statistician whatsoever. ",2022-09-23 06:37:42
u23kix,A year ago I graduated from a bootcamp with 21 other people. Only 6 of us are working as SWEs today.,"I wanted to make this post as kind of a counterweight to all the stories that get posted here of people attending bootcamps and then quickly making six figure salaries, because I do not think those stories really give an accurate impression to the people here who are considering going to a bootcamp. 

There's a concept in statistics called [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) where cases of failure are ignored because they're less visible than cases of success. The people who went to a bootcamp and didn't make it aren't going to come in here and talk about it, and they certainly aren't going to show up in the ""placement statistics"" that the bootcamps advertise. 

My cohort of 22 graduated a year ago from a fairly well-known bootcamp. Our program was pretty standard, three months of full-stack work focused on JavaScript and React which cost ~$15k. 

Out of those 22, 6 (including myself) are in full-time SWE roles, mostly small companies or agencies. No FAANG. 5 more are in other non-developer industry roles (recruiters, designers, support engineers etc). The other 11 are not working in the industry and most of them haven't even touched their LinkedIn profile for months. 

This amounts to a placement rate of 27% which is not great for a program that costs $15k. The official ""placement rate"" of my program according to their advertising materials is ~60% (which they reframe as ~90% by excluding people who don't participate in their career services ""to completion"" whatever that means).

I don't mean to scare people off bootcamps- they worked for me (although I already had a humanities BA). But I do want to warn people who are thinking about a bootcamp as a *shortcut* to get into the industry without the effort or cost of a BSCS. Is it possible? Yes. Is it easy or guaranteed? No.",2022-04-12 16:48:25
ugveah,Name and shame: CIBC,"A year ago as a fresh grad applying for junior developer positions, I chanced upon an interview for cibc, a bank in Canada. Since the experience lives rent free in my mind to this day, I’ll detail it.

Had applied for a junior Java developer position, by this point in time I had a total of 1 yoe via coops. Got an invite for a 2 hour interview with a manager and 2 senior devs.

They started off with some basic java related questions, stuff you’d expect someone in their last year of uni to know, simple. They started going into somewhat more complicated questions, asking about patterns I’d heard of but never seen in practise - got a comment from one of the devs by this point along the lines of “wow they teach nothing to you people nowadays” for not knowing how to explain decorator pattern properly (and this after explaining factory, flyweight and observer with examples). Alright maybe that guy is just grumpy, it’s ok.

Then I get asked about multithreading, said I knew about deadlocks in theory but never saw it in practise besides database tx locks… another dev says they knew this stuff perfectly by their 2nd year back in India lol okay.

Then I get asked a problem on cloning a graph, goes well… solved it relatively quick since I had seen it before, get negged and gaslit to oblivion by one of the devs saying my code was good but I took too long compared to other candidates, “we will give you a chance on this next question” he says… then he pastes in an lc hard dp problem lmfao, understandably did not get it, “come on man algorithm class should be enough to teach you this forever”.

Manager then say that’s enough and asks the two devs to get off, says he likes me and asks me what salary I’m expecting… I said 75k cad (downtown Toronto btw) and he looks flabbergasted and says I’d need senior level knowledge for this.

Got rejected, it was my first interview as well so my confidence took a brutal hit. A few weeks later I land something for 90k. 

Waiting for a hopeful acceptance to faang so I can add this gaslighting trio on LinkedIn as a flex.

That’s my story.",2022-05-02 17:51:22

or think that you must work 60h weeks to receive that kind of TC

I just saw a thread in /r/ProgrammerHumor about 'tech bros earning +$200k"" and holy shit there are several people who straight don't believe that a normal non-genius developer with 5 years of experience, can earn 200k in Silicon Valley, and work only 40 hours, not being micromanaged.

I understand this subreddit is very skewed to very high salaries. But it's still shocking to think that maybe 90 to 95% of developers out there in the real world, are doing a very poor job of demanding higher pay, to the point of not even Googling what the typical salaries are.

If you were to judge the typical salary by only paying attention to the people around your social circle... you'd probably not even notice that in the last few years salaries increased across the board by a lot

you wouldn't what the company in the next building is paying

and not knowing means = you get underpaid

I think we need to follow in the steps of /r/WorkReform and try to galvanize developers into learning their worth and demanding for more. It could raise everyone's pay. Collective action problems are hard to solve, but it's worth trying",2022-05-05 12:05:24

ys86ns,Being a Software Engineer is extremely hard,"Here are some things you may need to learn/understand as a CRUD app dev.

1. Programming Languages  
(Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, etc.) It is normal to know two languages, being expert in one and average-ish in another.


2. Design Patterns  
Being able to read/write design patterns will make your life so much easier.


2. Web Frameworks  
(Springboot, ASP.Net Core, NodeJS) Be good with at least one of them.


3. CI/CD Tools  
(CircleCI, Jenkins, Atlassian Bamboo) You don’t have to be an expert, but knowing how to use them will make you very valuable.


4. Build Tools  
(Maven, MSBuild, NPM) This is similar to CI/CD, knowing how to correctly compile your programs and managing its dependencies is actually somewhat hard.


5. Database  
(SQL Server, MongoDB, PostgreSQL)  
Being able to optimise SQL scripts, create well designed schemas. Persistent storage is the foundation of any web app, if it’s wobbly your codebase will be even more wobblier.


6. Networks Knowledge  
Understanding how basic networking works will help you to know how to deploy stuff. Know how TCP/IP works.


7. Cloud Computing  
(AWS, Azure, GCP) A lot of stuff are actually deployed in the cloud. If you want to be able to hotfix/debug a production issue. Know how it works.


8. Reading Code  
The majority of your time on the job will be reading/understanding/debugging code. Writing code is the easiest part of the job. The hard part is trying debug issues in prod but no one bothered to add logging statements in the codebase.

Obviously you don’t need to understand everything, but try to. Also working in this field is very rewarding so don’t get scared off.

swdgiq,Financial advice after a decade in tech,"I've been thinking of putting together a huge doc/repo on the financial advice/lessons I wish I knew before entering the tech industry.  There is a lot of general information on financial advice, but very little tailored explicitly for tech employees. With so many jobs now paying $100k+ out of college, I thought -  **What financial info would I have wanted to know when I was jumping into tech?**

With the correct information and execution, most of you can set yourselves up for a very comfortable life.

I've worked at a wide range of tech companies, running into most of the situations you will most likely encounter in your tech career.  In the last decade, my income grew dramatically. When I joined Yelp reasonably early on, I made $30k base + stock options. At  Netflix, my salary was over $300k.

Here's everywhere I've worked -

* Yelp (Pre-IPO)- when there were 50-75 employees.
* Redbeacon (5 employees - acquired by Home Depot)
* SimpleGeo (\~20 employees - acquired by Airship)
* Tindie (founded, raised VC, sold)
* Netflix

**Things I wish I had known when entering the tech world -**

* Reviewing companies & selecting the right opportunity
* Salaries, pay raises, and how packages are structured
   * Startups vs big companies
* Stock options vs RSUs  - how they work, exercising them, the tax implications.
* Bonuses - what to expect and also the tax implications
* Health insurance - picking a plan, should you have a health savings account
* Investing in your retirement (401ks, IRAs, etc)
* Real estate - renting in these high costs of living areas vs buying
* Tech investing - becoming an angel investor & VC investing
* Contract work - how to bill & taxes

**Is this something you'd like to read? What would you like to be covered?**

I  am thinking of building this in public as a repo. That way, if there are topics or things you'd like to see, feel free to create an issue.  Here's that link.

zg5wtb,"I've hired people who failed coding questions - let me explain what I'm looking for out of a technical test, and why getting it right is maybe 1% of the grade.","I hate coding questions, and give exactly one question to people - but there's many, many reasons why I do so.

It is in a screen-shared environment, where I tell the person they can ask me absolutely anything, and we talk through the problem and work out a solution collaboratively.  Half an hour tops, no take-homes, and it's the second half of a two-step interview process (once for HR to make sure you're sapient, once with me for what I'm looking for).

I give them a reasonably hard problem - I have a d20 I spin to pick the question, and all are roughly the same difficulty.  I tell them, ""it is a collaborative test - let's plan it together, and I'll let you write it.  Ask as many questions as you can think of - there is no such thing as too much, and describe your thought processes and plans as you look through the prompt"".

What happens next, usually, is reading the question, thinking of some ideas, and then asking some clarifying questions before beginning to plan out a solution of some type.

**#1**:  The ability to recognize a problem as a specific class or subtype of problem.  This is for experienced roles mostly, but I pick leetcode questions that have sub-problems that tend to pop up when doing ETL (Extract/Transform/Load) operations, so recognizing how hard something is (If it's a search-like of O(log(n)), or a sort-like of O(nlog(n)), what have you) and what kinds of solutions work in that context is great!

**#2**:  The ability to clearly and concisely explain your understanding of a problem and the structure of possible solutions in a way that's understandable both to a fellow professional, and bonus points if you can simplify it to layman's terms.  Communication and comprehension is unbelievably important in this field, and if you can't explain yourself, and can't understand project specifications, then it doesn't matter how talented you are at implementation - it'll be a struggle to point you in the right direction!

**#3**:  Asking questions!  Especially with how bad documentation has been at some places I've been - this is what has caused the highest attrition rate of developers I've worked with: silently struggling, and silently failing.  Everyone wants to be an island of productivity, but it is very hard as a newbie!  An experienced developer can sometimes, in one minute, save a newer person an hour, just by knowing the exact right thing to do or look at.  Experienced devs, in any shop worth its salt, are perfectly aware of the expectation of mentorship and advisory - and that plays into #2 very closely, as it's hard to be an advisor if you can't explain things!

And yes, I've had interviewees ask, ""What's the answer?"",  to which I excitedly would say the name of the algorithm (Edit Distance? ""Levenshtein!"", I'd say), only to, for some reason, get modest disappointment in return.  If they were especially determined, they'd ask what a good implementation of it would be, and I'd describe in general terms how small parts of it would work, watching for when they're able to complete the puzzle themselves.

I've also had interviewees ask, ""Can I google some stuff?"", to which I always answer, ""yes, of course - you'll always have google at work!"".  If they're really struggling and we're about 10 minutes in, I'll mention that it's open-internet, and see how they research and learn independently.  Because yes, while asking questions is important,

**#4**: Ability to research and learn independently is also very important.

If they destroy my problem without much effort, I'll half-heartedly ask an implementation question about what is, but shouldn't be, a relatively obscure API (the FHIR CMS Meaningful Use API standard) and ask them to do some quick (<5 min) research to check for comprehension - the ability to learn is the ability to stay relevant in a developer's world, ultimately.  And if they can, without existing knowledge, learn of a solution, comprehend it and implement it, that leads to

**#5**:  The ability to plan a solution, and then execute on it

Ultimately, it does come down to your ability to understand a problem and come up with a solution.  If your theory is sound, but you get stuck on the implementation, but it's just stupid syntax bullshit or easy-to-miss variable name mismatching, I'll grade you more highly than someone who copy-pastes the solution and can't explain it.  If I didn't value peoples' time, I'd absolutely do a follow-up question that involved using the exact same solution in a different way, but what I test for seems pretty thorough as it is.

**#6**:  Mood.  When a problem seems hopeless, do you give up, or are you determined?  Does a problem excite you?  When you're stuck, do you reach out for help, or shut down?  If I suggest that there might be a problem on a certain line (with almost that exact wording), do you look at it, fix it and go ""oh sweet thanks"", or do you get defensive/combative about it?  Do you have an ego, or are you able to be wrong and thrilled to learn from your mistakes?

&#x200B;

I've been doing this for a couple years - and I'm sure others have way more experience than me, so feel free to ask me anything, or disagree with anything so I can learn! :D",2022-12-08 17:47:42
v3xxqf,UPDATE (again): Just got fired. What to do next?,"Hey everyone!  About eight months ago, [I was fired](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oz52ww/just_got_fired_what_to_do_next/) for what I thought was a pretty minor infraction of company policy (I loaned a $100 voucher for merchandise to my spouse when only I was supposed to use it.) In my [last update](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qv7shz/update_just_got_fired_what_to_do_next/), I mentioned I had rebounded, joining a great company and increasing my total compensation from $110k to $205k.

As another update, the company I've been with has been absolutely great with an amazing culture and awesome teammates, but the stock price has taken a hit, so I was a little open to considering other options.  Out of the blue, a FAANG recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn and asked if I wanted to go through the interview process.  I figured it wouldn't hurt to at least try, and after a couple interviews I'm pleased to say I've accepted an offer with a FAANG!  Despite being down-leveled from senior to mid-level, my new total compensation is now $315k, which is nearly *triple* what I was getting paid at the place that fired me.

This past year has been a whirlwind and I can't say I'm eager to repeat it, but I'm really excited about this new opportunity!  So, again, if you find yourself unexpectedly fired like me, just know that it's not the end of the world.  In fact, it may be the beginning of something great!

EDIT: As many have pointed it, the title makes it sound like I was fired AGAIN and definitely seems like clickbait.  I promise that wasn't my intention!  I just wanted to give an update to the original post, and since I had already given an update before, I used the word ""again"" in the title.

EDIT 2: Some people think I didn't do any practice for the interview.  That's not true and I didn't mean to give that impression.  I studied very hard for about two weeks, doing about 150 LeetCode questions and going through the whole Grokking the Coding Interview course.  I also read through the systems design chapter in Cracking the Coding Interview and watched supplementary YouTube videos.  In addition, I prepared some pretty extensive notes for behavioral questions.  I just figured it was worth studying anyhow so even if I didn't get the job it was time well spent.",2022-06-03 12:07:13

t5tc7k,The red flags I saw at my job screening yesterday,"Went to an in person job interview for a software developer position. 

It was a software consultant company, but they also do in house development and this is what the position was for. While my interview wasn't stellar (I've been babied by my current job having me do non performance sensitive python dev and graph database stuff and all the questions were about sql, 'what does rest mean', object oriented programming definition questions, and design pattern questions). 

But I noticed a lot of red flags. Thought I'd share them. 

For starters, they emphasize that ramp up will need to be done on personal time. Like, talked about that for ten minutes. 

Gave me sceneries where I had 12 hours left of work do do by tomorrow with only 4 hours left in the day (where the correct answer was to stay until it was finished). 

No option to work remote, in office every day. 

They kept emphasizing that the single most important thing is product being finished by deadlines. They said ""we're working as fast as we can all of the time, so tensions are a little high, but it's good, it makes you sharper"". 

""We have a very diverse team here. Many of our devs are from India and Mexico"" and they had teams IN India and Mexico. To me that says ""we wanted as much cheap labor as possible. They have 45 people working on a single project. They're split into 6 teams but all the teams are identical. They're just split for communication lines. 

Before I even made it back to my car I knew 3 things: that they were going to offer me the job even though I had less .net experience than they wanted, that they were going to offer me about 10k lower than the listed salary for the position, and that they were going to cite my inexperience and act like ""you're lucky, we're making an exception and hiring you anyway"". 

Within 3 hours all 3 of those had come true. 

Obviously I'm going to turn them down",2022-03-03 14:54:52

xpnxy2,"My Job Hunt as a Software Engineer with 5 YOE, 100k to 290k TC.","# TL;DR
CS Bachelors with 5 YOE looking to switch jobs. Prepped for 5 months, passed 5/6 onsites and improved TC from 100k to 290k.

#Background
I have a CS Bachelors and 5 YOE, all at a large financial services company. I'd previously solved around ~100 LC problems on on a different account back when I was looking for my first SE job (The site probably had ~300 problems total back then, oh how times have changed...)

November of last year I started casually doing problems, about a few per month. I didn't start seriously studying until April, when I started studying System Design and did ~400 problems over the course of 5 months. I started applying to jobs in July and interviewed in August.
 
# Methodology
## LeetCode
[My LC stats](https://imgur.com/a/JUrA6vo).
I solved an average of three new problems a day. One or two of these would be from NeetCode 150, until I finished. Instead of topic by topic, I did a different topic every day and cycled through them. I would also redo/look over past problems a day, a week and a month after solving them.

For non-NeetCode problems, I just sorted by interview frequency. In August when I was interviewing/had interviews scheduled, I did company tagged problems, also sorted by frequency.

For each problem, I'd spend anywhere from 10-30 minutes trying to solve it myself, depending on if I thought I was getting anywhere. After that I'd go straight to the answer. NeetCode's are usually the best, there were only a few problems where I preferred other solutions to his. For non-NeetCode problems I would first check if the official LC solution was any good. (it really depends on the Author, you usually can tell right away from the comments) If not, I'd go digging around in the discussion.

A few times a week, I would also try solving a problem exactly how I would during an interview. (Asking questions, annotating what I was doing out loud, using well thought out variable names, commenting everything, going through Big-O out loud).

## System Design
Because my old company is pretty dated tech-wise, I didn't have much experience with System Design despite my 5 YOE. I started off reading [DDIA](https://dataintensive.net/), but decided after a few chapters it was too dense and not great ROI from an interviewing perspective. However, it was a great read and I will go back to it at some point. 

I ended up reading the intro in [Alex Xu's System Design book](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF), as well as the topics in [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) to gain some basic knowledge.

I then went through the examples in the Alex Xu book, as well as the ones in [Grokking](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview), for each example I took notes and practiced writing out the APIs, diagram and schemas.

Finally, I went through and watched some mock interviews on the [Exponent youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/exponentTV). These are pretty scripted but I thought they were still a decent representation of what an actual interview is like.

This prep brought from zero to pretty comfortably giving SE2 system design interviews, and I was even up-leveled at one of the companies I interviewed at.

## Behavorial
I made sure I had 2 stories for each of the common Rainforest Leadership Principles, about 15 total with overlap. For all other companies I just adapted my Rainforest stories on the fly.

# Job Hunt
In total I submitted ~50 applications at ~25 companies. They were all through either recruiters, or applying directly on the Company site. Some notable ones below:

Company|Result
:--|--:
Rainforest | Offer (L5)
Audible|Offer (L5)
Bloomberg | Offer (SSE)
Capital One | Offer (SSE)
Dropbox | Rejected (Resume Screen)
Google| Ghosted by Recruiter
Lyft | Rejected (Onsite)
Microsoft|Rejected (Resume Screen)
Spotify | Canceled Onsite
Toast|Offer (SSE)
Twitter|Rejected (Resume Screen)
Uber|Canceled Phone Screen

I ended up passing 5 of the 6 onsite loops I attended. After negotiating with the competing offers I had, I accepted one at 290k TC, Boston HCOL.

# Thoughts and Takeaways
These are all just my opinions, please take them with a grain of salt!

* LC premium is worth it. While not all the solutions will be like this, there were some that alone justified the entire cost, as they solidified my understanding of certain concepts.

* Over-studied Dynamic Programming.
 * DP never really clicked for me, despite dedicating a large amount of time and trying various resources.
 * Out of all the problems I encountered between OAs, Phone Screens and On-sites, I only received a single DP problem, which was really an optimally greedy problem with a DP solution.
 * I could have just gotten lucky, it could also be a different story if you are interviewing with Google.

* Under-studied Arrays and Strings.
 * I feel like these are sometimes glossed over since they are more ""basic"" data structures and I was guilty of this myself.
 * At least a third of the problems (with probably another third being DFS/BFS problems) I received were Array/String related, with no special data structure/algorithm beyond that.

* Overall I was overprepped for algos. Case in point, for graphs I made sure I was comfortable with Union-Find, Djiktra's, Bellman-Ford, Kruskal's, Prim's, and was seriously considering some of the more obscure ones as well. I used these algorithms a grand total of 0 times during my interviews.

 * If your interviewer is having a really bad day could they give you a problem that needs some obscure algorithm to solve? Sure, but I feel like the overall ROI from knowing these is quite low, and the time would be better spent making sure you're really confident in the two granddaddy algorithms DFS and BFS, especially if you don't have as long as I did to prepare.

* Communication is extremely important! Coming from a consulting background I feel like the bar on this for SEs isn't all that high, so being a strong communicator will definitely allow you to stand out. If you aren't comfortable in this, I suggest doing mocks with friends/coworkers, or looking for people in NeetCode's discord. 

* One upside to Rainforest's ridiculous emphasis on LPs is that it overprepares you for other behavorial interviews, I definitely felt like my behavorial interviews gave me a leg up. If you're not interviewing with Rainforest but are just looking for a structured way to prep for Behavorial, it honestly wouldn't be a bad idea to create stories for the common ones.

* Following the advice in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ujjhpi/not_all_can_make_top_5_salaries_by_definition_but/) was great for negotiating.

* Finally, for those on the grind for their first position, I promise it gets better! The difference between my first job and second job was truly night and day.

This bloomberg, but i removed the paywall. Apparently the knuckleheads made a slack and forgot to make it private. They want to fire half the staff before the quarterly RSUs (Which are now bonuses) vest. I'd expect a class action lawsuit over this. Likely they will have to pay for part of the bonuses in some settlement, but that will take years.

https://twitter.com/alexeheath/status/1587959746576850945

you can find others. 

Musk saddled Twitter with $13 billion debt when took the company private. This is called a leveraged buyout. So now twitter has to make money while also servicing these massive debts. Leveraged buyouts always lead to massive job losses, benefit cuts, pay cuts, and then higher prices. Since they need others to pay off their debts. 

If you ever work somewhere and there is discussion of taking the company private or spinning off your division (they buyout themselves and saddle themselves with debt), start looking for a new job immediately.

this kind of thing happened before. When I was in school I read a business case about Safeway. They were profitable, but some investors saw an opportunity to break the union. They took out loans to buy out safeway to make it private. then sat down with the unions. they showed them the books. Now that the company is heavily in debt, we cannot service the debts if you do not accept massive pay and benefit cuts. if we dont pay the debts, the banks come in and shut the company down and sell it off for scraps.

so its pay cuts or you are all fired. safeway today pays far less than it used to long time back.",2022-11-03 18:00:20

3 managers, in total took 8 weeks day off in December for their family/vocation/errands.

I am oncall again this week, trying my best to help with tickets, yet these 2 person really just pumped my blood pressure to the sky.

Person A: pinged me on slack in early morning asking for help debugging, I didn't reply. Went straightly sending me an email and CC'ed a bunch of managers asking why I didn't help. Turned out they misspelled the name of the package they were git pushing to and my team doesn't even own it.

Person B: pinging me multiple times a day asking for update on a ticket, been told I was working on multiple tickets, started questioning me ""is there anything more important than mine?"". Told them I could not give estimite finish time because it is a huge ticket and needs days of work and I am the only one working on this, then straight went into the ticket and comment ***my name*** is not cooperative and all the teammates on their team circle jerking themselves on the ticket.

I fking hate this company

(edit: I am lucky to have good teammates, they are all burnt out just like me, management know little about development, they only care about operation. Other teams in the org use us like their go-to wiki/Q&A/something similar when they encounter slight discomfort.

thanks for all the comments suggesting me to stop victimizing and stand up for myself. I really haven't found a good way to do it as the whole org is pretty pushy on engineers and im on visa, not so easy to jump ship as u/[cookies50796](https://www.reddit.com/user/cookies50796/) guessed

I find these jokes funny but recently I've seen people that actually believe this stuff. They somehow think that companies pay developers top money because developers are lucky or other people still haven't found out that developers are paid well and they somehow don't come to our field (which doesn't even require any degrees!).

No my friend. Software engineering is so damn hard. I'm not saying it's rocket science but you have to keep yourself up to date because sometimes technologies deprecate a few times in a decade, you should have a great overview of how computers work (I know dozens of doctors who can't properly work with Instagram let alone understanding its complexities under the hood), you need to be great at problem-solving, you must to be 100% comfortable in English. you can hardly find a more complex and abstract (in a technical sense) job.

wx9g5g,Start applying months BEFORE you graduate. Not months after.,"Every day in this subreddit there's someone saying they can't find a job, and when asked, turns out they only started applying after graduation. sometimes months after.

One last summer vacation on your last year of college as if you are still a student isn't worth the risk of being unemployed for months. it isn't worth delaying getting your first salary by months, your first raise, your first promotion, your first job hop. After years, this will cost you hundreds of thousands.

If you have are working on your master thesis and have no classes, and it's going well, you could even start applying 6 months before and start working before you graduate,

if you still have classes, you can start applying 2-3 months before graduating, and ask for your starting date to be a few weeks / one month after your last exams if you want to have a bit of a vacation.

ts89li,I was offered money to get a job for someone else,"Just wanted to share an interesting experience I just had.

3 weeks ago, a seasoned reddit user sent me a private message asking me if I would like to interview as someone else against a bit of money. The deal is: I join the zoom interview without video, record it, and pretend to be their candidate. I would get paid $200 per interview. That's a terrible deal, I don't see why I would jeopardize my professional reputation in that way, but I agreed out of curiosity.

The conversation continued on WhatsApp, with what appears to be the big brain of the operation. A guy asks me for my referral, LinkedIn, checks that I'm actually a software engineer, and asks for an audio recording.

3 weeks go by without hearing from them, and yesterday they told me I had an interview scheduled. I'm supposed to be Kevin, from Connecticut. I have no clue in what world the scam could work, since I'm french, and my accent is... well, I won't comment on my accent but it's a bit different from the Connecticut accent.

Anyway, I joined the meeting and the interviewers were quite surprised to see my face (Kevin is black; I'm not). I explained to them that they were being scammed and went back to my tennis session. I wasn't hired :(

Given the recent trend of layoffs, and investor pressure on founders to ""get fit"", there seems to be a sense that lower salaries and slashing of benefits is going to be more common in the industry going forward.  Some are wondering if the 2010s was a unique golden age in the labor market for engineers that we're not likely to return to. 

If that's the case, it begs the question of why more of us don't organize. So I thought I would resurface the question given these recent events, as it hasn't been asked for a while.",2022-12-21 21:00:48

s93y4x,You probably shouldn't get a PhD,"Imagine you had a million dollars of cash right in front of you. 10,000 Benjamins, all neatly stacked up, all yours for the taking. Now light a match and throw it. 

This is basically the equivalent of pursuing graduate studies in computer science. Most people who are in PhD programs are competent, intelligent folks who could easily land a high-paying tech job if they wanted to. Instead they choose to squalor in academia for the better part of a decade. 

There is no guarantee that a PhD is good for your career. If you are exceptional, you might have a shot at a coveted research scientist position at a major company. But realistically, very few people, even among those competent enough to complete a PhD, are this good. For every such story, there are other not-so-successful stories. People who've done their PhDs and are now in the CRUD job market competing with 22-year-old new graduates, or working as untenured adjuncts or lecturers at colleges.

If you're truly talented—and by that I mean at the very top of your class, with multiple papers published as an undergrad, and it's clear that you're a gifted person who will almost certainly make a mark in your field as a researcher—a PhD might be a worthwhile investment. Everyone wants to think that they're this talented, but they're not. Academia is littered with genuinely _very_ intelligent people (who, again, would easily be able to get hired in most industry SDE positions) who unfortunately just aren't good enough to compete in the academic job market with others who are, quite frankly, literal geniuses. No one wants to acknowledge this, because we insist on the notion that everyone's equally talented, which is false. 

In brief, you're spending your entire youth living in poverty at the bottom of the academic totem pole, going through with an immense financial and opportunity cost in the form of a delayed career, and, the kicker is, it is very probable that you'll get _absolutely no_ return on this huge investment.

I'm in my mid-twenties now. I did everything right, or so I thought. I got excellent grades in undergrad, and I was accepted to a decent PhD program. I'm in my second year of that. My peers and professors are reasonably good (many others cannot say the same, mind you — academia is rife with abuse of graduate students). But I'm not really enjoying it, and somehow I'm incredibly uncertain about what happens next. I'm also in a financially dubious situation, to say the least, surviving off graduate school stipends with some extra help from my parents. I also have around 40k of student loan debt. 

Meanwhile, my friends and acquaintances, who I used to best academically, are working at lucrative tech jobs. They're buying apartments, cars, getting engaged, and, quite simply, growing up. They're adults now, and I feel like I'm still a kid in my nineteenth-grade of school. 

This was all a big mistake. Don't be me. 

Don't go to graduate school, unless you're an actual demonstrated genius, or you come from a silver spoon and can afford to spend 5-6 years doing something just because you think it's ""adventurous"" or ""intellectually rewarding"".",2022-01-21 06:06:30
t2tdrq,Thoughts and Lessons from a 22 Year Career in Tech,"I've been a professional developer for over 22 years now and thought I'd share some of my experiences and knowledge learned over that time. Sorry it's long, but you can skip to the important bits at the bottom.

From the time I was 6 years old and played my first video game (Missile Command) I knew I was going to be a programmer. I didn't set out to make money; writing code was the only thing that made sense to me. So I went to college for CS. 

I graduated right before Y2K and got a job for 42K and moved to Austin. I know this sounds ridiculous today, but it was *really* good money. I was an excellent CS student (3.7 GPA) from a very good engineering school, and I interview well. Among my CS friends only my roommate was making more (49K). After a year I got bumped up to 49K too because ""salaries were going crazy!"" and they didn't want me to jump ship.

Life felt good! I liked the company, and my coworkers were my best friends. I had a lot of shit going on in my life (marriage, divorce, other peoples mental illnesses, death in the family, etc.) and the job was very stable. I didn't notice for a *loooong* time, but the work really sucked. I was doing desktop development in C (notice the lack of ++) on a legacy app that was started in 1986. Eventually I got my life in order and I realized that I'd already spent ***13 years*** at a job I actually hated but hadn't realized, because it was the only thing in my life that made sense. I was making 82K a year at this point and had been promoted twice (note: this is a very bad sign).

I'd been playing around with JavaScript, writing little browser games, Greasemonkey extensions, etc., and I really liked it. I decided I should become a web developer. Deciding to do this is one thing; getting a job doing it is another. You can imagine how hard companies are fighting to hire experienced devs with zero professional experience for their entry level WebDev jobs. I studied and practiced and talked/interviewed with two dozen companies over a solid year. Finally I found a startup-ish company that was willing to give me an offer -- the interview had zero coding so I aced it! I'd been with my previous company for 14 years and again was making 82K a year. The new one offered me 85 (benefits were worse) and I negotiated to 90 (**ALWAYS NEGOTIATE**!).

I walked into my new job at 8AM on day one and the dev room was empty. 30 minutes later another guy walked in. It was his first day too. An hour later our manager walked in. Turns out the other two developers had quit or been fired the previous Friday. Our manager was completely non-technical -- hence the zero coding interview. This sounds like a disaster, and it was, but it was also an amazing way to start. No senior devs to tell us not to do anything, so we did what we wanted, broke shit, fixed more shit and generally molded the tech stack the way we liked. After 3 years in that job I had been promoted to manager of the team, hired 8 devs and I was the big fish in a very small pond. I was making 120K.

That's when a big company expanding into the cloud space came knocking looking for experienced front-end devs. After some intense negotiations I jumped ship, and my TC hit 185K. Life actually was good. Now I was in a massive org with all the incumbent politics and nonsense that comes along with that. However, I was working with people much smarter than me (you never lose imposter syndrome folks) and had an amazing manager, and I actually felt pretty confident in the work I was doing for once. Our stock almost tripled over the next couple years and I got some good raises and my TC hit 235K. I got promoted to Staff engineer and expected the big money to finally come in. I got a 10K raise, but refreshers were piddling. I'd vested all my initial stock and my TC dipped back down to 220K.

In December I realized that while this company had been paying top of market when I started, the market had moved and they weren't near the top anymore. Corona and fully remote companies had changed the game and salaries were insane. I started interviewing in January with a mix of late stage unicorn startups and some bigger companies. I could get my foot in the door with anybody now (except Amazon who just rejected me outright without even a phone screen lol). Google and Meta were calling *me.* I could afford to be picky. I spent my nights and weekends in January doing some LC and more studying JS fundamentals. It sucked, but it was worth it (although I probably studied too much in the end).

This week I accepted an offer for 385K TC with a company that ticked all of the boxes for me (pay, WLB, low-stress, room to grow, some ""namebrand"" status) despite the fact that I got kinda down-leveled. For a tier-2 location (Austin), I'm at the very top of their pay scale which made up for that. For 22yoe this isn't amazing these days, but I only really have 8 years of relevant experience, so it still feels pretty good.

Lessons and things I wished I'd known from the beginning:

* Don't stay somewhere out of loyalty or because you like your coworkers. You can still be friends with them.
* Don't be afraid to switch career paths/specializations if you'll be happier or more interested in the work.
* If you aren't getting promoted at least every 4 years something is wrong. Change yourself, your group, or your company.
* Nobody values you more than the company that doesn't have you. Job hop if you want to make big bucks.
* Everything is negotiable. Be a hardass in negotiations and never take the first offer, even if it's more than you expected. If you don't feel comfortable, pay a negotiating service like Levels to help you.
* Everything you do in your free time can help your career, so never stop learning and playing around with new technology.
* You're going to have a lot of setbacks, and fail *a lot* of interviews. Try not to get discouraged, learn from the experience and try again.
* Most people are average. Half your co-workers probably think *you're* the guy who knows everything. Don't let imposter syndrome hold you back.",2022-02-27 17:39:58
sut4bg,"I'm a fairly inexperienced, mediocre programmer and I was just offered a $130k software job waaaay above my league. How do I succeed (not get fired)?","I just got a job offer at a bootstrapped, financially stable but rapidly growing mature start-up, with the position of full stack engineer for a website that's coded in languages which I have little to no familiarity with, with limited mentorship opportunities (the point of the hire was to relieve the CEO of their engineering responsibilities).

I'm not a particularly good software developer, neither on paper nor by aptitude. I was very forthright during the interviews of my limitations, ostensibly to communicate to them to not waste their time, but I think the CEO took it as a ""Wowie wow! This boy's got gumption!""   
This time last year I was long-term unemployed having graduated right before Covid, with no internships, fat, and making chocolates as a hobby (Which is how I got fat; for those building a mental image of me, I am no longer fat (Pinky promise)). I then spent about six months at a janky start up (Where issues with my performance *had* been mentioned), which I learned a *lot* in thanks to a great mentor, but after which I was furloughed due to funding difficulties. I've spent the past few months unemployed but much less depressed. 


The prospect of raking in ~$500 a day pre-tax, fully remote, with various perks is obviously too good to pass off but I'm nervous as hell. I guess I can take a head start and take a few Udemy courses before I plunge in the deep end but I still feel like at some point I'm going to reach my competency ceiling. I can write neat code, but at the startup I was given the task of integrating AWS and was absolutely overwhelmed until they brought in a dedicated AWS guy.

xy0kfl,Landing a job has nothing to do with technical skills,"Piggybacking off [the discussion in this post](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xxg9ag/now_i_understand_why_it_took_me_so_long_to_land/) to give some advice to those frustrated with landing an internship or full time interview. 

___

First, a bit of background:

1.	Went to a medium sized university with a mediocre CS program
2.	Landed an internship at a large non-software company in their IT department from going to a career fair
3.	Upon graduating, had an offer from Amazon for SWE and an offer from the company I interned at, among others not worth mentioning
4.	Took the cushiony non-software company position and couldn’t be happier. Years later, I’m very involved in our college recruiting process. 


Based off the above, I would like to think that I’ve figured out the important pieces to landing an interview relatively well. The biggest advice I can give is as follows:


**Landing an Interview**

As pointed out in the aforementioned post, most job openings have hundreds of applicants, of which only a handful get interviewed. Usually those in the handful have referrals. A referral does *not* necessarily mean your friend or family member works at the company. The most common referral, in my experience, is one where a recruiter got a positive impression of a candidate and passed their resume along with a positive note. 

-	Go to career fairs, events, clubs, etc. Even if you hate meeting new people, find a way to get yourself out there. Quantify it, gamify it, whatever you need. 
-	At career fairs, have copies of your resume to hand out, and use the resources on this sub and elsewhere to make your resume stand out. 
-	I feel like I shouldn’t have to say this, but PLEASE, take a shower and put on a business casual outfit for any networking. It’s astonishing how many unpresentable people we see at career fairs. If you can’t put in the effort to present yourself, we damn well won’t be hiring you. 
-	Smile, make eye contact, stand up straight, speak with confidence. Many take these things for granted as they come naturally, but for those that they don’t, practice these things. 
-	Follow up! If you met a recruiter, gave them your resume, and had a quick convo, reach out to them on LinkedIn! It puts your name in their head again, and shows your interest in the position. 

While most of these may seem obvious, the overarching theme is this: landing the interview has almost nothing to do with your resume, and everything to do with networking. I hate that it’s true, but I would rather hire a personable, outgoing, mid-tier student than a technical genius who can’t communicate. 


**Passing the Interview**

Once you’ve got the interview, you’ve already beat 90-95% of applicants (pulled that number out of my ass but still), so go into it with *confidence.*

-	If you’re remote, have your resume open. When answering questions you can refer to your experience directly on your resume, asking the interviewer to do the same. “If you have my resume handy, position X mentions Y. In that role…” This is huge, you’re painting a picture of yourself and your experience, help us use the tools available to paint that picture. 
-	Smile, make eye contact, stand up straight, laugh if they make a joke, share an anecdote where appropriate, etc. Most companies are hiring for culture fit, so rather than getting bogged down by the details, show that you’re someone they would enjoy working with. 
-	For technical interviews: vocalizing your thought process is #1, so practice this. Also, if you don’t know an answer, share how you would find it. In my Amazon technical interview I didn’t get a working solution at all, and literally said “if I was solving this for work rather than for an interview I would google ‘<exact query>’.” I “failed” the technical interview, but still got a handsome swe offer because of the other things. 
-	Show that you have a passion for tech. If you aren’t passionate about it and just want a paycheck, *pretend.* 


Hopefully this helps, and I will be glad to answer any questions! At the end of the day, there are countless applicants, many with great resumes, and many with awful resumes - the main thing that will set you apart is everything that isn’t on your resume. Hell, the #1 candidate I’m looking at right now has 0 relevant experience, but he was the most enjoyable to talk to, showed a passion for problem solving and tech, and showed he’s eager to learn. It’s the intangibles that count!


Edit: 
I definitely should’ve worded my title differently - it’s not so much that you can be a great person with no technical expertise and land a SWE role. It is more so that the technical skills you build are your foundation, but that is the same foundation every other grad is building. The tips above are things that allow you to differentiate yourself from all the other qualified resumes in the stack. 

Also should’ve mentioned in experience that I interviewed with multiple FANG companies and countless tech-adjacent/non-tech companies during my undergrad. The Amazon role and my current role (which includes recruiting) were just most relevant anecdotally.

Finally, this is just my advice from my experiences - by no means do I think this is all encompassing, but I hope it helps a student or two land a job!",2022-10-07 14:27:28

I’ve participated in hackathons throughout my time in university and I have a few decent personal projects to show for it. I’m staying in my hometown in the Midwest after graduation, so moving elsewhere in the US was not an option. 

Last summer, I interned at a non-tech F500 company in my hometown. I really enjoyed working there, and they offered me a job at the end of the summer. Although the compensation was below average (67k salary + 6k signing bonus + 15% annual bonus = 83k total compensation) according to my school’s career services department, I really liked the people I worked with and I thought I would get promoted quickly. They had a good IC track for a non-tech company. 

I’ve followed this sub for a while, and I decided to follow some of the common advice for my LinkedIn profile. I changed my profile picture to one of me in a t-shirt while I was on vacation, my banner to a local landmark in my hometown, my title to “Aspiring Software Engineer”, and my about section so it highlighted my technical interests, experience, and coursework. I removed all of the bullshit in my skills section (bye bye C from low-level programming, Ruby and Rails from my web apps class, and HTML because I already have CSS and JS in there). I also filled out the rest of my profile thoroughly. I occasionally got messages from recruiters for companies in the Midwest, but none of them were particularly enticing.

Then, I got a message from a tech company about a fully remote position. I checked levels.fyi and saw that I could be making 6 figures! I went through the phone screen, hiring manager interview, and two technical interviews. I studied for technical interviews for two days by reviewing the Wikipedia pages on basic DS&A and completing around 20 LeetCode easy problems. The hiring manager said the technical interviews wouldn’t be too intense and that informed my studying methods. Yesterday I accepted a job offer (103k salary + 10k signing bonus + 12% annual bonus + 7.5k RSUs per year = 133k total compensation)!

TLDR: I had a non-tech F500 SWE job lined up for after graduation, but I got a way better SWE job at a tech company because a recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn. Use tools like LinkedIn and levels.fyi to your advantage!

EDIT: Perhaps some of that LinkedIn advice is not from this subreddit. I searched around and can’t seem to find some of it. Here’s an [article](https://www.linkedin.com/business/sales/blog/profile-best-practices/17-steps-to-a-better-linkedin-profile-in-2017) with some of the advice I mentioned.",2022-02-12 14:26:01
zps78o,"With the recent layoffs, it's become increasingly obvious that what team you're on is really important to your job security","For the most part, all of the recent layoffs have focused more on shrinking sectors that are less profitable, rather than employee performance. 10k in layoffs didn't mean ""bottom 10k engineers get axed"" it was ""ok Alexa is losing money, let's layoff X employees from there, Y from devices, etc..."" And it didn't matter how performant those engineers were on a macro level.


So if the recession is over when you get hired at a company, and you notice your org is not very profitable, it might be in your best interest to start looking at internal transfers to more needed services sooner rather than later. Might help you dodge a layoff in the future",2022-12-19 13:54:27
t2c8za,What's the worst mistake you made at work?,"I'll go first. 

I was 3 weeks into my first job. I was tasked to soft remove some users from one of our client's database. I was careless and forgot to start with a begin statement before running my SQL query. This wouldn't have been that bad had my query been correct. But of course, I fucked up the condition in my query. It ended up removing ALL users. I only noticed my mistake when my query was hanging for far too long and production issues started popping up on slack. We ended up having to rollback the database and restore from one of our backup databases.

Everything was fine in the end. It was a pretty frightening experience as a new hire, but my coworkers had a good laugh over it. I'm still surprised they allowed me access to production data so early on. But now I will NEVER forget to use a begin statement.",2022-02-27 01:13:56

wcu4pl,Let’s all be a bit nicer to each other here,"I have been active on this sub for a long time now, and I always enjoyed helping out people around here by answering questions.

I don’t know what happened, but I noticed that large increase in hostility and toxic behavior around here in recent months.

I’ve noticed a lot of people jumping straight to personal attack as an opening of a disagreement. I’ve seen people assuming the worst motivation from anyone when they see an opinion they don’t like. A somewhat polarizing thread last night resulted in OP getting personally attacked and receiving rude DMs and even a troll post poking fun of him. Thankfully mods brought it under control.

There is a reason why a lot of experienced people stopped contributing to this sub. You say something people don’t *want* to hear and you are instantly made the target of a pitchfork mob.

Just because the downvote button is there doesn’t mean someone has to use it. We are software engineers. There are always 5 opinions among the 3 of us. Disagreement is in our nature, but let’s disagree without being disagreeable.

But people get such a boner from assigning someone to be the “shitty bad guy” and then go to town on them. People saying the “wrong” answers fall victim to that, and so do people asking the “wrong” questions.

Recently I was telling someone that if they finished their tasks way early in the day then they can consider reach out to the team and see if anyone can use any help. Someone immediately replied with “you must be a shitty manager trying to exploit people and I feel sorry anyone who has to work for a piece of shit like you”.

That’s the day I took off my “manager” flair. The amount of toxicity I see on this sub in a month is more than the total of what I’ve seen in my entire professional career, across 8 different jobs, ranging from startups to pre-IPO unicorns to multiple FAANGs.

But precisely because of that, I know vast majority of you guys aren’t like this in real life. Internet brings out the worst of people (damn our predecessors for inventing the damn thing lol), but I really think this sub can do better, because I’ve seen it being better.

xe1izp,I feel dumb for thinking this way,"When I was looking for jobs for my current role, I focused on jobs that I met the requirements for, like at least 80-90% of the requirements or I didn't bother applying. This means that I only applied for jobs where I had some knowledge of the listed tech stack and skills. My reasoning was that I didn't want to be a burden to the team I joined and I somehow felt like I wouldn't get the job without some of the skills listed. I ended up in a role that I have quickly grown out of with no clear upward path. 

In the meantime, I have watched as the company hired people with literally zero knowledge of our tech stack or the tools we use with the full expectation that it will take them 6 months or longer to become useful to the team. These are people getting paid senior level dev salaries to literally learn/study for 6 months before they're expected to meaningfully contribute. I feel like a complete moron for thinking that I was expected to hit the ground running as a new employee when I could've just been getting paid six figures to learn for half a year.",2022-09-14 13:06:27
uurkw4,I broke production and now my tech lead says he doesn't trust me,"So, long story short, I was in charge of writing a data migration script that I had been testing on my local DB. It looked like everything was working properly, so I went on to the next step which was testing the script in a staging environment so that the results could be checked by others. This is where the fuck up happened. I pasted the address to the remote DB environment, but forgot to change the name of the DB to the staging name. It just so happens that the local DB name is the same as the name on production so the script ended up corrupting data. Production was down for about 10 hours, but we were able to roll everything back without losing any data. By the way, this script was running from my local testing environment, so dev environments can reach production at this company. There are no safeguards in place. 

This is the one and only time I have ever done anything like this, but now my tech lead is acting as if I do this kind of thing constantly. I'm now being micromanaged, and being threatened with being put on PIP. My tech lead even said to me, ""I don't trust you to not do this kind of thing now.""

ttgmlr,"Why Companies Reward Job Hopping, an Example","I feel like it's a meme in here about how companies are too dumb to pay their high performers market value and if only companies were smarter we wouldn't have to job hop as much. I'll argue that it's actually extremely rational with an example that happened with a colleague and I.

I've worked at a large bank for 2 years now (8 yoe total), I was hired as a senior and pretty quickly was doing the work of a lead, at the end of the year I got the promotion to lead, a decent bonus, but only a 5% raise. The end of last year I was told they put in a request for promotion to senior lead and that was declined but I still got a 12% raise and a decent bonus. I got the feeling I was underpaid and interviewed around, and got a comp increase of roughly 30% on top of my recent raise as a senior dev for a tech company. When asked whether they could get me to stay I said I wanted a 50% raise from my current salary. They came back with a counter of 30%, pretty much exactly matching my offer. When I said no they were shocked. At the time I didn't realize why.

Now in my notice period I had a lot of good conversations with coworkers about careers and what we want out of the career including money, responsibilities, etc. I've always been very open to sharing salaries but being a bank people are a lot more conservative about stuff like that. Now that I was leaving I exchanged salaries with many on my team and honestly I was shocked how low some of the more senior team members were paid. One colleague we'll call him Jeff, had been at the company for 15 years and was promoted to lead the year after I was. Basically the two of us were leading the two biggest projects on the most high-profile team, had about 4 juniors soft reporting to us, and I think he was slightly better technically than me but I think I had a slight edge in leadership/communication skills. So wow was I shocked to find that Jeff's total comp was under half of what mine was. He basically said he knew he was underpaid, even with his promotion he got like 5% (less than inflation) and other years have been 2-3%, and he said he'd been interviewing around. A week later he gets an offer for a much more technical role being a specialist in the exact technology he wanted to use, and the salary was almost triple his current salary.

Jeff turned it down. He said he makes enough to live comfortably, and that the current job is super great job security, he's the sole breadwinner in the household with 2 kids and a mortgage, so if he flamed out and was fired it could cause a huge problem with their finances. He said maybe he'll ask his boss for a raise when I leave. But they're obviously going to say no and/or handwave about maybe getting him something at year end, and that's when the counter to my offer and their reaction to me declining sort of clicked for me. The average employee is terrified of change and terrified of the unknown. Now while I think this example is extreme, I think most people would stay at their job even if they knew they could get 30% more elsewhere. And companies know this. 

Companies don't underpay because they're dumb, they underpay because they know that for the vast majority of workers, they don't need to be paid market value to stay. My boss said he tried to get a 50% raise counter, and that if my offer letter had been for 50% more he thought they could have gotten it. But from HR's point of view, 99% of workers will not leave if there's no pay increase, so they basically thought my 50% was a bluff and I'd be delighted to get the raise I wanted and also keep my current job and stability. Also the counter came quickly, they knew I was underpaid and they were quite happy to pay me the extra 30% once they thought I might leave. This is the mentality of companies and it's why they do what they do, not because they're stupid, but because workers are insanely risk averse and they're smart. Maybe they could be a bit better and tailor their comp to people they predict might leave (I'd literally left my old company 2 years ago because they gave me a 30% raise from my old job, so they knew I'd do that if I was underpaid), but as a general policy underpaying people and dealing with the occasional Redditor type who will leave is more profitable than paying every dev their market value.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

Edit: a lot of people explaining that Jeff's decision to turn it down is dumb. If you're one of the people saying that congrats you are both correct and also completely missing the point. Obviously that level of increase is insane to turn down and most wouldn't, but the point is that if an outlier like this exists, obviously there would be plenty of more marginal cases where people would deal with being underpaid by 20, 30, or 50%. Also a major part of it is also the benefits, banks tend to have solid benefits including 401k matching and a pension and he's currently working on a PhD which the company's paying for. But guess what you can use to pay for school as well as any other expense? That's right, more money. But again, the entire point here is that most workers are irrational, so it's the workplaces generally being rational in the face of the irrationality that is causing them to do what they do, not the company being irrational.


Edit 2: people bringing up job security is a myth, but remember this is a large bank. If he's ever laid off he's getting a pretty good severance package unless he sexually harasses someone or the bank goes bankrupt or something.",2022-04-01 02:57:11
v6x1zg,First time involved in the hiring process - here are some thing I've learned finally being on the other side,"* Don't use the indeed resume. IMO it looks very generic and will look exactly like a dozen other resumes . It retrospect it's easy from my perspective why it's hard to get a response on indeed. If you are interested in a company - make sure to use your own resume or maybe apply directly on their website if possible.
* Don't make your resume more than one page. CVs can be different. But resumes - that are more than one page usually reflect negatively on the applicant. EDIT: People disagree with this one. The consensus seems to be if you have <5 years you can keep it to one page. If you are 10+ years two pages may be expected. YMMV
* Don't use super small font to get everything in on one page.
* A list of technologies doesn't really suggest to me that you have experience in those technologies - if possible list technologies used at jobs that you used to create certain products. If you don't have job experience list relevant course work about those technologies and which aspects of those languages your learned about.
* Proof read your resume - A spelling mistake would not necessarily disqualify an applicant - but any points against you hurts.
* A link to a github or portfolio is huge. If I am trying to decide between 3 - 4 resumes - any extra information helps.

I know this is subjective and just my opinions - but I feel bad when I see people say they have sent out dozens of resumes with no response. I think often times it's probably just a bad resume or something else they are unaware of.",2022-06-07 14:24:53
ysnkek,"Well, I just got laid off.","This isn't much of a ""CS career question""; it's more of just something I want to talk about, since a lot of people are going through this as well. Maybe you'll feel better, knowing that someone is in the same boat as you. Or maybe not 🤷‍♂️

As you all may know, big tech companies have been doing large layoffs, and, while I wasn't working for a FAANG company, I did work at a large tech company that, unfortunately, axed a large number of engineers, numbering in the hundreds. I honestly thought that I was going to be alright because my CEO and execs kept on telling us at our all hands meetings that our company would be fine. Lo and behold, when push came to shove, they were wrong and/or lied to us. But, of course, I don't blame them. It's impossible to tell the future, and the market is hard to read. You also don't want people in a state of panic. Rather than complaining about what's happened, I'd rather look towards what's to come. And that's kind of where my issue (?) is.

Should I apply for jobs again? Against FAANG-level mid-to-senior-level engineers? Little old me? Maybe. If I don't try, nothing will happen, and the worst that can happen is a company saying ""no"" and then just moving on to apply to other companies, I guess. But, I've worked at my previous company for two long years. I was never really much of a vacation guy; in my two years, I'd only taken a total of 11 vacation days. But I'm going to take a nice vacation now. A long one. Perhaps one month long. Or two.

I'm probably going to code. I'm probably not. Most likely not. Dunno if this is the right thing to do, but I want to finally take a nice, long rest. I was pretty burnt out, not going to lie, so, while I hate that I don't have a source of income anymore, a part of me is actually relieved that I don't have to work, as difficult as that is to admit. I'm just going to take my time until I feel like my emotions and working soul are back in working order, regardless of how long that would take. Maybe it'll take a year. Idk. Or maybe I'll just do this until my money starts to run thin (which probably won't be long hahaha). Okay, that's it from me. I'm going to go play God of War Ragnarok now. Heard the game is pretty dope. Wishing you all the best.

But many of you have pointed out to me that you're going through the same thing. It's comforting to know that we're all in this together, so thank you for sharing. For those of you who've had experience in the field for a long time (one of you has 30 years!), your advice on taking a well-needed break right now, as hiring is often not great anyways towards the end of Q4/beginning of Q1 was very reassuring to hear. I didn't really show it in this post, but the idea of taking such a long break made me somewhat anxious, but a part of me just knows that I need a break more than anything right now for various reasons. Thank you. Thank you so much. Really. For those of you who are in the same predicament, again, I wish you all the best ❤️

yropb1,Can we talk about how hard LC actually is?,"If you've been on this sub for any amount of time you've probably seen people talking about ""grinding leetcode"". ""Yeah just grind leetcode for a couple weeks/months and FAANG jobs become easy to get."" I feel like framing Leetcode as some video game where you can just put in the hours with your brain off and come out on the other end with all the knowledge you need to ace interviews is honestly doing a disservice to people starting interview prep.

**DS/Algo concepts are incredibly difficult**. Just the sheer amount of things to learn is daunting, and then you actually get into specific topics: things like dynamic programming and learning NP-Complete problems have been some of the most conceptually challenging problems that I've faced.

And then debatably the hardest part: you have to teach yourself everything. Being able to look at the solution of a LC medium and understand why it works is about 1/100th of the actual work of being prepared to come across that problem in an interview. Learning how to teach yourself these complex topics in a way that you can retain the information is yet another massive hurdle in the ""leetcode grind""

Anyways that's my rant, I've just seen more and more new-grads/junior engineers on this sub that seem to be frustrated with themselves for not being able to do LC easies, but realistically it will take a ton of work to get to that point. I've been leetcoding for years and there are probably still easies that I can't do on my first try.

v0rl65,People are starting to lose their minds. My professor was nice enough to bring in a recruiter to answer questions and it was embarrassing,"Long story short, I’m another one of those dime a dozen career changers who’s in a master’s program. Pre-2019, the atmosphere was different. There was a lot of optimism in the air. People were welcoming and encouraging. Lately, this sub and real life conversations sound a lot more grey. We know everybody and their mother wants to switch into tech and there’s extreme saturation at entry level. The economy is at higher than average risk for a recession. VC firms are tightening their belts. There’s already layoffs and hiring freezes happening. 

We’re living in some not so peak times of modern history. We millenials and gen z remember 2008, we survived a historic pandemic, we are living in hyper competitive world, the wealth gap is wider than any other time in modern history, 40 year high inflation, out of control housing costs, increasing prevalence of mental illness, there’s mass shootings and we are lonelier than ever unless you’ve “made it”. But damn, I didn’t realize even my own classmates were on the edge.

In my lecture earlier this week, my professor (who was also a career changer) was nice enough to bring a near-FAANG tech recruiter to answer questions for career changers. People fucking went off at her. It felt more like a disgraced politician being grilled and hammered at a press conference by the media than a civilized Q&A session, which my professor intended. The whining attitudes, impolite/impatient tone of speech, and frustration was visible in the air. I had second hand embarrassment for the recruiter and my professor who were just trying to do a nice gesture.

I’ll be real with y’all, I have fears and concerns in the back of my mind. I have these thoughts that I don’t say aloud and actively suppress. But people literally said my hidden concerns aloud.
- “Since everybody is switching to tech, what will happen to me, even if I build the best projects and ace leetcode?”
- “There has been hiring slowdowns and layoffs, and a recession is coming, what will happen???”
- “Oh man entry level at a no name company has 3000 applicants for a single listing”
- “How the heck do you get entry level experience if you don’t have experience in the first place, 3+ years experience requirement is dumb”
- Whining about automated resume filters and rudely pressing the recruiter on how she filters out resumes.
- Some whining about leetcode and technical interviews
- More concerns and airing out personal insecurities about resumes

Recruiter was definitely put in a tough spot and she’s volunteering her time to be nice. She was not looking 100% comfortable in the moment. However she does take the L for saying “I posted 17 positions and got 14000 applicants” when some visibly distressed guy was talking about some of his frustrations.

I was starry eyed scientist wannabe in undergrad before choosing pharmaceutical research. And I remember my old friends had these premed discussions in real life and showed me some discussions online that were so toxic. I felt like those people were losing their minds. It got to a point where you would get these failed middle aged premeds in biotech companies throwing tantrums and taking their frustrations out at the workplace. 

I’m hoping tech doesn’t go down this route. Because I remember one biotech company I was at, I was even afraid some guy would shoot up the place after he was acting erratic. 

Just some observations I’ve made and just wondering about your opinions. Do you guys feel like people are about to lose their collective shit? It’d be cool to hear what everyone thinks, from vets to noobies like myself.",2022-05-30 03:55:09

s7tgbv,Is anyone else surprised by how many people are incompetent at their jobs?,"The Peter Principle is in full effect! Also, growing up poor, I always assumed that more money meant more competency. Now with 8 years of experience under my belt, I'd break down the numbers as follows:

* 10% of devs are very competent, exceed expectations in every category, and last but not least, they are fantastic people to work
* 20% are competent hard-working employees who usually end up doing the majority of the work
* 50% barely meet acceptable standards and have to be handheld and spoon-fed directions
* 20% are hopeless and honestly shouldn't be employed as a dev

t0g0fw,"Signed up to be a software engineer, job is actually firefighter. Is this normal?","Hey all, I'm just wondering if what I'm experiencing at my job that I've had for two years is normal, or if I'm really better off going someplace else.

My entire team of ~40 people were all hired two years ago to replace an offshore outsourcing company. They left us a diseased, wretched mess of a codebase. It's made it very difficult to implement new features and do bug fixes. All of us have been voicing our concerns to management over the last few years, and we've been trying to do what we can to clean it all up, but we simply were never given time to clean up this tech debt. Management and leadership don't think it's an issue.

Fast forward to today. I realized that I've spent most of my time, especially over the last few months or so, putting out fires 24/7. I'd go as far as to say I don't even do any development anymore, I just put out fires until 7 PM. And these defects are getting harder and harder to solve because the code is completely incomprehensible but we tacked on huge new features anyway. Some of them are caused by our antiquated processes (it can take several days to restart a microservice in one of our test environments, for example), but by and large the cause is that we simply can't make sense of what our existing code does. There is no end in sight and leadership already wants to move on to our next project.

Morale is low. All the engineers I work with agree this is untenable. To make matters worse, we're facing worsening scaling problems because the architects before our time went with the wrong architecture. We haven't figured out how to solve this the right way, because that would require several sprints of design and implementation, which management and leadership won't give us. So we're tacking on more and more hacks and having to resort to more and more desperate measures to fix issues. There have been some bug tickets open for two years but we have no way to fix them because leadership just wants more and more new features as fast as possible.

I fully expect our product to completely fail sometime this year.

Is this normal for software engineering jobs?

so4vr4,It's sad to be from a third world country,"The title says it all. I work remotely for a US company. I earn good money if we compare to the salaries in my country. However, people are ambitious. I am the only latino in my team and I am the most experienced among them, but I am the one who earns the least just because I am from a third world country. I see recent grads making twice as much and I have more years of experience, AWS certifications, Linux certifications, good soft/technical skills.

tjd4s2,"I am a Senior Software Engineer writing cloud and feature code. My company is bleeding talent. How should I word my ""Pay me more or I am leaving too"" email?","I can't ignore the recruiters anymore. I can make a lot more money but I love the people I work with and what we do. So I want ""a lot"" more money. I reckon I could make another $50-$100k. Maybe more.

I am not super confrontational, and until now our bonuses have kept me happy. The product we earn bonuses on is going to lose a lot of value over the next two years, so we are back into the dev cycle for our next release. I would actually love to be a part of the next cycle but I want more money. How do I write this email?

Edit: The ""get an offer contingent"" is missing my point. I am literally just being lazy. They won't fire me and I have zero fear of retribution. Even if they did fire me I can easily not work for a few months. I can make maybe make three phone calls and probably have a better offer by the end of the week with little or no interviews. I am not doing that because I don't want to waste the time of my real professional contacts. I just *actually like my job*. Or I could dance like a monkey and maybe work at a FAANG but I am trying to avoid that crap. And I can. Yes people like me exist.",2022-03-21 14:31:05
v3csra,Are intervieuers supposed to be this honest?,"I started a se internship this week. I was feeling very unprepared and having impostor syndrome so asked my mentor why they ended up picking me. I was expecting some positive feedback as a sort of morale boost but it ended up backfiring on me. In so many words he tells me that the person they really wanted didn't accept the offer and that I was just the leftovers / second choice and that they had to give it to someone. Even if that is true, why tell me that? It seems like the only thing that's going to do is exacerbate the impostor syndrome.",2022-06-02 16:28:55
ua0yt7,Never realized how burnt out I was until I pulled the nuclear option,"I just effectively put in notice of my intent to leave. The amount of relief I am feeling is positively orgasmic. I knew I was stressed at work but.... HOLY !!! FREAKING!!! CRAP  !!!!! This sense of relief is amazing. Then it suddenly hit me ... This might just be how normal is supposed to  feel.

So to any of you feeling stressed. I give you permission to pull the nuclear option. You might just be surprised at how orgasmic normal feels.

P.S.
Now is the best time in history to be a software engineer",2022-04-23 08:38:51
sxpsp3,Does anyone else get anxiety at morning standup if you haven’t made any progress in your tasks?,"I’ve noticed that I have bad anxiety before my morning stand ups when I haven’t progressed anywhere or completed a ticket on my todo list. I just feel like I’m letting everyone down or everyone is looking at me
wondering why its not done yet. Sometimes it’ll take me a week or more to get something done or waiting on people getting back to me but I just feel bad in the morning saying I haven’t done this or that but I’m working on it and having to say that every day for a week. 

Does anybody else have this?",2022-02-21 09:50:14
sm54ri,Anyone else feel the constant urge to leave the field and become a plumber/electrician/brickie? Anyone done this?,"I’m a data scientist/software developer and I keep longing for a simpler life. I’m getting tired of the constant need to keep up to date, just to stay in the game. Christ if an electrician went home and did the same amount upskilling that devs do to stay in the game, they’d be in some serious demand. 

I’m sick to death of business types, who don’t even try to meet you halfway, making impossible demands, and then being disappointed with the end result. I’m constantly having to manage expectations.

I’d love to become a electrician, or a train driver. Go in, do a hard days graft, and go home. Instead of my current career path where I’m having to constantly re-prioritize, put out fires, report to multiple leads with different agendas, scope and build things that have never been done, ect. The stress is endless. Nothing is ever good enough or fast enough. It feels like an endless fucking treadmill, and it’s tiring. Maybe I’m misguided but in other fields one becomes a master of their craft over time. In CS/data science, I feel like you are forever a junior because your experience decays over time. 

Anybody else feel the same way?",2022-02-06 19:27:04
xih4wb,What is up with the MAANG wannable companies asking MAANG questions with A LOT less compensation?,"Going through the interview process right now with a company and the process is exactly like a MAANG company. I thought, OK, if the process is like MAANG, then the compensation must be high as well, around $100K. Nope. So, I essentially have to go through an OA, a live coding challenge and a long onsite to get a job that had the same interview process as the big tech companies and yet this is a small company that pays nowhere near MAANG, what gives?",2022-09-19 16:25:18

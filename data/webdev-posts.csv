1b14bty,Netlify just sent me a $104K bill for a simple static site,"So I received an email from Netlify last weekend saying that I have a $104,500.00 bill overdue. At first I thought this is a joke or some scam email but after checking my dashboard it seems like I am truly owing them 104K dollars:

[That's 190TB bandwidth in 4 days](https://preview.redd.it/do33l577a2lc1.png?width=1091&format=png&auto=webp&s=6718c5f3358e3df4c6e502fc7c7a558eec47a2cf)

So I was like 😅😅😅 and think okay maybe I got ddos attacked. Since Netlify charges 55$/100GB for the exceeding bandwidth, the peak day Feb 16 has 33385/55 \* 100GB = 60.7TB bandwidth in a day. I mean, it's not impossible but why attack a simple static site like mine? This site has been on Netlify for 4 years and is always okay with the free tier. The monthly bandwidth never exceeded even 10GB, and has only \~200 daily visitors.

I contacted their billing support and they responded me that they looked into it and the bandwidth came from some user agents, meaning it is a ddos attack. Then they say such cases happen and they usually charge their customer 20% on this. And since my amount is too large, they offer to discount to 5%, which means I still need to pay 5 thousand dollars.

This feels more like a scam to me. Why do serverless platforms like Netlify and Vercel not have ddos protection, or at least a spend limit? They should have alerted me if the spending skyrocketed. I checked my inbox and spam folder and found nothing. The only email is ""Extra usage package purchased for bandwidth"". It feels like they deliberately not support these features so that they can cash grab in situations like this.

The ddos attack was focused on a file on my site. Yes it's partly my fault to put a 3.44MB size sound file on my site rather than using a third-party platform like SoundCloud. But still this doesn't invalidate the point of having protection against such attacks, and limit the spending.

I haven't paid that $5k yet and decided to post here to hear what others think first. And yes I have migrated my site to Cloudflare. Learned my lesson and will never use Netlify (or even Vercel) again.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Thank you all for the suggestions I have posted this on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39520776).

UPDATE: Here's the email response I got from their billing support:

[I have taken down that .mp3 file but still, it's only 3.44MB size and I don't think it's entirely my fault leaving it there.](https://preview.redd.it/yuf4gzbp63lc1.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=155423c4bc69f51925307cc17be40730ecc65d8c)

UPDATE: For those who are curious, that .mp3 file is just an old Cantonese song. I removed that from my site but you can still view it from the GitHub history [https://github.com/CanCLID/jyutping.org/blob/133b7d8b75bb3e454f663e6945694b84c50baa36/static/song/maanboujansanglou.mp3](https://github.com/CanCLID/jyutping.org/blob/133b7d8b75bb3e454f663e6945694b84c50baa36/static/song/maanboujansanglou.mp3)

UPDATE: I saw the CEO's reply on HN and their support also reached out to me to waive the bill. But I am still curious who orchestrated the attack and they said they are still researching the incident.

UPDATE: Their support haven't come back to me with the IP information I asked yet. So I posted on twitter to ask their CEO [https://x.com/laubonghaudoi/status/1762913229569974380](https://x.com/laubonghaudoi/status/1762913229569974380) and [https://answers.netlify.com/t/i-am-the-op-of-that-104k-bill-post-and-i-have-some-follow-up-questions/113472](https://answers.netlify.com/t/i-am-the-op-of-that-104k-bill-post-and-i-have-some-follow-up-questions/113472)",2024-02-27 05:45:02

gzr3cq,fyi: You can bypass youtube ads by adding a dot after the domain,"On desktop browsers.

*To follow up: I had initially assumed that it didn't work on mobile because the browsers normalized the URL, however this isn't the case. The redirection happens on the server side.* ***So, if you want this to work on mobile browsers, use the ""Request Desktop Site"" feature.***

For example,

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuB8VUICGqc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuB8VUICGqc) // will occasionally show ads

[https://www.youtube.com./watch?v=DuB8VUICGqc](https://www.youtube.com./watch?v=DuB8VUICGqc) // will not show ads

It's a commonly forgotten edge case, websites forget to normalize the hostname, the content is still served, but there's no hostname match on the browser so no cookies and broken CORS - and lots of bigger sites use a different domain to serve ads/media with a whitelist that doesn't contain the extra dot

This works for many news websites as well serving paywalls, e.g.

[https://www.nytimes.com./2020/06/09/us/george-floyd-who-is.html](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/06/09/us/george-floyd-who-is.html)",2020-06-09 16:58:43

Despite providing some pretty innovative features at inception, it is nothing more than a reinterpretation of Chrome standards. But it is the only alternative rendering engine which Google doesn't have its hands in. Opera, Brave, and even Edge run on Chrome's rendering engine.

As more and more sites block access to Firefox's rendering engine, they create an environment where Google is the only party allowed to create features for an ""open"" \[HTML5\] standard. Turning the web (something open to all of us) into a proprietary conglomerate of intellectual property.

For the web to remain open, we must fight for Firefox to keep a seat at the table. Stop blocking Firefox access, simply because you don't want to test cross-browser compatibility with Chrome.",2023-05-10 20:47:38

I uploaded the word files to this GitHub to download 

https://github.com/Oak-Harbor-Kits/Contract-Templates

Just download them and put in the information in the highlighted fields and follow the directions on how I use Adobe Sign to send e-contracts. You can use whatever you want. Adobe sign is like over $200 a year to use. So if you want to take my contracts and use a different e-sign service you can. 

One contact is for my lump sum contracts and the other is for my monthly subscription clients. Make sure you check section 2.5 and add your fees. 

Feel free to look them over and make any changes specific to your business.

EDIT: please be advised that it might be best to have this reviewed by a local state lawyer for Your business and state. It’s significantly cheaper to have one reviewed than to have one written. This was made for me in Washington state. As with any legal stuff, use with caution and your own discretion. But this should be a great starting point for your contracts.",2022-03-05 18:47:05

bos684,I am a Web Dev. And I am Burnt The F#*K Out.,"TL;DR; A rant from a dinosaur that can't keep up anymore. How do you guys do this?

*EDIT: Holy cow.  This turned into a real thing, didn't it?  Thanks everyone for the replies.  At this point if I keep responding to everything, I'm just digging myself a whole I'll spend the rest of the week crawling out of, but I appreciate all of your continued responses and advice.  Even if I don't response, keep it coming!*

&#x200B;

**UPDATE:**

To be completely honest I wrote that post as a cathartic rant in the depths a particularly exhausted moment. I fully expected to get down-voted and/or removed.  **I did not expect it to catch fire in the way that it did.**

What I discovered is that there are a lot of people that are in a similar place: overworked, burnt-out, and/or frustrated by the constant skill set churn.

But I found out there are a lot of others **who aren't: they're still happy and excited, and don't feel over-worked.**

Then there were a handful of folks who basically said ""quit yer bitchin'."" Fair enough. But I have to question whether they'd say that to a nurse, a doctor, or a tradesman that started his own business and burnt himself out trying to grow it. I appreciate everyone who shared, and gave me some much-needed perspective in all directions.

And I question *how much money you think I'm making*.  As I said I work a lot of 14 hour days. And til' it's all said and done I made around $80,000 last year. No benefits. Supporting a family of 4. We don't struggle to put food on the table, but we don't make enough money to be frivolous either. And not once have I complained about the money. I know I'm blessed, if not as wealthy as some of you seem to think I am!

So here's what I've learned from you all:

1. **Those that have long-term happiness in this career are those that can put it to rest at the end of the day.** It is ultimately a job that makes other parts of their life better. For me starting my own business basically killed that possibility. I work 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM. Then 9:00 PM - 2:00 AM.  And in between, I'm ""on call."" I also know there are plenty of you that *aren't owners* that feel similar pressures, and I feel for you. This was a choice I made, and it's mine to fix.
2. **I noticed a trend between childhood passion for coding and adult career burnout.** I noticed this as I read all 800+ comments. Those of us with stories about cutting our teeth on DOS and coding games for our TI-82 calculators all seemed to share a similar ""malignancy."" I'm not sure why. Was it a mistake turning something we loved into a career? Are humans just not meant to do (and love) the same activity for 25+ years? *Are we expecting too much?* I don't know. its just interesting to notice.
3. **Maybe web development as a career has some problems.** Some of you have pointed out that you've simply accepted that a full day of work each week will be spent re-educating yourself and not earning money.  I think *everyone* should be thrilled to be lifelong learners. But I think *nobody* should have to accept losing a day each week, essentially unpaid, simply to keep their job. It's also a real possible that these problems are working themselves out. The web job market has expanded. There are now entire career paths around more specific skill sets. Its far more manageable to keep up with ""Local SEO"" or ""front-end developer"" or ""UX engineer"" or even ""React Developer"" than wearing and maintaining all of those hats at once. A lot of people told me to limit my scope but deepen my knowledge of whatever I'm left with. That's a great idea that I took to heart.
4. **The agency model sucks for developers. Period.** When I left my old agency and started my business, I didn't leave the agency model.  *I just made myself the agency*. That was a mistake. A lot of folks suggested that I need to do more to move myself out of the developer role and into a management role, and put young blood in the coder's seat.  I've actually tried this through the past year.  It's been difficult, but I'm going to try harder.  Others told me life is *completely different* working a 9-5 development job that's not agency.   I'm going to give serious consideration to closing my business and taking a job working *for the man* again.  I'm not precious about ""ownership."" Especially if it makes my life more balanced.
5. **The speed at which front-end development changes is maddening** and that *seems* to be an idea that's far more accepted than the more general premise of my original post.  But we are under no obligation to learn every new technology/framework. Fair enough! I prefer back-end and I have entirely skipped Ruby, RoR, Node, and Python. Zero regrets.  My background in pure computer science will help me get up to speed if and when I need to.
6. **There are a lot of ways to do this career path. If balance is important to me, then I am doing it wrong.** That's on me. I take full ownership of the mistakes I made to get to where I am. I can't tell you how much I appreciate the advice all of you who are ""doing it right"" gave me.

Going forward I have a lot of things to think about. To start, for the next 6 months I'm planning to put my clients in ""maintenance mode.""  I won't accept new clients or ambitious new projects during that time. Incoming maintenance work and ongoing retainers are enough to sustain my family for now. This is a buffer to give me time to sort out my career and work/life balance.

I'll use that time to think about my future. If I want to keep my business, how do I do it in a way that supports the lifestyle I want for me and my family?  If that's not possible, how do I responsibly walk away, and where do I go from here? Ultimately nobody has a gun to my head forcing me to perform agency-style development. *It is a choice.*

In conclusion: I thought it was worth pointing out to folks that are considering web development or are just getting into it  that my experience is not everyone's experience. And that I take responsibility for decisions that contributed to my burn-out.  Learn from my mistakes, as I've learned from everyone who responded to me.

Hopefully in a year I will post a far more positive follow-up.

**ORIGINAL POST**\-----------------------------

I'm 37 which in web developer years mean's I'm a dinosaur.  I've been programming since I was 13. I thought I was ""l33t"" because I made a pixely snowstorm in QBASIC in high school.

I've been making websites since 28.8 kb/s was standard. I've been doing it for money since 2003. I was around when nested tables were the only way to do layout. I embedded my share of animated GIFs and MIDIs, unironically. I was there when ""To Hell with Bad Browsers"" was published. I remember WASP, unaccompanied by Ant Man. I was there when Jeff Zeldman taught us how to Design with Web Standards and Eric Meyer introduced us to CSS. I'm pretty sure I probably masturbated to CSS Zen Garden at some point or another.

I've written guestbooks in C and home-brewed a CMS in Perl. I was building websites when the world was more familiar with Java than JavaScript, and people assumed they were related. I used MooTools, Prototype, and Dojo. I'm still maintaining web apps I wrote when ExtJS was *still* ExtJS and was open source. I was there when jQuery was new. I was there when jQuery *for all intents and purposes WAS JavaScript*. And I'm here today, wondering why half the web is still loading it.

I learned to love the HTML 5 DOCTYPE. I've coded in PHP 3, 4, 5, and 7, Zend Framework 1 and 2, Symfony 3 and 4. I've built enough WordPress sites to both understand the love, and the hate. I've slung gigabytes of data between MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server and mish-mashed it all into XML, JSON, and YAML. I've learned to love vanilla JavaScript again. And I've watched the JavaScript ecosystem spread out on the front *and* back-end. Sometimes, I feel, like a cancer.

Dudes.... *I'm tired.*

This was fun when I was young and cared about nothing else. I felt like I was doing something interesting. I felt like I was solving problems and building things that nobody else could build.

But then I discovered the outdoors, and hobbies. I got married. I had kids. I discovered the world outside the familiar glow of my screen is full of interesting things and unique challenges.

All the while, I've been through cycles upon cycles of changes in web technology. It's a hamster wheel. It's a rat race. It's *whatever rodent metaphor* accurately describes both the feeling of constant struggle and the utter pointlessness of going through it. We're a digital Sisyphys being crushed by gigabytes of npm modules that seem to be required to do anything useful nowadays.

I've realized that there are other people that are far better at this than me. I've realized that the myth of /u/breich having a genius level mind for technology only exists in comparison to the other minds in the small, rural community in which he grew up. **And I've realized that I don't actually care**.

I spent years terrified that website builders, automation, and machine learning would replace me.  And I stuck it out long enough to be sitting her *begging* for website builders, automation, and machine learning to replace me.

1akb14u,Guys Its Finally Happened to ME! I have....the EYES!,"Whats up! 

Been a software engineer for over 4 years now. And yesterday I finally experienced the level of enlightenment we all aspire to.  


I got a code review request from a fellow senior engineer, it was about 15 files and 300 lines. I finsished the review in about 5 minutes, and requested changes.   


Fellow engineer says there's no way you finished the review THAT fast. You haven't even pulled it down and ran it on your local !  


I said ""I didnt need to pull it down. And as I noted in the review this is not going to work for x,y,z reasons and also these 2 edges cases are uncovered blah blah""   


Fellow engineer comes back 20 minutes later, and said ""wow how did you know those things were going to happen without even pulling it down""  


My response: "".....I can read code? 🤷🏽‍♂️""  


Was a pretty funny moment, but seriously, as of late its like a light flipped on and I can now read and understand other peoples code as if I am reading natural language sentences now. It took me awhile to get to that point becuase for the first 2 years of my career I was mainly reading my own code. But proud to be here nontheless.",2024-02-06 14:29:10

Millions of downloads and hardly any compensation,"It blows my mind to learn the story about [Denis Pushkarev & core.js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/docs/2023-02-14-so-whats-next.md)! I remember in 2013 when I started serious frontend work I had to chose polyfills by hand and integrate them in webpack. Then at some point they became part of Angular 2 and I forgot of their existence. I always thought these polyfills must be paid by Google or MS or some combination of the FANG companies. Big surprise it was not!

Looks like the system for giving credit to the authors is currently fundamentally broken. I made [this  video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wDzFoAuNSdg) to spread awareness in my Flutter community and beyond. I encourage other developers/podcasters to do so. We should not let this thing just wash away in the news cycle.

We owe this man so much. I mean... all of has have been benefiting from his work. I remember 10 yrs ago, saying you are JS developer was getting people to treat you as second class citisen. Since the big SPA frameworks showed up this change by significant measure. So much was built on top of core.js and it's shocking to learn how little was paid back. You can support him by following the links he proides in the article.

**PS** Yes I know he is russian. Makes no difference. Read the full post and you'll understand how much work was put in this library and how much all of us benefited.

o5k8gb,[Rant] I can't stand developing for Safari anymore,"In the last few years, I've seen Safari slowly fall behind Chrome & Firefox. It wasn't exactly a brillant browser before, but it's now completely outdated.

### No modern APIs

First, Apple don't give a fuck about any modern APIs. PWA, streams, who the fuck needs that? Well, dear Apple, a *fucking lot* of web devs need that nowadays.

### On iOS, all browsers are just skins of Safari

We all know *why* they don't implement those features - they want to keep the control on their closed ecosystem. But seriously: during the Epic VS Apple case, they had the guts to say ""If you don't want our 30% fees, just write a web app"".

Seriously? On iOS, you cannot install another web browser. Well, you can install an application named ""Chrome"", but it's only Safari with another skin. Because Apple forbids creating a web browser on iOS.

Then, how are we supposed to write web apps on your legacy browser, which is the *only* available browser on mobile? Fuck off

### The bugs

Oh my god. Even when they implement an API, it's riddled with bugs they *never* fix. Or they do it fine, then break it later. Just look at Service workers, or IndexDB.

How are we supposed to keep up with this? Isn't Apple one of the richest company in the world? Invest in your fucking browser.

### It's installed by default on Mac

Just like IE was a pain in the ass because it was the default browser, Safari is here to stay. Just because it's conveniently the only browser installed when you get your Mac.

> Hey, but it's only normal for a company to preinstall its browser on its OS

Well yeah, it's fine if your browser works fine. Even Microsoft understood that, and switched to Chromium because they didn't want to cripple their users with a shitty default browser.

### No automatic updates

Oh yeah, nearly forgot this one. If Apple implements a feature you've been waiting for, well don't expect you'll be able to use it anytime soon. Safari doesn't automatically update itself. It's the only modern browser where most users lag a few major versions behind the stable release. Have fun waiting! 

### What can we do?

Well let's do what we do best: write articles, blog posts, reddit comments showing how stupid their browser is. I've got a bunch of side projects, with ~200 visitors per weeks. 

**I'll add a banner asking the user to switch to a more modern browser, like Chrome or Firefox, if he's on a Mac.**  Just like IE. 

We need to raise awareness on this issue, because it's been a pain in the ass for years, and the recent events show that Apple will not make a move in our direction if not forced to.

116vvpp,Saying Goodbye To Stack Overflow.,"I've had a registered account on Stack Overflow for six years. I have about ten years total experience in IT. I have followed a few tags on SO to answer questions in some very narrow areas I have particular knowledge which might be helpful to others. I have also asked a question on average every three months, for a total of twenty-five questions over the time I've been registered at SO.

When I ask a question, it's after:
- Fully researching my question using search engines. This includes reading through listserv and bug tracker / issue resources and reading relevant blog articles. I have experience with customizing search engines (`Apache Solr`), I know how they work. I'm not terrible at searching for technical information after all these years.
- Writing out my question on SO, and going through all of the relevant ""Similar Pages"" suggestions the editor offers to make sure I'm not duplicating my question (in addition to the Google search I did first).
- Stepping away from my question, and coming back to edit it before posting it so that I can make sure it is succinct, to the point, etc. I'm not a great writer - but I've also written technical documentation for a decade. During that time I've tried to improve my writing skills. I'm not terrible at it.

It's been three years since a question I posted to SO wasn't closed within the first ten minutes of posting it and downvoted for good measure (that'll teach me to use the site like it's intended!).

Every time I go to post a question on SO, I think ""*Do I have enough points to lose to ask a question?*"" (there's a particular functionality I wanted enough points to be able to do on SO - creating custom tags for my personal open source projects).

Every time I go back to check on a question I post, I think ""*It's probably already closed*"", **never** ""*I hope someone gave me an answer for this difficult problem that's stumped me and my colleagues for days*"".

I spend more time editing my SO questions than I do on editing my blog articles on my personal website (hoping to avoid the SO mod mob eager to close questions as fast as possible).

My second to last question involved the behavior of a native browser API. It got closed as a ""duplicate"", and the link provided to the ""original question"" was some completely unrelated JQuery function.

My last question (just now) asked about potential maintainability issues involved with a certain approach to CSS layout. I gave an example of a concrete maintainability issue that I could live with in one of the two scenarios, and asked for other concrete examples.

It was closed within a minute for being ""primarily opinion based"".

I've finally decided to cancel my SO account, to add it to my hosts block list, and to block SO results from Google using an extension.

I get that moderators are barraged with low quality questions on SO, but if it's been years since someone's been able to ask a relevant question in spite of being very careful about it, the site is probably useless for most people (and slowly losing utility in a flaming dumpster fire).

I've shown questions to other developers that I've had closed and asked if they thought my question was wrong. At the time, I thought it was me and wanted to fix *my* problem. In every case the feedback was ""*That's really stupid they closed your question, it's a good one. I'd like to know the answer too. F#ck SO!*""

Indeed. Stack Overflow is a toxic cesspool that is utterly useless outside of historical answers. That begs the question, what fills the void? It seems like Reddit, mostly. It's not as well designed for the purpose, it lacks the nice tools specifically for a Q/A format, but at least bad questions just failing to show in the feed makes up for a goon squad incentivized to close questions for any reason they can, *as fast as they can*.

**A DISCLAIMER:** This post has gotten ~120k total views and +750 upvotes. That basically exceeds the number of people who've read *everything I've ever written anywhere in my entire life*. I'm out of my league. SO was incredible when it came out. Any other site trying to do tech Q&A would face the same issues they are. I'm not so much trying to dog SO as express my specific frustrations with the site, and hold out hope there is a fix for them (and *maybe there's not*).

**EDIT:** I added a link to my SO profile and my last couple of questions that were closed in response to a request lower in this thread.

**ADDITIONAL:** A few people mentioned I'm being hysterical by blocking SO from search and hosts. Fair enough, it might be true. My reason for doing that is the same as the reason I force myself to do other things, like use regexes with capture groups for find-and-replace in my code editor: otherwise I won't learn, I'll keep doing it the hard way, and I'll stay frustrated.",2023-02-20 02:55:04

Lol what do you even say to that.

We had an argument basically because I was struggling to hit deadlines. I'm a Junior. I build the entire bespoke system by myself. No other developer has the skills to do it so they all hide and run away.

It got heated. My boss was shouting, face red as fuck. Complaining about the money he was losing.

I had enough so I told him straight.

Me: ""I'm the strongest developer on your team, no one is as good as me. I'm working 2 roles above my station. Why am I being punished?""

Him: ""Because you said you would do it"".

Me: ""No I didn't. I offered to help your manager out on it. Not take on full responsibility for that. You made that assumption. When he left, you didn't replace him, so I lost my support structure, and you're demanding that I do his job as well as mine"".

Him: ""I understand that you're working at a Senior level and I appreciate that but we need this to be delivered"".

Me: ""Every time I give you a deadline, I pad it out because I know that are things I will miss. I'm not a Senior I will miss things. When you don't give me that extra time what do you expect?"".

Him: ""I wasn't told this"".

Me: ""Why doesn't anyone else jump on this?"".

Him: ""It's your job"".

Me: ""Are you telling me that if I didn't try harder than everyone else I wouldn't be getting disciplined. Do you reward mediocrity?"".

His face got even redder.

o9jp8e,Every single interview question I was asked while changing my job.,"Hello everyone.

I've gotten a lot of use out of this forum, especially while I was starting out. So hopefully, this is my way of giving back a little bit.

**A bit of background:**

I've been working in development for a good few years now and recently decided I wanted a change from agency work. While the agency is full of great people, work-wise it wasn't what I was after.

So cue a series of interviews which has thankfully led to a new position. I decided to note every question and technical task I had to go through in the hopes it would help people, new to the sector or not, to prepare for their next interview. I'll break it down into stages and won't go into too much detail about how I responded but will make any notes if anything stood out. For context, I was applying for mid-level roles in London.

**Stage 1. Screener Calls**

In almost all cases except for tiny companies, there was a screener call with an internal recruiter. One pattern I noticed is that they almost always aren't technical, they're short, and almost always follow this format. This should be the least stressful part of the application process.

1. They'll tell you a bit about the role.
2. Standard tell us about yourself question.
3. Tell us about your current role?
4. What tech stack do you use?
5. Do you have any experience with X (Some tech listed in the job description)?
6. Are you interested in X (Some non-dev skills listed in job description e.g. mentoring or design tasks)?
7. What are you looking for in a new role?
8. What's your current notice period?
9. What salary are you looking for?
10. Do you have any questions for us?

That is generally it. I don't want to underplay the value of an internal recruiter but it seems like you apply and then makes sure you literally tick some boxes from the spec. If you do they'll pass it on to the team you'd potentially be joining.

**Step 2. Initial Interview**

If your details are passed on and the team like your CV you'll have an initial interview. These are the most varied. Some of them were basic chats and some of them included algorithm questions. One thing that became apparent to me is while some industries have a generic format for interviews like retail or sales, tech is absolutely just winging it. I think most will be surprised at the variety, and unfortunately, it makes it really hard to prepare.

1. What does the deps array in useEffect() do?
2. What do you know about the company?
3. Tell us about yourself?
4. Why hire you?
5. How have you managed stress in the workplace?
6. Tell us about a time you've led on a project?
7. Tell us about your choice of CSS preprocessor?
8. CSS Methodologies?
9. What is a Linked List?
10. What's the fastest way to find the middle of a Linked List?
11. What does it mean when a function is idempotent?
12. What is a pure function?
13. What was a major change in React around 16.8?
14. What's the difference between white/black box testing?
15. What's the difference between unit, integration, and e2e testing?
16. What is batching in React?
17. Difference between props and state?
18. What's the difference between classical and prototypal inheritance?
19. What does good code look like to you?
20. What's a piece of code/work you're proud of? (This one came up a lot)
21. What are styled-components?
22. What are the status codes for REST API calls?
23. Tell me a bit about what Jest/Enzyme is used for?
24. What's the difference between shallow mount and render in enzyme?
25. What's your working style/ how do you work at your current job? (Might branch off into some agile questions?)
26. What's your opinion of the React landscape?
27. What are the pros and cons of working with Typescript?
28. How would you go about clearing tech debt?
29. What's your approach to testing?
30. What is hoisting?
31. Do you have any back end experience?
32. How would you handle large data sets from the backend to the frontend?
33. What are higher-order components?
34. What are higher-order functions?
35. Difference between let/var/const
36. Benefits of styled components over traditional minified one CSS file.
37. Benefits of class over function components?
38. When would you use a class or function component?
39. What is snapshot testing?
40. What's the difference between a normal function declaration and an arrow function?
41. What's your product release cycle like?
42. Do you do sprints?
43. What React hooks are you familiar with?

I don't know if it's hard to see from just a list. But I felt like I'd prepare for an interview, only to have it be nothing like the previous one. Some were asking in the context of scaling to X thousand users. Some were just chats. Some people were friendly, some were desperate, some were obnoxious. I'd prepare to talk about unit testing for a job that listed it as very necessary only for them to never mention it.

**Stage 3. Tech Test**

Honestly, the most frustrating part. It felt like no matter how well I did in the initial interview they'd ask me to do a tech test. I could smash every question they threw at me. Point them to my previous work. Have worked on an *X* month-long project doing exactly what they require, and they would still ask me to do some work. Some of them even implemented the suggestions or work I did. So in essence I worked for free and they were farming stuff bit by bit from applicants.

These are all the tests I was asked to do and I'm providing them as a reference, but I actually turned some of them down. One said knowing  Vue isn't a requirement but then the test itself required building a large project using Vue. So it's a bit like... if I have to know it to pass the test then it *is* a requirement. People might argue well it filters out those who aren't willing to learn. Some people might be willing to give up the 2 days they get a week to learn a new framework to apply for a job that specifically said it isn't needed, but I'm not one of them.

Some were good. Some were responsive to questions for clarification. Some had such a high turnover and then flipped their lid when I refused to do it which in hindsight is probably linked.

Anyway, they obviously touched a nerve. I'll stop rambling now.

1. Go through our site and tell us what you'd change (x2)
2. Hit an API of fake products, display them, be able to add them to a basket.
3. Make a node/express server with a DB, be able to add comments to a document, have them be persistent and saved to DB, make sure to unit test etc...
4. An online algorithm/problem-solving coding challenge on HackerRank or Codility type of thing.
5. Build a production-ready dropdown component for React.
6. Build a Gmail clone (this is not a joke)
7. Using the StarWars API (swapi), make a top trumps clone.
8. Recreate this design in React, be production-ready (almost definitely just farming free work. Design was branded etc...)

The biggest thing I took from this is writing tests wins you a lot of points. I guess cos they kind of demonstrate best practice, coding ability, etc... all in one.

**Stage 4. Final Interview**

These were the most stereotypical interviews. Once all the tech was out the way it just boiled down to generic competency-based questions. In no particular order.

* Tell me about a time you've led on a project.
* How would you break down an epic into granular stories?
* How would you deal with a PM asking you to do something faster than planned?
* How have you handled unexpected positive feedback?
* How have you handled unexpected negative feedback?
* How have you dealt with a time where everything is going wrong?
* Why should we hire you as opposed to another candidate?
* Why do you want to work here?
* What are your ambitions over the next 1/2/5 years?
* What are our company values?
* What are you looking to get out of this role?
* How do you see yourself improving the quality of our team when you join?
* How do you work to maintain relationships with colleagues?
* Do you prefer a slow introduction to things or prefer to be ""thrown in the deep end""?
* Have you ever stood strongly for something then changed your mind?
* How do you deal with conflicts between the team and stubborn clients?

Anyway, I know this might not be of huge help but I thought it might be good for some people to have an up to date interview reference thing if they're thinking of applying for the first time or even just changing role after a while.

**Things learnt from the process.**

* People love it if you know about unit/integration/e2e tests.
* Saying you don't know is OK. 
* If they want to see a Github repo full of open-source commits every evening and weekend then I'd stay away from them.
* If they're complaining about not being able to find good developers what they mean is they refuse to pay what it takes to get one.
* If they're open to questions or feedback and value your time, then keep them on your shortlist. They're probably great to work with.
* Don't be scared to ask for clarification.
* If they want a React build, ask if they prefer using hooks maybe. Or ask how they manage their CSS.

That's it! Hope someone somewhere gets some good use out of this.",2021-06-28 12:56:12

um2153,my gf is my rubber duck.,"So you know how they say programmers will talk to a rubber duck? In short it's basically when something isn't working, you explain the code line by line out loud to an object as if you're trying to teach them what it does. A lot of times it leads to a big ""aha"" moment.

Well my girlfriend will see me struggling, pull up a chair, scoot aside my 4 empty energy drink cans and say ""Explain it to me"". It could take 5 minutes, it could take two hours, but even though she knows nothing about code, we always get the problem fixed together. 

I just think its really sweet of her and decided it'd be a good tip to share here for other newbies. Go find your rubber duck, even if it's an object on your desk. They're geniuses.

Edit: I've never gotten an award before, that's pretty rad. Thank you.

eem4mj,Just ended an interview early because my future boss was being a condescending dick.,"Just dropped out of a technical interview after ten minutes.

Questions he was asking were relatively simple, but almost every answer he was trying to make me look like an idiot with the technical lead on the phone. And he was being so condescending toward me. His face was so red the whole time. 

Example (getting a bit technical here):

* Him: ""What are all the ways you can make a three column row on a web page?""
* Me: ""Well, the way I've typically done it is - -""
* Him: abruptly interrupts, ""No. I did NOT ask what ways YOU would do it. I SAID, what ways are POSSIBLE to accomplish this.""
* Me: ""...... Flexbox, divs with floats, a css grid system..""
* Him: ""Flexbox and a css grid system are the same. I SAID, what DIFFERENT WAYS can you list off?""
* Me: ""Honestly, those are the ways I've encountered best practices""
* Him: ""What about css grid?""
* Me: ""Well I've never used it because at the time it didn't have full browser support - - -""
* Him: abruptly interrupts, ""actually we've switched ALL of our websites over to css grid, so your answer is not the right answer.""

At this point I just said ""Okay yeah, this isn't working"", and hung up the call. He asked two questions before hand and gave me the same treatment. 

He was being such a condescending dick the entire time, and I went with my gut. This guy would be a total asshole to work for and I could tell during this interview.

Anyone else experience this type of behavior?",2019-12-23 15:40:45

7o6p7v,"Looking for an ""idea guy"" to manage me","So, I'd like a sweat equity position in a company where an ""idea guy"" reminiscent of Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, etc. can manage me. Ideally, there would be no pay, but just the promise of a future small portion of ownership of the company I created. Does anyone know any ""brains of the operation"" guys looking for some mindless code monkey nerds to direct? Also, it'd be great if they had no experience of any kind in the industry and did no research of any kind into competition (I mean, not even a google search). It is mandatory that their description of their company be in the format ""like [other company], BUT"". So, ""like facebook, but..."". I would prefer them to have no business or coding skills of any kind, so they'll be free to express their unbridled, uncorrupted creativity. I would also like *massive* underestimates of the worked required to implement their idea and no concept whatsoever of the time it take to fulfill their ambitions. I would like for their creativity to be unencumbered by concepts like ""reality"" and whatnot. They should rely completely on me for the unimportant things such as creation of the app, so they can focus on the real work, like telling me what to do.

11fo1sf,I GOT THE JOB!!!,"After  over a year of self teaching its finally my turn to write one of these  posts! I signed my offer letter today with an awesome company ! I just  wanted to give a BIG thank you to this community! You guys really helped  me through this whole thing. If I was ever stuck or didn't know  something I knew I could count on someone here to help me out. It really  means a lot that people here actually want to see other people be  successful. Its hard to find a supportive community and you people are  AMAZING! Thanks again, everyone!

Here  are some takeaways from the whole process for anyone that is just  starting their journey or in a similar position as me.... or just  curious:

&#x200B;

* It  took me over a year of studying everyday after work to get here. The  stories about getting a job in 3 months are pretty rare.  You really do have to work for it.
* Don't worry about your age. I just turned 31 (which is apparently old now?). All you career switchers hang in there!
* I  sent out probably over 500 apps and received rejection letters  constantly. I know its super depressing to get rejections. There were a  few times where I was like ""am i wasting my time...maybe i should go  back to school...looks like ill be answering phone for the rest of my  life."" Just keep at it! Keep learning and building things!
* When  you finally do get an interview you want to nail it! It took me  hundreds of applications just to get my 2 interviews. The first one I  totally fucked up but it was good practice and taught me what I needed  to focus on. Have the basics down super solid and be ready to sell  yourself.
* I  know this a controversial one here but I think leetcode actually helped  me pass my second interview.However, I didn't focus on anything crazy  complex.  I'd say working through leetcode easys and maybe a medium here  and here if you're feeling up to it.  A least being familiar with the  DS&A concepts will help you out IMO.
* Be  flexible and willing to relocate if necessary. I know everyone wants  the super awesome remote position but so does everyone else. My position  is hybrid and I  think that's part of the reason I got hired.
* Be  ready to not work on your dream stack. Sure you may be working on a  bunch of React projects but be ready to get a job using something  completely different. Maybe they use a different framework or maybe no  framework at all? Focus on having good foundational knowledge because  you might not even be working on the thing you are spending so much time  on.
* Lastly,  have creative projects and a portfolio. My interviewer loved my  portfolio so much he went around office and showed everyone. Be creative and stand out. That weather project is nice but they  see that one everyday. Find a cool API and make something out of it.

That's  really all I can think of right now but if anyone has specific  questions feel free to ask and I will be sure to reply back.

Thanks again everyone, I couldn't have done it without you!",2023-03-02 01:00:16

q9d6g8,The Only Advice You Need To Become a Developer,"Lots of wrong advice is being handed out here by people who have never actually been developers or failed to become one or people who are just bad developers.

The technologies do not define a developer/programmer.

A programmer is a problem solver. A programmer is not a person limited by his tools, it is a person who is willing to put in the work and learn the tools needed to do the job.  
Good programmers ask questions, best programmers ask things to be explained to them like they are idiots.    
Why you may ask? It is very simple.  
Distilled information coming from people with expertise is better consumed.  
I see people being afraid to ask questions and what is worse is then there are people who answer these questions in a very condescending way and if you are that type of person, fuck you. No, seriously.

For the people who constantly ask ""*wHaT iS tHe BeSt CoUrSe To LeArN* ***XYZ***"", you guys are making your life VERY DIFFICULT. 

""So what do I do?"" - you might be asking yourself, and the answer to that is VERY SIMPLE.

**GO READ OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION**

This will not only teach you how to navigate technical documentation, but it will teach you self-reliance and it will give you the confidence to tackle unknowns.  
Can't make sense of the docs? Read again. Can't make sense of the docs again? Go watch porn, watch Netflix, chill out a bit, and then come back. Still cannot understand? Read again, write down with actual words what you think you understand and what you need help with and go to forums and ask for help. But, the thing you should be doing is not asking for the best course to watch or some other resource where you expect knowledge to be spoon-fed to you.

Here is a short story.

I had the pleasure to work with a Junior Developer a few years ago. He was around 60.  
Turns out he was a programmer in the early 70/80's. How did he become one you ask?  
All the dude had was one book and a crap computer without internet.  
He told me that he read the book like 20 times before it clicked, took him like 3-4 months.  
There was no internet back then, nobody to ask.  
He said, once it clicked, everything fell into place and he started building games, later on, he joined a software company, and afterward he made his own company which he ran for like 30 years, and sold it.  
You may ask why did he want to continue development and I asked him that as well.  
The guy was loaded with money, I could tell so it wasn't for the money.  
He said solving problems is what he wants to do and for him, it's a quest for knowledge.

What is the moral of the story?  
The moral of the story is that the initiative starts with you and you shouldn't rely on anything else.  
If you do not commit to understanding what you are trying to do, you will be forever stuck in watching videos and asking for help and what tech stack is best.

This is it, the is the only thing you need.  
You need to trust yourself and give yourself the time to understand a given technology.  
You need to work hard until it clicks, once this happens, everything afterward is like a waterfall.  
Rinse and repeat.   


Every time we build software at work (and we build software for a lot of money), we fail our way to production. We break pipelines, introduce bugs all the time. It happens and no process in this world will prevent that. Nothing is perfect and it will never be. But we iterate and we make it better. And after each iteration, broken pipelines and bugs diminish.

The same stupid principle applies here.

You know you want to learn something. Take small steps and iterate. Trust yourself.

This is the only advice I give to every Junior developer or people who want to become developers and I hope this opens the eyes for some of you. It is that simple.",2021-10-16 14:33:37

Myanmar was recently under a military coup as you might have heard in the news. The website was originally only meant to track the crimes and violations being committed. But I made it into a content hub with useful links. (But majority of the content is still evidence of crimes and brutality) Please check it out :) I update daily. Trigger warning, blood, violence, gore and shootings. Just dont click on the evidence button of the incidents.

Also I'm only still a beginner. Any tips and suggestions would be appreciated, especially regarding SEO.

bx51vk,We need to talk about what it is to be a Wordpress Dev. Some of you guys are killing people.,"I have a client that needed a web app for his business that would walk his clients through information gathering and selection of systems for their company. It was not an entirely complex app but it was not simple either. Middle of the road stuff.

Someone built it for him in WordPress. It was shit and any modification was a dance in plugin hell. How do I know? After huge expense and little results he hired me to fix stuff. 

&#x200B;

Because my client perceived that he is ""stuck"" with his original creation and would not heed my rebuild advice he has bounced from WordPress dev to WordPress dev trying to get things working to his liking. Every dev I have consulted with thinks the same thing. ""I'll use Gravity forms here, some shit plugin there and another fucked up plugin over here.""

I see this several times a year. unknowing clients hire a ""Developer"" to build an app and they get a WordPress monstrosity. Then I become the asshole that has to tell them it is not worth it to ""fix"" it. It needs to be re-built at twice the original cost.

&#x200B;

**It's like WordPress devs think they can build web apps as one would build a spaceship with legos. Only they are using some obscure BLOX brand that doesn't even fit together correctly. At the end of the day it still won't fly to space because it's not a real fucking spaceship!!!**

nt6gus,I created a browser-based video editor. 100% Free!,"Hey everyone,

After looking around online for a free video editor, I started getting frustrated with the options out there. After working on a video for a while, I would click the export button only to be hit by one of the following options (ordered from most to least aggravating)

1. Pay a monthly subscription to export your video 🤬
2. Export with a watermark 😠
3. Export at a low resolution

So I decided to build a video editor by myself and it's been one hell of journey, but today I'm excited to show you guys [Mastershot](https://mastershot.app/). It's a completely browser-based video editor. This means that everything (including the rendering) happens in your browser! It's 100% free with no watermarks and up to 1080p export. Here's a list of some of the things you can do with it:

* Trim video/audio/images
* Extract audio from video to separate track
* Add text to video/images
* Overlay videos on top of each other (picture in picture/grid/rows)

**Coming Soon**

* Integrations for stock images/videos.
* Chroma Keying (Green screen)
* Transitions between clips
* Keyframe animations

Check it out at [https://mastershot.app](https://mastershot.app/)

The tech stack used for this project is as follows:

Frontend - VanillaJS with WebGL for the preview screen.   
Renderer - Webassembly port of ffmpeg + canvas renderer for future (WebGL shaders, transitions, etc)

What do you guys think?

w6k6vo,Had to sue my first client. Make sure you always have a contract!,"This has been a fun ongoing issue the last few months. Yes we had a contract signed. What caused me to sue was what he did the last week we had contact. 

The day prior, he said how much he liked the site after an exhaustive couple weeks making all the edits and tweaks he wanted to make his store exactly the way he wanted. Said we finally had it. 

Next day, he says that we didn’t meet expectations and that he will be wanting a refund of his deposit. However, he would let us keep half the deposit if we give him the source code. He says this is the best way to avoid costly court fees and for us to at least make some money and not lose out. My development partner and I were stunned and speechless at the size of this guys balls compared to his brain to try something like this. We quoted about $3k for development. He still owed us $1500. 

So we tried to get back into the Shopify account and shut down the store demo while we mitigate this situation and turns out he removed our access to the store, and the time stamp of the changes predate the email he sent me to cancel the contract. Our contract states that the code is ours, the design is ours, and they cannot take it without permission or give it to someone else. He breached the contract by removing our access to the Shopify and stole our code. 

So, I called my lawyer, told him the situation, and sent him a demand letter stating what he owes for breach of contract and if they aren’t settled within a certain time period then we will take this matter to the courts. 

He didn’t think I’d do it over $1500. I can’t imagine how many others he’s tried bullying with this tactic but My partner and I decided that it stops with us. So I spent $1500 on a retainer for my lawyer to begin the drawing up the paper work to have them formerly served in court. But before we could finalize and send it, we got a notification in the mail that we were being sued in small claims court in his state. There’s a number of reasons why this was ridiculous. Number one, our contract states that all legal matters will be held in the jurisdiction of my state and county courts, so his motion was filed in error, second, we’re two LLC’s and our matters are not to be brought in small claims as they are between individuals, not Companies. HiS contract was signed as his LLC. My lawyer was dumbfounded at the dumb he just found. So we filed a petition with their court to have the suit removed as it was not valid. 

So what we do now is we are counter suing in real court and having a process server in his state find him and serve him. 

So now, because he didn’t want to pay us the remaining $1500, he now has to retain a lawyer, fly to my state to appear in court, pay for his lawyers travel and expenses, and Hotels which will be significantly more than the $1500 he was trying to grift from us. 

I’ve never seen this before. If our work was not satisfactory, why do you want the source code? If it’s not what you want, then why do you want it? I have all communications with him in text and email, I can document all the work we did and that he was happy with it. I’m looking forward to out day in court. 

Moral of the story - have a solid contract, be make sure it also protects your code and work from improper theft by a client, and that all legal grievances will be conducted in your counties jurisdiction. And always communicate via email or text as record of your communications and agreements. Also, don’t give your client access to the Shopify before final payment. Now we don’t transfer it to their account until final payment is made. Lesson learned. 

His site is still his old site so he hasn’t tried to use our work. Probably at the advice of his lawyer. 

Now we just wait for him to be served and go to court. I don’t mind spending more money on legal fees than I’d make on the project to send a message and defend myself and make him think twice before he tries this Again on another developer. Not sure if anyone else has gone through something like this. Thought I’d share as a warning to other devs the importance of an iron clad contract and keeping communication in text form. This can happen to anyone with anyone. Dude was nice, we got along well the whole project and loved my work. But flipped a switch overnight and turned into a client from hell. Trust no one, and always have yourself covered.",2022-07-24 01:55:52

13hns81,I made an app for color grading in the browser (without a framework*).,"TLDR: I’m a solo dev with backgrounds in art/photography and made a web app (PWA) for film emulation and color grading. 

https://app.color.io (desktop only for now)

Hi everyone! 🙋🏻‍♂️I’ve been working on this project for almost a year and wanted to share it with my fellow web devs here! 

Color.io is the result of my long standing frustration with how color tools behave in most editing and color grading software, especially on the photographic end. It’s much easier to create completely unnatural looking colors than it is to truly enhance an image in a subtle and film-like way. Most apps work around their engines’ color science shortcomings by exposing some kind of profile or 3D LUT interface that allows for arbitrary color mappings to be applied to images. The problem with profiles and LUTs however is that they’re a black box and offer limited creative control.

My app is meant to act as a middle man in this color process. I wrote a custom color engine on top of ACES (hand ported to WebGL) that uses custom color models and transform operations that are much more suitable for creative color manipulation than cone models like HSL. The engine is controlled by my library of interface tools like custom spline interpolators, color wheels, 2D draggables and more. 

I launched about 8 weeks ago and wanted to share it here because r/webdev is where I started my journey as a developer a few years ago! 

🔨 Tech Stack:

UI is built with my tiny (< 80loc) wrapper around CustomElements: https://gist.github.com/monokee/03230511f1e2214dc1f0b17763d85369

For state management, I needed non-linear (branching) undo-redo history, tight integration with indexedDB for local persistence and advanced state diffing with a simple API that integrates well into my vanilla coding style. The app also supports batch editing and multiple in-app tabs which the state system needed to support - so I rolled my own. 

Image processing is all done in webgl with a custom rendering engine that compiles all fragment shaders to a single 3D texture (you can inspect that texture as an interactive point cloud) before an integration shader that maps the 3D texture onto the image. The integration is embedded into a film material emulation shader that I wrote to simulate how real film grain works by breaking the image apart and re-building it out of simulated halide granules. It also has pretty neat halation simulation with physically accurate exponential glow falloff (actually rather esoteric :D)

📚 Libraries I did use:
- libRAW (compiled to web-assembly and extended with a custom profiling step to better load RAW images into my logarithmic processing gamma)
- libTiff (same as above)
- a DPX parser I ripped from somewhere and micro-optimized (it reads byte streams in vanilla js, it’s not pretty) 

Doing all of this pretty much bare bones vanilla js / webGL and keeping the code base clean and scalable has been *really* challenging but, I think, ultimately worth it!

hwourm,"Friendly reminder that visually styling a button to look like a button does not mean it's a button. If you aren't prepared to implement accessibility yourself, please stop using non-standard controls. It is a massively widespread issue and is beyond frustrating for keyboard & screen-reader users.","It's very common for me to see a web designer reimplement an existing type of control, such as a checkbox or a button. Usually, this means using a span element or similar, assigning an ID and a JS event, and changing the visual style. I can only guess at why it's so common, but my assumption is that it's easier to restyle a ""fake"" button than it is to remove the default style and add something new, and that idea has become so pervasive that people just create these by default without really thinking about whether it's actually a button or a checkbox or a link. Aside from not adding basic alt-text to meaningful graphics (possibly including links and buttons), this is the single most common issue I deal with as a screen-reader user on the web.

The reason this design choice is a problem is mostly because of the assumption that a control which is clickable with a mouse and has a visually obvious function is good enough. The reality is that these controls--which are not really controls at all--are rendered to a screen-reader as nothing more than pieces of text. under certain conditions, the screen-reader can tell that they are clickable, but not much else. Depending on several factors, the screen-reader may be able to figure out how to activate them, or I may have to simulate a mouse click. If it's a checkbox, a multi-select list, or anything else where the items dynamically change colour to indicate whether they're selected, that change won't be indicated to the screen-reader (although I technically have a hotkey that tells me what colour something is.) The consequences of this can be anything from not knowing whether I've agreed to the terms and conditions to not knowing whether I chose to remove a sandwich ingredient I'm deathly allergic to. Some users prefer the keyboard even when they don't use a screen-reader, and using non-standard controls takes away their ability to use keyboard commands such as tab and space to move to and activate buttons.

One of the most popular poll plugins for Wordpress doesn't present the options as radio buttons. The other one does, but it shows a chart of results that has no alt-text. The numbers are right there, but they're automagically turned into an inaccessible graphic, and what Wordpress user is going to think of changing that? So it's not just content creators; it's also the people who make it possible for us to create content. Wordpress administrators won't know better, and will put out countless polls that will be inaccessible in some way. This is just one of an exhaustingly large list of examples.

There is a way to create accessible controls without actually using that control type, using [ARIA roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles). These essentially trick the screen-reader into seeing an element as something it's not, similar to styling a plain piece of text to visually look like something it's not. This is often what we do to existing projects in order to avoid breaking compatibility.

I don't know if anyone on this subreddit actually needs to hear this. and if there is a practical application for doing this, I'd love to know what it is. Right now, it looks like a lot of people just don't want to use standard controls or don't really think about what they're designing.

Lastly, I want to say that whenever I post something like this, I get a lot more people who do go the extra mile than people who don't. And realistically, that is reflected in my usage of the web. A lot of websites are great, and are only improving. Most developers care and want to make things better; they just don't have the time or knowledge or their company hasn't even informed them there is a problem despite customer service insisting they've forwarded my feedback to the developers. I regard this as a newbie mistake, not a malicious coding practice that all the big bad developers do just to piss me off. Nevertheless, I don't know how to spread the word that this is bad--and the word needs to be spread. So for those who have done literally anything at all to make your content more accessible: Thank you. You deserve an entirely separate post. I know it's not always easy, but these tiny nitpicky details are often the most common, and those usually *are* easy.",2020-07-23 21:48:27

cvajhw,I did it Reddit - I am now a full time Developer!,"This is just another little success story that I have the privilege to write up after leaning on so many stories just like this throughout the past 3 years.

In January, 2016, I decided to put my head down and learn JavaScript. I had some basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and could make a simple page - but the logic was obviously lacking. JS scared me. 

After my wife became pregnant, the fact that my job as a Cinema Tech wasn't going to go anywhere became more and more of a reality. So I learned JavaScript, I learned SASS. And I built stuff - A LOT of stuff. Stuff that was useless, some stuff was fun. I took Udemy courses, stalked Wes Bos and Scott Tolynski on Twitter to grab their latest courses, listened to podcasts and asked a LOT of questions on Reddit. I made websites for friends and family. I made an Electron app with Vuejs and Net-SNMP. I built stuff for my company that they are actually using and excited about!

I'm not going to lie, it was exhausting. I'd be putting 50-60 hours a week towards my actual job and then 30-40 towards code. 

But I did it! I start in a few weeks as a Jr. QA Engineer, working mostly remote and I am so excited. I can't imagine how much easier it will be to learn this stuff once it is my only job. 

PS - I just turned 32 and have a Bachelor of Science in Graphic Arts lol.

v45ju7,I lost my job today,"I lost my job today. Still kind of reeling from it as it was very abrupt.

I was supposed to have a call today with the CEO to discuss a pay raise. My acceptance letter back in January specified a review and pay increase after the company's series A, approximately three months into the position. Three months came and my call to get a raise kept getting pushed back, but they kept promising it would happen. I had it in writing, and literally everyone involved kept telling me how happy they were with what I was doing for the team, so I didn't really think about it. I had my issues with the job but I liked it and the team overall, so it didn't really bother me.

About a month ago, the person who hired and managed me very mysteriously and abruptly left or was removed from the company. I don't know what happened to them, but they were the one I was speaking to regarding a pay increase. I reached out to them on LinkedIn to wish them good luck in the future, and they said they were not allowed to speak with employees at the company.

I reached out to the next person in line to discuss my pay increase, the CEO, and about three weeks ago I finally had an in-person meeting with him. We grabbed coffee, and it was actually a pretty good time. We talked code and culture and all this stuff. He was personable, complimented the work I was doing for the company and said he was happy to have me on his team. I asked him for feedback, positive or negative, and he gave me only positive comments. At the end of the meeting he said he'd plug the salary I was asking for into some spreadsheets and return to me with a number.

My code finally went into production last week, the culmination of \~6 months of work. People were pleased, it was this massive push forward for their company and it was a very complex piece that I finished essentially all on my own. We finally scheduled a call to discuss my pay increase for earlier today and I didn't even really think about it that much. It felt like a forgone conclusion at this point; I was either going to get somewhat less than what I asked or what I asked for. Either way I'd be happy, even if it was just a modest increase.

The call comes along and it's very brief and cold. He opens up by saying ""I'm just going to cut to the chase, your employment with our company is officially terminated. Today will be your last day.""

Everything after that was very basic stuff. They're giving me 1 month's severance, they would wipe my computer remotely and send me a box to ship it back to them. I asked if there were any issues I could work on and they said I just wasn't a good culture fit, that they had other circumstances going on at the company, and they didn't want to spend the resources ""developing me"", which I'm still ruminating on.

I spoke about it with a couple people and the consensus seems to be that they probably just needed a FE dev to work on something for this big push, and now that it's done and there's a lull between that project and the next, they decided to trim the fat off the FE team. Since I was the most recent hire, I was most likely on the chopping block.

I keep thinking back to all the things I could've done wrong during my 6 months with this company. Did I take too much PTO? Did the fact that I didn't go to the optional office meetups bite me in the ass? Did I not work hard or well enough? It sucks because there's really no way to get any definitive answers for any of this, and the most likely scenario is just that they needed someone for a few months but didn't advertise the position as such.

It sucks, and it hurts, but there's really nothing more I can do except take my own self-criticism and be wary of that kind of behavior in the future. Writing this out helped me organize some things mentally and emotionally, so I'm just going to take today for myself, reach out to a couple close friends in the industry, and then rework my resume this weekend.",2022-06-03 18:21:16

I kept the email contact of the tech lead from a company I applied for back in October. I had made it to the final round in October, but I did not end up getting the position. I thought the lead was a really nice guy, so I emailed him last week. I told him how awesome the interview experience was and that I really liked the project they were working on. If in the future they had an internship opportunity I would be happy to participate and that I was not concerned about the money at all. One week from that email today I just got a call from the HR lady. She told me that they loved that I reached out to them and took initiative. They believe that I will do what it takes to learn and persevere. Tomorrow I get my offer letter. The only caveat is that they are starting me out at 20 hours or so a week part time, with the ability in a few months to go full time. She is sending my offer letter tomorrow. Either way I am just thankful to finally have some sort of opportunity with a real company. Its remote too! Don't ever give up, make sure to email companies back that you did well with in interviews. It could pay off! I'll be working with Node.Js in this position mainly, and I am very excited.",2023-02-03 01:20:00

t8v6lp,Do yourself a favor and stay away from GoDaddy,"If you're well versed in web development, you'd know that GoDaddy reviews are pretty trash. Unfortunately, the average consumer doesn't really understand why.

**TL:DR**
If you're looking to build a website it's MUCH BETTER to go with [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) as your domain registrar and [Siteground](https://hostinglnk.co/go/siteground) as your web hosting provider.

By doing this you save a significant amount of $$$ in the end because **GoDaddy up-charges you for stuff that you get for free with Namecheap + Siteground!** (more on this later).

The only caveat is it requires a few more steps to set-up. It's really not hard at all though... 

I highly recommend checking out [this YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/rpUJ1wbPcMU?t=25). It shows you exactly how to set everything up including the WordPress installation. It's also good to note that Siteground currently has an [80% discount](https://hostinglnk.co/go/siteground).

# 1yr GoDaddy Plan Breakdown
---

I'm going to break down for you why you should stay away from GoDaddy and why it's much better to go with an alternative.

Keep in mind I determined these figures using GoDaddy's cheapest web hosting plan.

**Provider** |	**Discount Period** |	**Starting Price** |	**Renewal Price** |
-|	-|	-|	-|
**GoDaddy Domain**|	1 Year|	$0|	$20|
**GoDaddy Web Hosting**|	1 Year|	$84|	$108|
**GoDaddy SSL**|	1 Year|	$0|	$99|
**Total**|		|**$84**|	**$227** ($19/mo)|

If you purchased all your web services with GoDaddy, it would cost you `$227` or `~$19/mo` AFTER the discount period ends. **The discount period lasts for 1 year.**

What a lot of people don't understand is companies will deliberately show you the discounted price on the checkout page and keep the renewal price in fine print!

If you were to checkout via GoDaddy you'll see a very attractive price of `$84`. Understand that this price only lasts for 1 year! After that, you'll pay `$227/yr`

Okay, now that we understand GoDaddy's pricing, let's go over the pricing for Namecheap + Siteground.

# 1yr Namecheap/Siteground Plan Breakdown
---

Keep in mind I determined these figures using Siteground's cheapest web hosting plan [StartUp](https://hostinglnk.co/go/siteground).

**Provider** |	**Discount Period** |	**Starting Price** |	**Renewal Price** |
-|	-|	-|	-|
**NameCheap Domain**|	1 Year|	$7|	$14|
**SiteGround Web Hosting**|	1 Year|	$35|	$180|
**SiteGround SSL**|	N/A|	$0|	$0|
**Total**|		|**$42**|	**$194** ($16.17/mo)|

As you can see, the Namecheap + Siteground combination is much more affordable. Not only are you saving $$$ during the discount period, but your renewal rates after the discount period(s) ends is cheaper! `$194` or `~$16/mo`.

The main reason being is that **Siteground does not charge your for an SSL certificate*. GoDaddy on the other hand charges you `$99/yr` for one! This is absolutely ridiculous... You do not need to pay for an SSL certificate. Most web hosting providers will provide you with one for FREE!

Sorry if it sounds like I'm getting too excited about this... I'm just frustrated with how often people fall for the marketing tricks of GoDaddy. Hell, even my mom fell for it (more on that story below).

**A quick re-cap on what to do:**

1. Go to [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and buy your domain
2. Go to [SiteGround](https://hostinglnk.co/go/siteground) and purchase your web hosting plan. (Make sure you select *""I already have a domain""* while doing so).
3. After purchasing both your domain and web hosting, you'll need to point your domains nameservers to Siteground!
4. Install WordPress
5. Profit $$$

If you're a visual person, [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/rpUJ1wbPcMU?t=25) perfectly demonstrates how to do this all.

---

**STORY TIME:** My mom recently built a website. Curious, I asked her what provider she used to get her domain and build the website. She said GoDaddy. I sighed in disappointment wishing she would have consulted me before building her website.

The main thing GoDaddy has going for it is its marketing which unsuspecting people fall victim to, believing it’s a good domain registrar and web hosting provider.

The truth is, GoDaddy leverages their successful marketing in order to upcharge for their services and profit. Their reviews are not very good amongst experienced web developers.

Even upon checkout, GoDaddy tries to upsell you on services like:

* Domain Protection
* Website Builder
* SSL Certificate
* Microsoft Office 365
* Google Email

Many of these services (like SSL certificates) can be gotten for free.

For the other services like Office 365 and a Google Business email, it'll be presented as **FREE** but if you read the fine print, you'll see it's only free for the first year, then they'll hit you with an overcharged monthly subscription fee.

# Domain Registration

The main reason why GoDaddy is bad is because their .com domains costs $12 for two years (which is already high for an introductory price). What people don’t realize though is that after two years, the cost jumps to $20/yr.

With Namecheap you can get a .com domain with an introductory rate of $7, however, the renewal rate is $14/yr.

# Web Hosting

Instead of buying your domain and web hosting directly from GoDaddy. It’s actually better to buy your domain separately from a domain registrar like Namesilo or Namecheap, then purchase your web hosting from a provider like [Siteground](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/sskmfw/siteground_web_hosting_review_honest_thoughts/). Of course don't take my work for it and do your own research to find the best web hosting provider that fits your needs.

Side Note: Bluehost is a [Newfold Digital](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/tag6sg/beware_of_newfold_digital_eig_if_you_are_buying/) company, which is also controversial on Reddit since they own a large portion of the web hosting market. It's best to go with a [Newfold alternative](https://www.reddit.com/r/HostingHostel/comments/tb667j/full_list_of_newfold_digital_eig_brands/).

**TL:DR** \- GoDaddy will overcharge you and upsell you services that are unnecessary.",2022-03-07 18:00:49

webk7m,On Monday I Start My First Job in Tech as a Junior Developer. I am 32 Years Old.,"Hi Everyone, 

So as the title says at 32 years old I am starting my new career as a Developer. I thought people might like to hear my journey and maybe find it useful if they are thinking of doing the same.

For some background on myself, after High School I went to University with the dream of making video games. However, within a year or so I realized that this was definitely NOT for me. I couldn't wrap my head around C++, Discrete Math was killing me and don't even get me started on Computer Architecture. I was at risk of failing out completely so I pulled a big 180 and decided I would become a Lawyer. Well, after 3 more years of University (for 5 total) I just wanted to be done with school and the thought of 3 more years for Law School sounded dreadful. I got my Degree though and was able to get a good job with a Social Justice organization and that's where I have been for over 8 years now.

For the last few years though I have been pretty burned out. The job pays okay, but there is no room for advancement really so if I stayed I would likely be doing the same thing everyday for the next 20 years. The job leaves no room for creativity in problem solving as we have to follow policy to the letter. Throw in Client's who can be draining and you get the picture.

When the Pandemic hit and we started WFH I realized I loved that! I also had more free time and decided if there was ever an opportunity for a change, now is that time. I knew I wanted to get back into the technology space and with a little research landed on web/software development. So I was kind of back where I started but now with a little more maturity and patience (and less binge drinking and parties). 

I found [The Complete Web Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course on Udemy and got to work. This really helped set a great foundation, for me at least, to get me started. It took me a couple Months to finish the course and from there I felt like I knew I was on the right path! I started watching more tutorials on YouTube and really focused on React/NextJS as my framework of choice. Around this time I ended up getting a Client who needed a website for their craft store. They didn't have a lot of money but to me I was just happy to have a real-world project so I charged way too little and we got to work. 

The store was run with SquareUp (more commonly just called Sqaure) and their API was... Okay... to work with. I was hit with imposter syndrome pretty quickly when I got started but was able to push through and was pretty happy with the site. The Client liked it too and was happy to have something running since new COVID restrictions locked everything down again. Over time I improved the site as I learned more and things were great. That is until in a hasty move the Client decided they wanted to leave Square and switch to Shopify, also I had a week to get the site working again... I got it working but it wasn't how the Client envisioned it working now as they wanted to use more Shopify features (they never really articulated which...) and our relationship ended pretty abruptly. They actually stiffed me on the last bill (about $200), so that was a good learning experience I guess. I check in on their new site from time-to-time, it's awful.

Anyways, without this Client anymore it opened up more time for me to learn and look at other opportunities. I ended up linking up with someone who ran their our freelance organization. He saw some potential in me and started to mentor me a bit and let me help on their projects, even paid me too! It was a few hours per week here and there but it was great to get real feedback on my work. I will forever be grateful for this help but ultimately they were just so busy they didn't always have time to help coach me along when deadlines were looming. At this point it has been a little over a year since I started my journey. I figured it was time for me to see if I could get a good enough portfolio together to start applying for jobs. 

I got a big boost in the portfolio department when my relatives golf league wanted a website for their members. They wanted a site so that members could enter their weekly scores, track attendance, and post announcements. They also wanted it to be able to randomly generate a tee time schedule for all attending. It would be a big project for me but I was pumped to take it on. I built the site with NextJS for the Front End and a Strapi headless CMS for the backend. It worked out perfectly and they couldn't be happier with the site. It took me about 3 months to get together and that bring us to about January of this year. I felt like I had a few good projects under my belt and started to apply.

Oh did I apply... LinkedIn says I applied to about 500 jobs on their platform. Add in more on Indeed, Zip Recruiter, and Angel, and I am probably pushing 1000 applications. Now, I will say I was not picky in my applications. Anything remotely close to what I thought I could do I applied. I figured it was a numbers game and I would let them be the gatekeepers, not me. Out of those ~1000 applications I would say 95% of them were quick rejections. I did a handful of technical tests for some (I will never do another Hatchways assessment again) and had mixed results. Most of the ones that started with the technical test I would be rejected from. 

I also had some companies reach out to me from Github for interviews. This was so exciting since it felt like I was wanted. Spoiler, none of these companies led anywhere. Most were a quick interview and ghosting. 1 of them I actually went through 2 interviews, the 2nd being with the CTO who said they would reach out in a couple days with a job offer. Never heard from them again, even with follow ups. Likely a blessing though since it was in the Crypto/NFT space lol. Another one I went through 3 rounds and though I had it! I aced the technical test, and the final interview was basically a ""here's what your first week/month/year will look like"". 2 days later I got the HR rejection email. Never got any feedback. A dozen more were just an interview and rejection, or just straight ghosting after the interview (always fun).

Throughout this time I am refining my resume, working on projects here and there, and continuing to learn. 

Then about a month ago I got an interview. I nailed the opening HR interview, really felt like they liked me after that one. Only took a couple days later for them to send me a technical test. I really took my time and felt like I nailed it when I submitted it. The next day I got a call to set up the next interview with a Team Lead who would go over my test results and as well test me some more. I was really nervous at this point since it seemed like I was doing really well and had a good chance. This interview was over an hour long and covered good range of topics from background, to future goals, some command line stuff and then React coding. After it was done I felt really good. I was trying not to get my hopes up though since I had been burned so many times before. 

A couple days later I got a call from HR. They were offering my the job! They sent the Agreement a couple days later and last week I put in my notice. It's exciting and scary changing careers in your 30's but I know it is the right move. I feel like at this point the only way I am going to improve as a developer is if it is my full-time job. I know the first few weeks/months will be tough but I plan on really using the ""Junior"" part of my title to learn as much as I can. 

Anyways, that's my journey. If anyone has any questions I'd love to answer them! Hopefully I can help someone else in a similar boat as me!",2022-08-02 13:21:47

muuhc4,"Ironic... after applying for months to jobs that ask specifically for the languages/frameworks that I'm good at and for which I have multiple projects, I get an offer to become a React developer because I studied the react docs for 2 days and did a ""create and validate a form"" task.","I genuinely feel like Ashton Kutcher is gonna jump out of a bush and tell me I've been Punk'd any moment now. I've been applying for jobs in the past 2-3 months now, and I got a couple interviews that didn't lead to anything.

This past Friday, I was browsing some job listings and noticed one that required knowledge of ""React, Angular or other front-end frameworks"" and which was suitable for people with little to no experience. As a Vue.js connoisseur, I decided to apply in case Vue.js was part of those ""other front-end frameworks"". 2-3 hours later, I received a phone call asking if I'd be down for an interview in about 3 hours. The interview lasted about 15 minutes during which the 2 interviewers introduced themselves, then asked me to introduce myself as well and tell them about the languages, frameworks and technologies that I use. Finally they gave me a React task and 3 days to do it. The task was to create a SPA with only 1 view that contains a form with all input types + validation that makes a POST request to hookbin.

I read through the React documentation during the weekend, and since React and Vue.js do share some similarities, I was able to complete the task. As this was my first React project ever, I had my doubts about how good the code was, so I wasn't expecting a call back. I submitted it on Monday, and 2-3 hours after my submission, I received an email invitation for a second interview. To my surprise, during the second interview, they told me they were satisfied with the task and offered me to join them. At that point, I started worrying that maybe I accidentally mislead them into believing that I've got experience with react and I wanted to make sure that there isn't any misunderstanding, so I told them:

""Just to clarify, you do understand that up until now, I've only used Vue.js and in order to complete the task, I just read the React documentation and applied my knowledge from Vue.js. All of my projects use Vue.js and none uses React. That being said, I don't mind learning React as long as you don't mind my current inexperience""

They said that they were completely fine with that. I genuinely started feeling paranoid because it felt... too easy. 2 interviews that lasted about 15 minutes each + a really simple task is all it took. Most job listings ask for shitload of languages/frameworks/technologies, then the interviews are riddled with leetcode, data structures and algorithms questions ( which is fine, just not my forte ). Finally they hit you with a huge task and give you 2 days to finish it, after you've asked for 3 ( whilst feeling optimistic about it ). It felt almost as if I'm being scammed or something :D .

tfv3im,I did it!!,"I got the job!!!!  I finally get to be the one to make a post about this!

After months of interview after interview, I finally got the offer letter.

I'll be a remote UX Engineer (basically front-end developer) for a smaller agency.  Full time, pays decent, good amount of PTO, benefits, holidays off!

I am completely self taught, taking a bit of Leon Noel's free online cohort the first time around, as well as working with The Odin Project for a large part as well.

My major push was working on projects and building out things that I really wanted to make.  That project based learning really got me to develop my skills and finally led me to today!

Now I will finally not be working in retail for the rest of my life and can working in a field I actually enjoy.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Wow thank you all so much for the kind words! I am so excited to feel part of a community like this.

A few words of advice: 

Don't give up!  It takes a lot of effort and you should be proud of where you start at.  

Also, don't be discouraged by a no, or from no response from a job posting. I had countless no responses, moving forward with other applicants, and initial calls with no follow up.  Part of the fight is getting back up after a loss, especially with job applications. 

In the same vein, hit apply! I promise you that all the qualifications (especially in a more junior/entry level role) are not a reason to not apply. I don't know much about Shopify which was a desired skill of my position, but I still applied! If you see even <60% of the qualifications as something you can do, just apply and reach out on linkedin to recruiters/HR in the company.  

Build projects!!! It is super important to have your own work that isn't from a tutorial, as well as a way to learn concepts on your own.  My biggest work was just from an idea i had on my own. I found that when i would show a hiring manager things I made on my own, they were more impressed than if i made yet another calculator app or a todo list.

k97llo,Had a breakdown at work - should I just quit my job at this point?,"I'm not sure why I wrote this, I think I'm just looking to vent. Long story short, I got this job as a front end developer a year ago. I was switching fields and my company knew I'm a beginner (I knew basic HTML, CSS and Javascript). I spend 2 months  trying to learn React, Typescript and Material UI , while also working. I was closing tickets from the second week of work and I got a mentor to help me with my learning/ closing the tickets.

The tasks were always too much for what I could do (I always suspected it and some of my colleagues were saying the same thing). From components of 50 lines, which I wrote when I was learning, now I got into our code base which is full of custom React components, with almost no documentation and spanning from 300 to 1000+ lines of code. To be honest I never complained to the management directly about the difficulty of the tasks, and when I asked them what they think about my performance, they said they are happy with me. Few months ago I got a project which is just huge. I'm working alone on it and my mentor is supervising and helping when I get stuck. Which in the last 2 months is almost daily.

The colleagues are incredibly supportive and they never say no if I need help but after one year I feel like I'm a drag for the team. Always asking for help, not being able to come up with solutions on my own. To make an analogy, I feel like I was thrown in the water without knowing how to swim and being asked to come up with elegant swimming techniques when I can barely stay afloat and not drown. I started to get headaches and stomach pain, I don't sleep well anymore and I have anxiety attacks more and more often.

Today while having a Zoom meeting with my mentor, realizing I don't understand anything (AGAIN) from the solution he came up with for a specific problem we were having, I had an anxiety attack and started crying. Video was off but he realized what's happening. I broke down and told him I have no idea what I'm doing and that I can't keep up with the project anymore.  I immediately felt  embarrassed and apologized but at this point I feel it's too late. He tried to be encouraging saying that I'm doing well and that I learned a lot of things in one year but I just don't see it.

I don't know what to do, I feel like a fraud every day and I dread starting to work. I'm not the lazy type, I work extra during my free time, I research things and try to understand the code, but I just feel  overwhelmed . And now this crying episode. I think I should either look for another or just give up  developing all together...

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: thank you everyone! I was hesitant to post and it's very heart-warming to see developers supporting other developers, especially junior ones. Your replies contain a lot of valuable advice so I will already start to take some of it:

\- I'll fill a holiday request for the end of this month

\- I'll go back to Javascript and revisit the fundamentals (being self taught it's very possible I'm lacking in this department and this increases my anxiety and frustration).

As for the rest, I hope it will come with time and I will stop putting so much pressure on myself.

Because I got this question a few times: yes, I do like being a developer and I feel proud of my work every time I see my code in production. The career change was pretty taxing income wise and difficult in general but I do enjoy it most of the times (especially when working on personal projects).

Thank you again for taking the time and writing some nice words - especially to senior devs who maybe don't always realize how their reassuring words can change the day/ mind of someone who's in a shitty spot.",2020-12-08 16:41:25
e8og0l,"“Our agency is so busy that some days our staff barely take their lunch break, is that OK for you?”","Me : “I have always found that disorganisation is what causes these sorts of issues. 

Did management not attempt a review as to find what is going wrong, that the staff are being required to stay longer to finish the workload?”

Needless to say I did not get the job, nor did I want it in the end.

It’s infuriating how companies try to put a spin on what is a poor work environment.

How would you feel if you were asked a question like this? I personally almost always take my breaks and leave on time. Companies have never shown me any loyalty when I put in the extra effort, so I have leant the hard way.",2019-12-10 09:24:49

vlv6rt,Negatives comments on my r/webdev post led to this moment...,"In January I posted about a book I released on GatsbyJS ([you can see the post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/sfewru/i_wrote_a_book_on_web_dev_took_me_a_year/)). While it had a lot of upvotes, the comments weren't the most positive:  
""Gatsby is dead"", ""You should have written about nextJS"", and someone even suggesting they were going to pirate it and give it away. It hit pretty hard. I'd spent close to a year writing something and to be met with that kinda response got me down. 

**I think the thing that sucked the most is people were kind of right** \- the book wasn't going to have a huge shelf life and to be honest my heart wasn't in it. Now the reality is even if I had written about Next.js, eventually even that will be redundant too. The kind of books that do withstand the test of time in the web dev space are process books. And there is one kind of process in this space that I absolutely LOVE and am a bit of a connoisseur at - HACKATHONS. So I went away and spent 5 months writing this. Possible the most fun project I have ever worked on.

On the whole I think this community is incredibly supportive but if you have the courage to post something you've worked on and you get hit with negative feedback, I hope you can find a way to turn it into a positive. You're all awesome in my book 🤣.

x7xhyy,"After 15 years in web dev, my best advice to new developers is that it doesn’t always matter how much you know.","Instead, it’s your ability to adapt to new concepts and technologies. The ability to understand the “bigger picture” of the entire web dev landscape (what tools are being used and what paradigms are shifting), without necessarily being proficient in all of those technologies, will serve you well in your career.

The adage “Jack of all trades, master of none” could sum up my entire career. Sure, you may be proficient in one or two stacks, or you may have cut your teeth on a popular framework and know the ins-and-outs. But if you only keep your focus on that limited, but deep, well of knowledge, you may find it hard to flip the script at a seconds notice and easily learn something else when the situation requires it.

My point being, don’t be afraid to dabble in a little bit of everything and get your feet wet, without always worrying that you aren’t going in deep enough. If the job or the project requires something that you are not familiar with, you should be experienced enough with self learning and training that you can pick it up without feeling completely overwhelmed.",2022-09-07 06:15:54

9nqmaz,Walked out of a final interview for the first time in my career: lessons learned,"This was for a full stack web dev position. I had had about 3 phone interviews with this company, each time they were pretty disorganised, but they seemed nice enough. We had decided on a salary and it seemed like we were about to seal the deal, but we both felt one final in-person interview would be best. I'm currently employed, so I took a day of leave and flew out there, then bussed over to the other side of town.

I arrived and he talked about the piece of software the company had done for what felt like hours. It was a pretty vanilla ASP.NET crud app, and as he talked, various things appeared to break. Oddly he found time in this presentation to complain to me about a minority ethnic group in our country. Bringing up race and politics in an interview is incredibly unprofessional, so I steered the subject back to technology.

Then the 'technical questions' came, and it was clear he had some kind of agenda. Whenever he talked about something I didn't know, he'd be smug and condescending. Whenever I talked about something he didn't know (this isn't my first rodeo, I can tell when someones bluffing), he'd be dismissive and change the subject. And whenever he talked about something we both knew - I could tell he was full of it. He never asked any general questions, about computer science, or software engineering, or even questions about C#. They were all questions about the minutiae of different libraries, trying to catch me out for not knowing the exact same tech stack as he did.

I was also asked to show him stuff I had done for my current employer - this was had not been mentioned previously at all. When I said all the things I'd done them were internal, he asked me to log into their system and show me!

(A fun tidbit: the guy claimed that database normalisation was stupid. He also proudly showed me a hairy stored procedure that called 5 other hairy stored procedures that generated a model for a very basic MVC page. And complained that many of his queries took a long time. I think these things may be related.)

As petty as it sounds, it all unravelled when we tried to talk about structs and classes in C#. First he said that no one uses structs anymore because value types are slow. Then he literally said 'no one uses constructors anymore'. That combination of self-assuredness and wrongness was it for me. Mid sentence, I shot up out of my chair, said 'thanks for your time!' and shook his hand. When he asked me why I was leaving, I was about to give him a piece of my mind... but I just thanked him again and got the hell out of there.

My key takeaways from this:

- If an organisation shows signs they're disorganised/unprofessional in the early stages of the interview process, I'll cut it short.
- If I am going to fly out for an interview, I am going to make sure it's just a meet a greet and there's no tech questions at that point. The hard stuff should be already out of the way
- Get a demo of one of their products early on. I really don't mind that much if it's a buggy piece of shit, but if you're arrogant about your abilities despite producing a buggy piece of shit - that's a huge issue.
- While I am less than pleased with the time/money I wasted attending this interview, I am proud of myself for getting the hell out of there rath than engaging in unprofessional behaviour on my own end.",2018-10-13 03:03:56

glz7rn,AWS tutorials by an ex-AWS engineer - Interested?,"Hi everyone,

I worked at AWS as a software engineer for a few years. I've noticed some interesting things since leaving:

* People who want to deploy websites/apps/pages are really, really daunted by AWS.
* Trying to find AWS tutorials online is just awful. It feels like everything is either a manual, a ""12 hour certification course"" or an outdated Medium article from 2016. 
* Many people are using Netlify, which is really just a wrapper around AWS, and similar ""instantly deploy services"".

I've recently helped some friends in the startup world set things up on AWS - mostly deploying static sites. So far, all of them are now 

* spending less money on hosting
* getting better load time on their sites
* deploying things pretty much as quickly as Netlify's offering

I'm thinking of writing up some friendly resources/tutorials on using AWS so others can have these benefits too.

Would you guys be interested in this? 

If so, **please let me know what kind of tutorial you'd like to see.** It'll help me decide on the best tutorials to start with. For example, it could be ""deploying a static site on S3 + CloudFront"".

**EDIT:** Wow I didn't expect this much attention! I'm trying my best to note down all the info from your comments and messages, but it'd be a huge help if you could also answer in this form I setup quickly: https://forms.gle/SFTuigCBeupeReV2A.

Filling that out will also make it easier for me to distribute tutorials I create to you guys.

**EDIT 2:** 
I've been combing through all of your responses and have started preparing a roadmap of tutorial topics, which I'll communicate soon!

From what you've all said, it looks like Youtube and blog posts/articles are the best ways to provide these tutorials to you guys.

I've setup some pages which I'll use to post tutorials if you'd like to subscribe to them in the meantime:

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuKP0tNM7tWR8EAOdr4utOw)
- [Medium](https://medium.com/@awstutorials)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/awstutorials_io)

I'll also put up a website (which will include blog posts) real soon! I think that'll be a great way of collating all the channels and resources into one place.

If you think I've missed a distribution channel or anything else, please feel free to DM me!

Lastly, if you signed up on the Google Form, I'll be reaching out soon with updates!

Thanks everyone :)",2020-05-18 10:48:05

95sofq,We're all terrible at what we do.,"I just read https://xkcd.com/2030/ and it got me thinking.

Nearly all software is crap. It starts off all clean and elegant and full of good intentions but by the time it's been in contact with the Real World for a few years it turns into crap. Apps. Compilers. Tools. Libraries. Everything. 

Bugs creep in. Designs are hammered in to shapes they were never suppose to become. Vulnerabilites appear. Slowdowns and ""random behaviors"" start to show up.

I've been developing software since the 80's and just realized that everything, at every place I've worked on is just a sack of scary parts that happens to look like it works because nobody noticed the bugs or they just never encountered the broken parts. This isn't just stuff I worked on. It's stuff anybody has worked on. I've had maybe 5 jobs over the last 30+ years and once I actually got to look at the codebase, found that not a single one had clean, well designed systems that stayed that way.

I'd also like to mention that ""Software Engineer"" is just title inflation. It's really not engineering. It's more like cubist art where the parts just seem to mostly work together.

I'll be retiring in about a year.

6a6d64,The FCC claims it was hit with a DDoS attack at the exact same time as John Oliver's segment on net neutrality,"UPDATE: The FCC is [now claiming](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/08/john-oliver-net-neutrality-238132) that it was also hit by a DDoS attack back in 2014, the last time John Oliver did a segment about net neutrality. This makes me even more skeptical. These are serious claims -- they need to show us the proof. The only way we'll know what really happened is if the FCC released their logs to an independent party who can verify their claims.

UPDATE 2: Now we are pretty sure the FCC is lying. Our software dev has confirmed that the FCC's site [went down again](http://imgur.com/a/cALQp) last night around 8:30pm EST, shortly after the John Oliver segment would have aired again on HBO. He also confirmed that their servers repeatedly fell down under net neutrality comments coming through [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com) over the last two weeks. It seems extremely likely the FCC is attempting to cover up the fact that their comment system simply cannot handle large amounts of feedback from the public. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  just issued a [press release](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-344764A1.pdf) claiming, “Beginning on Sunday night at midnight, our analysis reveals that the FCC was subject to multiple distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS).” 

The FCC is saying that the site hosting their comment system was attacked *at the exact same time* comments would have started flooding in from John Oliver’s viral Last Week Tonight [segment about net neutrality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak). The media [widely reported](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/john-oliver-tackles-net-neutrality-again-crashes-fcc-comments-site-again/) that the surge in comments crashed the FCC’s site. 

Disclosure: I am a a net neutrality activist and I work for [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org) one of the groups behind [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com). I have been paying close attention to the issue since 2014, and have been part of efforts that [overwhelmed](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-fcc-website-net-neutrality-20140715-story.html) the FCC’s comment site in the past. 

The FCC’s statement today raises two concerns for me. It strikes me that either:

1. The FCC is being intentionally misleading, and trying to claim that the surge in traffic from large numbers of people attempting to access their site through John Oliver’s GoFCCYourself.com redirect amounts to a “DDoS” attack, to let themselves off the hook for essentially silencing large numbers of people by not having a properly functioning site to receive comments from the public about an important issue, or—worst case—is preparing a bogus legal argument that somehow John Oliver’s show *itself* was the DDoS attack.

2. Someone actually did DDoS the FCC’s site at the exact same time as John Oliver’s segment, in order to actively prevent people from being able to comment in support of keeping the Title II net neutrality rules  many of us fought for in 2015.

Given the current FCC chairman Ajit Pai’s [open hostility](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/26/trump-overturn-net-neutrality-rules-resistance) toward net neutrality, and the telecom industry’s [long history](https://news.vice.com/article/cable-companies-are-astroturfing-fake-consumer-support-to-end-net-neutrality) of astroturfing and paying [shady organizations](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/shady-conservative-group-is-flooding-the-fcc-with-anti-net-neutrality-comments) to influence the FCC, either of these scenarios should be concerning for anyone who cares about government transparency, free speech, and the future of the Internet. 

One thing that we can do right now is call for the FCC to release its logs to independent security analysts so that we know what actually happened. The public has a right to know. You can email the FCC’s Chief Information Officer asking for them to do this at <David.Bray@fcc.gov> or call 202-418-2020

ruahwv,Not every showoff project is geared towards developers,"I've seen this twice in the last 24 hours and I am assuming there is more, people show off something cool they have built and someone in the comments responds with:

>I could build it in 5 minutes

>it's so simple to do it why are people impressed by it

>this browser api is well known its not impressive 

Some people build beginner projects and while we all know photoshop is better than your little watermark editor or your effects editor, it is still a cool project and there is no need to point it out especially to beginners

Basically those projects can be divided in 2: beginners getting their feet wet, which doesn't mean anything useful so any comments pointing that out are useless and just end up hurting the op

Second type is projects for non developers in which case it doesn't matter of you can do it in 2 minutes, or that you cam automate it, it's a nice project for muggles, and the op should still be proud even if you could do it better or faster

As a new years resolution let's try to keep our comments constructive and helpful, not try to destroy every aspiring programmers dreams",2022-01-02 14:17:49
fr7nox,What I've learned in my first 6 months working as a developer,"I started my first programming job at the start of *October in 2019*.

**Junior Full-Stack Developer** is my title, and here's a list of what I've learned since then and some other random bits and pieces I've learned.


## **A bit of context**

- The company I work for is a relatively small Fintech startup (~18 employees total)
- We use Vue, Node.js (Koa) and MongoDB, so it's full-stack JS.
- We're a team of 4 devs: Tech Lead, Senior, Mid Level & Junior (me)
- 3 of us are self-taught, everyone went to University except me 


___

## **What an average day is like**


**8:20**: Arrive at work, set up my laptop, get a drink, open Github and just catch up with slack, etc. Open up Google calendar and see what's going on for the day, just generally settle in.

**10 - 12**: Most meetings happen in these hours, team meetings often happen around 10 and daily standup is at 12. They're mostly like 30 minutes of just talking about what we've been doing, dev team meetings are mostly looking at the Github milestones and reviewing how we've been doing, standups are basically reviewing the work we've been doing recently and discussing what's happening today, just catching up with each other and staying on track in general.


**12:30**: Gym time wooo 💪. I replace my lunch with this, which is why I arrive a bit earlier than the typical 9-5. A surprisingly good way to break up working all day. They're nice enough to not track my hours and be strict about how long I spend.

**5:15**: Between lunch and the end of the day there might be a meeting, but usually after lunch, I just quietly code away until I leave. On some days we have little birthday parties and small things like that to make work seem less work-like I suppose, these usually happen around 4:30-5.

___


## **Code Expectation vs Reality**

### **Expectations**:
1. When I accepted the offer I had never used Vue before, so I had to get up to speed with using Vue instead of React before I could even do anything. I expected to be pretty useless and struggle with it quite a lot.

2. I expected working in a team would be hard, I had no idea how they would manage Git and I had limited experience interacting with others using Git. I knew the fundamentals but obviously, I had never worked on a team before.

3. JavaScript knowledge wise I wasn't too concerned, I was quite sure I knew a lot about JS in general, especially for a junior role. 

4. I expected things to be very strict and limited, tests, comments.

5. I thought my ideas and things I knew wouldn't be needed or wanted *(e.g in meetings I should just do whatever the senior says to do because I'm the junior)*


### **Reality**:
1. Vue isn't that different from React, I was able to transfer a lot of knowledge. I'm still not as comfortable with Vue as I was with React even now though, but I'm getting there. *(The senior dev is very active in the Vue Land discord chat helping people - so being able to ask questions and get in-depth answers directly related to work makes life a lot easier.)*

2. Working in a team isn't as difficult as I expected. I make a branch and push my changes, making a PR for review when I'm done. The most confusing thing I've had to do is branch off a few times and merge conflicts. I keep it **very** simple 🤠.  

3. JavaScript wise I've learned a few things (and taught some stuff too), my expectations were about right that I knew enough general JS.

4. There's linting enforced, some stuff is tested (but not a lot!) and comments are a luxury. Most code is not commented, which is not too bad if it's descriptive, but some confusing things that are hidden away are quite exactly that, hidden away. Reality is far from what they show you.

5. The dev team was kind of unhappy that I didn't give my opinions more often and brought it up in one of my reviews early on, saying I had good ideas but didn't tend to let people know about them. As time has gone on I've been putting my ideas out there more and the other devs seem to agree with me, so in general, everyone seems happy to share ideas, there's no longer a ""but you're a junior!"" feeling and my ideas are welcomed.

___
## **Work Expectation vs Reality**

### **Expectations**:

1. I honestly had no idea what to expect, I had no clue about any finance stuff at all, I expected to be totally overwhelmed with finance words I didn't understand.

2. I imagined that the typical 9 to 5 work hours would leave me with a lot of free time after work and that I'd spent at least 7 of those actually writing code.

3. I expected to be bad at soft skills, for sure.

4. I'm way less intelligent than everyone else, they all went to uni and I'm a dropout. 


### **Reality**:

1. The financial side of the business is mostly handled by other people, there is a lot of things people say I still don't get...But I don't really have to when I need to understand them, I just ask a few questions and get a general idea of how it works, combined with a bit of googling on the subject if needed.

2. Most of my time is spent not writing code, like 50% at best. 10-20% is taken up just by meetings or just talking to people. The rest is reading code, code reviews or being on a break. I also have almost no free time, by the time I get home and get all my daily required things done I just want to go to sleep. I was entirely not used to this compared to my previous habits of writing code for 14 hours a day.

3. I am bad at soft skills. I can't bring myself to talk to people for no reason at all. We're separated on 2 floors - I rarely see people on the other floor & I leave the office at lunch so the only real way to talk to them is to relocate myself to the other floor.

4. Pretty much true. I have a lot less random school-related knowledge. I am just uneducated outside of what I've taught myself.


___

**TL;DR**: My expectations vs reality of starting my first job has been that things are a lot easier and way more relaxed than I expected. I am indeed just a bit of an awkward developer that wants to write code and not chat about random stuff in the kitchen. 🤷

## **Tips and stuff I found important**


### **Git**

Obviously working with a team Git will be the most important thing to understand teamwork wise, I feel if you can do all the basics *(clone, push, pull, merge, make a PR, etc)* you'll be fine.

We do things slightly differently to what I expected here, we make a branch and push to it and then merge it after review. *(using Github labels to figure out what's going on)*.


 
### **Ask questions**


Getting the right balance of how many questions you ask is important, if you ask too few you'll get stuck on small things too often, if you ask too many you'll be wasting a lot of time.

It's hard to say what the right amount is, but if you ask the right types of questions it doesn't matter how many you ask.

If you can google it *(e.g the question is a generic question about JS)* then google it. If you feel like asking in person just to discuss it a bit, you can.


If the question is codebase specific then just ask it.


If you're stuck for over like 30-40 minutes just staring at the screen wondering why something won't work, ask for help. Sometimes all it takes is someone to look at the same thing and they'll spot something you didn't right away. *(This doesn't have to be in person, you can ask a random person in a chat or stack overflow, etc.)*


Overall you have to kind of humble yourself and not feel shy or ashamed to ask for help, even if it's a small thing. Being a junior gives you the perfect excuse anyway 🤠. They want you to ask questions.



### **Find what works for you**

Personally, I spend a lot of time on discord discussing code with others, sometimes I'm ""at work"" but solving someone else's problem, teaching something or just talking random code stuff.

This almost sounds bad, like I'm wasting company time... But honestly, I feel taking breaks from what I'm doing helps me just feel happier with what I'm doing overall.

I feel like I'm able to do what I want, when I want - as long as I do the work at an expected pace and I'm becoming a better developer at the same time, I feel this is exactly what I **want** to be doing.

I expected ""working"" to be a miserable thing I did to earn money, but by being able to just break it up and do what I enjoy *(gym & chilling discussing code)*, I feel way happier and enjoy going to work.



### **Code reviews are good**

You can learn a **lot** from code reviews 😸! 

Not just people reviewing your code, but reviewing other people's code and also looking at reviews other people made unrelated to your code.

You have to understand you are not your code. If someone says you did something wrong, you shouldn't be upset they're saying you did it wrong, they're saying the code you wrote isn't correct. Everyone has times when they're tired and the code just isn't good, it happens. 🤷



### Take notes

I wrote up notes of most things that were confusing to me. There was a LOT of things done in a very specific way I'd never seen before, specific to our codebase only.

The problem with asking questions is that you'll get an answer, but if you don't come across that thing again. You may have forgotten the next time it comes up. 


I use markdown to write notes and then when writing something for GitHub I just copy/paste it in there as part of the Issue/PR and it's already in the correct format. 


___


And that's about it, I've probably missed a few things as the time has just kind of flown by, but I think everything is going fine and all my reviews have been overly positive, the transition from self-taught to ""proper"" work has been fine.

It all started with a simple contract i received, and once i received an initial payment of $1300, my account got limited and frozen, i contacted them asking about the reason behind this, and they just simply told me it was because of outside communication, to which i responded that it's very normal call to go over everything, that is a business standard, and the contract went through the platform and so did the payment, so there was no reason behind these extreme majors they took.

The money was frozen and they told me that it would stay that way, up until they closed my account for good one week after with a simple email, saying that they closed my account.

I have worked on this platform for over 7 years, finished countless projects with full perfect five star reviews, never hurt anyone or hurt the platform in any way, and the only thing i did occasionally that was frowned upon was a call here or there to explain something to a client or to share my screen with them, and its not my fault that they did not provide these features on their platform and i had to use something else to make up for their shortcomings.

In conclusion, i gave them 7 years of my life; they closed my account for nothing, stole from me, and took away my main source of living.

I have not been able to even leave my house for the past week, and had to force myself to write this review, even as just a warning for people, and I’ll make sure that everyone hears about what happened to me.",2019-04-27 17:27:28

While those are \*ok\* for developing some pattern matching skills (i.e. implementing an existing design), they really don't stand out to anyone. Especially becasuse everyone does the same project.

So why not do something that

1. Stands out a lot more
2. Is much more educational
3. Has a positive impact on the field

Probably because it's hard. Sometimes PRs never get merged in. It takes a lot more communication, you have to discuss implementations and wait for code reviews.

BUT that's what every day as a software engineer is like. And it's worthwile to make an effort!

**Common issues**

1. I don't know where to get started
2. I've tried and had a bad experience

I'm excluding the ""I don't have time to code free"" because I'm explicitly talking about people who are already spending their spare time doing tutorials / self learning.

Number 1 is pretty easy to resolve. Lots of resources available.

Number 2 is harder. Sometimes there are really toxic people in the OS community. I've had a lot of contributions rejected (and told I was stupid for trying). To avoid this I usually:

1. Look for repos with less than 200 stars (usually the more popular, the less beginner friendly)
2. Communicate. Respond to an open issue. Open a new one if it hasn't been address. Solicit feedback, and get maintainer buy-in before slinging out code.

Edit:

Update at 17:42

Seriously, thank you all for those good tips and positive vibes!

For my surprise, I slept pretty well last night, even though I was and I am still pretty nervous, also excited.

There has been few questions about my education and journey to this point, so here it comes:

 I'm 32 years old man living in Scandinavia, and after I had done a bunch of shit jobs for over a decade, I started studying. I went to University of Applied sciences and my path is a bachelor of IT engineering. It didn't took long, till I found out, that programming is my passion.

This is my third year at school, one year to go, and I've done all kinds of school- and hobby projects. Mostly the school projects have been simple work time tracking-, project- and warehouse management web apps.

I made friends with one of my classmates pretty soon. He's same age than me, and because of we were kind of boomers in our class, we bonded well right away. We spend a lot of our spare time together, go outdoors camping etc etc (inb4 get a room fags), so I can say, he knows me and my programming skills pretty well.

He had been programming as a hobby for years before our school started and he has been way ahead of everyone else of our class during the whole studies. He has been also working for a year now at IT company, and last week he gave me a tip of job opportunity. He told me, that one of the seniors of the company is leaving, and they are hiring 2-3 juniors. I started to make my own portfolio right away. Meanwhile my classmate told his bosses about me, and they all said, that message them asap. I posted them a simple application (without that portfolio), where I told about techniques I know and the level of my skills (and I was honest, I told them, that I'm a noob on nearly every language). So they arranged a remote meeting, there was three gentlemen interviewing me last Monday, I shared my screen and presented some of my projects and my portfolio to them and they asked me, that shall I start on Friday. The weight of my role will be on front end developing, at least in the beginning. I understand a lot more of front-, than back end. 


If I think about the interview situation afterwards, I wasn't confident at all and after the interview I just kept wondering, that how the fudge they even hired me.

All in all, I was so lucky to get this specific job, but if I wouldn't, I'd be writing and sending applications to another companies.

So, today the new saga begins. And as everyone tipped, I'm gonna take notes as a maniac, be enthusiastic and try my best to keep learning :) This is the point, when the real learning begins.

They're solving problems that I don't have and (for me) muddy up the ""vanilla"" learning of JS, HTML, CSS, and Node","I'm wondering if this makes sense. Because when I look at beginner tutorials they almost all use these frameworks. I've been spending most of my time learning JS, but I I just learned that Node.js has its own routing ability, and that CSS has variables. If I just started using 99% of Node.js tutorials I would be skipping straight to using express.js. 

And after a lot of reading and watching I still have no idea why the hell I would need a framework. But then again state management isn't a big deal for me right now, which seems to be the main use case?

My gut tells me to just ignore these things until I need them. But any intro Udemy course, or even the famous free bootcamps, all seem to include these frameworks as if they are core topics in web development. Is it just the instructors/courses bending their course to student expectations, or have I missed the reason these are taught as beginner topics?",2020-08-19 13:53:03

So I wonder if they may have found my social media accounts etc.

o7gg1p,"After 8 months of self-taught, I was approached by Netflix and interviewed for a senior position. I need your advice."," Hi everyone, I thought it would be interesting to share this unique experience with you guys and I really need some further advice.

First of all, I'm a self-taught Front-End developer based in Brisbane Australia, I majored in Advertising art at Uni and used to be a digital media editor for 4 years. Last year, I decided to make a career change when the quarantine hit.

So I began to learn Front-end development, after 8 months, I finished my first project, a Netflix clone without following any tutorial and I put it on Reddit for some feedback.

The post went viral beyond my expectations, it got more than 3k upvotes in less than 12 hours. The positive feedback I received was also overwhelming. Thanks again for the supports, all of you!

One day, I got a private message from a very kind and nice senior software engineer who is working at Netflix, he told me he was very impressed by my work and my passion. Also to my surprise, he afforded me the opportunity to have a chat directly with his manager who is based in NYC.

As a non-English speaker, I really can't describe the feeling accurately when I knew that as a self-taught, no-experience, my work was recognized by the real Netflix team. It felt like I'm having the sweetest dream in the world.

A few days later, I had a video interview with the manager. Oddly to me, the position title was 'senior software engineer' which I found out later that all software engineers at Netflix are seniors.

The interview itself went well in my eyes. We talked about my experience, learning journey, passion for SE, and future learning plans, etc. At the end of the interview, the manager indicated the potential future steps would be technical interviews with engineers on coding challenges, homework, and algorithm/data structure whenever I feel ready.

That was when I realized I couldn't get this job at this moment because I know literally nothing about algorithm/data structure. And I have already heard that FAANG companies have really high requirements regards of how good their candidates are at algorithm/data structure.

I wish I could be a genius to know all of the knowledge in just 8 months of self-teaching and got this job. But in reality, I'm not.

I have to accept the hard truth that when the great opportunity came, I wasn't ready for it.

However, I think this experience is still priceless to me because now I know that myself has potential, and I want to become better and better so eventually, I can work at Netflix.

The question is how. What should I focus on next? My thought is that I'll keep job hunting in Australia and gain some solid real-world experience while starting to learn algorithm/data structure.

But how should I know when I'm ready? I mean this question may sound silly but I think everyone has imposter syndrome, I probably need more insights to keep me feeling confident.

I really need your advice. Thank you heaps in advance!",2021-06-25 04:32:55

m5xyq1,1 year ago I started my web dev career and today I became the web department manager 🤯,"My mind is still blown. A few years ago I felt like a loser because I started college late and didn’t really know what I wanted to do. Shortly after graduation I got hired as a web developer for a consulting firm with 400+ clients, fast forward a year of grind and today I was offered the web dev department manager position.

Now I gotta learn how to manage a team of 7. I’ve never done that but I’m beyond excited. Any tips from those with project management experience?

I just keep going over in my head how many hours I spent looking at this sub reddit hoping one day I could make it happen and now it’s real.

Edit: a lot of you seem to be wondering about the team I’ll manage. So it’ll be 3 devs, 1 designer, 2 client reps, and possibly one new addition.

I agree with many of you, this is totally a sink or swim situation but I’m down for the challenge. I know a lot of people on here are saying I’m not ready but they also don’t know that I’ve been the backbone of my department since I joined. I know literally every aspect of what we do.

If I fail I fail, if I succeed I will forever be grateful of this opportunity",2021-03-16 01:41:00

kmfmjd,8 APIs for interesting projects in 2021,"New Year coming up so I figured I'd list out some APIs to help fire up some ideas for people looking for side projects in 2021. Most resources I see list 50+ boring variations of database style APIs where you just make simple queries to display data

1. Printful - Lets you upload designs, preview items, and then order almost any type of merchandise via API. Printful handles shipping and manufacturing
2. Mux Video- Handles all the complexity of working with video, just upload the file and Mux creates multiple versions of it and pushes to a CDN. Also supports live streaming
3. Lob - Lets you send postcards, letters, checks, and more with a few lines of code
4. Twilio - Already well known for SMS, but they've expanded their product range a ton and have a bunch of new features to play around with
5. Plaid - Makes it easy to connect to users bank accounts and takes care of security and regulations
6. Google Cloud AI - Could have put a few different companies here but I like Google's AI APIs because they give you $300 in free credit, plus most people already have a Google account so sign up is easy
7. Coinbase - Free public API for real time crypto price data via websocket, also historical data. With an account you can place orders if you wanted to make a trading bot
8. Open Secrets - Provides data on pretty much any politicians in Congress, voting records, fundraising, and lobbying

In the video below I go a bit more in depth on each and also give some project idea suggestions for each API

So many times I felt like, ""I could create this cool app"" or similar, but then I open the IDE and i feel like ""WTF I'm doing. Let's put Netflix and watch some movie"". 

And when I enter and watch some Showoff Saturday post and think ""How the f did you just made your portfolio look like a f*cking ubuntu desktop in your free time"". 

I HATE IT and I hate myself for not being doing something and I feel like I'm wasting time, but if I start doing something I feel worse like I'm wasting my free time.

rcqj1s,Quitting later today,"tldr: Too much work for me. Quitting/getting fired. Going fishing with dad and daughter.

&#x200B;

I'm the guy who erased the companies website a while ago. Giving an update of sorts.

Long story short I'm getting fired/quitting later today 100%. A very very VERY big soft drink company was shopping around for a team to do a project for them. I submitted a demo landing page based on the info they gave us and it ended up winning the project. I was very proud since this is a VERY big soda company and they surely must have compared my work to several other places.

So we get this 25-page project and I'm basically told I have 20 days to finish. Pixel perfect, work across all devices, SEO %10000, on angular universal ssr (they know the only framework I know is Vue), and I'm thinking ""Dang this is a lot but if I work extra hard I can maybe meet the deadline"". Mind you I'm the lone front-end on the team.

So on my second day into this project, I get told I need to help make some revisions on a mobile app I had helped make previously. They basically wanted me to reskin the whole thing since the client hated the design (extremely common that they hate the design btw) and change a few components so I spent a day doing that. Then I get told I need to go make changes to another previous project that was submitted over a month ago and I miss another day doing that.

By this point, I was into day 4 of the project. Day 4 was also the first day we had to submit work to the client. I was obviously behind since I hadn't really had the time to advance much in the project. I work all day basically from an hour after I wake up until 2 am or so. It's obviously impossible to remain productive all those hours nor do I work as well as I normally would after 14+ hours staring at a screen, but I do my best to make sure I work my ass off. Despite being busy with other things, I was able to scrape together what the client had requested, though I'll admit the quality was not on point.

My boss was pissed since two of the menus would break on the iPhone 11 by shifting. I reminded him that I was rushed to get something submitted and apologized for not having the time to do quality checks. He tells me to fix that issue and it should all be good. So I get it fixed. It took longer than I thought it would take but got it fixed before the day ended.

By now I'm into late day 5-6, I think? I'm not sure since it's all been a caffeine-powered blur. I get called into a meeting with an outsourced back-end dev for the project I had reskinned. The back-end bro just had a few questions about how things worked. Boss tells me I must go to the meeting. I don't get asked anything the whole time and the only input I had was reminding my boss what the URL for the project was. At the end of the conversation, my boss asks the outsource bro if he has anyone that knows Angular Universal to do my project. Thankfully back-end bro said he doesn't touch that framework nor would he. I missed my daughter's first Christmas pageant to be at the meeting btw since the boss insisted I had to be there.

Today I get up after working late af getting part 2 ready for submission when my boss sends me a few messages asking me what's wrong with my work since an icon was out of place on the iMac 12 in. And that we needed to have an emergency meeting.

I'm a bit upset since I wasn't even aware that was an issue or I would have fixed it and yes bad on me for not checking every device under the sun but I'm feeling rushed/tired between all the projects/meetings. Something I didn't mention much was that the whole week my boss has been sending me messages asking what's the problem, saying things shouldn't take as long, and questioning my quality constantly.

I've freelanced before for a bit and to be honest I can do just as fine without a job or heck I can go back to my pre-dev job, work 4 hours a day, and make just as much while having the time for my family and learning.  I see no positives in staying I don't even have a contract despite being there for 4 months (highly illegal on them). They also aren't technically paying me what we agreed on since they are deducing an amount from my pay for ""medical insurance"" that they btw aren't paying. Regardless of that though they are paying fairly well for a junior position in my country. My cousin at IBM with a degree makes less. Money isn't even an issue, I just thought I'd enjoy life more by doing something more mentally stimulating. My wife is 6 months pregnant and she's going to need my help soon and I don't see myself being very useful if I'm sitting on the computer all day. My toddler needs special attention and goes to speech therapy and I hardly spend time with her. I have recruiters reach out to me 2-3 times per week. Also, my dad is in the country for a month and I'd rather go fishing with my old man. Ya f this. I'm quitting and I guess I just needed to type things out to think clearly.

I told my boss I was being overworked and that they probably needed someone else who could work faster and that no I wasn't going to the meeting I had things to do, and once I came back I'd send him a message so we could talk. The dude had wanted to fire me in a group Zoom meeting like f him I'll call him on his phone and have a one-on-one later. In reality, I'm sitting here downing two liters of coffee typing this.  


UPDATE:   
 Well, I spoke to my boss. I told him I was very upset due to not meeting their standards of quality in a timely manner but that I was working my ass off and didn't appreciate the comments. I told him they probably need someone else since there was no way I was going to meet their deadlines. Boss responded by trying to find a solution for both of us. He said he'd assign me some more simple things instead and find someone else for that project. I told him I kind of wanted to fly solo and he told me that if I was going freelance that he'd hire me on a project-to-project basis under my terms and that I would be getting better compensation that way anyways. I didn't agree instead I told him I'd think it over but if I do I guess I'm ""done"" working for them but I'll do stuff for them from time to time which isn't awful.

sizr46,Succesfully bombed my technical interview today,"EDIT: What the actual fuck, they actually called me for a second interview


This is so fucking embarassing.

for context, I have been working with React for nearly a year.

Today, a company I applied to sent me a technical coding test. I was pretty happy and started doing it, as I felt really confident.

first part was data structures and algorithms, and I basically breezed through it. all tests passed, everything was going perfectly. completed it in around 30 minutes (total time limit was 2 hours).

then comes the embarassing React part.

I just needed to get the input data from one component, pass it to the parent and then again pass it through props to another component to render it. sounds pretty simple and basic right?

I just could not fucking do it. I have no idea what the fuck happened to me, I have done that MANY times.

Basically watched the timer slowly creep down to zero as total embarassment and anger just built up in me. 

I submitted the test and smoked nearly half a pack of cigarettes while I tried to calm down.

you bet your ass I will be doing that shit everyday, until I will be able to pass around props telepathically. this interview basically headkicked my ego and confidence as a developer into oblivion, but I am planning to build  that shit up again. mark my words, I will completely annihilate the next test.",2022-02-02 21:00:27

fpxarx,Am I crossing a line here? or just being paranoid?,"My city has a public bus system and on their website, they allow a user to click on a button for a bus, and see the bus location on a map. This is somewhat difficult to use, so I made my own solution.

I dug into their website and found an API they were calling which returns some HTML for those buttons. The button elements contained data attributes which had the gps coordinates for each bus.

So I wrote my own script to call their api, do a little web scraping, and then use each set of coordinates for each bus to place markers on a google map. This way I can track every bus all in one place.

I now have the map publicly available to others in my city because I thought it was useful.

Is this something that could land me in trouble with the organization that runs the busses? All I did was take the information they have publicly available on their own website (if you dig for it) and represent it in my own way.

Feels wrong for some reason.

Edit: added disclaimer to the web page:

This application is not affiliated, associated, endorsed by, or in anyway officially connected with COMPANY. The official COMPANY website can be found at [https://company.com](https://company.com)

Edit 2: Emailed the company to ask if I could use their API for my own purposes. Honesty is the best policy.

Edit 3: Company responded to me and said they had no issues with this.

Edit 4: They warned me that the API was not permanent and could change without warning which I figured already. They then said they would keep me in the loop for when they release a more stable version. Super cooperative

Edit 5: many people have suggested putting more effort into this and using it as a portfolio piece which is what I am now doing. Shouldn't take long to add the features that were mentioned. For those of you asking for a link to my project, I will share one once I have finished the updates.

q7eeys,it's like 90% done. ehhhhh... we can fix that in production.,"Ever said this? And then have that happen?

Yeah, me too. lol

Here are 7 tips to help.

## 1/ Use Relative Units & Percentage Widths

Using em, rem, and percentages helps your CSS styles flow across screen sizes.

ex: If you need to change a breakpoint, your widths work across the board. And your font-sizes can change by simply changing the <html> element's font-size.

https://preview.redd.it/dvbw76bhp8t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d59f3d464498cc181f31c23582244f2648785401

## 2/ Content (not device width) determines breakpoints

You don't want to end up in this loop: New device, new media queries, new device, new media query...

To keep that from happening, here's what you do:

Base your breakpoints on the natural qualities of your content. As screen size increases, pick where it’d be better in a new formation.

Boom! Breakpoint.

https://preview.redd.it/zabzz68lp8t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=eca311024a8dd6f785c26040fd810d09bbd1315d

## 3/ Use min-width media queries

Using min-width ensures that mobile styles get loaded without desktop styles mixed in.

This can significantly improve the mobile experience and your site's SEO.

https://preview.redd.it/3up80klop8t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=439065358408ed512c84ebbd4c3eec0ab2812d9b

## 4/ Start by listing features, not designing layout.

If you’re building a cheap flights site don’t ask: “Should this item be on the left or right?”

Instead ask: “What will our users need?”

Write out the items: ""a datepicker, input field, search button, etc."" Then piece them together.

https://preview.redd.it/ag409wspp8t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f2fcc91b3db99ae420a30245cf477c2c4fcf21d

## 5/ Follow the thumb rule

75% of people use their thumb to operate their mobile device. Place key actions where it's easily accessible.

💚 : Easy access = Most important elements   
💛 : A small reach = Secondary elements   
🧡 : Takes effort = User always notices

https://preview.redd.it/ggtu5ulsp8t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c0865b117b4f475249d1d9889ef2fcf13e3f21d

## 6/ Sketch, Design, Code.

Sketch first, always. Notice how the sketch is rough and details are left out. It gives room for interpretation on a design tool.

But it’s also specific. It’s very clear how it works, what needs to be built, and what doesn’t need to be built.

https://preview.redd.it/dq3hskqvp8t71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c0b182612dbee8a608b45d527be8be74b811ec1

## 7/ LT Browser

The LT Browser was made specifically for testing website responsiveness.

✅  +45 screen sizes to test on  
✅  Built-in dev tools for debugging   
✅  Network throttling testing   
✅  Local testing   
✅  Google Lighthouse performance reports

I can't believe I didn't know about LT Browser until I researched all this...

kn1peg,Anyone else feel lazy when working remote?,"My team got sent home to work remote through February(indefinitely really) about 3 weeks ago.

But as a result of working remote I have become very lazy. I’m zoned out on our stand ups - just waiting to end the Zoom call from the moment I connect really. I complete my weekly issues most of the time - but occasionally something has to roll out of complexity.  

Some days (most days) I just do the bare minimum and my productivity is down. It still meets the minimum - but that’s all it meets maybe sometimes slightly more. 

This sounds childish but I just get too distracted at home and other things sound more fun than pounding away at another React CRUD app.  My house is full of stuff regarding my hobbies, I have my pets, my girlfriend works from home regularly, it’s just hard to maintain focus and really motivation. 

Some mornings I boot up my computer and sit there being fully aware that I have to get work done, but at the same moment, I feel the subconscious pull of procrastination that I know is a matter of time before it overcomes me. 

How do you successful work from home guys do it? Or is it all just a sham and it’s okay to work 3-4 hours a day.",2020-12-30 12:50:42

10pkmx0,The Hidden Purple Memorial in Your Web Browser,"Looking for info about a strange CSS color that isn't present in the [W3's Extended color keywords](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3/Color/Extended\_color\_keywords) I came across this story. It almost brought me to tears, I would've never thought a CSS color could make me feel like this.

[https://medium.com/@valgaze/the-hidden-purple-memorial-in-your-web-browser-7d84813bb416](https://medium.com/@valgaze/the-hidden-purple-memorial-in-your-web-browser-7d84813bb416)

I cite:

I recently encountered a visual bug where the style I was attempting to apply to an SVG element just wasn’t working. My first instinct when debugging a tricky styling issue is to fire up Chrome Dev Tools and attempt a sanity-test. I usually start by setting the misbehaving element to a noisy and ugly CSS color value like ‘blue’ or ‘red’ and examine any clues.

&#x200B;

To my surprise, when I typed the first two letters of “red” — just “re” — the element was filled with purple. Was “re” some type of new obscure shorthand?

&#x200B;

It turns out that Chrome Dev Tools was autcompleting “re” to a named CSS color I had never encountered before. The color was named “rebeccapurple”

&#x200B;

What’s rebeccapurple?

&#x200B;

That autocomplete behavior led to me to learn about a tiny gesture of kindness/remembrance that is baked into every major web browser and has been part of the official CSS standard since 2014.

&#x200B;

Purple was the favorite color of Rebecca Alison Meyer who passed away twelve hours into her sixth birthday from brain cancer. Rebecca was the daughter of prolific CSS standards pioneer Eric Meyer. Eric kept his online colleagues informed of the battle his daughter and family were waging through blog posts and brief updates on Twitter.

&#x200B;

After hearing the awful news, designer/author Jeffrey Zeldman decided to do something and started a Twitter hashtag campaign in her memory:

&#x200B;

It’s so easy to do, there’s no reason not to. Go to Twitter on 12 June and post the hashtag #663399Becca along with any additional words or pictures you feel moved to share. Or just share the hashtag. It will not be enough. Nothing will ever be enough. But it will be something.

&#x200B;

What started as a hashtag charity campaign evidently transformed into a much larger project. Given Eric’s prolific work on CSS, it was proposed that the hex-value #663399, a shade of purple, be aliased to “beccapurple.”

&#x200B;

When informed of the initiative, Eric had one request if the standards body were to adopt the proposal: call it “rebeccapurple” instead. Eric writes that “Rebecca informed us that she was about to be a big girl of six years old, and Becca was a baby name. Once she turned six, she wanted everyone (not just me) to call her Rebecca, not Becca.”

&#x200B;

In late June 2014 the proposal was finalized and “rebeccapurple” was now officially the color purple with a hex value of #663399.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The ability just to connect to each other and help each other — that feature, that fundamental aspect of the web helped me survive the last couple of years. And I don’t know where I’d be without the ability to share what I was experiencing and just in blogging about stuff and sharing things and having people say ‘Man, we hear you. And we’re here.’ Really helped me in profound ways, ways I don’t think I could ever express and that most of those people will never know. The web made all that possible. And I love that that capability is there.” — Eric Mayer

&#x200B;

I sure didn’t expect a silly CSS problem to reveal so much kindness.

&#x200B;

If nothing else, the next time you find yourself trying to pick a color or debug a fussy element, how about “rebeccapurple”?",2023-01-31 01:41:44

manager: hey! did you get that email I just sent you?

dev: yeah I was just looking at it-

manager: cool! do you know how long it will take you?

dev: I've not had a chance to look at it yet...

manager: OK I'll pop back later

dev (thinks): or you could just *wait for my email reply*

// you talk to your line manager and explain you've been asked to quote for work but have no spare time in schedule today; line manager tells you to let the manager know you have no time

// open IM application; tell manager you have no time today

// email notification, subject ""Automated schedule update alert""

// you read the email; the manager has swapped time out on you, so you have an hour to quote for the work

// you spend 45mins preparing a detailed quote for the work and arrive at 2 days

// writing reply to manager when...

&#x200B;

manager: hey! thought I'd check how you were getting on with that time quote

dev: oh yeah, I was actually just replying to you with the break-down now

manager: cool! can you talk me through it?

dev (thinks): or you could just *read the fucking email I've basically all but written?!*

dev: sure

manager: 2 days? ok. that's going to be tricky as design over-ran by 9 weeks, so we only have 1 day for development; do you think we can do it in a day?

dev (thinks): what fucking choice do I have

dev: eh I guess so, but it'll mean we won't have time to develop the animations they want

manager: ahhh that's FINE! hahahaha ahhhh don't worry, the client knew the animations were a ""nice to have""

&#x200B;

// time appears in your schedule for the work; 3hrs on monday, 3.5hrs on tuesday

dev (thinks): fucking great. why didn't they just give me one day on it so I can focus on one thing? \*sigh\*

&#x200B;

// monday morning, 9AM...

&#x200B;

manager: hey, how much progress have you made on the page development?

dev (thinks): are you serious? you saw me walk in to start work 10mins ago...

dev: not much yet

manager: ok cool no worries, no pressure; I'll let you concentrate!

&#x200B;

// monday morning, 10:30AM...

&#x200B;

manager: hey will we have a link ready to show the client before the call at 2pm?

dev (thinks): ...what link? what call? who promised that? when was that agreed? did I miss something?

dev: no, I'm still working on it. The page won't be done until the end of the day.

manager: oh... because the client would like to see what the page looks like before signing off tomorrow, so they can give any feedback. last time everything went wrong because the client felt they couldn't provide enough feedback.

dev:  but I told you it would take at least a day, and we're not even 1.5hrs into it...

manager: .... hmm, ok

&#x200B;

// monday morning, 10:40AM...

// email notification: calendar event invite: ""Page design catch-up re client call at 2pm""

dev (thinks): oh, ffs

&#x200B;

// monday morning, 11:15AM, stand-up catch-up

// some director has been asked to attend the meeting; they stand there sipping coffee

// having spent 5 minutes having a jovial, insider conversation with the director, the manager finally begins the meeting...

&#x200B;

manager: ok so I wanted to discuss what we're going to do about this client call at 2pm

dev: yeah I still have a lot of work to do before it's done

director: is there any way we can just show them the gallery feature?

dev (thinks): ffs, I was going to do that last as I really need to setup all the other styles first

dev: yeah I suppose so

manager: great! ok let's have that ready for the call at 2pm then.

&#x200B;

// monday afternoon, 12:30PM...

another manager: hey, how did you get on with the work on Friday, did you finish it?

dev: yeah very nearly. I've just got an hour or so left on it

another manager: ...oh, I thought you had enough time in schedule for it?

dev: yeah I did, but I lost an hour to estimate some other work for today

another manager: we need to share this with the client today though, we have a meeting at 2pm with them. Is there any way you can do that last hour of work before then?

dev (thinks): bye-bye lunch break

dev: uh yeah ok

&#x200B;

// monday afternoon, 13:30PM...

// you're just deploying the finished work for another manager, that you completed while eating your lunch

&#x200B;

manager: hey! are we all ready for 2pm?!

dev: yeah I'm just deploying this work for another manager, then I'll put the gallery component somewhere it can be viewed in the meeting

manager (looking like they could choke a squirrel): did another manager *take my time off you?!?!*

dev (thinks): the irony. it hurts.

dev: nah it's ok, I just finished it while I was eating

manager: PHEW! that's ok then! ok. let me know what the gallery preview link is when you have it

dev: ok

&#x200B;

// monday afternoon, 13:55PM...// email from dev: here's the link to show the client, please use the Chrome browser to demo it, as I've not cross-browser tested it yet

// monday afternoon, 3PM...

&#x200B;

manager: hey, how's it going?!

dev: yeah, fine

manager: great! so the client saw the gallery feature; I think they liked it but they have a few change requests and also I noticed a few bugs with it, too

dev: what bugs were there?

manager: oh nothing major, just the buttons were not aligned properly and their brand font didn't load

dev (thinks) £100 says they showed it in Edge

dev: did you show it to them in Chrome?

manager: oh I'm not sure. they wanted to look at it on their own laptops, so we just gave them the link

dev (thinks); ffs!!

dev: ah ok

manager: I'll email a list of the changes they want to see

&#x200B;

// monday afternoon, 3:15PM

// email notifcation: new page development gallery client change requests

// you open the email to read the requests; half way through...

&#x200B;

manager: hey! did you see my email about the gallery change requests?

dev: yeah

manager: are they going to be ok?

dev: they're pretty simple from a development perspective but this will mean the final product won't look the approved design, so we need to update the design to reflect the changes or notify QA before they test

manager: oh yeah sure! of course! I'll do that now

&#x200B;

~~I can't keep writing this story~~. I can't keep writing this satirical conversation - it's too painful. Plus I see a manager approaching /s. Pray for me.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm both pleased and sad this resonated with so many of you.

I joined agency work as a junior, fresh out of uni so I definitely experienced similar scenarios to the one I satired for the sake of this post.

I'm an established mid-weight dev now, on the cusp of a senior role and over the years, I've become unrecognisable from the push over I was as a junior.

I want to thank everyone who has placed me in the role of the dev in my story and encouraged me to stand up for myself. Whilst this is advice I've personally taken on myself a while back, it is excellent advice for juniors and new starters at an agency who want to avoid being used in this way.

The bright side of agency work is that I've worked with some of the best developers and smartest people out there.

Anyways thanks for the gold and thanks for reading. My love and best wishes to you all!

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Fellow devs, seriously, this is not a word-for-word account of something that actually happened to me. I know the dev in this story is a push-over; I did that deliberately for the sake of humour. Please stop with the ""ffs stand up for yourself"" messages and personal attacks; it's not me in the story, sheeesh.",2019-01-21 15:59:04

uw8vqp,"I’ve had many people asking about my sales technique and how I handle the first call. After answering this a dozen times and it worked for those developers, I wanted to share how I approach cold calling and the best way to start the call and navigate the conversation and make a sale.","EDIT: I am in the US and i primarily call small businesses. They are a very underserved market with terrible websites and terrible support. Cultural and geographic differences may vary experiences. 

EDIT: when I say I’m a stay at home dad in my initial phone call, obviously that’s not universal. That’s an example of injecting something personal about yourself so they can get a little glimpse of who you are in a short amount of time. Instantly separates me from scammers. And opens me up for conversation about our kids. You don’t need to do this. You can just say “web developer working for myself” or something to that nature. 

___________________

After years of freelancing and learning from thousands of calls, here’s by best advice. 

Just Don’t try to sound like a salesman. Don’t ask how their doing or say that “I can help you generate more leads through your website.” You will sound just like every other spam call they get.  Don’t immediately try to sell them. Introduce yourself first and offer help.  Here’s how mine goes 

“Hey, is this (business name?)”

They confirm and ask what they can do for you or whose calling and I say 

“Awesome, we’ll my name is ryan and I’m actually a stay at home dad web developer and I found you on google and poked around the site and saw it’s a pretty standard Wordpress site and I wanted to call and see if I can make you something better”

Don’t say things like “generate more leads” and stuff like that. They hear that so much from other spammers calling them that it has lost all meaning to them. You sound like them so they treat you like them and hang up. 

And don’t try to say you will make tweaks to their site either. Alot of times they hate their site. Why would they pay someone to make tweaks they can just do themselves? What can YOU do that they can’t and that’s better? 

First you need to be able to answer the question “what do you do that’s better?” This questions will inevitably come up. THIS is where you sell yourself. Not at the beginning. It almost always comes down to this so you better have your Answer and it better not be “well I can help you generate more leads from a better optimized website and grow sales….” blah blah blah who gives a shit. It’s all fluff. It’s what they expect to hear from a salesman. Don’t sell them on expectations or promises. Sell them on cold hard facts. 

When they ask me what I do that’s better, I say 

“I custom code everything like by line. No page builders. This makes my work better than page builders because they load instantly and make google happy. Last May google launched its core vitals update that heavily favored mobile performance and speed in their search rankings. That’s where I shine. Page builders have bloated code, prone to hacking, and very messy code. Right now, your site scores (I checked theirs before calling) 34/100. This is terrible and your site won’t really rank as well as it could. My sites score 98-100 and are literally as fast as they can be, there’s no wasteful code. Every like was built with purpose. Over time this makes your website more favorable with google and will eventually rank higher and outperform to your competition who are almost guaranteed to be using a page builder or cheap Wordpress theme that’s poorly built and not optimized for mobile experiences like mine are. Mine is a custom built site designed to convert traffic into customers by satisfying Google’s metrics and making the best perforating mobile site you can have. And for Every second of load time, you lose more and more customers who didn’t want to wait. When it loads instantly, we don’t lose those people. They can get to the site and convert into a sale instead of bailing after a few seconds. I also do with this a very specific formula in which i structure my website to maximize conversions. There’s a specific order you place your content in and how you write about it that funnels visitors into a sale. They’re called website conversion funnels, and I use their principles to design more effective websites. You can’t just throw whatever you want up and expect it to work. It’s all very calculated, purposeful, and deliberate. That is the difference between me and the page builders or other people who might have called you this month. I actually care about the work I put out and put thought into it. I even hire a copywriter to write all your content for you that is keyword researched and designed to be engaging, get picked up in search engines, and get people to contact you.”

When a client is educated on what page speed is and why it matters they can infer themselves that that means better ranking and more leads. 

My opening is perfect because it’s short, establishes me as a real person, and a family man like them putting myself out there to support them. They respect it. I’ve had many who after I made my pitch say “you know I normally hang up on people like you, but I like you. You’re real and I love your authenticity.”

I speak to them like a friend. Not a client or a sale. Asking “how are you today” is a waste of their time. Time is money for them and generic pleasantries like that feel forced, just get to the gist of it. You don’t have much time to keep their ear. The slightest bit of suspicion and they’ll hang up. 

I explain what I do that’s better and why it’s better rather than going straight into “generate more leads and increase sales” because they’ve heard it all before. Let them come to that conclusion themselves when you explain your work and what it does better than what they have now. And do it in a way that they can understand. 

Don’t be afraid to talk about yourself either and be Honest. Some have asked me how I found them and I tell them. I say “well I decided to call Texas today and looked for businesses on Yelp with no website or bad ones that definitely need help who also have good reviews in the last year because I don’t want to work with bad people. I hand picked everyone I call who I’d like to work with that I think I can help. And that’s how I found you, your reviews are awesome and people love the work you do. You’re someone I’d love to help and work with myself.”

Right away with that answer they see my authenticity, honesty, and process, and now it’s not me randomly calling numbers and they’re just next in my list. They were picked for a reason. They made the cut. You did your homework on their business and website and determined they can benefit from what you do. This make you seem more deliberate in your work. You only call those who you think need help and who are good owners. 

Honesty, authenticity, transparency, and talking to them like a friend and not a client makes all the difference.

Then there’s the actual product and service. They can’t edit custom coded sites. So I sell myself as a service. 

Once they’re interested, they ask, “alright we’ll what’s something like this gonna cost?” And I tell them “$0 down $150 a month, includes hosting, unlimited edits, 24/7 support, analytics, 
and lifetime updates. I do everything for you so you don’t need to worry about it ever. I’m your personal web developer in your pocket, six month minimum contracts” 

This is where I close most of my sales. They’re expecting thousands of dollars. This is a low financial risk for them. They’re hesitant to spend that kind of money ($2500+) all at once from some dude that just called them. So when they hear my $150 a month, they get interested because they’ve never been offered that before. When they ask what happens when they cancel I tell them “you keep your domain, but the design and code stay with me. You’ll have to start over with someone else. Which means you you’ll he 6 months behind where you could have been if you stayed longer with me. It takes bout 6-12months for google to properly rank your site, so after six months I think you’ll start to see some results from the site and stick around. I’m looking for people who understand websites are an investment for the long term. It’s not a turn key product. It’s some that takes time to build up and start returning on your investment. So if you don’t see yourself sticking around for too long or are not 100% on board then I might not be a good fit for you and I don’t want to waste your time and money if you aren’t 100% committed to the site and working with me”

This is another opportunity to show your integrity. You don’t want to waste their money, so you basically are telling them that if they aren’t 100% sure of their decision that they shouldn’t sign with you. That right there is you putting their needs above yours and they will recognize that. It’s not about the sale for you to them now. It’s about being the best fit for them. Now you’re flipping the narrative. It’s not about you selling them a website, it’s more than that. it’s about them wanting to work with you. It’s a partnership.  They’re tired of getting shitty sites from developers who ghost them. By selling yourself as a service and them having your personal phone number to call if they need anything is the cherry on top.  You’re there for them. And you stand by your work. THAT is what they want. It’s a major pain point for small businesses. They actually want someone to manage it for them, they didn’t know they had the option because they’ve never been offered it before. That makes them willing to spend $150 a month on you. 

And when they ask me why they should be paying me $150 a month indefinitely I tell “think about it this way, if the website is successful, how much is a new client worth?” For trades people it’s hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars. I then say “if the website is bringing in just one new customer a month, it more than pays for itself. Now imagine it brings in 10 or more. At the end of the day, the website is an asset of your business. You spend $150 a month on it, and it brings in more than $150 a month in value to the business. When you take that away, any value that my work was bringing will stop and you’ll have to start over and rebuild that value with another site and it might even be as effective and will bring in new clients but not nearly as many clients as mine was doing. Plus that $150 a month is more than just the cost of the site. It’s access to me. It’s a retainer to call me with any questions and make all your edits. It’s peace of mind, I’m here for you when you need me so you don’t have to waste your time figuring this stuff out when it could have been better spent on the business making you money instead did costing you money.”

I know not everyone can sell
A site for $150 a month. But it’s a HUGE selling point in my business. I have over 46 monthly paying clients right now. It adds up. I do less than 5-10 hours of edits a year. That’s it. It’s all true passive income. The key is to use templates. I’ve built my own website templates in html and css only that I reuse for new clients. I have like 15 template designs and I mix and match between them to create new sites too. So I can turn around a $150 a month site in a only a few hours. Not a lot of time commitment. I invest in copywriting ($200) for the home page and bank on them staying past 6 months and making pure profit every month. I’ve had clients with me for over 3 years now. Their sites score 98-100 page speed and they’re having the best years of sales on record. 

I also help optimize their google business page and tell them they need 20-30 reviews. Get them from every client, friend, or family member they can. It really helps a lot. More reviews = more visibility in the google maps search results. And your website also helps boost your profiles appearance in the results. I tell them all of this. 

But those are my secrets. That’s how start and close all my sales. Make a personal connection if you can, be real, be genuine, don’t sound like those fake servers at chain restaurants who put on a big smile and cheery tone, talk to them like a friend, and that you just wanna help. Don’t be afraid to be honest or open about yourself or personal life. Don’t just say you’ll increase sales, tell them HOW you’ll do it and why only YOU can do it and why it matters. 

Side note, I also send hand written personal Christmas cards to my clients and it’s one of those cards that has the spot for a picture of your family. Every year I take family Christmas pictures and send those cards to my clients thanking them for having faith in me, and supporting our family this year and being part of our growth as well and and referencing any personal calls we had and inside jokes and wishing them another great year for them as their family. It’s the personal touch like this that keeps people staying. You’re a person to them. Not a company. They can see your family growing every year and the fact that you took the time to write and send a personal card means a lot. No other company will do that or can do that. But you can. Because you care, and it’s that same care you put into your work and is a reflection of you and your business, your service, and product. It’s a reaffirmation of the promise you never had to make to them. You don’t have to say you’re there for them and you care, gestures like the card show more than any promise could. 

It’s not a sales technique that I use. It’s a peoples technique. I create connections with my Clients built on honesty and authenticity. I treat them like people, not like a sale. And I really do care about what I do and that shows in my work and my passion on the phone. Be comfortable in who you are and what you do. Be honest. And be yourself. 

Feel free to ask any questions. Hope this helps close a few more sales for anyone.",2022-05-23 19:58:44

jbdved,I thank my lucky stars I got into this industry before the new age interview...,"I mean, it wasn't that long ago. 2013. I was a graphic designer and decided to make the switch to web development, which I had always been interested in. Made a few crappy websites back in my high school years and was ready to redeem myself.

I decided to apply for a now very well-known company as an HTML/CSS developer.

My exact interview was as follows:

* Float the inner box to the left
* Float the inner box to the bottom right (they meant position, but I got it)
* Make the inner box turn red on hover
* Make the inner box turn orange on hover of the outer box, but still red on hover of the inner box
* Bonus: Make the inner box color fade in on hover

If you want to try it out (lol): [https://jsfiddle.net/ue1msx6a/](https://jsfiddle.net/ue1msx6a/)

Not exaggerating. That was it. Plus a couple chats with some higher ups.

I'd say I'm a pretty good senior frontend developer, but no way am I doing these 2020 interviews, having to create a snake game in one hour, or memorizing 400 leetcode questions, all to get the job and change the button to red and make the react component with a title and subtitle prop.

If I were given my own companies technical interview right now, I'd probably fail. So my sincerest condolences to anyone in a position where they have to do the interview circuit.  


EDIT:  I didn't mean to discourage anyone starting out. And other commenters are right, I think I'm projecting what I hear the bigger tech companies FAANGMULA and the like are doing with the interview process including the intense white boarding sessions. Sounds like smaller or less well-known tech companies may do practical take homes and projects. ",2020-10-15 01:11:50

kzqmhb,I'm in awe of you all...,"When I started developing web applications terms like ""minimalism"" and ""design systems"" and ""dev ops"" and ""VMs"" didn't exist in the way we think on them today.

I can't imagine coming into the dev job market now and being an effective team member - college just didn't prepare me for what's going on. In pre-covid times it would take me 6+ months just to train new hires and get them up to speed, to understand who they are and how to best communicate with them and help them leverage their knowledge as well as keep them within the coding standards of our projects. Now, I just don't know.

I need to leave dev life soon and I guess I want you to know a few things before i depart from all this. 

1. Programming isn't about the stack or the systems architecture; the arch meta will change faster than you can learn it. 

2. The job of a programmer on a team is to communicate. You will not get a better application from all-nighters, you will not 'free solo' an application. All systems are the sum total of the discussions, joint planning, and hard work. Any product you concoct alone, devoid of communication, will fail in a team-based env. (though, shared all-nighters in a team session have been some of the best moments in my career, so take this one with a pinch of salt)

3. Few tho they are, programming ""rock stars"" exist: you will see them on NPM and may even work beside them or read their blog posts, but these are outliers. (Read ""Outliers"" by Malcom Gladwell for better context than I can provide). I had the opportunity of working with an ""Outlier"" and though my understanding of programing appreciated from that time, the codebase suffered (and still suffers) from it.

4. DRY, recursive funcs, polymorphism are [typically] afterthoughts and should not be a goal while you're developing the solution.

5. Kanban's will keep your team in check. Stay on top of your tracking especially if your portion is behind; it's not a mechanism of doubt or shame or illness or anything that contributed to you being behind on work. Your honesty is tantamount: when your peers start to doubt your abilities you're already in a bigger hole than you probably are. Learn to communicate the nature of your issues with the problem at hand and I guarantee that your peers will recognize it if not in whole than in part. Speak up!

6. Tell your boss to have patience. But first, learn how to tell your boss to have patience.

5. Make a habit of reading books if not directly related to dev then tangentially related. (4 books per year was a good pace for me.)

6. TAKE TIME OFF. If you have 24 hrs time off that's three days office time. TAKE. THEM. AND. GO. AFK. It's best to plan the time and let your team know. Try to make it non-work related (but not self-destructive): camping, reading, visit family, practice hobbies, volunteering with animal shelters, study fine art, date people .... Make memories. Please, just live your life.

7. Sprint estimations for new features are, in the practical sense, a fallacy. Feature-sprints are pretty loose unless you work with a team that's one-out-of-a-thousand. Pad your dates by a factor of 2 where you can. (2 months = 4 months, etc. - also depends on your team size.)

8. If your team consistently underestimates the time needed for a patch/feature (sprints) after 1.5/1.75 yrs time consider leaving unless you (or management) can really commit to change in this regard.

9. ""Glue Work."" In the scope of dev, there are no enemies. Not your boss's boss, not your boss, not your team members, not your clients, not you. Company culture is usually your first culprit if things go wrong, and if you can't vocalize why/how then it requires one of two things: a contractor to debug your company culture OR for you to leave; there is (in my experience) no middle ground here. (Unless it's your job to fix it, at least learn how to recognize Glue Work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KClAPipnKqw)

10. If you work for a non profit, make sure your worldview is in line with the org's mission statement and that those you work with harbor your own sentiments. If not, leave.

11. Do not interview for new jobs with/on company property or during work hours. Even if you have consent to do so, just dont. Wait until lunch, wait until you're home to compose your email resp to an offer. Cover your bases legally especially in the realm of startups.

12. When looking for jobs, ask about their testing practices. If they don't really answer, obfuscate their response, or just dont have an answer, avoid them at all costs. Tests/testing are a symptom of a healthy company culture.

13. Understand what good testing means. If you have trouble with this, look at tests on github of frameworks/languages. The basic form of tests come in the following for Javascript for front/back end devs (Node.js specific?): Unit Tests, Integration Tests, End-to-end tests. Understand why they're utilized and how to leverage them for various use-cases.

14. The number of frontend Frameworks out there are N+1.

15. Read the documentation. It's your job to understand what's going on internally for your stack's framework(s) and if it takes you a few days to estimate the work-cost of utilizing a new lib reading docs is time well spent. If management doesn't understand this time after time then look for a new place to work. 

16. Buy you a whiteboard. Plan your work on it - sprints, logic, component relationships, cat drawings. (and of course it doesn't have to be a whiteboard, but the open space of a whiteboard to track my weekly meetings, logic intuitions, etc. all are best expressed for me in a large space)

17. Keep a journal if you can (or a blog/vlog/written notes if that's the way you track your thoughts). Reflecting on the way I thought about a problem or feature set has been the best way for me to recognize my growth. (e.g. In college we never really discussed the implications of ""Immutability"" though it was mentioned and I found that as I kept journaling my understandings of Immutability with the context of the problems at hand it helped to give me a portrait of how/when to utilize it for future projects more effectively.)

18. Learn/Practice vocalizing thoughts such as ""I think you're wrong, here's why..."" and ""I don't think that's right given ..."" and ""While that's part of the problem an equally (if not more) pressing issue is ..."" It's important to learn how to vocalize your misgivings, even if you're not 100% confident about them; your intuitions about a given problem will usually find similar minds on the team chip-in and fill the gaps.

19. Empathy. Empathy for your co-workers, empathy for your clients, empathy for your past-self too. Practice empathy.

20. Take time off. please. Life is so painfully short - get out there and live it.

I want you to be happy. Dev work is not just algos and number/set theory and kubernetes and the like; it's a way of thinking but that thinking is a far cry from reality sometimes. 

Be honest, work hard, advocate your truths, dont take any shit, make friends. You are not the sum of your commits.

olurvh,Somebody should tell the recruiters..,"Hey fellow devs,

I want to touch on a rather relatable subject - which is ""recruiters"", or as they call themselves ""talent aquisition specialists"" (can't say it outloud without cringing).

Sometime around this year, to keep things fresh - I've decided to look for another contract.  
To do so, I've set my linkedin status to 'Open to Work' and patiently waited for job offers to pour in - so, here are my thoughts about the whole process and some **do's** and **don'ts** that I subjectively think are better than whatever recruiters are taught in the boot(indoctrination) camps.

&#x200B;

1. **Do** tell us the salary up front - if we're to read your silly manifesto of how great your *usually* generic company is, at least get us excited about possible increase in compensation.
2. **Don't** send us a vague description of your tech stack, e.g. verbatim quote from e-mail I've received: ""The primary technologies that would be a requirement is .Net, C#, API, Cloud & Programming."".
3. **Do** give us an extensive description of the tech stack you're using, if it's API - tell us if it's REST, GraphQL, gRPC.. - these details matter!
4. **Don't** use words like ""artisan"", ""rockstar"", ""hero"", ""soldier"", ""bro"", ""gangster"", ""wizard"" etc. when refering to programmers - these make us cringe.. and you look like an absolute imbecile.
5. **Do** learn about the positions and technologies you're recruiting for - Javascript is not Java.
6. **Don't** send us job offers for different positions than our preference and experience - if my description clearly states "".NET Engineer - 5+ years; Leaning towards backend"", don't send me an offer for ""Ruby front-end developer"".
7. **Don't** ask us to ""make time"" for video calls where you'll take a great portion of our day waterboarding us with how great your company is, what big and famous clients you guys have, how innovative and groundbreaking the projects you're working on are - limit yourself to chat, e-mail or texts - and we'll get back to you when we feel like it (usually after you tell us the tech stack and salary).
8. **Don't** tell us about benefits like ""casual fridays"", ""fruit mondays"", ""pizza wednesdays"", ""pool tables"", ""ice cream fridges"", ""comfy chairs"", ""team integration events"" - these aren't benefits, these are primary school summer camp attractions.
9. **Do** tell us about benefits like regular raises, bonuses, paid holidays, paid sick leaves, refundable transportation, private insurances and healthcare.

Now that I've vented out - I'm hoping you guys can chip in.

I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who feels that way.",2021-07-17 01:35:08

auq6au,"My experience as a web developer, and how I got 2 remote jobs in less than 1 year.","Alright my fellow developers. This is a *long* one.

I see the question come up here a lot on *'How do I get a remote position'* (or similar) so I decided that now, after (finally) getting two remote jobs (one full time, one part time) I would tell you the way I did it.  This may seem like a 'duh' to a lot of people, but I also know that some people may find this helpful and perhaps offer insight.

&#x200B;

TL;DR at bottom as well as job boards I used.

&#x200B;

*I will start this off with a few things:*

**One**: This is how *I* did it. Everyone is different. This is dependent on a few things - your experience, location, stack, etc.

**Two**: It's difficult to get a remote job if you don't have experience in-house. Not **impossible**, but difficult. I will elaborate more below.

**Three**: This is a bit of an 'about my journey' story as a developer that shows how I got to my point now. IF this isn't allowed, please let me know and i'll delete it. I just want to offer help/insight to any other developers who are in the same position I was, or who want to work remote.

&#x200B;

Alright so with that out of the way, here we go.

I'm a full stack developer by definition, but my bread and butter is front-end. I've been in this field for 5-ish years now. Started off with HTML/CSS/JavaScript static sites just for local businesses, churches, schools, etc. and that's how I got my portfolio up and moving over the years.  I also did some WordPress development, too, as time went on.

In college, I realized I wanted to do more, so I took up learning more back-end stuff, as well as pushing my knowledge in front end. For what it's worth, these are my areas of 'expertise' (stuff I have used for clients, things I have been tested on, etc.): HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Angular, React, Node.js, jQuery, PHP, Ruby (Rails). Working knowledge in other things, too, but this is stuff I play with regularly and work with for current projects.

After college, I *really* wanted a work-from-home position (as most of us do). I have a great setup, I do my best work in my own 'vibe', and I had personal stuff happening at home that would make it easier on my family if I was more available to help out.

Applied to around... 200 places. All remote. Got rejected from them all. Why? I had experience in the field, a decent portfolio, recommendations from clients, an aptitude for learning, but....  **I haven't worked on a development team**, or alongside designers / other crucial professionals in the field - at least this is what they often times told me. *I hadn't had proven ability to collaborate with others or communicate well in a virtual environment.* I worked freelance or contract (local) here and there, but they were small-scale websites and almost entirely done by me, not on a team.

&#x200B;

So back to the drawing board. I still needed a job.

I ended up applying to local jobs that I could go to that were close enough to home I could still help my family out.

I got offers from several, and accepted one at a local B2B web development/design place in my home-city.

I worked full-time at said location as a developer. My current job at the time was \*very '\*corporate', and I was extremely unhappy as they hired me as a full-stack developer (originally) and told me after 90 days, I could work remote 2x a week. Okay, sounded good, maybe after a year they'd let me work fully remote, then! Right?

Wrong.

Every time I would try/ask to work remote *well after* the 90 day trial period, they gave me a difficult time. For example, I had a family emergency that required me to be at the hospital all day waiting for my family member to get out of surgery. I asked if I could work remote from the hospital that day, since I would just be sitting there for 6-8 hours, but wanted to be there for my family. It was a literal nightmare.

Anyway. My point is, I wasn't happy at my job - they promised me challenges, fun projects, conferences, full-stack projects, etc. , but I was pushed into only being a front-end developer where I became extremely bored and felt like I wasn't pushing myself at all.  I would come up with new and innovative ways to do websites/projects, they would get many of clients (and hundreds of thousands of dollars) presenting my new ideas to their clients to recruit them onto their services/upgrade their services, but I was never really acknowledged or thanked or anything; they'd just take the idea and disregard me. I wanted challenges, some feedback, some input, some insight, ANYTHING. Soon, I lost my passion for development and my hunger to push myself. I started just floating by.

&#x200B;

After 9 months at my job, I got fed up with this feeling because I love  my career and hated dreading coming into work. So I applied to \~75  remote jobs (I will list job boards and such at the end of this) over the course of a month, got emails back from 28, had interviews via the phone/video chat with all of them. 11 got back to me for a second interview / coding project.  Some of them I had to do another interview for.  Some of these jobs were the *same* companies I had applied to at the beginning of my journey.

Seven got back to me with offers.

I accepted 2 - a full time web developer role (remote; full stack) and a part time front-end developer and designer role (also remote.) I did this because I have student loans and the extra income doesn't hurt (lol), the schedules don't collide, and both jobs were okay with me working for the other one as they aren't in the same sector / or are competitors. Since I'm very comfortable with the front-end work the part-time job wanted, I knew it wouldn't cause me a bunch of stress and I could work in evenings or on weekends however many hours I wanted to.

&#x200B;

**Here's what they (the jobs that offered me a position) told me:**

1. They liked that I had experience as an in-house developer now - I worked with designers, back-end developers, DevOps, sales, marketing, SEO specialists, etc. - because it showed I can collaborate on projects to create an application/site/project with a team.
2. My portfolio was reflective of even more complex projects now, like integrating API's, for example, or making more dynamic sites (as opposed to mostly static sites originally)
3. My portfolio had national corporations and businesses in it now, not just local and small-businesses with more simple/static sites. The new sites showed that I took on more challenges. (*Note: I had permission from employers / their clients to feature some of my code/work I did on the sites with my personal portfolio, so at least they allowed me to do that :) !*)
4. My Github was booming. I was always doing little side-projects for fun, for work, etc. trying to find ways to innovate and streamline current processes at my job
5. I was honest - I told the prospective employers straight up why I wasn't happy with my current position. I told them that I wanted to be challenged more, I wanted to have more exposure to the 'full cycle' of web development, back-end, etc. and not just be placed in one part of web development.
6. I didn't pretend to know something I didn't. I know this also sounds obvious.  I mean that if I could not explain it with a coding exercise or explain it like a professor to a student, I didn't include it on my resume or as my skills. Anything I said I knew how to do, I could prove it with an exercise and/or by explaining it clearly. They told me that sometimes people will use a language a few times, and then put it on their resume, but not fully understand it or how to implement it properly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Here's what I PERSONALLY did:**

1. I made a great cover letter that allowed me to swap out certain things easily.  I was able to replace the company's name as well as skills they were looking for. I made a completely separate word document with little descriptions of my skills, how I've used them, what types of projects I did with that specific language/skill, etc. If that specific job was looking for that specific skill, I'd copy over that 'skill bio' onto the cover letter to make it more personalized.  I don't know if they all read my cover letter, but, this was something I did different than my first go-around, and I got many more responses.
2. I made my LinkedIn ""Open for Opportunities"" and replied to every recruiter saying, ""I really appreciate you reaching out, I'm always open to opportunities in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(field)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. However, right now I am currently only open to remote positions! If you have a client that is looking for a remote developer, I'd be more than happy to chat!"" - I actually got my part time job from a recruiter on LinkedIn. Which is unheard of, but hey, it worked.
3. I focused on polishing my resume to be clean, modern, and reflective of my own personal style - not just 'run of the mill.'
4. I set up alerts on the below job boards to email me whenever a job that matched my skills came up. If it did, I'd make sure my cover letter reflected those skills and didn't seem like a 'copy-and-paste' (even though it quite literally was)
5. Throughout all of this, I kept learning. I started taking Udemy classes again, putting projects on my Github as I went, showed that I had a desire and aptitude to learn new things, and made sure I could clearly explain my projects on my Github.
6. Obviously: I worked in-house for nearly a year to show I am able to work with other parts of this business, that I am a team player, and that I work smoothly with others.
7. *I practiced my verbal skills*. This was huge for me, as I have a bit of social anxiety. I worked on ways to present myself better when explaining my code, projects, bugs, etc. because over the phone/video chat, there is a bit of a barrier. I worked on slowing down my speech, thinking before I speak, not getting 'anxious' when they question me on 'why I did X instead of Z', etc. and overall just making sure every answer I had was well thought out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Here's the Job Boards / Lists I Used Primarily:**

1. [https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs](https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs)
2. [https://weworkremotely.com/](https://weworkremotely.com/)
3. [https://angel.co/](https://angel.co/)
4. Indeed\*, Craigslist, and Zip Recruiter

*\*  I got my full-time offer from Indeed; however, got callbacks/emails from these specific job boards/sites. The first link is a great starting list to find awesome companies, too, who encourage/allow remote work.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***TLDR***: I got two remote jobs after working for a B2B business as an  in-house developer for less than a year. I asked some companies why they didn't hire me before this experience, and it was because I didn't have 'collaborative experience' in the beginning or more dynamic sites in my portfolio. I revamped  my cover letter and resume, was honest about what I was looking for and why, kept my Github active with trying new things, and relentlessly applied to any web developer position that said 'remote' in it.

&#x200B;

I'm not quite comfortable posting anything too personal, however, if you have any general questions I'd be happy to answer, or if you want me to look at your resume / site / portfolio / cover letter and give you feedback based off of what's been told to me, shoot me a PM and I'd be happy to give you input.

&#x200B;

**All in all, it's hard.** I applied to a lot of places and had to prove my passion for this field, but I'm really happy I did. So if you want to work remote, you can do it. My best advice would be to **try and work in-house somewhere first** if you're having a difficult time getting a response (instead of freelance clients only), rework your cover letter, polish your resume, and read each job description to tweak your cover letter to show that you have all the skills they are looking for.

&#x200B;

THANKS! :)

&#x200B;

Edit: WOW! Thanks for all the kind comments and the GOLD!! I guess I just want to say this to any new-comers or junior developers: stop asking 'how do I start', and just DO it. Youtube. App Academy Online. The Odin Project. Udemy. Udacity. Etc. Anything you can do to just START. All the questions you have or resources you need are already out there - just start. You can do this, you got this.",2019-02-25 20:50:43
17ntjza,I have achieved the web developer dream: I'm no longer a web developer,"So, you know that joke about how some programmers who have been doing this for a while become jaded/burnt out and want nothing more than to not do be a programmer anymore... how they want to go and do something ""simple"" and hands on like be a woodworker or really anything that doesn't involve staring at a screen all day?

Well, that's what I'm doing - except instead of woodworking my obsession is with trains.

Over the last year I've worked my way through the (various and frankly, ridiculous) stages of assessment to become a trainee train driver here in the UK. With a whole bunch of luck I've finally somehow done it, and have just finished my first week. Within a year I should (if all goes well) become a qualified driver.

I'm elated that I'm getting to do my dream job... but also more than that I'm relieved that I'm never going to have to work in a stupid fucking ""sprint"" again, never have to try and interpret requirements from 5 lines written in a ticket, never try to debug a seemingly impossible issue in a completely messy code base, never have to juggle tickets and most of all never have to deal with awful project managers/product owners/stakeholders.

I was dreading every day that I had to sit down and stare at a monitor working on these problems or trying to use all these frameworks/libraries and design patterns that are apparently supposed to make our lives easier. Trying to think through programming problems was giving me an immense feeling of ""brain fog"", I had lost any and all interest I guess and let the pressure to deliver get to me.

So yes, I was burnt out basically. Maybe changing careers into something so different is a bit drastic, but I don't care at this point. I can't keep pretending to myself that I like being a programmer anymore.

Anyway, I'm sure this new job will have it's challenges (grass is always greener etc etc), but the huge difference is that for me on a personal level it feels like I'm actually going to be doing something useful and meaningful; at least when compared to creating internal company apps for mind-numbingly boring business processes that are cancelled half the time anyway.

Ok, so I am being hyperbolic here with my statements - I'm sure most web devs do actually find this career interesting and enjoyable, maybe I've just had shit luck over the years with employers and projects, but either way, I'm out.

jq5svg,How I got better at web design as a web developer,"I started coding in 2011 but I was awful at design. I got better each year by understanding the following ideas ...

**Colors are important**

I know that this may seem obvious to some of you, but I did not know where to look for colors as a developer and I struggled with bad color choices which made my designs suck.

Here are a couple of websites where you can select great colors for your website or project:

1. [https://coolors.co/](https://coolors.co/)
2. [https://brandcolors.net/](https://brandcolors.net/)

**Fonts make reading beautiful**

So when I first started I use to use basic fonts like sans and so on. But I learned that there are other options like [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) which is simple to integrate to your project has a lot of options to choose from.

**Sizes matter**

I use to choose small fonts or the same size for everything, but that's wrong. You should choose different sizes. And you can define the size by it's importance. So use different sizes.

**Icons are aesthetic**

Icons are not necessary but they do make the design more beautiful and professional. I like to use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) because it's easy to use and have the full package, and I mean there is icons for everything you can think of in terms of web design.

What else do you use to make your designs professional and beautiful?

Join the conversation with some useful resources and tools.

Hope you find this useful,  
Farris

ha9o80,Finally got my first dev job!!!!,"Hi everyone, I finally got my first web dev job after self studying for about 8 months now. I'll be working for a small marketing agency that has good starting pay with good benefits!

A little background, I do have a bachelor degree in IT with okay GPA, but I didn't put much to use on it. I was working as a help desk support for about 1.5 years and felt really lost in life since I wasn't doing anything creative. After that, I decided to take a leap of faith and quit my jobs to full time self-study.

I will admit that it wasn't easy to teach everything on your own. The first 3 months, I relied heavily on Udemy and Youtube tutorials and stuck in tutorials hell. I felt like I know all the materials, but when I start to build things on my own... I didn't know anything lol. So I took a different approach by  starting building small projects on my own and continue on building and building. Eventually, I felt like I was able to understand the concepts and able to use that knowledge on a different projects. When you build your own project, you will run into TONS of ERRORS and you will learn how to fix it by googling thingsss! I have so many self doubt about my performance and continue to push myself each day.

When I start applying for jobs in March, it was a real struggles due to covid 19, companies cutting employees, etc. I continue to keep applying to places at least 10 companies per day while continue to build projects to build in my portfolio and picking up random freelancing projects that helps me stand out a little from typical junior level.

UPDATE: To all the self-taught, bootcamp, or recent grads. Please take good care of yourself while learning and improving your career. Yes, the 100 + job applications of rejection and denial can be really discouraging and take a huge toll on you, but REMEMBER, you ONLY need ONE company to BELIEVE IN YOU.",2020-06-16 18:29:11
3f7q3q,"Been interviewing with a lot of tech startups as a frontend dev, here are the technical questions I've been asked","So I've spent the last couple of weeks interviewing with a fair amount of tech startups in London, I thought some of you might find it interesting/helpful to see some of the technical questions I was asked.

Many of the positions I interviewed for where using Angular so a bunch of the questions are geared towards that.


**Standard JS Questions:**

* Explain javascript closures
* Explain event bubbling 
* Explain event delegation
* What does apply() do
* What does bind() do
* Explain what the js map function does provide an example
* What is strict mode
* Whats the difference between a promise and a callback

**Angular JS Questions:**

* What is scope
* What is a directive
* What is the link function in the directive
* What is the digest cycle (after I mentioned it in giving another answer) 
* What is $scope.$apply
* What are the most commonly used out of the box directives
* What does transclude do on directives
* Tell me about a time you had problems with state in angular
* Have you ever had performance issues in angular and how did you tackle them
* What do you like about angular, what do you dislike about angular
* Why use a q promise as opposed to just returning $http’s promise
* What does $resource do

**General/Presentation Layer Questions:**

* What is a model in mvc
* Explain css specificity
* How do you centre something horizontally
* Explain what media queries are 
* What are the pros and cons of a single page app
* How could you improve performance of a single page app
* Whats the difference between inline-block and inline
* How would you develop a mobile site for a website that didn’t already have one
* What is jsonp 
* What is a doctype
* On a unix command line how would you run a long command you typed out already an hour ago
* What frontend tools do you normally use
* Where do you think ui’s are heading
* What motivates you, how do you learn

**JS Challenge Type Questions:**

The first few the employer stole from You Can't JavaScript Under Pressure :)

Write a function that takes an integer and returns it doubled

    function doubleInteger(i) {
        //your code here
        
    }    

Write a function that takes a number and returns true if it's even and false if not

    function isNumberEven(i) {
        // i will be an integer. Return true if it's even, and false if it isn't.
    }

Write a function that returns a file extension

    function getFileExtension(i) {
        
        // i will be a string, but it may not have a file extension.
        // return the file extension (with no period) if it has one, otherwise false
        
    }

What will be printed on the console? Why?

    (function() {
       var a = b = 5;
    })();
    console.log(b);

Define a repeatify function on the String object. The function accepts an integer that specifies how many times the string has to be repeated. The function returns the string repeated the number of times specified. 

For example:


    console.log('hello'.repeatify(3));
    //Should print hellohellohello.


What will log out here?

    function test() {
       console.log(a); 
       console.log(foo());
        
       var a = 1;
       function foo() {
          return 2;
       }
    }
    test();


What will log out here?

    var fullname = 'John Doe';
    var obj = {
       fullname: 'Colin Ihrig',
       prop: {
          fullname: 'Aurelio De Rosa',
          getFullname: function() {
             return this.fullname;
          }
       }
    };

    console.log(obj.prop.getFullname()); 
     
    var test = obj.prop.getFullname; 
     
    console.log(test()); 

Fix the previous question’s issue so that the last console.log() prints Aurelio De Rosa.

     .


The following recursive code will cause a stack overflow if the array list is too large. How can you fix this and still retain the recursive pattern?

    var list = readHugeList();
    
    var nextListItem = function() {
        var item = list.pop();
    
        if (item) {
            // process the list item...
            nextListItem();
        }
    };

What will alert out here:

    var a = 'value';
  
    (function() {
      alert(a); 
      var a = 'value2';
    })();


The following code will output ""my name is rex, Woof!"" and then ""my name is, Woof!"" one second later, fix it so prints correctly the second time
        
    var Dog = function (name) {
      this.name = name;
    };
    
    Dog.prototype.bark = function () {
      console.log('my name is '+ this.name + ', Woof!');
    }
    
    var rex = new Dog('rex');
    
    rex.bark();
    
    setTimeout(rex.bark, 1000);

The following code outputs 100, a hundred times, fix it so it outputs every number with a 100ms delay between each

    for (var i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
      setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i);
      }, 100);
    } 

The following code is outputting the array but it's filled with every number, we just want the even numbers, what's gone wrong?

    var evenNumbers = []
    
    var findEvenNumbers = function (i) {
      if (i % 2 === 0)
        console.log(i, 'is an even number, adding to array!');
        evenNumbers.push(i);
    }
    
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      findEvenNumbers(i);
    }
    
    console.log(evenNumbers);
    //outputs:
    //0 ""is an even number, adding to array!""
    //2 ""is an even number, adding to array!""
    //4 ""is an even number, adding to array!""
    //6 ""is an even number, adding to array!""
    //8 ""is an even number, adding to array!""
    //[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

The following is outputting 0, but if 4^2 = 16 and 2^2 = 4 then the result should be 12

    var square = function (number) {
      result = number * number;
      return result;
    }
    
    result = square(4);
    result2 = square(2);
    difference = result - result2;
    
    console.log(difference);

* Write a function that when passed an array of numbers it gives you the max difference between the largest and smallest number **ONLY** if the small number is in front of the large number, not behind it, so for example: [3,4,8,1] = 5, notice how the biggest difference is between 8 and 1, but because the 1 is after the 8 in the array it shouldn't count, so really the biggest gap is the 3 and the 8.

* fizzbuzz (lol)

* I was presented with a html element with a border, and asked to animate it left to right full width of browser

* I was presented with another html box and asked to centre it both horizontally and vertically


Also, all these companies had me complete ""take home"" coding tests, they ranged from being really easy (simple ajax request to an api endpoint and populate some data on the page) to pretty in depth.

Hopefully anyone looking for new positions can use these as warmups/practice, it's important to not just know the answers, but really understand how things work and in the case of the challenges, why things are working the way they are.

vi19im,15 Steps to using Open Source to Advance your Career as an Early Tenure Developer,"I didn't know much about contributing to Open Source 12 months ago, I just heard it was a great career accelerator and a lot of fun.   


So I listened to a lot of smart folks about how newcomers to coding can use Open Source to advance their careers.   


This is what I learned about how to get started.

&#x200B;

1. Pick the language you are the best at. If you're not at least an advanced beginner in a language work on tutorials until you get there.
2. Search for an Open Source project in that language - good places to look are [https://github.com/stars/bdougie/lists/open-source-friday](https://github.com/stars/bdougie/lists/open-source-friday) / or [https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations) 
3. Pick 2 or 3 projects.
4. Watch all 2-3 projects for 1-2 weeks (i.e. join their community on Discord / Slack, and subscribe to issue notifications). See how people contribute, how they talk to each other. and read all of the documentation.
5. Based on that investigation, pick the one that seems most welcoming to you. Only pick one.
6. Introduce yourself in the proper channels. Follow the introduction instructions!
7. Read all of the open issues. Pick the one that you are most likely to do well. Work on that issue.
8. Meanwhile, if you see someone else ask a question that you know the answer to based on reading ALL of the documentation, answer those questions. ""I think the answer is this \[and add link\]. Community, please redirect me if I'm wrong."" \*\*\* helping in Open Source is more than coding, and this is a great way to ease the burden on the very busy Maintainers. \*\*\*
9. When you finish the issue, follow the protocol to get a code review. Also, ask the appropriate channel for a Maintainer to double-check that you are following the correct process.
10. Repeat steps 7-9 at least 5 times, preferably 10.
11. Ask in a public channel, not privately, for an experienced Contributor or Maintainer to review your initial contributions to see what you are doing well and how you can improve.
12. Now that you've worked on 10 issues, work on 20, then 30, then 40.
13. Recommended: start reviewing others’ pull requests. Make sure you get advice from someone more experienced after your first one.
14. Recommended: along the way, keep a weekly list of what you did, and what you learned. 
15. After at least 25 hours of contribution, but preferably 50, update your resume (that's what #14 is for), and ask on a general or career channel if folks would give advice on your job search. ""I've been working on Community AA for the last BB weeks and have done XX issues, YY pull requests, ZZ code reviews. Would someone be willing to share tips on my resume and or organizations you know who might be looking for an Engineer with these skills <list yours.>”",2022-06-22 09:36:50

jmh4vo,Ever feel like the Western world glorifies entrepreneurship too much? Why is being just a professional not good enough anymore?,"I know and I've worked for some entrepreneurs, some of them are amazing people who I still draw inspiration from. 

I can say this. It's not for everyone. It takes a special combination of personality traits to be able to do that kinda work. Also, even if you have these traits in spades, it also takes some luck and a combination of other factors for it to really take off. 

I feel particularly Western media glorifies entrepreneurs to the point that if you're just a regular hardworking professional, it's not good enough anymore. It's only worth it to put in hard work if you're aiming for the stars. 

The thing is, if we all became entrepreneurs, then who is left to actually execute the vision? 

I know some people who are doing coding bootcamps and seeking to change their careers. They're doing it because software jobs pay better and are more in demand. So what? Nothing wrong with that. There's no shame in wanting to improve your financial situation and quality of life even if coding isn't exactly your passion. 

Lots of immigrants weren't tech people to begin with but learnt it because it was their best ticket in landing a well paying job in a country where they didn't know anyone and didn't speak the language that well. Shaming them for being in a field that they are not ""passionate"" about is like shaming a 18th century European farmer who came to the new world because there was a better chance he could have a big piece of land. 

Most of software engineering jobs aren't extremely difficult as there's a wide variety of roles. If you're an ordinary, hardworking person willing to put in the effort to become good at something even if its not your burning passion and you show that you do the job competently, then you deserve to be in this field and should not be branded ""a loser.""

As for me for example, I was a very average student in HS. One of those kids who scored the same range of marks on ALL subjects whether it was math or history. Just a guy with average intelligence. When it took time to apply to College, I had no idea what the hell I was gonna do. I didn't seem good at anything. I only chose CS because there was a programming class in my high school where I actually looked forward to going to class and I'd spend a few hours after school trying to make a program work. All my other courses I dreaded and I put in only the amount of work to get my B. 

I also was clueless about how lucrative software industry would become. I mean, I heard ppl make good money but when you're 17 and your hobby is listening to music and smoking weed, I didn't really think about it. As luck would have it, it did end up being lucrative and high in demand too. 

It's a profession where due to its high in demand, you don't need to be a super genius at it in order to be successful. Unlike a lot of professions in the arts where only the top 10% actually can make a living off of it. 

Judging by the standards of western society, my background would not be ""legitimate."" I should have been a coding rebel in my teenage years and already building apps and selling them. I should have quit stupid college and hitchhiked my way to silicon valley and coded with a bunch of dudes all day in a startup. Or something of that nature. 

Instead, all I did was get my CS degree and go onto be successful and promoted numerous times at professional jobs. I worked hard but it wasn't all just work. In my OT, I made sure I pursued my musical hobbies, ensured I travelled, read tons of books (not about CS), enjoyed relationships, had friends, and maintained my physical health. 

I'm a lot older now and my life is tamer. Especially due to Covid. But I'm still proud of my career. To the point that I learn and code new technologies even though I don't have to in order to keep my job. But I do it to stay current and to be better at my work.",2020-11-02 04:35:40
wmhgg2,How I wasted 10 hours fixing the most disgusting bug I have ever come across,"I usually don't do this but today I decided to share a little anecdote from my life as a web dev.

&#x200B;

I currently work on a project that is used by \~100k people. Our help desk was flooded by a specific bug and it was my task to figure out a solution. The bug can roughly be described as follows:

When executing some steps of the application repeatedly and in a very specific order then something interesting happens. The new repetition was affected by the users previous actions, although they should be completely unrelated. I.e. the user was submitting a form and then immediately started filling out a now form. Weirdly, some of the values of the previous form sometimes found a way into the new form and were hiding there.

I won't got into more details as I feel like they are completely irrelevant for this post, but the most interesting things about it were

1. I could reproduce it sometimes but not consistently, which makes it incredibly annoying to test
2. Every time I was debugging it the issue suddenly completely disappeared

The first part is always a strong indicator that I was dealing with race conditions, which are [notoriously difficult to debug](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/l470e5/can_you_share_your_experience_with_race/). However, the second part was even more annoying. Whenever I started observing what happens at any point in time, I completely changed the codes behaviour. This is what is called *Heisen Bug*, named after similar phenomena in the field of quantum physics. This not only applied to console.logs but also when running the app with a debugging tool active. This happens because ""observing"" objects in JS can alter the time when they are evaluated.

The fix in the end was a simple one liner. I had to deep copy an object on initialisation instead referencing it. Some async tasks were sometimes delaying the timing when this object was reset, so some properties were silently finding it's way into the new supposedly empty object. The main reason I'm sharing this is because I would have easily saved multiple hours of frustration had I been more aware of [this phenomenon](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4057440/is-chrome-s-javascript-console-lazy-about-evaluating-objects) that is Chrome specific. A simple `console.log({...obj})`  helped me to understand at what point the error started to happen.

Now I know that devtools warns you about it with a small icon, but it's so easy to overlook its significance and I think a surprising number of people are not aware of this at all.

&#x200B;

**Edit:** as others pointed out `console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)))` is much better than `console.log({...obj})`",2022-08-12 10:01:51

Some of you might remember :) this was the project:

## Motivation behind this project

I usually lurk in programming subreddits like webdev, reactjs, etc. to see what other devs are building or if any new JS framework is popping up. I noticed many devs were making clones of popular sites like Instagram, Trello, Spotify, etc. as part of their learning purpose, and they were sharing it with others to get feedback in terms of code quality and best practices.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nwydthxgvzs61.jpg?width=1316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ea90bf8e890963468a3eb172157b4efb74d61a7

These clones were scattered all over the communities. So, I thought why not create a single list of all these clones which people can bookmark and revisit later for whatever purpose they need it for. Honestly, I wasn't entirely sure at that time whether it would provide any good value to others or not. So, there was a way to find out that is to build it myself!

## How I built it

## 1. Scraping Reddit

I wanted to get all posts that contain the ""clone"" keyword. I initially did it with default reddit search `reddit.com/r/reactjs/search/?q=clone&source=recent&restrict_sr=1&sort=new`, (means *look for all posts in* `reactjs` *subreddit with ""clone"" keyword and sort by new*). It returned all posts, but that also included low-quality posts with 0 upvotes, questions on how to build a specific clone, etc. It would be a headache figuring out good clone projects from that dump. So, I used [redditsearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/) instead, which provides advanced Reddit filtering like return posts that have at least 10 upvotes, posted during a specific timeline, etc.

Next, I made a list of all these clones, their Github repo, demo links, tech stack. It was manual work.

Additionally, I googled ""open-source alternatives"" and found some fully-functional clones of Slack, Airtable, Bit.ly, Evernote, Google analytics, etc. I added these to the list.

So, now there are 2 kinds of projects on the list. The first ones look quite similar (UI-wise) but aren't fully-functional and the other ones which are fully-functional but UI is different (to avoid copyright issues, etc).

BTW, I named my project after Star Wars 2008 TV Series: ""The Clone Wars"" and also kept the similar color scheme of OG image.

## 2. Pretty view of table

I needed to make it look better (sticky header) which meant I needed to deploy this project somewhere else. I still needed it to be on Github so that others can collaborate easily. I decided to host it on my personal site [https://gourav.io](https://gourav.io/).

My site is built using NextJS, and I was already using markdown (mdx) to write blog posts, so it was just a matter of copy-pasting markdown file from my Github project to new page [https://gourav.io/clone-wars](https://gourav.io/clone-wars). And on top of it, I use Tailwind CSS with ""typography"" plugin which makes tables pleasing to read along with other text.

I thought of automating it to the next level i.e. if any change happens to the Github project or someone's PR gets merged, update the same on my site [https://gourav.io/clone-wars](https://gourav.io/clone-wars). But, decided not to over-engineer it as changes weren't that frequent.

## Making it Viral

I posted in 2-3 relevant subreddits and it took off 🚀

Once the project gained some popularity many developers started raising PR to add their clone projects to the list. When I started it had around \~75 clones, but now it's more than 120+ and I still get new PR every now and then.

I got to know from a friend that it was picked by *React Newsletter*. Such a serendipitous moment.

People were tweeting about *Clone Wars*. nickbulljs tweeted [a neat idea](https://twitter.com/nickbulljs/status/1373573194846765061) for devs who are looking to get hired.

>I got 150+ new followers after this tweet :o

And one person donated $5 from *BuyMeACoffee* link I put on the project. Love you stranger.

Within 30 days of launch, 40k+ people came to my personal site and viewed my project (80k+ views).

in1ig2,"[Showoff Saturday] Made a way to screen record websites as pure HTML/CSS instead of as video files. These ""videos"" are now interactive!","&#x200B;

Here's a video demo of me using Reddit: [https://capsule.click/playback/1598544517133](https://capsule.click/playback/1598544517133)

An even cooler demo here: [https://capsule.click](https://capsule.click)

(hint: try using your mouse in the demos :))

&#x200B;

What's happening here is that I recorded myself using Reddit on my computer, but I recorded it just by tracking the HTML/CSS changes in the DOM.

And now when you view the recording at that link, I'm replaying all the changes right in your browser. So all the elements are actually present, and it's not a regular video screen recording where it's compressed and you have to squint to read text in the video.

You can use your mouse, click, and scroll in the recordings. Note that javascript is disabled when you're viewing a recording so not all elements in the page will work for you. This is for safety reasons.

&#x200B;

**\*\*I think this would be useful to you if:\*\***

\- You're a developer and want to share the webpages you make with others. You can just instantly ""deploy"" your websites (even from localhost!) and share them with others at a simple link.

\- You work on a web dev or design team at a company and want to show your teammates (engineers or designers) new features you've made in a better way than a regular image screenshot. Just send a Capsule link or attach it in a commit.

\- You do web testing / QA, and you want to have better bug reporting. In Capsule recordings, you have access to the direct HTML/CSS of the webpage so you have all the info you need to reproduce bugs your users face!

&#x200B;

Let me know what you use Capsule for! It's totally free to use: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/capsule-capture-the-web/pkdkjiilohbdhmpcbnmopocdomjhogfd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/capsule-capture-the-web/pkdkjiilohbdhmpcbnmopocdomjhogfd)

Note there are still bugs on some sites since there's a whole bunch of weird things people do on the internet given how large the HTML spec is!

&#x200B;

EDIT: Wow I posted this right before going to a place without internet access for many hours. Thank you all for the great excitement! We have so many even more amazing things we're working on for you to do with Capsule.

Code is here, minus the SEO/meta items: [https://codepen.io/envsn/pen/abaGxjE](https://codepen.io/envsn/pen/abaGxjE))

I currently work as a WordPress developer at an agency, but I've found myself needing better pay and benefits. I also want to spread my wings a bit outside of the WordPress world. I've already had 2 interviews with this company, and a day after the last interview they sent me this take home test:

https://preview.redd.it/4cvq1d22t1oa1.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=336d169fb19b71ffe40879826d7442b6ec29bea0

""The team enjoyed talking through your experience.  We are asking applicants to partake in a front-end programming challenge.  It’s attached for your review.  If you cannot nail down every part of it, no problem, we just want to learn a bit more about your skills.  Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any questions.""

&#x200B;

They told me there was no time limit and that I could turn it in whenever. I've already spent about 12-15 hours on it, and all I've been able to accomplish is pulling the product data and nesting them under their respective categories. I guess the purpose of this post is to ask the more seasoned professionals if this is a feasible challenge to complete for a Junior position? Admittedly, I'm having a really hard time and I'm beginning to become a bit frustrated. :(

Thanks in advance!

**EDIT (Some Background):**

I see a lot of people scoffing at the idea of having to complete this code challenge for a Junior position, but I wanted to highlight that completion of this challenge wasn't a requirement at the outset. Additionally, the title of my current role is Lead WordPress Developer, so I imagine they're interested in learning more about how I implement some of the strategies and concepts we talked about during our interviews from a foundational level outside of WordPress. I was sent this coding challenge after having two excellent interviews, the second interview being in-person with the Director of IT, the Senior Developer on staff, the Director of Marketing, and both of the company owners. I expect that should I perform well on this test, I will very likely land the job.

If I was given this coding challenge at the outset, I very likely would've just kept it pushing and looked for another opportunity. However, after interacting with the staff and getting a taste of the company culture, I'm more than happy to give this challenge my best in the interest of employment, but also to learn more and become a more well-rounded and knowledgeable developer in general.",2023-03-16 06:55:00

He was about to lower the quote for no reason, just to capture the business.

PLEASE STOP DOING THAT.

Why?

1. It undermines your integrity. If you can lower your quote on a whim, then it means that your quote wasn't reflective of anything real to begin with--level of effort, hours involved, value added--you just made it up.
2. You will resent working on the project because in the back of your mind, you'll know you undervalued yourself for no reason.
3. This cheap client is now taking up space on your schedule for clients who may have been willing to pay your full fee. In our business where time is the only form of scarcity, opportunity cost is real!

This all assumes, of course, that your rate is viable (that is, you're actually winning projects at fees for similarly-sized projects), and that the client isn't asking you to change the requirements in order to lower the cost; that would be a legitimate reason to work with them on adjusting your fee.

(Custom) web development is not a commodity. Custom web development is not a yard sale. Stop negotiating against yourself.

a8e5qo,"I may not be a web developer, but you really can't call Google a supporter of open standards when they're basically defining the standards and forcing other browsers to use them for fear of losing Google compatibility.","Title. Web standards should be an agreed upon thing and not something that Google defines on the spot when they implement it into one of their sites. Google says (or has said, not sure they still do) they're a big proponent of web standards, but you really can't call something a standard if only one browser and one company uses it. ShadowDOM v0 (ShadowDOM is a standard, but the others implement the standardized V1, while Google is the only company to still use v0 for YouTube, with Chrome having support for it) for example. At least in my eyes, this is a sleight of hand trick to make the standards obsolete and consolidate power unto one browser. If other browsers don't implement the Google proto-standards after Google almost immediately places them onto their sites to advantage Chrome, they'll fall behind and become less popular with people who use Google services.

Now, let's think about it. What browser implemented protocols that only worked in that browser and weren't implemented elsewhere? What were the company's motives for doing so? I'll give you a minute to think. (Microsoft Internet Explorer)

Alright, so my fear is that Google is attempting the Microsoft strategy again, except that they're being MUCH more intelligent about it. Instead of completely defying the standards bodies, they're trying to BECOME the standards body by implementing standards at such a fast rate on their websites that no other browser could ever conceivably adapt to fast enough. Standards are an agreed upon thing, so if Google is the only company defining what a standard is, can we really call it a standard?


Before anyone calls me a Microsoft or Mozilla fanboy, hear me out: I like Google services, and I do think Chrome is a great browser. But I'm really becoming sick of Google doing everything in their power to silence competitors, especially Microsoft (Google seems to really hate Microsoft because they seem to be one of the only companies that can challenge their web service monopoly). They seem to embrace competition, but try to ensure that the competition has no chance of winning.

The only way we're going to avoid this monopoly is to develop for Chrome, Firefox, and other competing engines, wherever they are. Web developers, understand this. If you only develop for Chrome, you are bringing us back to the IE days. Please develop for all browsers.

I was consuming Pieter Level's [""How to Bootstrap a Business""](https://youtu.be/6reLWfFNer0) presentation.

And something stopped me.

He said,

>""To build your idea, you should learn to code yourself.  
>  
>Just open Google and write, 'How to make a website.'  
>  
>The biggest thing in coding and business is learning how to learn. Or learning how to figure things out yourself.""

# Just Do It

I'd never considered that.

Back then, I wanted to build a map of the world's best surf spots and provide cheap flight and beachfront hotel discounts to them.

So 923 days ago, I did what Pieter said.

I literally typed ""How to build a website"" into Google and began learning to code.

Here's [a recording](https://youtu.be/bbKAEmdOZtA) of me literally doing it on day 1.

Check it out.

&#x200B;

I did this for 3-4 days. But I began to feel constrained or stuck.

Like, I didn't know what to learn next.

So I asked a friend.

She was so excited about what I was doing!

She told me to learn HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and jQuery. And to do it using [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/).

&#x200B;

So that's what I did. 

I’d take a tutorial.

Then I’d code on my project for as long as I could and slowly I'd become completely stuck.

Like in [this photo](https://i.imgur.com/i7n5yRA.png) when I couldn't figure out how to show multiple surf spots without the code being un-godly long (Javascript loops!).

At that point, I'd take another tutorial.

Once I'd figure out how to keep going, I'd continue coding the project.

Rinse. Repeat.

&#x200B;

In case you want to learn to code too, here's the exact tutorials I took at Treehouse:

>[HTML Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/html-basics-2)  
[CSS Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics)  
[Bootstrap Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/bootstrap-4-basics-2)  
[Beginning Javascript Track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/beginning-javascript)  
[jQuery Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/jquery-basics-2)

&#x200B;

# Learning How to Use a Database

After getting stuck because I my code was getting crazy long

my friend told me to check out Firebase for my first database.

I Googled around and found this [Firebase tutorial playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itfjle0ji1xOZ2cjRGY_WB) by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg).

I watched each video, did the full tutorial and slowly figured out how to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) items in a database.

&#x200B;

This was completely game-changing.

I remember feeling like I could build forever at this point.

Here's a [PNG of what the project started to look like](https://i.imgur.com/1LJOhEG.png).

I still needed to Google how-to's for almost everything, but I could build and build and build.

It was so empowering.

&#x200B;

# Learning How to Use APIs

A few weeks from here, I wanted to add a map with pins to my site.

This was my first time engaging with an API.

I learned how to do this from this [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/Zxf1mnP5zcw) by Brad Traversy.

From that one tutorial, I added a map with surf spots and places to stay right next to the waves.

I was so amped on it. I remember wanting to show everyone I know.

Here. Check it out in [this GIF](https://i.imgur.com/6q7SoUw.gif)!

&#x200B;

It's worth mentioning, Brad is my favorite online teacher by far.

I’ve taken [every YouTube tutorial he has online](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA). And I've bought multiple of his [Udemy courses](https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/).

Any course Brad makes is worth its weight in gold.

&#x200B;

# Feeling Unstoppable, Then Getting Stopped

Once I figured out how to plug into APIs I felt unstoppable.

With all the knowledge above, I coded and built Surf Trip List for 9 months.

Here's [a video](https://youtu.be/rkqGGcp448I) of me explaining the end product if you want to see it.

&#x200B;

It’s a story for another time, but life changed and I gave up on Surf Trip List.

If I’m honest, I got pretty depressed at this point too.

I felt like a total failure.

I kept starting other projects, but I couldn’t finish them.

I remember wanting to build a project with the languages I knew.

But I felt constrained.

Like it'd be super hard to build a large project with only Javascript.

&#x200B;

# When Stuck, Build for Someone Else

Finally, I decided to build a project for someone else (a blog for my fiance) as a forcing function to learn React.

At this point, I had a full-time job.

So I'd learn for an hour here or an evening there.

I took the [React Docs tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) (three times lol) and read through [the docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) multiple times too.

And I took Brad’s [MERN Front to Back Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/) and all his React related courses YouTube. Here’s [the best one to start with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A).

I should have filmed some of this.

But like I said, I just needed to complete something here. I wasn't in the mind space to share the journey then.

&#x200B;

# Learning NextJS

As I went, I learned React wasn't great for SEO.

So I did some research and found Guillermo Rauch's NextJS.

NextJS is incredible.

It's a React framework for static sites.

It's server-rendered, so it's crazy fast and optimized for SEO.

I read [the docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) and took [this tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) (which is so good, btw).

&#x200B;

# Learning Tailwind CSS

At this same time, I learned about Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger's [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It’s basically Bootstrap on steroids.

It’s a CSS library that you can customize as much or little as you want.

Here’s [the tutorial](https://youtu.be/UBOj6rqRUME) I used to start.

I even bought [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) for all the pre-built components and templates, and it sped up my dev process at least 2X.

&#x200B;

# Ready to Go! Well Almost...

So I had my fiance's blog all set up (with placeholder content).

Here's [a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/qvi67Ba.png) of it.

But...

My plan was to convince her to write the blog in Markdown.

(And push it up to Github with git CLI commands. lol)

Which yeah... would never have happened.

&#x200B;

# Learning Sanityio

Luckily, my buddy Dylan Jhaveri saw this and told me about Knut Melvær's [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).

Sanity is a customizable CMS (like Wordpress) that serves up content to the DOM with the perfect amount of flexibility.

I worked through [their docs](https://www.sanity.io/docs) to understand it and used [this Next/Sanity template](https://github.com/sanity-io/example-frontend-next-js) by Shaswat Saxena to re-start my project with Sanity.

Here's [a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/W2wEjhB.png) of the Sanity Studio I set up for my fiance's site:

# React's Context API

As always, I built until I got stuck.

I hit a place where I needed a tool to help manage semi-complex interactivity on the site (in coding terms this is the ability to more easily manage state).

In Lehman terms: If you click on this button, have the code change these elements inside these four different files.

Changing the state of elements inside numerous files gets messy. So you need a state manager.

&#x200B;

After some Googling, I found [React's Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) (it's React’s version of Redux, which I had heard of before).

I took this [Brad Traversy tutorial](https://youtu.be/XuFDcZABiDQ?t=900) and learned the Context API. Start at 15.00.

Here's [a photo](https://i.imgur.com/pxlcYml.png) what I ended up with inside my code:

&#x200B;

# Ability to Build Forever

After this point, I felt like I could build and build and build again.

I’d still Google simple things (and always will), but I could flow.

And after many nights and weekends (since I have a full-time job) I finished my first React project!

My fiance's site still has placeholder content…

But check it out in [this GIF](https://i.imgur.com/Q3V10DC.gif).

I'm super stoked on how it looks and works anyways.

&#x200B;

After that, I built my most recent project — a whole other site called Remote Dev Jobs.

This is totally under construction, but it's been amazing to hack on a project again.

It looks like this so far. Here's [the GIF](https://i.imgur.com/Jl0r8DL.gif).

&#x200B;

And with all that, I feel empowered to take on projects that seemed too big previously.

&#x200B;

So to sum my journey learning to code!

7265h6,What do you guys think of an Urban Dictionary for coding terms?,"One of the most frustrating experiences I've had while learning might sound familiar to you....

---
ME: just understood what a framework is, gonna learn Rails

INTERNET: cool, but swap out PostgreSQL for MySQL

ME: Wait, how are those different from regular SQL?

INTERNET: Also, make sure to use LESS, it's a pre-processor.

ME: What's a preprocessor?

INTERNET: *you're learning Rails??* The hot thing today is Sails.js!

ME: okay...

INTERNET: start by installing homebrew, then get Node up, and then we'll dive into MVC

ME: **WHAT ARE ALL OF THESE THINGS?**

DEVELOPER FRIENDS: Node provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API

ME: **ARGHHH**

INTERNET: Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell

--- 

**IDEA**: I'm thinking of building Urban Dictionary for coding terms. There are tons of places online to find definitions - I'm thinking about creating a concise, dev-edited (*you* update and upvote the definitions, *a la* Wikipedia) glossary of common coding terms. Definitions are going to be under 200 characters, with the goal of helping beginners understand *where a term fits into* the coding ecosystem, not how it works inside-and-out. 

For example, as a beginner, you might want to know that *NPM helps you download and install packages and libraries useful for building Node apps through Terminal/CLI.* You can do your own, thorough research after that, but as a beginner, this helps answer the question of ""what the hell is this/should I learn this?"".

Thoughts?

If the ads you use BREAK my experience (like when there are so many ads on my phone’s screen I can only read two sentences of your article at a time), or if I can’t scroll down the page without “accidentally” clicking on a “partners” page… the I think the fault is on the company or organization.

k0ntfn,Some senior advice to all the upcoming webdev freelancers,"I've been in this industry for almost 10 years now and I'd like to share some of my concerns - this post is not meant to discourage anyone, but to maybe shed some light on long-term perspectives vs. the quick money-grab.
 
Recently, the number of upcoming freelancers in this sub seems to have exploded and lots of people want to get into webdev.. which I fully understand. Working in this industry is just very appealing for lots of reasons and wouldn't want to do anything else.
 
 
That being said, there's an awful lot of posts lately where freelancers ask very simple, almost shockingly basic questions. I really love to help people in here and give advice.. but in some cases, my only advice would be *you're not ready for the job.. at all*. I usually don't post this because again, I'm not here to discourage people.
 
Doing your first freelance-job without any (or just very basic) knowledge is a bad idea for various reasons:
 
- Without experience, there's no way to really estimate your hours. You might end up working double the time without any payment for it, simply because you didn't know how long it all takes and went with a fixed contract.
- Freelancers don't just code - there's a lot of customer-relation stuff involved that can be more exhausting than the actual work. Always keep that in mind (actually that's the reason I quit freelancing long ago).
- Get a lawyer or at least someone with knowledge about contract law.. I've seen this too many times, young freelancers being fucked over by shady clients.
- You might end up in legal troubles and a ruined reputation if you upload something insecure. Security is big deal, especially in e-commerce. Again, don't just focus on coding and take some time to get familiar with basic web-security (XSS, solid validation, etc.).
- Reputation is key as a freelancer - getting new clients is way easier if you get recommended by former clients! For that reason alone, I can't emphasize enough how important it is to deliver a good, solid, **professional** project. Your projects are what you (as a freelancer) are being rated on in the real world - not Udemy certificates or any of that stuff. Taking a bit more time to become better *before* your first gig might pay off later on - don't gamble your career for a quick buck.
 
That's about it.. as a final conclusion: getting into webdev as a career is not as easy as some people seem to think, but it's 100% worth the effort. Keep going and don't look at the time you spend learning as wasting potential income, but as an investment in yourself!
 
I might have missed a lot, so other experienced dev's are very welcome to add to my list of advice.
 
Edit: Pretty busy right now, but I'll get back to all of your questions later!",2020-11-25 07:47:22

I searched to register a domain name, then left it for a week then went back to buy it and it was taken. Taken the afternoon I searched for it actually. 

The thing is the name isn't even a real word. The chances that someone would know that specific, made-up word and then have a reason to register that domain... on the same fucking afternoon that I originally look it up are so incredibly small.

That word is a really good business name. No corresponding website name to my small business will hurt. But aside from that, this is a scummy move on GoDaddys part.

hyuznw,"I wanted to share some Front End practice interview questions, after interviewing and finding it nothing like Leetcode","I recently spent some time preparing for Front End interviews and found the suggested 'Software Engineer' interview prep pretty lacking: **the common advice is to spend most of your time grinding Leetcode and, for Front End interviews, get ready for countless** [trivia-style questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions)**.**

After half a dozen interviews with Bay Area companies, I personally experienced just one Leetcode-style algorithmic question (a pretty basic graph question) and zero FE trivia questions.

**My interview experience was roughly: 25% culture fit, 25% system design/experience (e.g. discussing a project I worked on and choices I made), and 50% practical Front End coding.**

This also matches my experience as an interviewer at my previous company, where we phased out both algorithmic and trivia questions (in favor of practical FE coding) after finding they were poor indicators of future success.

IMPORTANT NOTE: your experience may vary, especially with companies based in other states or countries!

I feel like there's a huge lack of practice questions suited for practical Front End interviews, so **I wanted to share a handful of my favorite Front End coding practice questions** (with slight variations) that came up for me. But first, a few tips for getting the most out of these practice questions:

* Use [codepen.io](http://codepen.io) \- I was asked to use this in nearly every interview. Get familiar with the environment: shortcuts, layouts, how to add libraries, etc
* Read the question prompt, and think about what clarifying questions you might ask in a real interview (e.g. unclear requirements, edge cases you might need to account for)
* Run through the question once with a time limit. After completing, review your approach: what went well, did you get stuck on any specific parts, what could be improved, etc
* Complete the question and think about how you could refactor it for readability, extensibility, re-usability, and performance
* Come back to the question later and try it again, but this time using a different approach. e.g. vanilla JS vs framework, React class components vs hooks

# Front End coding practice questions

## Data fetching and visualization

* **Prompt**: retrieve a list of numbers from an [endpoint](https://www.random.org/integers/?num=200&min=1&max=10&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new), then plot a histogram showing the frequency of each number in the list. The histogram should have appropriately numbered x and y axes

In the example below, the list contained 24 ones, 17 twos, 30 threes, and so on.

https://preview.redd.it/jvxwpf13i3d51.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=18a86709d03fa6885a5afddf0b7133d17524f6fe

* **Time limit**: 40 minutes
* **Hints**
   * >!There are three main parts to this question: fetching the data, manipulating the data (i.e. into a format that can be visualized as a histogram), and drawing the histogram. Start by considering at a high-level how each of these will work!<
   * >!After fetching the data, you should have an array of numbers. Think about what format you need the data to be in to make it easier to draw the chart!<
   * >!Consider using reduce to convert your list of numbers to an object of { number: frequency of that number }!<
   * >!How are you going to draw the chart? If you decide to use plain HTML with some styling, think about what the HTML structure will look like (e.g. how will you draw the axis, how will you dynamically size the bars, etc)!<
* **Possible extensions**
   * Ensure your histogram displays correctly with extremes, e.g. how does it handle very high frequencies of a single number, what about negative numbers?
   * Use different colors for each bar in the histogram
   * Add a button to refetch/regenerate the data (the endpoint will return random numbers each time)
   * On hovering over a bar in the histogram, change the color and show a label above the bar with the precise value
   * You may notice that the [random.org](http://random.org) URL takes query parameters that will change the numbers generated: include a form that will dynamically generate the URL to provide a different set of numbers (e.g. more numbers, min/max value)

&#x200B;

## Image carousel

* **Prompt**: create an image carousel that cycles through images fetched from [an endpoint](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/top/.json?t=all) (displaying a new image every 3 seconds), and allows the user to skip to the next/previous image

The example endpoint contains images within the response as follows:

    {
      data: {
        children: [
          {
            data: {
              url_overridden_by_dest: ""*.jpg""
            }
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
    }

Below is a mockup of what the UI should look like (the carousel should be horizontally centered, with at least some top margin):

https://preview.redd.it/48tq1gbbi3d51.png?width=1686&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8addd3473d64361bb1d7d2cd566ee6dd924e3f4

* **Time limit**: 60 minutes
* **Hints**
   * >!As with the previous question, start by thinking about what the main parts of this question are and how to tackle them at a high-level: fetching the data, getting the image URLs from the response, displaying an image, automatically cycling through the images, and allowing the user to go forward and back through the images!<
   * >!There are two ways you could start: stub the endpoint and fully build out the component first (e.g. create a static array of image URLs to use for testing), or fetch the data first and then build the component!<
   * >!Make sure that the data fetching and extraction of the image URLs is cleanly separated from the code that displays the interactive carousel component. Ideally, the carousel component itself should just accept an array of image URL strings!<
* **Possible extensions**
   * When the user presses next/previous, make sure that the timer resets
   * After the last image, make sure the image cycles back to the first
   * Add image selector circles. The highlighted circle should have the same index of the current image, and the user should be able to click on a circle to jump to that image

https://preview.redd.it/7w5jccmdi3d51.png?width=1026&format=png&auto=webp&s=d97550bbb7444a124ce5aaf118c0f16d90cf4469

* Allow the user to select from a (static) list of subreddits to change the cycled images
* Allow the user to see top images from the day, week, month, year, or all time by dynamically appending a query param to the URL: e.g. `https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/top/.json?t=day`  
 (or t=week, t=month, t=year, t=all)

&#x200B;

## Snake game

* **Prompt**: Create a Snake game ([example](https://playsnake.org/)) that meets the following requirements:
   * 15x15 grid
   * Snake should be controlled with cursor keys (or WASD if you prefer)
   * Snake should start with a length of 3
   * One apple at a time should appear in a random position on the grid. When collected, it should increase the score by one, increase the snake length by one, and change to another random position
   * Display a score for how many apples have been collected
   * If the snake head collides with the rest of the body, the game should end
   * If the snake head collides with the borders, the game should end

https://preview.redd.it/v2eqcztfi3d51.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bb3c82528158bde1024cd69a2c18a13e61de3eb

* **Time limit**: 60 minutes
* **Hints**
   * >!This is a pretty open-ended question with many different approaches (e.g. HTML canvas, vanilla JS with styled DIVs, framework). Think about the tradeoffs of each, and how you can decouple the model (the game state, logic, and main loop) from the view (how you take that state and render it to the screen)!<
   * >!Begin by thinking about how you will represent the game state!<
   * >!One simple way to represent the game state would be: current apple position as {x,y}, snake body as an array of positions \[{x,y},{x,y},...\], and score as a number!<
   * >!Build the features very incrementally (planning the order in which you'll tackle them), and test constantly. Start by just getting a single square moving around the grid!<
* **Possible extensions**
   * When the game is over, display a game over message with the score and allow the user to press space to restart
   * As well as the current score, display the player's high score (you could also persist this with [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
   * Before the game starts, display an intro message (e.g. game title, controls, high score) and wait for the player to press a key
   * Consider ways to increase the difficulty over time (or add selectable difficulty modes): increasing the speed of the snake, adding random obstacles
   * At this point, you have a pretty complete game: congratulations!

&#x200B;

## More questions?

I have a bunch more practice questions, but it takes a little time to rewrite them in such a way as to test the same concepts and be of similar scope, while also being different enough from the original question asked (while I didn't sign any NDAs, I have been on the other side of the interviewing fence and it's frustrating when your exact question appears on Glassdoor).

If even a few people find these practice questions helpful, I'll spend some time writing and sharing more. Also, if anyone knows of a good repository of Front End practice questions then *please* share!",2020-07-27 16:00:58

dt8tnb,My self-taught-dev experience megapost,"No TL;DR here, I'm afraid: Just a wall of text on my experience/insights and some resources that helped me at the bottom.  
So, I’ve been following this subreddit for a while and posting as well where and when I can, and I wanted to finally take the time to put down my experience as a self-taught dev in the hopes that this will be helpful for someone else.

I currently work as a Front End Dev at a midsize organization (building pieces of an online subscription service) in a major HCOL city. This is my second web dev job, and my first at a tech company with a team of other developers. I work with React and Redux. My pay is in the low six figures, which signified a huge leap for me (more than doubling any previous pay I had received). Before self-teaching, I had a B.A. in English and no technical experience. My work history is made up of retail, service, and increasingly less terrible administrative jobs. I am 33 years old.  
I started teaching myself web development approximately 3.5-4 years ago. I learned entirely on my own with no formal support structure, while working full time. I studied a bit most days, with some weekends and days off spent burning through 8 hours of tutorials, and other days (and some weeks) when I did nothing. 

I was able to transition after about 1.5 years of self-study at my then employer (a nonprofit) into a role as a Frontend Developer for a very modest bump in pay over my administrative salary. I worked there, with out-of-date tools for approximately 1 year, while continuing to self-study and introduce more up-to-date (though still not cutting edge) methods (gulp build process, version control, and eventually Vuejs for a couple self-contained in-house applications), until I landed my current job, where I have been for just over a year (and where I am performing well).

I do still complete tutorials and learn new tech outside of my working hours, but in general I’m a coder 9-5 and can do my thing otherwise (usually when I am learning something outside that time, it’s because a problem is bugging the hell out of me at work or I’m excited by the prospect of a shiny new toy). I don’t have much in the way of personal projects. I haven’t really done much Open Source at all. My personal site could use a touch up (though it was as impressive as I could make it when I was applying to my current role).  
I looked into bootcamps for a while when first starting out, but was never able to make the math work between the cost of tuition and the opportunity cost of lost wages. I do not think bootcamps are bad, necessarily, but I would caution others that, though they will accelerate your learning, they will not replace the need for self-teaching and extra work. I estimate that if I had done a bootcamp, it would likely have saved me 3-6 months of time (with a total cost of \~$12K, plus \~$23K in lost wages). So I am happy with the tradeoff I chose, but I know other folks who really benefited from bootcamps, including some of my company's recent hires (who are performing well too).  
I learned primarily through video tutorials. At the start, especially, this was very helpful. I knew so little that the advice that generally gets put out there (just build stuff!) felt overwhelming to me, and it was nice to follow along and just learn by typing after someone, the way you learn another language by just aping back words until they start to make sense. I also think that it’s beneficial to have someone guide you through code this way in that, if you choose the right teachers, you learn best practices as well. The danger is that, if you never go outside the video courses and build your own things alongside them or read actual documentation in depth, it’s a bit like only swimming in the shallow end. You can become comfortable and not challenge yourself enough to grow as quickly as you may be seeming to.  
Now, of course, I’m challenged every day at work. So I can use videos to introduce me to new tech or go over best practices and then immediately find a real-world use case for it. But for a while there, I definitely found myself following videos as the easy option. And I would urge anyone who does choose to use videos or any other on-rails tutorials that you MUST apply the stuff you learn, as you learn it, to separate projects. The part that’s most frustrating (“It worked in her project! Why won’t it work in mine?”) is the part where your brain is actually committing the knowledge to memory and learning problem-solving skills. It is only by figuring out pitfalls and problems on your own that you gain an understanding of things.  
A few other observations:  
1. The number of resources can be really overwhelming, but it really doesn’t matter a whole lot what you choose. I spent ages sifting through different tutorials, trying to find “the best” course on X technology or trying to choose between X technology and Y technology. But in the end, it’s likely that you will end up learning each technology from multiple sources (I can’t count the number of vanilla JS courses I’ve done at this point, and I have still more bookmarked--you never stop relearning the basics of programming or refining your understanding of a language), and any technology you learn will contribute to a greater overall understanding (e.g., if you learn Vue now, then realize you want to work with React or Angular later, it will be a lot easier to transition to that other technology).  
2. The other way to cut through this glut of resources that I would recommend is to try to simplify things and focus as much as you can at the start on the core technologies. HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS have always been the underpinnings of the frontend. And they’re not going away any time soon. They might change a bit, but they won't go away.  
It took me a long, long time to learn JavaScript (and ES6) properly, and before I did, I tried to learn Node and React and Redux. That was a mistake. It took me a long, long time to go back and learn CSS properly. That was an even bigger mistake. You’ll want to rush to the next thing, to check the boxes to the “employable” technologies, but the more time and energy you spend on getting the basics down, the better and easier everything will be later. And especially when you’re a new developer, no one is going to expect you to know all the technologies--they will care, though, that you’re writing clean, maintainable code that will serve as a good foundation for learning their specific stack.  
My portfolio site, in the end, that helped get me hired at my current role was pure HTML, pure CSS, and a little bit of pure JS (for a clickable carousel with transitions), but the code was as semantic, clean, and readable as I could make it.  
3. Network and highlight your communication skills. Coders tend to be pretty single-minded and a bit like the South Park underpants gnomes: Phase 1) git gud at leetcode, phase 2) uhhhh, phase 3) profit! You’re going to have to work on a team. You’re going to have to work with nontechnical stakeholders. You’re going to have to write code and document it in a way that other developers can read, maintain, and use on their own.  
I’ve seen multiple threads on this subreddit where this gets brought up, and folks get defensive and try to draw a distinction between the “technical” coders and the “soft skill” coders. In truth, the most technically skilled coders I’ve met also have strong soft skills, because they can work through problems collaboratively and learn from other coders effectively.  
The Phase 2 of the underpants model above is communicating the skills you’ve acquired in Phase 1. As part of my portfolio, I wrote up a couple short Medium articles going over the coding projects I had done. I explained why I chose to use the technologies I had used and how I balanced technical requirements with stakeholder desires. I talked through the mistakes I had made and things that I would do differently on future projects. This really helped me when it came to interviews, because it allowed employers to know that I was able to think through problems and communicate that process in a way that anyone could understand. A recruiter could read through my blog posts just as easily as a developer, even if they didn’t understand all the technologies.  
4. Seek ways to gain real experience, even if it’s not glamorous. Before I got my first web development job, I volunteered to help update sites at my existing job (where I had an admin assistant role). I did that for a long time, putting my skills to use with no extra pay. Then they finally made me a full-time web developer with just a $4k pay bump. All my tools were out of date. All the code was mouldy old spaghetti, and I had next to no support. But I got the chance to solve real business problems, to figure things out. And I got things that I could later bring up in interviews. Everyone obsesses about landing the tech job, but there are tons of non-tech companies out there that need someone to “Do the website.” If you don’t have a traditional tech background, these can be stepping stones.  


# Resources I Like

  
Finally, here’s my opinionated guide of resources for learning front end development. This is not exhaustive. This is simply my best attempt at gathering those resources I found most helpful in my own education and laying out a sensible-enough path to some level of competence in order to cut through the uncertainty and resource-sifting that caused me so much trouble. All of these resources can be replaced by other resources, if you find something you like better. If you start digging into a book or video and don’t like it (or don’t like the instructor/writer’s style)--try something else. There are far more quality resources than you will possibly be able to work through.

All of these resources are either free or low-cost (I spent about $200 total on my web dev education before landing my current job). I would not recommend buying any courses before you are ready to start them--things change fast in web development, and it’s possible that if you buy a React course now, for example, it will be out of date before you actually get to that point in your learning. Also, a lot of these resources are from Udemy. Their pricing games annoy the hell out of me, but they can be quite cheap, and a lot of the courses are quality. The real price of any Udemy course (the only price you should ever pay) is a sale price of between $10 and $20. And never worry about missing a Udemy “sale”--they have sales ALL THE TIME.

There are some high-quality resources that are more expensive, and I would give a particular shout-out to Frontend Masters. It is the best single intermediate-to-advanced resource for JS and other FE Dev topics that I’ve found. If you’re willing to spend a bit more on resources, FEM is a great place to spend it (I know I sound like a shil here, but I just really like their stuff).

Finally, you’ll notice that there are a few common things “missing” from the resources I’m giving you--technologies like Bootstrap, JQuery, MongoDB, etc. My experience is that tutorials use these as a way to skip over the difficulty of digging into the underlying technologies you should be learning. They teach you Bootstrap so that they can avoid digging deeply into CSS. They teach you JQuery so that they can avoid the difficulties of DOM manipulation with vanilla JS. And they teach you MongoDB because it’s easier than learning a more industry-prevalent database. This is not to say these technologies don’t have a place (I actually quite like them all for what they are). But, especially with the current state of web development, they are technologies that fill particular niches and should not be the only or even the primary tools in your toolbox. And because they can make the hard things easier, if they are the main tools used in your FE portfolio, it may give an interviewer pause.  


HTML, CSS, and basic JS  
1.[ HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189)  
Though a little out of date, this book is the most approachable absolutely-from-scratch resource I know of to explain HTML/CSS for a non-technical person. It’s beautiful and easily readable. His Javascript and JQuery book is also nice, but the time since publication has seen many more changes in the JS language than in HTML and CSS, so I would only recommend that one as something to glance through.

2.[ FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

Obviously, FCC covers more than just HTML and CSS--you can follow their curriculum through very advanced topics. But I found it really good as a supplement to reinforce what I had learned elsewhere, rather than as a standalone resource.

3. Jonas Schmedtmann’s [HTML/CSS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) and [Advanced CSS and SASS](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/)

CSS is really, really hard. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong (and they might be bad at CSS). And a lot of its difficulty comes from a) not fully understanding how it works and b) not writing it in a systematic way (sometimes CSS does also just do unpredictable things in different browsers, but this accounts for far fewer problems than most devs would like to admit). These courses will teach you not only the underlying reasons for CSS’s workings, but also get you used to writing your CSS in a way that is elegant, predictable, maintainable, and industry-standard. They also equip you with the tools to start creating Portfolio sites that look good, and much as we’d like to imagine that every interviewer will only judge you on your code, if you have pretty portfolio sites, your eventual applications will find an audience more easily.  
One note: Never use tutorial projects as your portfolio projects. The instructor of these courses says you can. Don’t. Build your own thing using the skills he teaches you (even better, build 3 things, doing a slightly different thing each time). This will also serve as a great chance to review the skills as/after you do the course, which you need to do if you want to retain that knowledge. If an interviewer catches on that your portfolio is just a bunch of code-along projects, they will not be impressed.

4. [FrontendMasters Bootcamp](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/)

This course is very new, so this is not actually a resource I used when I was first learning. But I have taken courses through FrontendMasters with both of these instructors and reviewed the material they cover here. I recommend it for a few reasons: 1) it’s helpful to have an overview introduction, but unlike many courses, this is strictly HTML/CSS and JS, 2) JS has changed A LOT in the last few years, so using a new course like this for an introduction to it will be helpful in giving you some of the nice new tools from the start, 3) these teachers focus not just on the languages themselves but on best practices.

5. [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) and [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/)

Not so much tutorials as comprehensive knowledge bases written exceedingly well. If you’re having trouble figuring something out, googling “ \_\_\_\_\_\_ CSS Tricks” or “\_\_\_\_\_ Smashing Magazine” is almost guaranteed to turn up an article or tutorial that walks you through the exact topic in the best way possible. This [CSS Tricks guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is such a handy reference that it may as well be a permanent tab on my browser.

JavaScript

As hard as HTML and CSS are, JavaScript is an order of magnitude harder to learn, because it is a proper programming language, and when we talk about JavaScript on the web, there are two different things we mean that are kind of tied together: 1) Programming logic and 2) DOM manipulation. Programming logic is what you do in every other programming language--loops and if/thens and all sorts of tools to take one piece of data and turn it into another. DOM manipulation is reaching into the guts of a webpage in the browser, looking for the piece you want to change, and changing it so that it changes for the user.

The above courses will have started you learning JS, but you’ll really want to focus on learning it in-depth, as it has managed to become the basis of modern frontend (and some backend) web development.

There is also a problem I run into here, which is that, as I said above, JS has changed a whole lot in the last couple of years, to the point where it almost feels like a new language since I started learning. All of these changes have been for the better (just trust me). You get a JS with all the neat new tools as standard. But it becomes hard for me to recommend many of the resources I used to learn without a big giant asterisk saying “this is a little out of date”. So, there may be better things out there than some of these, though these are very very good.

For DOM manipulation, I really recommend [Wes Bos’s Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/). It’s free and fun, and he walks you through a lot of real-world use cases for manipulating the DOM.

The Udacity course on [Javascript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989) was really helpful to me in shaping my understanding of MVC and how to build a Javascript-based application that can adapt to changing specifications.

Tony Alicea’s[ JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/) helped me start to dig into the fundamentals of the language more deeply. This is definitely a bit out of date now, but it will prep you to understand all the ‘gotchas’ of how JS breaks in weird and stupid ways.

For deep, deep learning of JS, there’s really no better resource than the [You Don’t Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) book series by Kyle Simpson. The second edition is currently in progress. If you take the time to internalize these books, you will be able to think fluidly in JS in fundamental ways.

MPJ’s Youtube channel, Fun Fun Function, is also a great resource, and his series on [Functional Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk) really helped me start to wrap my head around that way of thinking (which becomes essential once you start messing with frameworks). His videos on test-driven development were also super helpful to me.

Beyond these resources, you should be in a place to play with the JS Frameworks (like Vue, React, and Angular). I have trouble recommending resources on these beyond vague ones because they change so frequently, and what I used to learn is largely no longer valid. What I can provide is a list of names of instructors/writers/teachers who helped me in digging further into everything. If any of them have new stuff on the framework you want to work with, go for it. If you're trying to choose a framework to start with, I think Vue is delightful and the easiest to learn, but React has the highest industry saturation currently (and is also delightful once you learn it, but woof, that learning curve):

x6ur49,Friendly reminder to backup any personal files you may have on your work computer.,"Inspired by events that transpired at my office today.

Long story short, a fellow web dev was let go around 3:00pm this afternoon.

About an hour later, he comes out to pack up his stuff, and while he's in the middle of it, the VP comes by, extends his hand and sternly requests the employee return his company laptop. Ex-employee says ""I'd just like to get my personal files off first,"" to which VP replies ""There shouldn't be any personal files on here, so I'll be taking it."" Nabs the laptop and walks off.

I was about to start swinging, but turns out, legally the employer owns those files. If someone lent you a backpack, they are perfectly within their rights to rummage through it once returned to them. Technically at that point his employment was already terminated, but even if it wasn't, at any point the employer is within their rights to do anything to the files stored on computers issued to employees.

Sounds like a no-brainer, but I find it easy to forget sometimes. So, just a reminder to backup any personal things you've got on your work computer.",2022-09-05 23:31:14

So after googling without success, I thought I'd ask the all-mighty ChatGPT about this, here's how it went:

a901mn,Just got my first full time job offer this weekend as a self taught developer!,"Beyond excited and honestly looking at the offer email feels surreal! I've completely self taught myself, and it's probably the most dedicated I've been to anything. It's been a little over one year since my first commit to Github, and I can finally say all that time has paid off. Starting the first week of Jan, I am a full time front-end web developer. 

I spent a little over the past month applying for jobs, eventually interviewing at two different places within the past two weeks. Imposter syndrome is no joke. I was so nervous to start applying and interviewing, but honestly I just had to do it and kid you not, I got an offer after my second interview for the salary I asked for. 

A huge thank you to this sub! I quietly frequent this sub daily and have since I started web development. 

Edit: A lot of people are asking how I self taught myself, and while that whole situation could take up a novel, here's the general idea of what I did.

I spent the first 3-4 months really learning CSS. I learned Flexbox, some CSS Grid, responsive design, and SASS. I picked up Bootstrap as well because that's what I saw everyone buzzing about. HTML literally took like two weeks to get the gist of it, so the deeper into CSS I got, the more I spent with HTML, so it kinda worked out like that. This entire time I was just taking websites designs off of Dribbble and Pinterest and building them as non functioning skeletons. Doing that also helped quite a bit with my sense for web design. 

After I really learned CSS, I hoped into Javascript and spent the remainder of my time (8-9 months) working with it. I focused on the basics starting out, working with the DOM, using JQuery etc. Moved on to React, Node, and learning ES6. This is when my JS knowledge really took off. Currently, I'm entirely comfortable working with arrays and objects, ES6 obj and array prototypes, asynchronous JS, can explain to you what closures are, can work with JSON, fetch data from API's, know difference between let and const, scope, etc. I can work with Node and most of projects use it. It really really helps to be comfortable with JS. It makes all the other stuff like CSS and HTML seem like a walk in the park in comparison. So build projects with it. If all you ever use it for is to add onClick handlers or classes to DOM elements, then you won't get too advanced with it. KNOWING JAVASCRIPT AS A WEB DEV IS SO DAMN IMPORTANT. My goal is to become a full-stack javascript dev, so I care about it and I'm biased. But I still think it's the most important programming language a web dev should without a doubt be comfortable with. 

Also learn Git. Seriously use it for any project your building.   Don't just put it off. Use it and learn it from the command line before you download a GUI for it. 

I started with a Udemy course, think it was actually the Colt Steele course. I've also followed a couple Wed Bos courses. But I hate following online lessons like that, so I just sorta got the gist of what I should learn and then just started making things. Personally I learn by doing so it's whatever works best for you. Learning by immersion is my tactic! I only ever followed a tutorial to learn something specific for a personal project. Don't add these tutorial projects to your portfolio! You should only use tutorial projects to learn. The biggest key to my success was learning by building stuff! I've got tons of projects on my computer, some done and some half complete. Some look like spaghetti and others I'm proud of. I've freelanced and built a couple Wordpress websites for money in this time. I've also written a couple tutorial articles on Medium as well. If you can write a tutorial about something in terms that a person with little prior knowledge can grasp, you're on the right track. 

My portfolio is built with React, Gatsby and GraphQL. It has a blog system set up. I also have an almost ready to deploy full-stack project built with the MERN stack. It's a fleet management application that allows a user to add customers, their customer's fleet vehicles, notes on those vehicles and service intervals on each vehicle for continued notifications. This app was built with my parents company in mind. I also have quite a few React apps in my GitHub. I play golf competitively so I built a golf stat tracking application, I also built a 30-day Bitcoin price tracker and price chart because I've been into crypto for a few years. The gist of this is that I build things that suit my interests. And as mentioned, I've freelanced a couple brochure style Wordpress websites as well as doing random things on Upwork. 

When they tell you that learning comes from doing, it is no lie. If you branch out from tutorial projects and make up something on your own, the amount of knowledge you obtain from that is worth way more than any tutorial. If you don't have a full tutorial to hold your hand, you are forced to Google and read. That's the key I think. 

I spent on average 3-4 hours almost every weekday working on Web Dev. Some weekends I would work a few hours each day as well, but I'm not the type of person to kill myself with work, so I made sure to take time away from development to focus on my hobbies. Most of my time was spent reading or watching tutorials to learn how to do something specific that would move along a personal project, reading, reading, writing some code, breaking stuff, reading. 

Lastly, it's imperative you adopt a mindset that allows for you to realize that no matter what,  you will encounter problems. Problems with code, problems with understanding a concept, etc. If you keep at it, overtime you'll realize that you can overcome most any problem thrown your way with persistence and dedication. You can't easily give up. If you give up out of frustration when you encounter a problem or something you can't do yet, then you won't be cut out for this. I've spent literal weeks being stuck on issues, but I've always pushed on and got it sorted. Every time that I figured something out, it added a percentage of confidence to myself. Confidence that assures me that no matter what, I will be able to figure it out. And that's better than acting like you know everything.   You won't know everything, it's almost a guarantee. But having confidence in your problem solving skills makes this less scary. ",2018-12-24 00:35:42

1246zke,"Just realized I've been underpaid at my job, feeling embarrassed, but working on applying for some other jobs!"," I am a web developer in the US and I've been working for a very small startup company now at the 1 year and 6 months of work mark.

Very early in hiring, my boss told me he could hire someone much more qualified from \[much more prestigious university than mine\] with an actual CS degree and he didn't because he could not afford their requests of pay. Because I was pretty early in my career and probably very desperate to hold onto any job I sort of internalized that as ""Oh, I deserve a fraction of the pay because of my background."" (State school and non-CS major).

I ended up writing down a list of all of the things I've been doing for the company:

Solo built multiple websites for the general public and the government (require special services etc)

I am the Graphic designer, designated UI/UX developer, and Web Designer.

Built backend AWS and GCP for all of the projects.

Learned to program in python so that I can work on machine learning models.

. . . and I am only getting paid 30k a year.

I know its a startup company, but apparently they're getting 80-200k contracts, and now they might be getting a 1M contract (maybe my pay will increase? hahah likely not).

I feel embarrassed, if I'm going to be honest. I've been struggling all year paying my bills because I thought I couldn't get a better job. Out of the blue I decided to start connecting with other women in tech and every single one of them have been shocked when I tell them my pay. They've all been so kind and are pushing me to find another job. Honestly I am so grateful to them.

I am working on my website portfolio at the moment and will be hopefully applying for some jobs in the near future. I just wanted to get this off my chest!",2023-03-28 00:43:30

hnhhko,Worst Interview I've Experienced,"I'm a self-taught dev looking for my first job and I had an interview yesterday and it was... odd.

At first they wanted to do an in person interview, I live in a mid sized city that is seeing a spike in Covid cases right now and so I was not comfortable. So the interview was switched to zoom.  It was a full stack dev and the job description had no specified stack, just a general description of the job.

I get on the zoom call and he starts the interview by saying ""Tell me about yourself"". So I start talking about myself then talk about some of the projects I've worked on. He seems a bit confused and starts asking me about c# and talks about the stack they use, none of which I have ever even heard of.  It becomes clear this guy didn't even glance at my resume. I'm a JavaScript dev with a focus on a Vue, Laravel stack. No where in my cover letter or resume do I even mention c#.  The interview goes on awkwardly for a few minutes as I tell him about the stuff I have done and he keeps asking if it's related to whatever stack they work on. Finally I end up giving him the link to my portfolio, that is on my resume and in my cover letter and the interview mercifully ends. My resume is one page, this guy did literally zero prep, and honestly wasted both of our time.

I looked up the company beforehand. Looks like a small place 8 to 10 devs, all dudes in their late 50s early 60s.  Seemed like they had a very narrow view of what Full Stack meant.

Update: Thanks for all this replies. This has been a really good learning experience  and have gotten a lot of good advice. I've taken fro this experience that I need to learn to sell myself. I've taken the time to learn web development, now I need to take the time to learn to sell myself. Thank you all this is a really good community!",2020-07-08 13:56:15

118g0y7,I've become totally disillusioned with unit tests,"I've been working at a large tech company for over 4 years. While that's not the longest career, it's been long enough for me to write and maintain my fair share of unit tests. In fact, I used to be *the* unit test guy. I drank the kool-aid about how important they were; how they speed up developer output; how TDD is a powerful tool... I even won an award once for my contributions to the monolith's unit tests.

&#x200B;

However, recently I see them as things that do nothing but detract value. The only time the tests ever break is when we develop a new feature, and the tests need to be updated to reflect it. It's nothing more than ""new code broke tests, update tests so that the new code passes"". The new code is usually good. We rarely ever revert, and when we do, it's from problems that units tests couldn't have captured. (I do not overlook the potential value that more robust integration testing could provide for us.)

&#x200B;

I know this is a controversial opinion. I know there will be a lot of people wanting to downvote. I know there will be a lot of people saying ""it sounds like your team/company doesn't know how to write unit tests that are actually valuable than a waste of time."" I know that theoretically they're supposed to protect my projects from bad code.

&#x200B;

But I've been shifted around to many teams in my time (the co. constantly re-orgs). I've worked with many other senior developers and engineering managers. Never has it been proven to me that unit tests help developer velocity. I spend a lot of time updating tests to make them work with new code. If unit tests ever fail, it's because I'm simply working on a new feature. *Never, ever, in my career has a failing unit test helped me understand that my new code is probably bad and that I shouldn't do it.* I think that last point really hits the problem on the head. Unit tests are supposed to be guard rails against new, bad code going out. But they only ever guard against new, good code going out, so to speak.

&#x200B;

So that's my vent. Wondering if anyone else feels kind of like I do, even if it's a shameful thing to admit. Fully expecting most people here to disagree, and love the value that unit tests bring. I just don't get why I'm not feeling that value. Maybe my whole team does suck and needs to write better tests. Seems unlikely considering I've worked with many talented people, but could be.

12wrmxy,"If you're a junior to mid-level fullstack engineer and have an upcoming frontend technical interview, here's some things to freshen up on","I've been leading a frontend technical interview for a full-stack SE2 position at my company and I've noticed all the backend-leaning candidates are falling into the same knowledge gaps with JavaScript.

For the record, our company happens to not even test knowledge of libraries like React, CSS, a11y, or even much to do with the browser, it just requires *some* JavaScript proficiency.

The question is a classic fetch an API (in our case, two APIs) and do some tree traversal with the resulting data. If the recruiter just mentions ""brush up on JavaScript"" your technical exercise will likely be something similar. So here's what to freshen up on:

&#x200B;

**Promises**

Specifically, handling promises. When you fetch data from an API, the result will be a promise, so you'll need to know how to handle it. The 5 candidates we've had so far have not been able to fetch an endpoint and then capsulate the resulting data in their desired scope without help.

If we're fetching from the browser we'll expect you to use the browser Fetch API (knowing libraries like Axios is a bonus). Fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. There's two ways to handle a promise: the `.then` method or with async/await. Let's start with `.then`.

    const DATA_URL = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1';
    
    fetch(DATA_URL).then(response => response.json()).then(data => {
      console.log(data)
    })

A couple things to note: fetch returns a promise as mentioned, so we handle that with the first `.then` which gives us back a large response object in the callback function. However, we need to convert that response to JSON in order to use on the frontend, and `.json()` ALSO returns a promise. We handle that second promise by chaining another `.then`. This now logs the data.

If we need to do something with this data, maybe massage the data, we either need to do it within the function body of the last `.then` method OR assign the data to a variable we define in our desired scope.

Since this `.then` method is a bit verbose and restrictive, let's try async/await to handle the promises instead.

    const DATA_URL = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1';
    
    async function handleData() {
      const response = await fetch(DATA_URL)
      const data = await response.json()
      console.log(data);
    }
    
    handleData()

When using async/await, we can assign the resulting data to a variable and use it within the same function scope. await is essentially delaying the execution of any of the following lines within the async function until the promise resolves with the data (we won't worry about error handling for now). Feels much better and gets you brownie points for using this relatively newer method to handle promises in JavaScript.

&#x200B;

**Functions**

Functions aren't all that difficult in JavaScript, but they can be confusing because there's different ways to define a function *and* return the value from it.

    // 1. Function Declaration
    function add(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    
    add(2, 3)
    
    // 2. Function Expression (Arrow Function Expression)
    const subtract = (a, b) => {
      return a - b;
    }
    
    subtract(4, 2)
    
    // 3. Arrow Function Expression (with implicit return)
    const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
    
    multiply(2, 3)

1. Function declaration using the `function` keyword and takes an optional return statement
2. Function expression is when we assign an unnamed or anonymous function to a named variable. Note we use the ""fat arrow"" to open the function body and we're not using the `function` keyword.
3. Here we use an implicit return. We can handle the expression in a single readable line, so we just return it without opening up the function body and explicitly returning the expression. Concise, right? These are great for using in callbacks like we did in the callback of the `.then` methods above. They're also convenient for array method callbacks:

&#x200B;

    const result = [1, 2, 3].map(num => num * 2);
    
    instead of:
    
    const result = [1,2,3].map(num => { return num * 2; })
    
    it's even worse with a function declaration:
    
    const result = [1,2,3].map(function doubleNums(num) { return num * 2; })

Also note, JavaScript doesn't support function overloading, so make sure your functions use different names (and are named properly.)

Definitely more to cover, but I'd start here!

P.S. I'd also freshen up on how to use for loops in JavaScript and also Array methods like `.map`, `.forEach`, `.filter`, and `.sort`. Note which array methods allow returning something (not `.forEach`), and if they modify the array in place or return a new modified array.",2023-04-23 21:53:45

1afn40j,Dev shop delivered an insecure app — $12K in the hole and not sure what to do now,"We hired a dev shop to build our MVP, this amounted to a total of $12000. A couple weeks ago, the developers finished the final revision and say it is ready to launch to production. Development took approximately 20 weeks.

I sent the link to my circle, and one friend who got ahold of it happens to be a technical person and expressed his concerns regarding security. I'm not a technical person and I had no understanding of the severity of the situation until he explained to me in simple terms what he found.

It turns out that the backend doesn't check for proper permissions at all, and returns information that a user shouldn't have. He was able to get near-total control with little effort, according to him.

Things such as:

* Changing other user's passwords
* Being able to see the admin's user ID from our CMS
* Able to see all the users our live-support is currently chatting with
* Able to just get a list of all our users, including their personal data such as email address, gender, and more personal identifiable information
* Able to trick the site into displaying info as if you're logged in as someone else
* Able to enter another user's live-support chat, read their messages and even chat on their behalf
* User's privacy settings are not respected; their profile can still be viewed if they've set it to private

He says there probably are much more vulnerabilities that he hasn't found yet, and a high potential for XSS or SQL injection. He also mentioned that the web framework used to build the site hasn't been updated since 2021 and is no longer a supported version. Finally, he said it wasn't hard at all to find these vulnerabilities, they were in plain sight in the browser's dev tools.

I've talked with the dev shop and they said they'll rectify the situation, but how they could've allowed this to happen in the first place is unbeknownst to me.

I also don't know the validity of the solutions they've proposed: encrypting the API request/response bodies, building a separate API for our search functionality, and requiring an authorization key in the API and chat server's requests. According to my friend the first 2 don't make sense.

There's more to it that I haven't written, but this is the most important.

Any words of advice?",2024-01-31 17:21:30
16ni6wm,Oh Good God Microsoft Teams is terrible,"I have heard people complain about Teams before and I thought that they meant in terms of using it for video calls and I couldn't understand the fuss.

But JFC I am using it right now in a company and it is the worst programmed crock I have come across since a discontinued Adobe product.

The web app is better than the Windows app but it is still dire.

I cannot download more than one item at a time. It allows you to select multiple items for download but simply doesn't respond when there is more than one item. Even switched over to Edge to see if it would help.

Everything is so slow. Opening documents or powerpoints prompts a resize to my current resolution resulting in a pause of about half a second every time.

Refreshing a folder brings you back to root.

You are not allowed view group discussion and navigate files at the same time. 

There is no way to refresh the desktop app (quitting and signing back in solves this).

Like all terrible software it doesn't feel like links should be anchors but instead should be tortuous javascript. Open in a new tab? Who'd want that!? The web app allows you to open in new tab but forces you into the new tab, making opening multiple items at once a pain.

Navigation is slow and clunky. It keeps wanting me to show ""recent documents"" instead of a directory structure, which means I see 5 separate items called workinprogress.docx - oh yes, that version control is just about as good as it sounds.

Yes, this rant is me putting off going back to that pit.",2023-09-20 10:52:07

18xvk0u,My imposter syndrome was never more clear than it was today,"Long story short, I had a meeting booked with my manager for the end of year performance review and feedback (we have two a year but on my last team we were so swamped I actually didn't have one over the past year and a half). I was nervous going into this one because I was put onto a new team working on a pretty high priority app as the sole Front End Engineer on a team was very senior and experienced Full Stack Engineers. I honestly thought I was going to have an if not bad, then mediocre review.   


However, the review gave me an 'Exceeds Expectations' and some take-aways were that they were expecting me to become productive within a few weeks of joining and I was productive in the first day, and then delivered many times more work than they would have expected. Another key take-away is that it is hard for the team to give me code reviews because my front end expertise is apparently at a higher level than the (honestly rather wizard-level) full stack engineers who do not specialize on the front end.   


I was very concerned about this review because running this particular app and developing locally comes with a host of problems and setbacks, almost daily, and in my mind even though the cause of the errors was not my fault, I should just be better at working through them (even though I am not a back end dev where the issues arose from).

This is the third time I get fired due to outsourcing, but it's not even that part that makes me angry.

What makes me angry is how much good frontend and UX work gets ignored by businesses. For the past 2 years I have been the middleman between customers and production teams, and in almost every case the customers have been expressing frustration with how the interfaces are set up.

The backend team does a good job at creating widgets and functions that work well, but they are covered in a frontend code that was made with zero user interaction in mind.
In the last company I worked for, the backend team was often given the task of also building the frontend. As my boss said ""It only takes 10 minutes anyway"".
One of the results of this was that every error message on the page just contained a stack trace, which was completely useless to the customer who just wanted to know ""What broke and who should I contact?""

I have fought so hard to have Design Thinking and User Heuristics become part of our project planning, but it always got shot down by the SCRUM master who only focused on how quick we could release a feature.

Managers seem to think that a basic WordPress or Wix website is top-quality, and it's one of the reasons why my job keeps getting outsourced, because ""you just need to slap on s button anyway"".

I have been trying to learn figma, create SVGs, create illustrations, and I hate it. I don't like designing images, I don't like creating SVG. I haven't written a single line of code in a week because of this, it sucks.

I have to power through I guess.

18f1a2g,8 Reasons Why WhatsApp Was Able to Support 50 Billion Messages a Day With Only 32 Engineers,N/A,2023-12-10 11:06:34
18dtwiv,Prismic.io is increasing our price by *1900%* over Christmas,"We've been using Prismic as our headless CMS for over three years now, and it has been mostly acceptable. We barely move any data (static page builds), and $9/mo has felt *high* for what they offer, but not too bad. We're a small operation and migrating away hasn't been high on the priorities list.

Today, we received an email informing us that Prismic wants **20x** more money from us, **by the beginning of next year**. 

In their own words:
> we are introducing our first pricing adjustments in seven years to provide you with greater access to emerging opportunities.
> 
> ...
> 
> The following repository(ies) have been growing, and your usage exceeds the new limits of your plan
> 
> ...
> 
> Prismic repository: <url>
> 
> Reason to upgrade: Exceeded the limit of Locales, in your plan
> 
> New plan and new price: Medium **$180 Per Month**
> 
> ...
> 
> Without any action on your end, your plan will be automatically upgraded on January 8th. Our commitment to making Prismic a product for everyone remains unchanged. Prismic continues to offer **the most competitive pricing in the headless CMS industry**.

(The rest of the email is mostly hyping ""AI"" features, and telling you how great some un-released features for 2024 are going to be)

Our usage has been pretty flat and low for a long time now. We do, however, use *three* locales, being a Norwegian language school that deals with a lot of immigrants and refugees. This apparently means that we now have until just after Christmas and New Year's to have our entire setup migrated to a new CMS.

I am extremely disappointed in this behaviour, especially with not even a month's notice **over the holidays**. I don't expect companies to be caring, but this cynical move to catch people off guard and maybe get a month or two of extra profit off your customers before you toss them aside is just offensive. It is also bordering on insulting that they call themselves the most competitively priced headless CMS in the industry, and are committed to making ""a product for everyone"".

We are three people, one of which is on the technical side. Instead of Christmas holidays and getting prep-work done for things starting next year, I am apparently now spending the holiday season migrating our entire website and build pipeline, and losing history etc. in the process.

Maybe I was naive here, but I am just posting this as a warning to other solo devs, smaller organisations, and freelancers:

## Prismic will happily ruin your holiday and throw your multi-year customer relationship in the trash on a greedy whim. 

They could have notified us earlier/with a longer window, or done a myriad of other things to make this infinitely nicer to deal with. They apparently chose not to, or they care so little about their small/medium users that it didn't even matter to them.

If anyone has suggestions for a serious and reliable headless CMS provider, I'd love to hear them - in the meantime I am going to go for a walk and hoping the frustration and irritation of this afternoon turns into some form of spiteful motivation. At least I can strike them from the shortlist of possible options for the massive migration being planned at my day-job...",2023-12-08 19:00:48

16em18q,"Can someone explain the trend of login screens displaying only the username, then the password separately?","It drives me insane. Even with logins that are not offering OAuth with FB, Twitter etc, I’m noticing sites display only the username field, then the password after you enter the username. 

I use Bitwarden so it means clicking twice to autofill. Why on earth is this a UX direction? What beneficial purpose does it serve??

EDIT: Based on the responses below, it's been explained that sites are doing this so that they can determine if you're a special kind of user that needs different authentication (like a corporate SSO, for example) based on your username. So bonus questions: why do it this way, even if that's the case? Clearly in the past we didn't do this. Assuming your public-facing website serves the average user (and it's not 99% corporate logins), why disrupt the UX flow and fuck up autofill like this? Is it really worth it?

EDIT 2: Again thank you all for all the in depth explanations. All the technical reasons make sense. I may not agree with the UX solution that arises from
them (that is, piecemealing out the login fields, which leads to the password manager issues I describe above, as well as a user experience that breaks from the norm), but hopefully as we move into a “passwordless” experience things will improve.",2023-09-10 00:41:40

11z9xim,Feel like I've wasted 3 years,"I've been studying web development for over 3 years now and just don't think I am ever going to get a job. I started studying the basics where I struggled but once I got the hang of it, I worked through projects of my own and a couple of ""Build X Number of Projects"" courses i started feeling a bit confident. So I moved onto React because I was told that's where the jobs are and it's the most popular. I starting building everything in React so that I would get the hang of React. After I was feeling good about React I worked through most of a full stack course but dropped it because I really felt like i should focus on the front end.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to actually applying for jobs. Applying for jobs while working a mostly full time job is HARROWING. Being given a take home project for a landing page that I have to squeeze in on my days off takes me hours because, turns out, guess I am bad at all of this and I am attempting to make everything from scratch. I've since learned that keeping a collection of components that I can drop in and tweak saves me time but I still get thrown something that trips me up. The last take home project I got was four parts and I was thankfully given a week to finish it but that still took me a great amount of time to finish. Then when it came time to review the assessment in front of the panel of developers it turned out that I completely misunderstood the third section of the assessment and for the fourth section it was two leetcode style questions that I just did not have the answer for. I copy pasted one answer and made an attempt to explain to them ""I copy/pasted this but I THINK I understand it"". They were nice enough to try and walk me through it but I could kind of see the pained look on their faces.

&#x200B;

I've since skipped trying to apply for React positions since what they ask for in the description seems to be far beyond my capabilities when it comes to React. I've now tried looking at agency jobs where they want Wordpress developers. The requirements seem to be a bit lower for these positions as they only require a years worth of Wordpress knowledge plus basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery etc. So now here I am learning Wordpress development. I am halfway through a 40hour+ course on Wordpress development and starting to realize it is going to be pointless if they expect me to also be a designer as I have seen that in postings as well and I am TERRIBLE at design. The only thing I have designed is my portfolio and even that was cobbled together from studying other portfolios (Brittany Chiang love your portfolio). This is my portfolio [adamjwatt.com](https://adamjwatt.com). Oh and currently that is broken locally because of some dependency updates that I just haven't had time  to work out!

&#x200B;

I am just stressed because I REALLY need a new better paying job and disappointed because I do really enjoy working in web development. It just seems that I might be bad at it. Sorry for the rant post. Feel free to remove mods but at least it's not another ""CHATGPT TOOK MUH JERB"" post i guess.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I've decided to try and apply for Data Entry jobs because I heard that was easy to get into. I like the idea of being in front of my computer so I can try to work on my web development projects if there is any down time. TURNS OUT most job postings for Data Entry are scummy people running scams. Hooray! The only solace I take from that is leading them on and messing with them while I wait for sites to deploy.

Web design used to be something creative, and something fun. It felt like an alternative to the rat race, and although we were often helping them, it felt a world away from the suits in the boardrooms.  
But now it seems every corner is filled with a tech bro telling me how they're going to 10x my business, or build an agency that has to have this many figures. It feels like salespeople became wannabe web designers overnight, and now according to half the industry the other half is doing everything wrong and should do it like them. And you couldn't possibly be doing it for fun, you must be doing it to earn big.   
I know there's still so many genuine people out there that do this for the love of it and are genuinely good at what they do - and there's nothing wrong with wanting to earn good money. But it just seems for every one of those people there's also a new hustler about selling snake oil.

But why?  We do your basic troubleshooting, it’s not their username or password.  It’s not MFA.  We contact support.

It’s their name.  It’s their non-American name more correctly. 

This issue relies on two things being true

1. You implement third party SSO.  We did of course.
2. people must have accent marks in their names.

That Google article links to a Wikipedia article.   The issue is their SAML assertation fails if your first, last or full name has any characters not on that list.  Thst’s right, an International company implemented a character set that doesn’t include accent marks.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable\_characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters)

Among that page is the 1977/1986 ASCII tables. That’s what characters people can have in their first or last name.  If your name is André you must change the spelling of your name. You must become Andre.  Pronounced differently it’s a different name.

Because we intergrate with Active Directory for the source of claims information we have to change their name there.  This means every place that pulls from AD has their name spelled wrong as well.

Not one other SSO integration we have has this problem.  Zero others.

One person sent in an account request.  When I saw their name I held their request until they fully understood the requirement they change their name.  They suddenly didn’t need a Google account and would find another way.

This is going to take a very long time to build a finished version (a couple of months), but no worries, I have committed myself and promised to add new content every single day. So even if you're someone who likes to read a little at a time, you're going to receive enough content every day to read and gain knowledge from.

Back to the main point. What is this book all about?

We start from basically 0 knowledge (little javascript knowledge is preferred) and end up creating a complete production ready backend framework, with absolutely 0 libraries at all! You're not going to ever do `npm install` throughout the book. On top of that, we're also going to create a cors, logging and tracing library, from scratch - that too without any dependencies. Say no to `npm install`

Isn't it better to work smart and not hard?

Yes, you may be right. But to learn things the proper way, and to have solid foundations, you have to ditch all the tools that do the heavy lifting for you, and do everything from scratch, to understand how the internals work.

If you know how the internals work, you are not limited by any language or framework. You can apply that knowledge no matter what language or framework you're working with.

These are some of the topics you can expect to master/learn throughout the book

1. Best coding practices, and how to properly think ahead when starting a massive/complex project. We'll start small, with a piece of code that just works. Then refactor that to make it modular, and reusable.
2. In-depth understanding of web and networks and an intro to *how do websites/servers work*
3. Learn the best practices for creating reusable modules, to be used throughout your projects, not just one.
4. Low level file handling and learn about file handles, file descriptors, closing them and reusing them for efficient file processing.
5. **Buffers** and **Streams** are going to be used thoroughly throughout the book. You learn various ways to deal with files, loading all at once in memory or load it in chunks/buffer (streams)
6. Proper error handling
7. HTTP, HTTP2 and a little on HTTP3. Our web framework will be HTTP2 compatible.
8. There will also be a small section explaining about `regex`es, as they're an essential tool, especially when we're building a web framework, our router should handle regex based paths
9. File rolling for our logger. Our log library will log to files, and a new file will be issued whenever there are certain limits reached. Limits will be provided by the client who uses our library. Some of those are - 1. create a new log file every X seconds, minutes, hours, days or weeks. 2. Issue a new file whenever its size reaches a specific threshold. 3. Add the request duration and other metadata. 4. Allow some sensitive fields to ignore while logging.
10. We'll also create a mini cors middleware from scratch, which will come packaged with our backend framework.
11. Support static file serving.
12. And much more.

We're also going to benchmark our framework's endpoints and compare it with some of the fastest nodejs web frameworks out there, and try to beat them ;)

I plan to add many more features to this guide cum book. If you're interested you can check it out on [github](https://github.com/ishtms/learn-nodejs-hard-way).

Any suggestions and improvements are welcome. This is in a very early stage (2-3 days old), and has to go through a lot of review process every now and then.",2023-08-19 20:14:01

# **what i hate more is the interactions i have to have with marketing teams regarding this tool**

as much as i hate GTM for being a tool that non-engineers can just inject random JS and slow our site down (and then blame us for slow performance later), the one good side effect is that i dont have to deal with all this tracking BS. they get to do it via GTM.

**but what happens is we get the worst of both worlds**

**marketing team**: *""we have this new tag/pixel that we are already paying for and need your help with. we tried setting it up in GTM and its not working so we need you to do it manually in code... here is the code you need to put in your codebase [blob of shit]""*


**me**: *""...where did you get this code block, do you have docs?""* 

(because thats not how this works. this isn't just a copy/paste and it works like you think



**marketing team**: *""thats what GTM docs tell us""*

**me**: *sighs*


 i manage to get something ""working""

**marketing team**: *""okay... GTM says its firing but the events are not showing up. can you help""*

**me**: *sighs*

my entire career has been several different teams where ""someone else owns GTM"" so no i have gained almost no legit experience and knowledge with how this shit works. I just ""fire tags/events"" and ""add to datalayer""

**marketing team**: *""you need to call this code, you aren't doing that""*

**me**: *sighs... ""can i get access to GTM?""* 

**marketing team**: *""maybe, it will take some time though since [person] is on vacation, but we really need this to get working as we are already paying for the advertising and wasting money*

**me**: *sighs*

**marketing team**: *""good news, i found out how to do this in GTM like we originally wanted so we dont need to use the third party pixel""""*

**me**: *THANK GOD*

14qciuo,Lost my 15-year old Domain due to provider's negligence. Need advice," 

I’m going to tell you how, after paying for a domain renewal, the provider iBrave forgot to renew it, and I lost a 15 years old domain. iBrave's response is that it's very expensive to recover it, but they can register a new one for me.

Now my website is a Thai gambling site.

First of all…

The service I had contracted was one of those “Unlimited hosting” that could disapear at any time. So I always made sure to make backups everything every week. However, I never imagined that they would forget to register a domain even after I had paid, and even though I had automatic renewal with my PayPal account linked.

I trusted this website a bit more because I contracted it from the BoingBoing store.

&#x200B;

Here we go:

On March 19, 2023, I renewed my domain warclimb.com in advance, for which I received invoices from PayPal and iBrave confirming that everything was fine.

On March 20, 2023, Isaac G from iBrave contacted me requesting the payment invoice. So I downloaded it from their platform (sigh) and sent them the invoices. Isaac replied saying he didn't get the attachment, so I sent it again. After sending him the invoice 3 times he stopped responding, and I assumed everything was correct, as my domain appeared as renewed in the email and the invoice I had downloaded from their platform was correctly attached.

Here is the invoice from their website and from Paypal:

https://preview.redd.it/aseprmsqlx9b1.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=cea0225d384e2a73d2fe1bf92a749b8d330f343b

April 28: Suddenly my website stopped working and my website users started receiving content from casino scams and pirated movies. I contacted iBrave and Isaac G responded confirming that someone had registered my domain, but that they could register another one for me at no additional cost :D

&#x200B;

[The original email with the attached invoice](https://preview.redd.it/buiwtse6mx9b1.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b1f190dae31be73ea1fead152a9fe67b095d1fa)

I explained the situation to him and he stopped responding to my emails. A few hours later I received another email from Arsi K from customer service asking me to contact ICANN to recover the domain.

May 10: ICANN responds asking for proof that I was the owner, but ICANN asked me for a registration from any domain provider that is associated with them. iBrave tells me that they register it with Stack Domains and then resell it.

So I wrote to Stack Domains.

May 15, I get a response from Stack Domains, but they have no record that can prove that I was the owner of the domain with them or that iBrave registered the domain last year. WTF!

iBrave also says that they are also unable to show a document that proves that they had registered my domain with Stack Domains during 2021 and 2022.

ICANN responds to me saying that they can't do anything and closes the case.

I run out of options and go to the LinkedIn of the founder of iBrave: Zane Voss. His LinkedIn profile is empty and has a photo that looks like those generated with ""This Person does not exists"":[ ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zane-voss-11bb56194)

I also received an apology from Stack Social and they offered me a refund of 50 USD, which I declined because it seemed insulting.

As of today, BoingBoing and Stacksocial are aware of this case and continue to offer this service in their stores.

I am one of the developers who has to repair everything that breaks like a 3rd party plugin after an update. Or I have to build some custom plugin on top of another plugin because the designers didn't think the original plugin was good enough or didn't look right.

I'm coming from .NET mainly and my passion lies in backend work and database work. I also prefer making everything right from start properly with proper frameworks. So I prefer building the frontend with say Vue, Angular, Flutter, HTML, CSS, JS and so on. Build the backend with modern .NET, automated tests, SQL Server or Python is ok too. I like Java also. I'm a full stack basically who knows a lot from scratch, rather than working with a CMS like WordPress.

But PHP and WordPress particularly are driving me nuts. I feel like I'm patching up broken shit constantly that wasn't designed the right way from start. I hate all those 3rd party WordPress plugins and they are giving me a headache literally.

I want to build proper systems, not with some blog CMS PHP crap like WordPress. I have to do all the shit work in it. The designers happily drag n' drop, install the plugins they want and when something breaks among those 30 plugins I have to fix it. Or if a plugin doesn't look right they want me to circumvent it, hack together some crap on top of that plugin.

It's like making a Frankenstein.

Should I give my employer an ultimatum that I'll quit if I have to continue like this? Or should I maybe just inform them that WordPress is killing my spirit and motivation? Any advice?

I left my stable corporate job after one year and something because I felt like I wasn't learning enough there and I decided to join a startup that on paper looked very interesting. They assigned me 2 take home assignments and at the and thay made an offer.
They decided to hire me as a contractor.
So I happily give my one month notice (Europe) and join the other company.

Some days before starting the guy that hired me said ""contact this other guy (form another team) in your first day, he will have your first tasks"". 

My first day I contact this other guy in the morning and we agree to have an initial talk shortly but after some time he sends me a message and says that before the call he wants me to set up the environment and have everything running. He provides a poorly described document where there are some instructions. At the end it took me one day.
In the afternoon he sends me a message with my first task which was as well poorly described.

My second day I start looking at the codebase and trying to find the files I'll work on for the task, make my first PR with the initial changes I made (as he requested). Obviously I needed some help because the task was regarding something I've never done. So I try to ask as little stupid questions as possible when I get stuck.

Third day: The task became more clear and I started to push more changes. Still asking for help for thing I don't understand (project related) but in my opinion not stupid questions. In the evening this guy (which didn't hire me) sends me a message saying that I don't fit the company vision and that they are expecting someone much more indipendece.

157qif5,Google is Trying to Destroy Distributed Web - A Proposal to DRM the Web with the Web Environment Integrity API,"[https://preview.redd.it/er0i2x5giqdb1.png?width=2336&format=png&auto=webp&s=d739ec8c229afeece7eeca1cab5e764d62470a45](https://preview.redd.it/er0i2x5giqdb1.png?width=2336&format=png&auto=webp&s=d739ec8c229afeece7eeca1cab5e764d62470a45)

 

Google has recently proposed the **Web Environment Integrity API (WEI)** for ""*determining the integrity of web environments*""

It's a subtle attempt by Google to solidify Chrome's monopoly over web standards, prevent ad blocking, destroy Firefox and smaller Chromium and WebKit forks and promote its advertising revenue.

This (proposed) API allows websites to request an ""attestation"" from an ""attester"" to validate the client environment (browser and/or devices). Google could exploit this by favouring Chrome as the attester, subtly promoting Chrome's dominance over other browsers like Firefox. A vendor lock-in in disguise!  
""Attesters"" decide whether your device and/or browser is ""trustworthy"" enough - as defined by the website you are trying to visit.  
It is specifically designed to destroy the open web by denying you the right to use whatever browser you want to use, on whatever operating system.

Another concern lies with limiting ad blockers. With Manifest v3, Google intends to restrict ad-blocking capabilities in Chrome extensions. Combined with WEI API, Google could potentially gain more control over the browsing experience, monopoly and ad revenue.  
This API provides almost no benefit, but could end up hurting small browser forks, modded Android/iOS phones, custom Linux distros, user privacy by giving attesters more data points and limiting privacy tools, user experience by breaking ad-blocking.

YouTubers like Louis Rossmann have also [heavily criticized this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i0Ho-x7s_U) and it is also receiving huge backlash on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues). We need to make sure that they fail, and the only way to do this is to spread awareness about it and talk about it more.

*I've posted a thread on Twitter about it, feel free to retweet it and share it with everyone and let them know about this:* [*https://twitter.com/0xDPJ/status/1683041313531523072*](https://twitter.com/0xDPJ/status/1683041313531523072)",2023-07-23 21:13:40

\----------------------------------------------

In a perfect world, these developers would be right. 

If you name your variables properly, separate your code into multiple easily understandable functions and classes, and write pretty good code overall then indeed you will drastically reduce the amount of comments needed.

**BUT...**

...coding is never that simple.

Even great programmers often end up having to write some sort of ugly / unintuitive code to fix an obscure bug that is the result of a design decision made years ago.

There's not a single senior developer who has never felt like they just wrote a shitty hack for a bug because because the only other way to fix it was to rewrite the entire feature from scratch.

The issue come from the ones who don't bother to explain why they had to do it this way while justifying it by saying that ""good code does not need comments"".

**It takes only 5 minutes to explain why you made this decision in the code, and it will save hours of work for the developer who will need to look at it after 2 years when a new bug is introduced.**",2023-11-03 13:33:31

18dq8ad,Are we witnessing the death of coding bootcamps?,"There's been conversations on Twitter/X that bootcamps are running out of business and shutting down for various reasons some including the fact that people are realising a big chuck of them are not worth it anymore.  


I've also noticed that there's pretty much no roles for junior devs at all. I run [peoplewhocode](https://peoplewhocode.io/jobs) and can confirm we've only had one role for a Junior FE Dev

Gergely Orosz says and I quote

""Many bootcamps are (and will be) going out of business as we are entering a time when college grads with years of study, plus internships, are finding it hard to get entry-level dev jobs.

Bootcamps were thriving at a time when there was a shortage of even new CS grads. Pre-2022""

“Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of collaborating with various agencies, a journey that has undoubtedly honed my skills and added value to my expertise. Yet, I can't help but feel a gnawing sense of inadequacy, as if I am lagging behind in this ever-evolving technological landscape. It would be irrational, of course, to assume that one could attain mastery over every existing framework.

I am confident that I'm not alone in grappling with what I've dubbed ""programming amnesia."" This perplexing phenomenon strikes as we hop from one framework to another, only to find ourselves revisiting the ""getting started"" documentation time and time again.

Surely, I can't be the only developer who has navigated the labyrinth of multiple frameworks and building tools. In years past, we saw the likes of Gulp, Grunt, Webpack, and Laravel Mix, only to be replaced by newcomers such as Vite and Astro.build. And whatever became of Ember.js? Has anyone ventured into the realm of Flutter? As for myself, I've delved into Angular, Vue, React, and now primarily focus on Next.js. The journey of styling has been equally tumultuous, progressing from Bootstrap to the present-day preference for Tailwind CSS or, when all else fails, default system styling. This battle, spanning a decade, has been arduous and relentless.

Ultimately, despite the extensive experience and knowledge I've gained, I can't shake the feeling of being woefully unprepared. However, I've come to accept this as an inevitable part of our dynamic field, and it's precisely this constant evolution that keeps us on our toes and fuels our passion for learning. Embracing the ever-changing landscape of technology, I've learned to adapt and grow, savoring the challenge and excitement it brings to my career.”",2023-04-03 01:36:59
16h37lb,Take your college more seriously kids," 

I wrote this in a comment but I feel like more college students should be reading this and some professionals as well.

It's common knowledge that college courses don't teach you anything. I think that that notion is harming people more than helping them.

College courses teach you fundamentals of computer science that ultimately make you a good engineer. What they don't do is teach you practical things. So in an ideal world you need to take your courses seriously and continue building skills outside.

Learning web frameworks, grinding leetcode, collecting certifications like you're Thanos collecting infinity stones feels good but doesn't do much to teach you the fundamentals that are essential to be a good engineer.

My two cents would be to use your college curriculum as an index for things that you need to study and then study them through equivalent college courses that are available freely from university like cmu, harvard, mit, Stanford and such. The quality of teaching is far better than what most Indian colleges teach.

As a fresher,, start with CS50 which is from Harvard. That course helped me a lot when I started college and right now it has multiple tracks. I'd recommend trying out all the tracks to get a vast breadth of knowledge and then you can dig deeper into what you like.

I never enjoyed grinding leetcode or cp because it didn't feel productive to me. Yes I struggled during placements because of it. I struggled to write code in the set time limit not with coming up with the solution but all it took was a couple of companies and a week of looking into the tricks people use to write smaller code and I was able to clear the OA. Interviews with good companies was not an issue because interviews are more like conversations where you get to show off your knowledge (remember knowledge comes from studying and not grinding).

MIT OCW has awesome courses that teach you basic and advanced DSA. I highly recommend that and also this website to brush up on your competitive programming [https://algo.is/](https://algo.is/)",2023-09-12 21:10:26

1609kvs,The Benefits of Working Fully Remotely as a Developer,"List your personal favourite benefits below of working fully remotely as well.

I work fully remotely from home as a software developer and love it. I really wouldn't want to have to go back into an office ever again, truth be told. Not even hybrid, 3 days a week from home and 2 days in the office.

There are so many benefits to working completely remotely, if you find a great company of course:

* I spend zero on commuting to and from work. I don't need to drive anywhere and I don't need to take any trains. One previous job required a lot of train commuting. It was a nightmare and a fortune. I would spend around £100 a week on train fares
* I can go to the gym easily first thing in the morning, get the workout done and be home ready to start work
* When I finish work usually on the dot at between 4.30pm and 5pm, I am home right away and have a lot of free time in the evening
* You don't have to put up with annoying colleagues making noise constantly in an office environment
* Whenever one of my senior devs is explaining how to do something technical, I always record it using free software called OBS to capture the demonstration. This means I can rewatch it and fully understand it rather than having to ask again if I didn't catch something. In an office environment, if a manager explains something, it may not be understood the first time around and I may be hesitant to ask again
* Very flexible working hours. I can start at 10am if I want and finish at 6pm. It's up to me. As long as I am at the daily standup at 8.30AM they are fine with this

Way too many benefits of remote work for me to want another office job. All the tools and technologies I need to do my job are on my own PC.",2023-08-24 18:11:43

15z4ayh,I hate just how many technologies there are in this field,"For starters, yes i know they are just options, and after a point there is a compatible option for everyone.

But, that being said. Lets say I want to build to a fullstack web app. First, I need html, css, js. Maybe Ts too, as a little bonus (ive learnt the basics but i use standard js) All that is basic and standard procedure, no conplaints. Then, time to choose a front-end framework. Vanillajs, React, vue, angular, svelte, are the 4 main ones, I learned react, kind of ok so far. Then, Ill need a back end. Express, django, laravel, springboot, RoR, list goes on. I chose express. Then, styling. Tailwind, bootstrap, pico (? Something similar at least), w3css. I went with bootstrap. But then, why not add a css preprocessor? I went along woth sass. Ok, well, then id need a database. MySQL, postgreSQL, MongoDB, list goes on again. I went with mongo db. Now, i need to choose between mongoose and the official mongodb drivers for express. I went with mongoose. This is just what I've learned the basics of. I really hate how i had to learn so many different things just to be able to start something decent. But what i hate more is that that's not all. What if i want to transfer data using xml instead of json? I could go and learn xml. What if i wanted to have a global state store? I could learn redux. What if i wanted ssr? I could learn nextjs. Then there are different build tools, webpack, babel, vite (i use vite, enjoying it). Then, of course you cannot forget git (thankfully i completed the w3schools course on git). And eventually im going to have to host that site too. Github pages, google cloud, ms azure, aws, firebase. Ehat if i wanted to leverage wasm too? And ALL of this is just off the top of my head. Say i want to transition from react to vue someday? Then id ditch next to learn nuxt... Hate how there are just so many different things to learn. Sure, i wont need all of them, but its hard to feel like ive ""graduated"" and feel ready to start building projects.

I switch all the code over to use the our mailgun account. A few forms on the site  had a google recaptcha that didnt even work so i switched them over to v3. I thought everything looked good, did a code review with the senior dev and pushed to prod. Come to find out these small changes snowballed into about 3 different bugs. Confirmation email formatting was all out of wack, the client stopped getting a confirmation email and I actually broke one of the forms when i switched to v3. I ended up fixing all these bugs and everything seems to be working fine but the client was insanely rude and made me feel like shit. In the email to my boss she wrote ""im suprised with these current issues, your company usually has such a tight process for working on the dev site before going live.""

131xrn0,Why optimizing for lighthouse is a mistake,"Rich Harris (of Svelte/Sveltekit) gave an interesting talk about [Frameworks, the web, and the edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXCipjbcQfM). The whole video is worth a watch if you haven't seen it, but I want to highlight an interesting point he makes starting at the 3:27 mark. 

He talks about [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law), which is often stated as ""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."" The idea is that lighthouse is a tool for diagnosing issues with a website, not a score that should be optimized. Chasing 100s for the sake of 100s is a misguided idea that, at best, wastes development time and, at worst, causes developers to alter their designs and produce suboptimal user experiences. For small hobby projects, it might not be a big deal, but for larger projects, over-optimizing for lighthouse scores is probably a mistake.

Rich's example to make his point is that the Svelte tutorial site gets a mediocre lighthouse performance score, but that doesn't matter because it needs to load a lot of resources to do the job it's designed for.

While listening to Rich's talk, I was reminded of a discussion from the recent episode of Lex Fridman's podcast with Manolis Kellis. Around [the 1:53 mark](https://youtu.be/wMavKrA-4do?t=6831), Manolis refers to a study that highlights the pitfalls of using simplistic models to analyze the connection between biomarkers and patient risk. These naive models can lead to paradoxical conclusions, as they fail to consider the impact of treatments on biomarker levels. As a result, the actual relationship between biomarker levels and risk is misrepresented, causing basic models to classify the highest-risk patients as having the lowest risk. You can [read the paper here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.30.22274520v1.full.pdf). It's a short paper and worth a full read, but figures 1 and 2 and their captions summarize the main point.

The analogy is obvious: optimizing for lighthouse scores and using them as a one-to-one measure of a site's quality of UX can be misleading. This is something experienced webdevs probably already know, but as a newer developer, I was definitely under the wrong impression about the value of lighthouse scores when I started. Dealing with client demands for all 100s is a challenge, and having some well-thought-out arguments for why that might not be a good idea is probably more useful than simply telling them ""It's not worth it,"" or caving and damaging the overall UX.

My take-home points from all this/TLDR:

- Rich's example is the poster child for why blindly optimizing lighthouse scores is a bad idea. The Svelte tutorial has poor lighthouse scores, but it needs to have ""poor performance"" to do the job it's designed to do.

- Building a simple model where high lighthouse scores are conflated with a good user experience is dangerous and can lead inexperienced devs to make poor design choices.

- Lighthouse is a useful tool for fixing issues with your site, but don't use it as a goal.",2023-04-28 15:31:56

With the rapid changes in front end technologies and developer-influencer over-hype and other fads, it feels like it’s just too much effort to keep up with industry trends (it’s not fun and exciting anymore). 

By the time I learn a new front end technology and implement it at work, a replacement or major update is already out that makes my new feature closer to legacy than cutting-edge.

Do any other full stack engineers feel this way? I think I want to break up with front end and start looking for solely-backend roles.

16oi59g,Unpopular Opinion: REST > GraphQL,"I don't expect many upvotes on this post as GraphQL advocates are very very passionate. In fact I've never seen someone advocate so strongly for REST as they do GraphQL. I'm still going to risk my Karma and say it, I prefer REST.

GraphQL is great at first. When I started working with GraphQL I thought it was amazing. I've even given conference sessions discussing GraphQL and the benefits it brings. At the time, I was only consuming GraphQL APIs. From a consumption standpoint, it does get benefits.

Running a GraphQL server brings a completely new perspective. This is why the pain points in the state of GraphQL report all revolve around performance, security, caching, etc. ([https://2022.stateofgraphql.com/en-US/usage/#graphql\_pain\_points](https://2022.stateofgraphql.com/en-US/usage/#graphql_pain_points)) which are all items that REST does very well.

I'm starting to think the best approach is to build APIs as REST, but then use something like Netlify Connect ([https://www.netlify.com/products/connect/](https://www.netlify.com/products/connect/)) to then allow front-end developers to choose GraphQL where desired.

15px442,As a junior dev trying to focus in backend why does it feel like there are TWO completely different backend worlds?,"For example, I'd look in my local (and even not-so-local market, EU job posts on Linkedin) and will realize that the vast majority of jobs ask for developers with Java or C# exposure.

Then I'll partitipate in online communities and check startup boards and realize that people go ""use Python"", ""use Go"", ""use Rust"", ""use TypeScript"".

It makes me think of ""online vs. offline"" such as, there are technologies people like talking about, and then there are technologies people make money with. I can't find the equivalent to frontend because in frontend you cannot escape using JavaScript/TypeScript, and you might say ""I'll use React"" or ""I'll do Angular"" but still those are 2 options not 5!

The question is twofold: How can I educate myself to choose a language and framework that will increase the odds that a company will extend an offer to someone who switches from FE to BE (and who also has a self-taught background), and whether I can make educated guesses as to what should I expect based on those options? By that I mean, is there some stereotype/rule of thumb that strongly correlates with a language or/framework that's true for the workplace? I know for a fact, for example, that Python tends to be used by AI/ML products or/and companies but I don't know if you can make some guess like ""Java = distributed systems"" or ""node = more odds to also do frontend"", etc.",2023-08-13 12:02:41

I see that most of the job receive 300+ applicant after 2-3 hours. That's crazy for us and for the employer too to read all these resume.

What's the ratio of bachelor, bootcamp & self-taught.

17sl603,CTO invited me to a call to scream obscenities at me,"I've been a software developer since 2016 and have worked only at startups. I've actually really enjoyed the startup life because you get to learn a lot of different things very quickly. I have been through a couple acquisitions and have a very well balanced set of skills between front, back, DevOps, and infrastructure. I have been extremely happy at my current company until this point (1 year), as everyone (including said CTO) has been incredibly friendly and it promotes a nice positive culture.

I'm a self taught engineer and previous entrepreneur, so startups are a good option for me because I can provide a lot more value than just writing code day in day out. When my last startup was acquired and I moved over here I thought I took a tech lead role, but really it ended up with me doing a lot of writing software because the company needed a lot of work, this was okay with me.

Over the last couple months the CTO, a middle-aged MIT grad, started getting more hands on with the code for some reason even though he's been a manager his whole career based on his LinkedIn. I think he has been enjoying getting his hands dirty with some Terraform among other things. Recently, he wanted me to implement something that I thought didn't really make sense, and after I explained to him why, he made it immediately clear that he did not care and I was to do it anyway.

So I did, but after a couple iterations where it was not to the specifications he wanted, which wasn't super clear to me since it was verbal only, he started getting very irritated with me and making snide remarks during stand-up that I was incapable of console logging (that's what he wanted, essentially). Eventually I told him, via Slack, that I didn't appreciate the disrespect and that I expect mutual respect.

He invites me to a huddle and screams and curses at me for ""calling him unprofessional"", ironically. I thought he was going to have a heart attack he was breathing so hard and talking so fast. This is a guy that up until this point seemed incredibly chill and friendly. He then started giving me ""feedback"" about all of the things he thinks I ""regularly fail at"", but I've never heard these things because for the entire year he's cancelled every 1 on 1 that I routinely ask for. To put things into perspective, myself and one other engineer are ""the"" people that come in to save the day week in and week out. Even if his ""feedback"" was valid, the delivery was the most unprofessional thing I've ever experienced at work in my life.

The market is tough right now and I make good money at my current company and like my coworkers, the startup, the CEO, everyone. But after seeing behind the curtain a bit, I don't see how I can stay out of my own best interest. We don't even have HR, and even if we did, what would they do? I don't have any leetcode skills since I'm self taught and have gone from startup to startup, but perhaps I need to get studying.

What should I do?

16wnxwx,Been building sites since 1996. What's the point anymore?,"First off, I'm ""old"" for a programmer. I started coding in  3rd grade (1982 on a TRS-80 III). I started designing and coding websites in 1996 after the Army. Built some truly original UI/UX over the years, especially for General Motors. But then Wordpress won the CMS wars and the template industry made EVERYTHING look the same for everyone. Header, navbar, hero slider, three column icon-laden sections, copy block, repeat. I was a Flash developer and animator so long as THAT lived, but Jobs killed it. I was there when AJAX and JQuery hit the scene, but now, what's the point?!

No one wants a hand-coded custom site when their nephew could throw up a Wix in 30 minutes. No one wants to pay for quality when a simple Envato search gets them 90% closer to what they wanted anyway. Do I abandon my old LAMP stack and learn MEAN? Or MERN? Is it worth getting into React? I've been using MySQL so long, Mongo seems like a foreign concept. Is it worth even being a ""web developer"" in the era of bland templates and ubiquitous PowerPointy HTML5 parallax movement and ridiculous client turnaround times based on a Wordpress template their cousin did one time on Media Temple.

Honestly, is this even an industry anymore or just a hobby for those of us enamored with the ""old"" way, the ""hard"" way of hand coding and custom UI? At 49, is it worth learning a new language, a new stack? Would Python be worth learning for anything other than my dusty Raspberry Pi 4? Why are we even here anymore?

18alg7i,Leaving a company and shutting down self made website that many people use.,"Hi all,

I have developed a few web-based applications that have significantly streamlined my daily tasks at work. One of these applications has proven to be particularly successful, with around 300 users per week and with 1000 hits.  

As I approach the end of my degree, I am considering leaving my current organization and pursuing other opportunities. However, as the project(s) are currently hosted on GitHub, I am unsure about what to do with them. 

My company is well aware of the application and while they don’t officially approve of its use, they allow it. I’ve already talked to my director of IT and he said they are working on a company made solution because mine won’t pass an QA. 

Am I obligated to keep the site running even if I am not employed there anymore?

Edit: Thanks for all the responses!

I am not employed as a developer. I work at as a non-IT department manager in a large company so I never signed a contract with clauses on personal projects. 

My goal was to use the project to gain experience to help career change into a developer role. My employer doesn’t see the value I provide and I feel it’s time to move on and start applying for junior developer positions. 

My main concern was what to I do with the application if I am lucky enough to get out before the company provides a new solution.

I also have other apps that are used but to a lesser extent, about 5 users a day for one and 15 a month for the other. The company has no plan to remake these.",2023-12-04 14:33:15

**Context:**

I’m a software engineer at a company with awesome work/life balance and decent pay. I really love my job — the work I do is fun and I consider the people I work with to be close friends of mine at this point. 

However, I think my family is starting to feel the effects of inflation in our bank accounts.

We’re cutting costs everywhere we can, and have cut back on a lot of the things we used to enjoy. I’m open to looking for a higher paying job if it becomes necessary, but considering where the market is at right now, I'd love to see if I can hold off on that for another 8-12 months.

I have a SaaS product I built that has one paying user at $40/mo, but I built the app for a friend of mine who runs a B2B e-commerce brand and it has such a specific use case that I haven’t had luck finding anyone else who wants to sign up for it. 

Because of that, I feel like I’m hesitant to jump in and build another SaaS product unless I’m certain more than a few people would use it. I guess I’m feeling stuck… I feel like I have so much extra free time in my day that I’d be more than happy to use towards some paid work, but I just can’t find anyone with the cash to pay for a software product/service. 

I’d be ecstatic if I could find 1-3 clients a year to build little $5k-$10k apps/websites for. I’m not looking to make an extra 7 figures, just a little extra cash to add to the emergency fund pretty much.

I’ve tried:

* Meetups: Mostly for the startup/tech community, but most people I meet can either do the work themselves or want the work done for sweat equity. 
* Networking online (Discord/forums): I struggle to make meaningful enough connections without sounding like I’m shilling services. 
* Content: My blog gets a few hundred readers per month, but I don’t think my readers are in a demographic that need work done/are willing to pay (I think most of my readers are other engineers). 
* Upwork: I usually lose bids to people with more reviews than me (I don’t have any reviews cause I just recently made a profile). 
* I’ve been thinking about posting more on Twitter or making YouTube videos in an attempt to build an audience, but I’ve never been a big social media poster and not sure if it’s worth the time investment.

My question to the community: Has anyone had success with any of these methods? If you had to start over, would you start with any of those methods? Or something else? (Talk to your network more, try to rank for SEO, find more/different kinds of meetups? 

Maybe I should just double down on my SaaS and find ways to make it less niche? Or even talk to that one e-commerce friend some more to see if that friend has other ideas/references to other clients?

If anyone has any success stories, I would love to hear them… A little inspiration might help to keep hopes high! 😄",2023-12-07 08:10:17

17trquc,TIL about the 'inclusive naming initiative' ...,"Just started reading a pretty well-known Kubernetes Book. On one of the first pages, [this project](https://inclusivenaming.org/) is mentioned. Supposedly, it aims to be as 'inclusive' as possible and therefore follows all of their recommendations. I was curious, so I checked out their site. Having read some of these lists, I'm honestly wondering if I should've picked a different book. None of the terms listed are inherently offensive. None of them exclude anybody or any particular group, either. Most of the reasons given are, at best, deliberately misleading. The term White- or Blackhat Hacker, for example, supposedly *promotes racial bias*. The *actual* origin, being a lot less scandalous, is, of course, not mentioned.

Wdyt about this? About similar 'initiatives'? I am very much for calling out shitty behaviour but this ever-growing level of linguistical patronization is, to put it nicely, concerning. Why? Because if you're truly, honestly getting upset about the fact that somebody is using the term 'master' or 'whitelist' in an IT-related context, perhaps the issue lies not with their choice of words but the mindset *you* have chosen to adopt. And yet, *everybody else* is supposed to change. Because of course they are.

I know, this is in the same vein as the old and frankly tired master/main discussion, but the fact that somebody is now putting out actual *wordlists*, with 'bad' words we're *recommended* to replace, truly takes the cake.",2023-11-12 19:35:47

I made his website promoting his fashion brand. We made a contract about the contents and capabilities of the website. He quickly had extra wishes that I told him would cost extra (also written in contract). Every couple of weeks he kept changing things, logos, navigation, etc.Eventually I made a cut and send him the bill of all the extra work (approx. 75% extra from original offer). He argued with me, telling me that it was too much and he wanted statements of what I did exactly, which I had already prepared using a time tracking tool.

Since he was one of my first clients I asked an hourly rate 50% of what he would pay with others and I even gave him 150 Euro discount on the extra work (I do not know why, maybe I am too polite)

He is yet to pay the extra effort but keeps making demands. I remind him each time about the bills and he keeps bringing up the same excuses.

Furthermore he keeps asking the same stuff ""How do I log into my mail on my macbook"" Which I already explained in detail, even borrowing a Mac to make screenshots. When I started to ignore these messages he started becoming passive aggressive towards my work.

Now I prepared a text, basically saying that I did all my contractual duties and that I will not cooperate any longer. Furthermore I set a deadline to pay the yearly hosting fee or else the website and mailserver would go down. He is behind three month in payment. I think turning off the site would be too harsh and would give him a reason to not pay his other monthly bills that he kept paying.

Am I too harsh? How should I handle this?

19csc7w,Why is frontend development so complicated?,"Im a developer but I haven't worked on a web frontend app for more then 7 years. Just before Angualr,React and Vue started to become popular.

Back then we used JQuery and KnockoutJs for developing the frontend and It was really easy to pickup and not complicated to develop in.

I kind of fallowing the development of the forntend framework for a while and never really learn them. And from a bystander perspective it looks unnecessarily complicated.

You now have to compile scripting language to a scripting language, there are projects that have hundreds of megabytes of dependencies and compile times (of a scripting language!?) that can compare to a big C++ project. 

Is there a trend that things will become more simple in the future, what do you think?
My perspective may be wrong, I mainly do system programming and in low level projects the goals are in the opposite direction. Less code, less dependencies and more simplicity, that way you can make more stable and fast system.

16vhd76,I was stuck in tutorial hell for almost 3 years. Here's how I got out and you can too!,"Everyone says 'you have to do projects', you know this but you don't know what to build or where to start, and you always feel like you don't know enough. 
The first step is to feel that discomfort/fear and just do it anyway. You CAN push through it. Keep this in mind always, and repeat it to yourself in the following steps. 

The trick is learning the fundamentals, once you have the fundamentals down and have broken out of tutorial hell, you can just Google things you don't know as you need them. Once you have the fundamental building blocks everything else will make sense rather quickly as you can easily fit the new information into your current schema. This is what professional devs are doing 90% of the time. 

But how do you know what the fundamentals are? And how do you learn them without falling back into tutorial hell? You take a course, one that  teaches you the fundamentals, and gives you projects to do, without holding your hand. The best I've seen is the FREE FrontendMasters 'Complete Intro to Web Development, v3'.  Brian Holt takes you through all the basics and has you build 3 basic sites each with increasing complexity and finally a (pretty challenging imo) wordle clone. This course was very hard and nearly broke me a few times but I kept repeating ""just push through the discomfort, this is normal"". 

After that I had the foundation to build whatever I wanted, now I'm building websites from scratch, no problem, no fear, whenever I get stuck I just do a quick search, ten minutes of reading and then I'm back to it. I could never have done this a year ago; I'd have said ""I guess I'm just not ready"" and would proceed to ditch the project and spend 4 weeks watching (mostly redundant) tutorials. 

That's my shpiel for the day, get away from the handholding BS (e.g codecademy) and get to the next level, you can absolutely do this. You don't have to take the FrontendMasters course either, I just personally thought it was the best, and you can finish it in a month or so, I'll list a few other FREE options here. 

Harvard CS50: good if you want to go deeper into learning programming, and how computers work in general, building up to building a few simple websites. This will probably take you a good 6 months, but it will be a fulfilling use of your time.

The Odin Project: this one is much longer, and more in depth but I've heard great things and know it busted a lot of people out of tutorial hell. 

After this, if you want to learn a frontend framework/library like React just follow the basic tutorial for a day or two then rebuild one of your earlier projects using the new technology, I've found this is the fastest way to pickup new tech. 

Anyway good luck, if you need help, my dms are always open.",2023-09-29 17:13:17
14hnrl9,Meta: do you think the internet is becoming more difficult to find good or useful information?,"I’m 30 and grew up online mostly. I first got online around 2002, but properly in 2004 so i was 11ish years old.

Most of my life i knew the internet to be useful for research, through learning how to google pretty easy to sort wheat from chaff, and full of valuable anecdotes from real people and a wealth of ability to DIY from it all for free.

However, since around 2012, but absolutely now it is no longer easily the case imo. Google is just a piece of shit and appending reddit(or similar discussion forums) is almost mandatory for a lot of searches now.
SEO junk word salads, advert desperate “content creators” on their site and youtube just cycle the same shitty source information from each other in a bid to make money. Its basically got to the point where paying for resources is almost mandatory now unless you are an absolute god ad wading through information. God forbid you venture into social media like Toktok or instagram where it is utter cancer. The culture moved to where people just would blog and discuss and share their hobby/experience/expertise in appropriate digestible formats to whatever the “algorithm” promotes so short form or snappy adhd bullshit, meaning people are just not sharing like they used to.

I grew up in these early periods so my experience and change to this is shocking but it was probably the same before the net existed(pay for good resources or get junk). Its sad imo.

15d84ag,I feel POWERFUL,"I’ve been a hobby dev for about 6 years, I’ve always considered myself to be fairly “dumb”. I found reading documentation very difficult, and found it very hard to understand coding in general. But I had a massive passionate fire raging inside of me, I wanted to be better. I loved it, the rush I get when I complete a task, or get a script to work I’ve been working on for weeks is like nothing else! 

For the first 4 years I stuck to the basics, HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript - vanilla of course. With a sprinkle of Jquery here and there. I then dabbled in some Symfony and Laravel, but found this very difficult. The general syntax and patterns didn’t click in my brain. 

Now, I come to learn React (NextJS). It’s like my brain exploded. Every little thing I learned from all of these struggles, all the weird hacks I thought of, all the PHP patterns and uses all smashed together. I had an awakening. I felt like I knew so much, all was so apparent. Although I thought I was lagging behind, still using the vanilla stuff while everyone was using these fancy frameworks that scared the shit out of me. I wasn’t, I was just taking a different route. It might have been a bit slower but now I feel like I have a deep intrinsic understanding - I feel POWERFUL!

1509p4m,I'm not impressed by GraphQL and I still prefer REST.,"Hi everyone

I have dabbled with GraphQL and used it for my [portfolio website](https://webdevamin.com) to see what all the hype is about. It allows you to fetch only the necessary data you need I get it. However, the challenge is that, when a new property is created on the backend. In such cases, I have to explicitly add that property to the query, for instance.:

        services(locale: $locale, pagination: { limit: 100 }) {
          data {
            attributes {
              title
              text
              showcase
              backgroundColor
              icon {
                name
                brands
              }
            }
          }
        }

I use Apollo. Makes me a bit frustrated that I have to rely on third party packages to implement Gql easier. With REST I only have to rely on built in fetch(). Let's say I have just added the ""showcase"" property in Strapi, which is a Headless CMS built on Node.js. I need to include that property in the query mentioned above as well. As a result, the query file becomes quite verbose, spanning over a thousand lines. The verbosity of GraphQL in this scenario has made me question whether using REST calls instead would have been a better option. Do you believe this issue can be solved while still using GraphQL? What do you think? You always need to put a new property inside the query every time you create new data on the backend. This isn't the case in REST, You just put

    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
    const data = await response.json();

and you get everything from posts automatically. Of course you should also consider error handling with try catch for example but the REST code above is minimum.

For Gql you have to write like this:

      const { data } = await client.query({
        query: GET_SERVICES,
        variables: { locale: [locale] },
      });

And afterwards you need to implement a query like mentioned above. And then who knows you need to change it constantly later on.

The main advantage of GraphQL I can think of is the ability to fetch data from a complex tree of nodes and relationships using a single network request.",2023-07-15 11:33:12

159fl60,UI+UX tools that changed my workflow in 2023,"A few days ago, I made a similar post on [r/UXDesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/) several folks asked me to post it here as well. I work more on the UX side but I work extremely closely with web developers and UI designers.

With that being said, earlier this year I was seeing *a lot* (and I mean a lot) of cringey ChatGPT posts from people in our space on LinkedIn; but after sifting through a lot of the garbage I've found a couple of both AI and non AI niche tools that are absolute gold.

I've been lurking on all of the UI/UX/Webdev subs for years but I never actually posted; all of them have been extremely helpful. Its been reassuring to know a lot of you guys have the same problems and are supportive. I just wanted to share a few things that have been helping our team this past year and hopefully give back a little.

&#x200B;

1 - [**HeyMarvin**](https://heymarvin.com/): Has helped me analyze qualitative user research

* Acts as a qualitative research repository, offering an organized platform for storing and accessing research data.
* Excellent for user interview data analysis - makes pattern identification and interpretation much easier from my experience.

&#x200B;

2 - [**Khroma**](https://www.khroma.co/): AI color palette

* Okay, this one is a bit more simplistic but we've found it to be quite useful as well. It figures out your color preference and gives you a variety of combinations you can use. Really big fan of this one and often helps me begin on an idea.

&#x200B;

3 - [**UIzard**](https://uizard.io/): AI UI design tool - **VERY USEFUL**

* You can literally take a screenshot of a design and turn it into something that's actually editable. This has saved me an immense amount of time.
* You can use text prompts to generate designs.

&#x200B;

4 - [**Dscout**](https://dscout.com/): User research platform focused on team alignment, data insights, etc. One of my favorite tools right now. V glad I found this.

* Sourcing, managing, and conducting interviews, enabling comprehensive user research.
* Management + conversion of data into insights

15lpn4z,Am I being too harsh with the junior dev?,"Here are examples: 

A) I was going away on vacay so I asked them to create a branch of their progress before their EOD. That way they would be unblocked before I leave. This person pushed the wrong code and didn't bother checking. Not the end of the world but it means they'll be spinning their wheels unnecessarily until I get back.

To clarify,  they're stuck and wanted feedback. And for that feature, I'm the only dev that can help. So basically, I just wanted to unblock them before I left.

B) along the theme of careless, not knowing when to ask for help... They were working on a tricky part of the codebase. And by tricky I mean just getting the code to run is hard. In my mind, that's a huge red flag telling you that you need help. But they went to another new dev for the PR. This person who didn't know about this tricky part, gave the approval. And they landed a bug.

To clarify, this person did not reach out to the other dev. 
We have a queue of PRs that anyone can review. Here the other dev should not have rubber stamped the PR. They are senior, just new.

The bug is on the senior. I'm just irked that the junior didn't ask for help. And to clarify I'm not the only senior. There's like a dozen more peeps they could have asked. There's slack for crying out loud. 🤣

c) continuing the theme, we had an architecture discussion about how to implement a feature. But when it came time to code,  they coded the approach I specifically called out as incorrect. Apparently they forgot/didn't write it down.

Anyway, there are numerous examples like this.

Btw, We're currently taking a more active approach where we're basically micromanaging this person... Which also irks me.

To sum up, this person is very nice but i sure am frustrated since I'm used to working with juniors that need less management, and are more detailed oriented. Who basically I can trust to get shit done with less guidance.

Or am I being too harsh and need to lower expectations?

Also to clarify, I'm not the only senior dev this person can ask for help.

Update: this post has been an eye opener. Namely, that a lot of devs here have very low expectations of what it means to be a junior. Someone even went so far as to jokingly call them idiots. It's a joke but still....

Given this, it sounds like we have an average junior dev, and so I've definitely been too harsh.

Also, this person may be struggling with impostor syndrome, feeling overwhelmed at learning new tech, not knowing how to advocate for themselves..

And being reminded of this can help me empathize with them.",2023-08-08 18:08:17

I’ve seen a lot of people talk about tailwind and the npm installs on it are on par with styled-components so I thought I’d give it a go and read the documentation and couldn’t help but feel like it was just bootstrap with less strings attached, why do people love this so much? It destroys the readability of the HTML document and creates multi line classes just to do what could have been done in less lines in a dedicated css / sass module.

I see the benefit of faster run times, even noted by the creator of styled components [here](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tailwind/)

152l35p,Just started a new job. Way in over my head...,"I just started a new mid level frontend dev position at a company. To say the least I was completely overwhelmed by my orientation and introduction to the teck stack today. 

For context, I started my career out three years ago as a web designer, focused more on mockups and coding out html and css to be used with the backend. At my past jobs I was considered the CSS expert and I could really easily translate my designs to code. Recently I have had more interest in frontend development using react and nextjs. I hit a good rhythm at my last company creating their frontends with react and nextjs and having a good place to learn more javascript alongside the senior software engineer. Unfortunately I was laid off from that job last month. 

Cue to today, where I just completed my first day of work at my new job. I was thrown into a crazy new tech stack that runs on linux and uses preact to create custom widgets that interface with another system. I was given some really big tasks and some smaller ones. I had a lot of trouble even setting up the repo and getting the code to run. I was on a 2hr long call with another coworker and they were helping me step by step to get the code to run. I felt like I knew nothing and every time I looked at the code I didn't know what to do and would have to ask for help again. The only thing I remotely felt comfortable doing is they wanted me to create some custom components their UI/UX designer had made. I'm even having trouble wrapping my head around how the widgets interact with the other service. I would say I am more used to created standalone websites and apps that have their own database and apis instead of creating more microapp widget type code. 

At this point I don't even know if I am qualified for this job. The interview process had no code test and they were impressed that I had design skills alongside the dev skills I had and I think that's what got me in the door. 

Should I try to fake it till I make it? I'm starting to think I might need to try and find a more junior frontend role if I want to continue down the frontend path. 

This is more of a rant post but I just needed to clear my head after such a draining first day. Any advice is welcome. 


EDIT

Thank you all for the comments. I may have been a little to quick to post this, especially to an online forum, but emotions got the best of me. 

Aside from that, I really appreciate all of the uplifting comments and suggestions. I'll continue to comb through the comments and see what you guys have to say. Tomorrow is a new day and I am excited to start learning more and to improve my skillset.

Now looking back at it I pretty much spent about 4 years being interested in coding (and doing projects) but yesterday a really scary thought hit me. 

As I was in a bus coming home I overheard two guys talking about how much they wanted to be devs but they couldn’t because of the high standards the companies have nowadays and how 5 years ago they accepted everyone as “developers” even if they didn’t know sh*t about programming (they taught them all later), but now it seems like its way way harder to become a dev since its “trendy” to code and that you will “necessarily” earn 10k per month (the casual rumours). And boom, now everyone suddenly wants to learn how to code.  

This is not the first time I hear convention like this. I start to wonder “what if programming is already oversaturated with so many people wanting to code?”. Should that be a big problem for me? I feel like the competition is really serious right now and im not gonna succeed.",2023-12-13 15:48:33
15uygoc,"4 week contract coming to an end, client is telling me I've done nothing","For context, I made this post a while back: [https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/15a91j8/need\_to\_decide\_what\_to\_do\_with\_clients/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/15a91j8/need_to_decide_what_to_do_with_clients/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Long story short, I was contacted by a 4-person startup a friend works with. They previously spent in excess of one million dollars paying developers in India to develop a highly complex app in the now outdated and unsupported Codeigniter 3. Then, about a year ago they added Wordpress to it so the CEO could make changes to the front end himself (dramatically increasing the complexity of the app).

When I started working on this, I was told the app was built in codeigniter and wordpress, was running slow and needed to be made faster. I said okay, I can look into it. So we settled on a 4-week contract.

I quickly realized it was built in codeigniter 3, not codeigniter 4. CI3 is no longer supported and not even compatible with PHP 8.x. The production server is running on PHP 5.6 for this reason. Then there's wordpress making things even worse... the app is basically useless with the homepage and every other page taking like 10 seconds to load.

I explained the app needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, but the CEO wouldn't take that for an answer. He wanted me to migrate the wordpress portion to a separate server instead, so the wordpress portion could have the PHP updated while the outdated codeigniter continues to run on PHP 5.6. It then took about a week to convince him I can't just hand chatGPT his massive CI3/wordpress codebase and tell it to magically generate a new app in a modern framework that functions properly (he seems to think AI can just replace software engineers now).

I explained that maybe it would be possible to accomplish that in the next week, but that I wouldn't guarantee it because I've had no time to do an actual code audit and have no idea how many errors I'm going to run into throughout that process... they said ok.

Fast forward to now, and as expected, I'm running into one problem after another just trying to get the wordpress portion of the app functioning properly on a devserver (which didn't even exist when I started--they just had a production server and a staging server). Errors within the app itself, dev database wasn't synced with prod and missing half the pages of the app, plugins all screwed up, etc... My contract ends today and the CEO is acting like I've done nothing this entire time. We had a heated phone call today which ended with him asking me to write up what I can accomplish from here. I'm supposed to call him on Monday morning.

Honestly, I don't feel comfortable working with this client anymore. They knew at the start I hadn't even worked with wordpress or codeigniter before, yet can't understand why it's unreasonable to expect me to make a major architecture change to their multi-million dollar application in a matter of 4 weeks.

191yp2g,"Well I just got laid off: Rant, reflections, etc. Learn from my mistakes.","Hey r/webdev 

I just got laid off (9yrs experience, mostly front-end, USA tech-center area). 

I'm mainly writing this for catharsis but I also thought I could share my experience with you all in case its of some use to someone. 

**Background:** 

I'd been at a mid-sized firm for a few years (my longest tenure ever). My responsibilities were a bit all over the place: I was the lead/architect for front-end in the company, so choosing technology, setting standards, conventions, best practices, mentoring, etc. I worked intimately with Product as well and got to learn a lot of their process and even influenced it heavily myself. I was also the go-to guy for what I think is best described as ""research"" type work (in relation to our existing skillset in the company). For example, we needed to build a new mobile app, had no one with mobile app experience, so it fell on my lap and I ended up learning how to do so and shipped a mobile app. I may not be the best at any one thing, but I'm a quick learner and flexible.  The work I did when I first joined completely changed how we did front-end (kind of worked myself out of a job here... see below), which gave me more responsibility and authority to the point where I became the final arbiter of anything to do with front-end, my word was law. I even helped them change their entire hiring process for front-end which led to great recruits after implemented. The culture was your typical up-their-own-ass corporate cult shit, but my boss and the people I worked with were not like that, so it was a good environment. My boss was lenient and flexible, so taking personal time was never an issue. I basically just made up my own goals each quarter, was left alone to accomplish them, and then repeat next quarter. I worked from home mostly, and outside of some hard meeting times, basically picked my own hours. 

**Why I was let go:** 

Well I joke and say that the company broke up with me because the thrust of their reasoning was ""its not you. its us"". The HR guy even brought up how ""since youve been with us for so long, and you've done such a good job we're willing to offer you a very generous severance package. That we are totally not legally obliged to give you"" (it wasn't very generous, especially to the europeans in this subreddit. 'Murica). 

**Analysis/rant:**

I think my main mistake here is breaking my own damn rules. Up until joining this company I had a strict rule of not staying at any given place more than 2 years (before this place my record was 1.5yrs). This kept me sharp, and my compensation kept rising. Then Covid hit. The economic future was not very promising and I made my big mistake: I talked myself into staying because of the fear that if i jumped ship I would put myself in a ""last hired first fired"" situation. Then the pandemic wound down, but the economic outlook was still bad and I made the same argument to myself. I had become close with my boss (not as close as I thought though haha), the people I worked most closely with were my real life friends, and I had reached a position of importance. I deluded myself into thinking that if I was getting fired, the company was just generally fucked given how much responsibility I had. Well I was fucking wrong, and looking back I can see the red flags waving wildly in the winds of my mind. 

When I joined, the CTO at the time was in the midst of a modernization drive. The company was older, and lets just say the tech stack and architecture was ancient. He decided to implement microservices on the back end and adopt a SPA approach in the front-end. A close friend had joined them (not an engineer) and told me they really needed someone to take the reigns as the existing team was struggling really hard with transitioning to SPAs. I joined shortly after. It was pretty bad. The team wasn't just new to SPAs but was very resistant to change in principle and seemed to not like the idea of component based architecture at all. They would recreate each UI element any time they needed it and couldn't even keep buttons consistent between pages. We had a large UI team at the time and with the requirement of getting to work asap, having a SPA school was not really an option. So I decided what most of you are already thinking, build a component library that would allow them to build UIs like putting lego bricks together. While this project was being completed, I was asked frequently to jump and fix shoddy UIs, build UIs myself, fix bugs the team didn't understand, etc. By the time we finished, the team was able to build any and all UI screens from the design team, rapidly and well. I worked myself out of these tasks, as I was the one building the components and all that. 

However, this was also a period where the product team got very excited and started throwing out all sorts of big ideas. And since the rest of the UI team was finally independently productive, my plate was clear to take on their big ideas. I built a few mobile projects which was something entirely new to me, I did some pretty heavy duty visualization work, it even just got kind of weird for a while where I built a zendesk theme and wrote a tool to custom make html emails in the company brand lol. I was doing a ton of different things. It was actually a pretty fun time. My earlier work had paid off, and the UI team had changed dramatically. My hiring advice got us some great engineers, and the component library was very well featured and had all the functionality the company needed, so building UIs became a breeze and not something I had to be on top of 24/7. The standards and best practices I established improved our code base tremendously and we stopped making Sonar suicidal. 

Then about a year ago, things started changing. The product team stopped having new ideas, most of their output became incremental improvements to existing product. There was talk of this or that new big idea, but never any movement. Given this lack of interesting work, and the fact the rest of my UI team was working well, I was asked to do some of the more annoying, hard, but necesssary work that companies tend to push off. For example before I joined the team had adopted this other component library, and there had just been no time (or political will is more like it) to replace it in the part of the product it was used. It was also some wild west spaghetti that was barely understandable. A lot of that kind of stuff, but the results were pretty impressive, I was blown away at how much time that library was adding to our pipeline. Long story short, in retrospect, it seemed clear that my role was becoming redundant. But there was always the promise of a big project we'll kick off ""next month"" that never came.

Back to the economic aspect. Some of you may have seen my comments on here about the economic situation in tech, specifically how interest rates going up have erased the free money that characterized the industry for so long. Well this is true across industry, money is no longer free and companies are acting differently. They're much less willing to throw money at things, especially if they cannot make a clear connection between the spend and increased revenue. Even if they can, firms are batting down the hatches and preemptively cutting costs as much as possible. With all that said, this past year the company was profitable, even grew! However it did not grow *enough* to please our investors and C-levels. Now keep in mind what I just said about the wider economic situation. Their answer? Shake things up and hire more salespeople. Because of course more salespeople will definitely make people with no money to spend, spend the money they don't have! (/s) I'm sure they paid no mind that when we asked our churn clients why they're leaving they overwhelmingly all said ""we love your product but the economy doesn't look great, times is tough, and we need to cut costs"". Nah it was definitely the salespeople. And it wasn't just me, in another office they cut 35% of the staff! 

So basically I fucked up by being a fucking wuss. Yes times is tough, and yes ""last hired first fired"" is a thing, but there is NO SECURITY in business. Doesn't matter how important you were, doesn't matter how much money you made the company. Business runs strictly on a ""what have you done for me lately"" mode, and more specifically ""what have you done for me lately that I can explain to an executive and tie a dollar amount to"". If i had taken the plunge I would be making more money (I've actually lost money with the combination of inflation and insultingly low yearly raises relative to inflation), my skills would probably be sharper, etc. I stayed because I was scared, and because I was comfortable. I was making enough money to be comfortable, my work-life balance was great, I liked my team, and I deluded myself into believing my boss had my back just because I was one of the most productive guys he managed. I ignored obvious signs that the winds were changing, and didn't act accordingly. I should've been brushing up on leetcode a year ago. 

The most annoying thing is that I *knew* all this shit. I have for years. I know theres no loyalty in business, I know its all based on ""what have you done for me lately"", I know you shouldn't be so free and generous with specialized knowledge that makes you look good/crucial. I knew all this shit. Yet I let the fear of the unknown, and my emotions cloud my judgement. I believe this was most likely not my boss's initiative, but I do feel betrayed he didn't even give me a heads up. He acted like everything was just peachy last time we chatted. 

I don't even know what I'm trying to say at this point. Just venting. Thanks for reading, and if yall known anyone looking for a front-end with 9yrs experience, I'm looking :)

15wjhbl,Can someone help me understand the real point of a JWT? Im not sure I see the use?,"So, with cookies, we obviously have sessions which are normally used, now every good Auth system should have a way too log out a user without needing to wait for the cookie to expire, which to me removes the main pro of using JWTs, because even a session with a JWT should have a session handle of sorts to invalidate it if needs be? So we technically still have sessions?

The only ""real"" pro I can see with JWTs is that we can use them to store some data locally and verify its authenticity with JWKS? But even then, most of that info if on the user only serves to show local info, so its not a security risk to store it locally instead of in a JWT? 

I guess what Im failing to see is if we need sessions anyways, and we can just store non sensitive data locally, whats the point of a JWT except to be a fancy cookie with another layer of protection as opposed to a regular cookie with a session ID?",2023-08-20 18:50:43

...but I already made one, so I'm sharing it :D 

https://resonance.distantmagic.com/

But seriously:

So many people say that PHP can't do this or that, or that it's an obsolete language, or it's just for CMS plugins. 

I wholeheartedly disagree. This is a modern asynchronous PHP framework with all the standard features (REST, GraphQL), but also Promises a unique approach to dependency injection.

My goal is to make it an Open Source infrastructure communication hub. It's easy to prototype in PHP and glue services together - especially with async features. So, you can start a product using this framework and then quickly swap or rearrange its modules. It's also highly performant.

I'm also working on special features and integrations with LLMs, so stay tuned! :)

15v9m9v,Me and my son created an online retro video games shop and a FREE CMS as a consequence,"My 17 years old son, Daniel, is an avid retro video games collector.

He has been selling and collecting his games on marketplaces.

Last year, he decided to create an online store. 
So, he started looking into commerce platforms and found it hard to get started (with Wix/Shopify/WordPress). They were also pricy for his budget (He is only a teenager).

I decided to help him, so I created a website prototype and a commerce system on top of Firebase generous Free Tier. We named the software `SHELF`

[https://www.shelf-cms.io/](https://www.shelf-cms.io/)

Our software is **FREE Forever** and his online shop [https://wush.games](https://wush.games) costs us less than 1$ a year and uses Shelf CMS.

We use:

- Firebase **Firestore** database,
- **Firebase Authentication**
- **Cloudflare R2** for images and collection storing (The most generous object storage)
- **Google Functions** for checkout and payment processing

`SHELF` is packed with many goodies:

- 5 types of discounts
- Open source and secure light backend (Google Functions)
- Image editor and Gallery
- JSON view for developers
- Product Variants
- Mobile friendly and really many more features

We also created a cool Docs site to educate people of all kinds about E-Commerce, which you can find at [https://shelf-cms.io/docs](https://shelf-cms.io/docs)

It is **FREE FOREVER**. We want to help other developers get started with e-commerce. But, we need your help with visibility and here is how you can help:

All together, it took me about 8-10 hours to complete.

I have years of Shopify dev experience and fairly confident that what I submitted was 99% aligned with their Figma design (I even had a few dev friends review my work and they also couldn't find anything to improve on). However, this morning I received the following email from them (the bolding is from me):

&#x200B;

*""We’ve taken the time to evaluate your work. However, we don’t feel you have the level of quality we’re looking for at this time. We pride ourselves on having the best of the best team when it relates to quality design, attention to detail, brand consistency, turnaround time, and customer satisfaction.*  
   
*When reviewing the test, we act as if we’re the client and evaluate your work from a client’s perspective, and* ***if we were the client for this test, we would be unhappy with the work and request a refund. This is the reason you did not pass the test****.*

* click here
* click here
* click here

* Home
* Manage subscription
* Cancel subscription
* Change subscription
* Get help

While there is some truth to that... do y'all think that maybe a big factor was also how absolutely awful the UX had gotten.

This rant is not about the content on FB (which I agree total crap). I'm looking to discuss how from a purely technical/design standpoint, the application is pretty bad. 

I went back to use it recently since a few local groups im in use it for organization. Here is what I noticed:

1. Extremely slow and unresponsive.
2. Reminds me in complexity of the AWS Console. Why are there so many different features.
   1. I currently got tabs surface to me for: Blood Donations, Climate Science, Ray Bans, Meta Quest, etc. These are not groups I follow either these are first class features.
3. Pages, Groups, Marketplace, Games, etc.  Redundant features all doing the similar crap.
4. No way to curate my feed or pin things I actually care about.
5. Searching for things is pretty much impossible
6. Feed will randomly refresh while I do find something to read that I care about.

For the past 1.5 year I've been bookmarking bunch of websites that I'll use one day as a web designer/freelancer. The problem was that they were extremely dis-organized and I couldn't ever find what I was looking for.

So I've created a Notion database with around 450+ Websites and categorized them all.

I've benefited from so many people's free work (that I don't even know the names of) so I wanted to share this database with everyone.

No forced sign-up or any bs like that required. Just the database itself.

Here's the link of the Notion Database:

I hope you find it useful :)

**P.S.**  The database was normally created as the gift / incentive for my [newsletter](https://psychologyofconversions.com) about web design, psychology and copywriting but I said fuck it and wanted to share it publicly.

At the time, I was taught that server-side rendering was undesirable (I assume because of page refreshes), and that client-side rendering led to snappy, fluid web applications with no page reloads.

Now, just a few years later, all the major frontend frameworks are moving to the server. My assumption is that client-side applications, given the power, grew too large for their own good. Is the key difference that the new server-rendered frontends still benefit from a sort of refresh-less design?

Maybe my real question is, why did client-side rendering of SPA ever become a thing if it could have always been done on the server? Why did we initially skip the server-side rendered version that all the frameworks are now adopting?",2023-12-01 17:02:09

- When he merges code that introduce bugs and you let him know, he does not fix them. When you submit a fix for his bug, he gets all defensive : « why is this needed? » « isn’t this code dead anyway? » (you tell me mister lead dev?), « why didn’t you just ignore that bug with a try/except ? » (yes, really). Last time, after I pushed a fix for a bug of his, he made what seemed to be an open minded suggestion for our coding rules that would prevent the issue from happening again. He even asked « What do you think? » … All good right? I asked him if his idea solves an edge case and described it for him: he completely ignored my question, forced push his fix and coding rule through my branch, and merged it.

# Assignment Title: Full Stack Developer - Book Selling E-commerce Platform

## Assignment Description:

In this assignment, you will be tasked with developing a Book Selling E-commerce Platform. The platform should allow users to browse and purchase books, manage their shopping cart, and track their orders. You will be using React and Tailwind/Chakra UI for the frontend, and Express or NestJS for the backend. The data should be stored in a database. The assignment will assess your ability to design and implement a full-stack application, work with frontend frameworks, handle database operations, and create REST APIs.

## Instructions:

1. Fork this project repo to your profile and clone it to work on the project.
2. Design and implement a Book Selling E-commerce Platform that provides functionality for browsing and purchasing books, managing the shopping cart, and tracking orders.
3. The application should have the following functionality:

* Book Catalog: Users should be able to browse and search for books. Each book should have attributes such as title, author, ISBN, price, and availability status.
* Shopping Cart: Users should be able to add books to their shopping cart, view the contents of the cart, update the quantities, and remove items from the cart.
* Checkout: Users should be able to proceed to checkout, provide shipping and payment information, and place an order.

1. Use Next.js/React and Tailwind/Chakra UI to build the frontend of the application. Implement user-friendly interfaces to allow users to interact with the system easily.
2. Use Express or NestJS to build the backend of the application. Implement REST APIs to handle the CRUD operations for books, shopping cart management, checkout process, and order tracking.
3. Use a database for data storage. Design the database schema to store the necessary information for books, shopping carts, and orders. Implement efficient database operations and query strategies to ensure optimal performance.
4. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the application. Users should be able to register, log in, and log out. Only authenticated users should be able to add items to the cart, proceed to checkout, and view order history.
5. Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. Follow best practices for code organization, naming conventions, and code formatting.
6. Use Git for version control and commit your code regularly to the forked public Git repository in your profile.

### Bonus Points:

* Implement input validation and error handling for the frontend and backend components.
* Implement responsive frontend UI with global state management using Redux, Recoil, or similar libraries.
* Implement pagination or filtering options for browsing books or viewing order history.
* Use of SQL database with ORMs like Prisma or TypeORM is preferred over MongoDB and Mongoose (In the case of this assignment only).
* Implement data seeding or migration scripts for setting up and populating the database.

## Submission Guidelines:

1. Fork this GitHub repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Commit your code regularly and push the changes to your forked repository.
3. Do not create a pull request; just submit your forked repository.
4. Provide a DOCS.md file with all the technologies used and how to run the program locally.
5. Once you have completed the assignment, share the repository URL with us via the submission form.

* Submission Deadline: Friday, July 7, 2023, 4:00 PM

Note: The assignment is intentionally challenging, and you are not expected to complete all the bonus tasks. Focus on delivering high-quality code and meeting the core requirements first.",2023-07-07 18:35:59

17madlo,What's with all the 'Fullstack Developer' job postings?,"As a freelancer I'm finding like 90% of the postings I see on this is what they want, they want a jack of all trades who they can overwork/underpay, like wtf? In my entire career I can count on one hand how many actual 'true' fullstack devs I have met (by this I mean they are at least an 8 or 9 outta 10 on every part of the stack, no weaknesses in their game). Instead what you'll typically see is a beautiful site but when you look in the database you have to put out your eyes and run screaming for the hills...or vice versa, the back-end is solid and secure but the front end is a minefield of javascript errors, the site renders completely differently depending on your device and browser and on some it doesn't work at all -lol

Granted it's certainly a marketable buzzword but if let's be honest, most of us have a preference for what aspects we like to work on best and the rest is usually more of a chore...and there's nothing wrong with that IMO, in fact I think its better to really excel at the things you love and have a working knowledge of the rest. I also feel like I've been really fortunate to work with folks who were masters at their trade whether that was design, animation, database architecture, devops, webservices dev or whatever so I was able to pick my path and learn from experts along the way.

Maybe we should be teaming up with our polar opposite counterpart and going after these positions as a team and just killing it? Like I know for myself personally I can bang out the backend shit in record time, creating db schema, data layer, API, security etc etc but when it comes to the front end I get stuck trying to debug some stupid cryptic scripting error and I burn hours on it pulling out my hair.

I just created a cutting-edge, private-label storefront delivery system. It is currently accessible via GitHub, and the front end is open source. My dedication and love for programming have led to the completion of this project. I am excited to share it with my community.

This application is ideal for restaurant operators trying to optimize their operations because it has features like configurable menus, online ordering, and customer management tools.
Since I've learned a lot from this community, i have also made the front-end of the project open source to show my appreciation for my fellow devs. I believe that collaboration and critiquing each other's work can help us grow and expand our skills as developers.

I love using devtools responsive mode, but always thought it should show more than one device at a time. Come on Google and Firefox I want this!

So I tinkered with a chrome extension and [made this](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mobile-view-test-responsi/clepmakjkiihmfoepipckkafafdepjne?hl=en-GB) in the meantime!  Somehow this isn't built into the browser.

Some notes:

* Everything is in sync (scrolling one device scrolls them all)
* Can rotate devices to see landscape + portrait together at once
* Working on most local servers I've tested (Vite, NextJS via create-next) but this was tricky
* So far its working on every site I've tested
* I have a few ideas for improvements, but open to suggestions!

If you enjoy this and want a Firefox version, comment: !remindme 7 days! and I'll get onto it if theres enough want :)

For now, [heres the Chromium version](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mobile-view-test-responsi/clepmakjkiihmfoepipckkafafdepjne?hl=en-GB) which will work on Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Opera

UI designer/FE dev here that went from working on freelance contract projects to working in a fully serviced in-house digital agency.

I was absolutely shocked when I saw the budgets for some of the briefs that come through the business. $6-8k for a landing page with a form, $20-30k for an entirely custom build with a CMS (not even e-comm), $1.5k monthly retainers for minor edits and management, $200 to duplicate pages and change the copy.

I mean, I get it. Huge overhead costs, paying for hardware/software, designers, developers, account managers, and then having enough to turn a profit - but how are businesses comfortable paying so much? Do they just have expiring marketing budgets, or are they paying to pass the headache baton and let someone else deal with the work?

We just had a meeting with the client prior to handing over a $30k project, where the meeting took about 30 minutes. There was a senior dev, two mid-level devs and the account manager. That meeting was billed respectively at $300 + $250 + $150.

18ntie7,Angry (entitled?) non-paying customer messaged me after hours because I suspended the website a whole extra 30 days beyond the terms of the contract.,"I'm evaluating my business practices today after a nasty exchange with a non-paying client last night around 7-8pm. I'm hoping I handled this professionally, and I'm curious how others would have reacted to this... wondering if my afterthoughts are appropriate considerations that would be in my best interest.

\--------

This client already doesn't want to pay me and has tried to weasel out of her contract. I have been documenting all interactions in fear that I'll need to go to small claims. She told me in October she wouldn't be able to afford her monthly payment for November ($100/m). I told her that, according to the contract, website service will be suspended after 30 days of nonpayment. I decided to suspend this client's website on December 6, 60 days after nonpayment, which I thought was lenient...  if you give an inch, they'll take a mile.

The client paid her past due invoices last night, so I restored her website service immediately. But the exchange wasn't cordial. She complained that I hadn't chased her down before the suspension. She complained about not having reminders or autopay and compared me to GoDaddy (her previous website was built with/hosted on their legacy website builder service). I chose not to respond to the rude comments, and instead I enabled weekly reminders for unpaid invoices. I had to configure this across the board for all customers. Now my concern is with pissing off clients who do pay on-time. Maybe I'm worrying for nothing though - those who pay on time wouldn't get annoying weekly reminders.

Regarding auto-pay, I have the ability to set clients up individually on auto-pay when they have a payment method on file. I don't do this by default because I still have to pay fees and everything when a card declines. I asked her to please let me know if she wants auto-pay configured on her account, but reminded her she already said she wasn't going to pay me. She didn't respond. Lol.

\-------

So in retrospect, I feel like I should stop being lenient or using discretion in situations like this, and hold every single client firmly to their contract. I'm looking at how flexible I am with payment options and everything, and I'm honestly debating just requiring up front payment in the future. But I'm naturally second-guessing myself because I'm a bit of a doormat, and (finally) chose to be firm for once. I have dealt with 3 clients exactly like this in 2023, all because I'm trying to offer affordable dev to new/struggling businesses with a weak online presence.",2023-12-21 18:21:37

15y26jd,Is this a fair wage or is my client trying to exploit me?,"So I'm a student and I have my own small company in web dev and graphic design.  
A client I've been working with for about 1,5 year asked me to completely rebuild his websites from multiple countries into one single .com website to cover everything.  
We had been working with an excel sheet in which I keep track of the hours I've worked and then at the end of the month I would send him in an invoice for the hours at €18 an hour.

And so I built the website for him (in Svelte 🎉) and kept track of my hours in an excel sheet.  
Now, about 4 weeks later, the website is completely done and ready for production.   
I video called the guy, and told him the site would cost him about €4100 if I would calculate it at an hourly rate of €18 an hour, which I didn't want to do as he is a very good client and a good friend of my parents as well. So I proposed him the hourly rate of €15 an hour which would be a rough equivalent of €3500 total.

The next day, he sends me an email telling me I should've been more communicative about the price, and that he is kind of shocked. He now proposed me to pay me at the hourly rate of €11 an hour (about €2500 total).  
Even though he told me he is extremely happy with the outcome of the website, he also told me that I should be glad as this job is way better than working in a bar..

Nevertheless, €11 is below minimum wage here. Even at a bar, you make at least €12,50 an hour.  
Not to mention it's a completely different job and not even remotely comparable to web dev.

I'm thinking even €18 an hour is very low for a perfectly good functioning, handwritten, custom designed beautiful website which I put a lot of effort in.  
Like I agree I should've just been more clear about the price and I should've sent him a quote and I know that's very unprofessional, but €11 an hour is laughable.. right? 

Also, I should probably add that about a year ago he had already asked me to rebrand one of his websites, to which I said that would cost him about €1600. Now, he's referring to the price of that project (we never finished it) as an estimate price we agreed upon for this project. 

Am I in the wrong here? Should I just accept his offer? What should I tell him?

EDIT: Thanks for all the great advice from everyone! As a starting freelancing web dev and student it's not always easy communicating with larger companies.
I was considering taking his offer tbh, but thanks to you I figured I shouldn't undervalue my own work so much. I'm not going below the already low price of 3,5.
Also, contracts really are essential and I guess everyone's gotta learn it in their own way. 🙏

EDIT 2: I went to have a coffee with the guy and he apologized for comparing my job to bartender work. Also he said he had no idea his offer was below minimum wage and we agreed on the 3.5k. I got him to understand he undervalues the amount of work that goes into a project like this.
He also has a large network of potential clients for me so that's nice for the future. I'm happy we managed to stick to my final offer and kept our relationship clean.

1apxsta,The 10 step process to blow $50k on simple website content updates.,"So you want to make some updates to your website but you're wondering how you can collectively spend $50k on something that should take 1 developer 1 afternoon? Well look no further because my company just finished doing that very thing and I want to give you some tips on how you can do the same!

1. First start by separating work among different teams. It's not good enough to have just a frontend and backend team, ideally you would want analytics teams, content teams, release teams, the more the better.

2. Next you have to establish a culture of rigid communication. Developers on different teams should never be able to just message each other and resolve issues quickly. No no you need to setup forms and processes for each team to contact each other, ideally you would also want to train your teams to have at least 1 full day of lead time before any request is responded to.

3. Now that the basics are there we move on to the planning phase. Yes you are just making simple website content updates but you should plan it like a full blown feature. Make sure to bring in UI/UX teams, testing teams, multiple product management teams for different aspects of the content. Ideally you should spend at least a week or two planning the changes and making sure your organization has funding to make those changes. Expect your analytics and UI/UX teams to respond to meetings with excuses like ""this is just a content change, you don't need our help!"". Don't buy those excuses as those teams provide crucial ""confirmation"" during this process. 

4. Once you have planned these content changes it's now time to actually make the changes. You will likely have a team in your organization that is responsible for the module where the content is being updated but it's important that you do not tap this team to make the change. Rather it's much better to tap another team that works on another module within the app or a team that works on another app entirely to make this change.

5. While you might have done a good bit of planning in Step 3, once the team starts working on the feature it's important to give them as little information as possible about the actual change. You don't want to bog down your team with all the relevant information! It would be better if you instead give the development team as little information as possible and then have them go through rigid communication channels that we outlined in Step 2 to get more information. It's also important that you keep some requirements back at this step as it will become very important down the road.

6. While your team is working on the content updates, if they have any questions it's important that you give them your full attention. Don't just respond to their slack message asking simple questions! It would be much better to instead schedule at least a 1hr+ meeting to cover the questions they might have. Ensure that other parties like UI/UX, analytics and product management are involved even if they are not needed, it's better to have them on the call than not.

7. Likewise if your other teams have to have a meeting, even if about something unrelated, it's crucial that you pull in the development team. While in the meeting your dev team might get distracted and will just ""listen in"" while working so it's very important that you constantly ask them semi-related or completely unrelated questions. A good practice here is to identify a question to ask and keep asking them over and over again, it's always good to have confirmation!

8. After a few days your dev team is done with their work and is ready to open a PR to merge the code in. If they are experienced at your organization then the dev team might be very familiar with the requirements to merge code. Keep your team on their toes by introducing additional requirements at the last minute. 

9. Once the code is merged in and your QA's, it's now time to introduce those requirements you kept back at Step 5, then have your QA work with the dev team to fix those issues and address the ""silent requirements"", success here is again rigid communication standards between your QA team and your dev team with lots of meetings. No quick Slack messages! That's how slackers work!

10. Once your change is finally ready for deployment, make sure that all teams are looped in and are attending the deployments meeting. You might think that including your UI/UX teams, analytics teams and other teams in this call is redundant but don't be fooled, these teams will play a key role in ""confirming"" commonly known information.

Now pat yourself on the back and give yourself a good congratulations. You have successfully engaged your entire organization and hopefully spent about $50,000 or more of developer time on a change that without this process would have taken one afternoon by one developer!",2024-02-13 16:36:54
172fvki,Roast my first paid gig,"I work solo so I wore every hat on this one. The clients had a lot of text in a very 90s website, all it was missing was rotating skulls. I just moved to a new state and this gig fell into my lap so I wanted to make a good first impression here. 

I had to rewrite everything, make graphics, create an “interactive tool” of some kind and host a backend with server side analytics and a database to hold quote requests. Mailers go out to notify staff when quote requests come in.

They insisted on this giant video file in the hero im working on getting optimized formats for.

1510230,I started an open-source project which helps beginners to get started with open source.,"I've always been fascinated by open-source tech and community and always wanted to get into it. Although, I've noticed that starting with open-source is somewhat overwhelming for many people, especially for beginners and those still new to specific tech.   


To get all of it easier, I decided to build a small open-source project which is a basic collection of blogs, documentation and project guides. It is a very simple way to get started for beginners and also for people of certain tech domains which doesn't have many open-source opportunities.  


It uses Markdown for the content and therefore helps developers across techs to foster a crucial habit of documenting their projects. All you need to make a contribution is a simple blog post, documentation, or project guide/tutorial written in markdown. And that's it.

This community has always been my go-to in any constraints that I faced throughout my web dev journey, and therefore, I would really appreciate the reviews of the project here. Also, potential contributors.

problem is: i have a regular job as developer and because of this i spend 6/8 hours day occupied by it. but as soon as i have even half an hour free i continue the work on my side project. when i'm back home from my programming work i start programming on my side project until late night, most of times i don't even have dinner because i like so much to work on it that my hunger goes away. the lastest weeks i've been programming for 14/15 hours a day, it's insane thinking about it but when i go in deep focus the time flies and i don't even realize

if i will ever publish this project is even going to eat a good chunk of my salary in server costs (it's very optimized code but still it might grow fast) and i don't get a silicon valley tech salary but a south european salary and you know what i mean. i don't even have a clear monetization plan yet. actually i don't even want to build it only to make money (would be nice if that happen ofc) but only to see people use and enjoy the product i made

So I quit and spent the last couple of months building out a GPT4-driven tool that does the work for me – idea is that your web backend APIs/routes get traced (locally only) by a library I built, and then the AI uses this understanding to make changes to the route for whatever feature you want to support or route you want to change. Here's a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjVH2sH2Q8) and you can [try it for VS Code here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Decipher.decipher-vscode). 

Example - ""Update the /checkout route's response to include a \`recent\_purchases\` count so the frontend can show how often other users have shopped here."" —> AI looks at the locally-stored traces and suggests the changes to do this in < 30s.

By tracing the code and looking at existing patterns in your code, the results are way more accurate (code changes “just work”) for node/express/django/flask etc changes than other tools I’ve tried.

I'm sure it's all a bunch of scripts underneath, but these GUIs did a good job of hiding most of that away, so you can do your website management more quickly and get back to application development. Using them took at most 10% of my day. Once in a while I have to edit some Apache server configs but again it's far from taking my majority of the time.

Either through sheer luck or complacency, I managed to keep finding jobs that just had their website operations done this way, rarely having to learn anything new. Sometimes they just hide the ops and deployment completely away.

This was my typical web dev work, well into the late 2010s. Commit and push changes to a staging server, work on the next application bug/feature. Don't even have to think about how the infra is being done.

It's becoming tougher and tougher to find a web dev role that doesn't expect you know at least something about modern CI/CD and cloud infrastructure. Whenever I take a look at it, it's all config files.

I can manage a package.json to set up NPM packages, but do I have to stare at lots of config files most of the day now? Is this more often than not the case for a modern web dev role? I'm looking through things such as Puppet and Ansible and... I'd rather focus on the application logic itself, not spend most of my time preoccupied with what seems to be more ops than app development. Are there roles that are still mostly writing application code or do I have to bite the bullet and deal with writing hundreds of config scripts like a Linux admin? I'd like to figure out how to navigate through all of this.",2023-06-30 03:24:54

Completely greenfield and I have pick of the litter of whatever languages, frameworks, and packages I want. This is going to be hosted on AWS. I am pretty used to React and the MaterialUI kit from my last job. But, since create-react-app is apparently gone now and ""server side rendering"" is the buzzword i keep seeing, I am going to have to learn at least some new things anyway, and I am pretty open to just about anything.

So far I have considered:

\* Next.js with MaterialUI - I am used to the React/MUI combo already and all I would need to learn is Next.

\* Next.js with Tailwind - Tailwind looks pretty fancy and next is totally pushing it on me in create-next-app's interactive setup, but its not a UI kit unless I want to spend money and I'd end up having to roll my own components (which I definitely do not mind).

\* Vite - I guess this is the closest to how I am used to doing things already, but I have read it has some potential issues for production?

\* Vue - Great time to learn a totally new framework right?

\* SAFE Stack - And speaking of learning new frameworks, I have been wanting to learn F# anyway, lol.

So I wanted to reach out and get some opinions: If you were building a new app in 2024, what would you pick and why? Don't feel limited to anything I've already considered: I am open to writing this in brainfuck if someone can make a good enough case for it.

11jdma4,Is anyone interested in working on small projects within a team?,"I saw that there was a lot of interest in a previous post on this sub for learning together in a group setting.

Would there be interest in something like this but specifically for building projects in a team environment?

Heres the idea: Say we have 20 people who are interested in this. We split into groups of 5, and about every week we decide on a prompt for us to work on within the groups. The prompt might be ”build a todo app” (hopefully something a bit more complex), and we would finish the project within the week.

Deadlines/project size will be 1 week or less to keep things fun and bite sized, preventing burnout. If you want to sit out for the next project, its easy to do so since its weekly

Teams will be smaller, but everyone will be working on the same prompts, so you will have a large pool of people to bounce ideas off of.

Teams will be arranged in a way that includes a variety of skill levels, so there will be opportunities to mentor and be mentored. 

Everyone is welcome, even if you are completely new to programming.

I will probably need help with management to some extent, and I will definitely need team leaders who are active and willing to guide others.

1ailocq,My experience with Figma Dev Mode as a front-end developer,"**TLDR:** Even if you pay for the Professional plan for yourself, you won't be able to use the Figma Dev Mode. To get a similar experience for free, export a Figma file and import it in Pixso, Penpot, or any other tool.

**Full Story:** I'm a front-end developer working with multiple clients. In most cases, I work with designs in Figma.

It was a pretty convenient tool till Figma decided to move the Inspect tab under Dev Mode some time ago. It was free till the beginning of February.

I don't mind paying for the tools I use, so yesterday, I signed up for the Professional plan to access Dev Mode:

[Dev Mode is advertised as a part of the Professional plan](https://preview.redd.it/zimi8856ujgc1.png?width=1214&format=png&auto=webp&s=21d93ff1df4506dfc665346303bf370f6d4adcc4)

Then I've opened a design and tried to enable the Dev Mode, but something went wrong:

[You can't access Dev Mode without being a member of a team](https://preview.redd.it/qx4al02gujgc1.png?width=352&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f375ff54a996d3a0992bbf59e4179d038165382)

Okay. So, I asked the designer to invite me as a viewer to a project. I got the different error:

[Request Dev Mode Access](https://preview.redd.it/xdtpdboyvjgc1.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5363a8e688baff40ca42c17718abdb32de48bd9)

If a designer upgrades my account, his team will be charged another $15/month for an additional seat to give me access toDev Mode.

That is called a scam. I have already paid for a feature, but I can't use it.

The only workaround is to export the Figma file and import it under my team in Figma. In this case, I will be able to use Dev Mode, but all the collaboration tools will be missing. Also, I have to manually reimport the updated design, if there are some changes made.

Technically, I can do the same with alternative services like Pixso, where I can simply import the Figma design and get a similar experience.

The idea behind the Dev Mode is simple: Figma decided to move some developer-related features on the Inspect tab to the Dev Mode, then charge companies not only for designer seats but for developers as well.

I do not mind paying for a feature I used to do my work. $15/mo is an acceptable price, but ultimately, I can't use it. My clients still have to pay $15/mo for each team I work with.

In terms of the Figma Dev Mode by itself, it may be useful in some cases, but the built-in code generation is a garbage. Sometimes it works, but in most cases it causes more confusion.

So do not make my mistake. It's not worth paying for Figma if you are a developer.",2024-02-04 11:14:23

(READ EDIT FIRST BEFORE YOU TRY IT)

Try it out! -> [Dear Stranger](https://dear-stranger.vercel.app/)

I built a web app on NextJS and I'm super proud to share it with you all! It's my first ever web app so feedback will be greatly appreciated.

**What is Dear Stranger?**

Dear Stranger is about letting people send anonymous letters to be answered by absolutely anyone in the world! You can use it to share an idea, tell a joke, confess secrets, or really whatever it is you want to say. (As long as it's not offensive)

**Why was it made?**

I made this app because I wanted to get into web development, and I had this website idea for quite a while. I came up with the idea of Dear Stranger after I realized that there's really no place you can dump some idea and get a response about it. Technically you could just message random people on any social media platform, but no one would reply, and they can't reply anonymously. Thus, Dear Stranger was born.

**How to use it?**

To write letters, just log in and start typing. To respond to letters, the same. Simple as that.You can optionally select a country to let those who read your letters / responses to know where you are from! When your letter recieves a response, you will recieve an email to let you know.

**How was it built?**

The web app is hosted on Vercel and is built with NextJS, a React framework. It uses PandaCSS as the CSS component framework. For the backend, it uses the Prisma ORM to connect and send requests to an AWS RDS Database running PostgreSQL. It also uses NextAuth to handle User Authentication and nodemailer to send emails.

EDIT:

I got some comments pointing out it as not truly anonymous, and I agree and I'm sorry for not being clear about it as I didn't realize the implications of having a sign in.

You do have to log in because I was afraid of bot spam and malicious users, and I wanted a way to keep track of writers and responders. The only ones who can see the letters is just me, so when you are writing a letter, do keep that in mind moving forward. If you are still uncomfortable with that, then I understand.

If you have any idea on how you could better implement this anonymous messaging system, please do share with me!

EDIT 2:

u/___Nazgul has shared a better way of implementing ""shadow users"" to make it truly anonymous while preventing spam. So I thought I should give them a mention as thanks. Will work on this feature and will repost again once it's TRULY anonymous :D

EDIT 3:

My post has blown up way more than I could've imagined, and thanks to the tremendous amount of feedback, I've managed to add some features since I've posted this:

\- A post/response limit (5 letters/responses an hour)

\- UI fixes particularly in mobile

Thanks again to those who support my app. It's given me a lot more motivation to work on it!

Here are the features I will be working on to improve my app:

\- A better way to handle users (via anonymous users with option to sign in)

\- A filter to automatically remove spam/abusive content

If you'd like to help out, feel free to contact me, and my code is open-source, so feel free to check it out and contribute!

15fx1z7,Anyone else stuck as the only Web dev in their team ?,"This is more a rant if anything else. Or maybe a desperate cry for help on how to deal with it to improve the situatuon a bit. 

I'm the only Web dev in my team, and also the only one in the company. While I do enjoy my work on most days, being the only Web dev has it's downsides and it can be quite stressful. Here's a few problems I run into on a daily basis:

- I don't have anyone to bounce off ideas or talk about suggestions how to implement. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of growth having nobody to talk with.

- Speed over quality. I give an estimate, but in the end the estimates I give and the ones my project manager communicates with the rest of the teams and members are not the same.

- Speed again, I often find myself having to quickly finish rather than taking my time. As a result lots of visual bugs from lack of time for proper testing.


- New features are always prioritised. Refactoring tasks, infrastructure, testing, documentation etc is always the least important. I hardly have time to touch these things so code quality slowly degrades over time.


- Everything has high priority syndrome. Let anything sit in the backlog for too long. Time to hire a contractor! Forget getting a full-time employee, let's get an expensive contractor for the next 3-6months to help out paid at least twice the salary of a full-time employee instead of just hiring a new engineer. 


- If I don't know how to do something, nobody else knows how to do it. I can't ask anyone if they have an idea how to implement it.


- Lack of time to learn new things. Same as above, but not exactly. Let's say I get a design that I am not quite sure how to reproduce. Most often instead of learning how to do it I end up having to scrap that part of the design or simplify it to get done with the task. 

I'm just so tired of being alone and not having anyone to exchange ideas with. I don't even get anyone to do my code reviews cause that means bothering server side engineers that are busy with completely different projects.",2023-08-02 03:03:42

I was so inconsistent for so long, one day I study for 3 hours, then take a week break, go on a streak of studying 1-2 hours most days for a couple weeks, then take a month break. It wasn't good, add ADHD into the equation & it was genuinely painful to study.

I was gradually getting more consistent, but as of almost 2 months now, I reached a big tipping point. Where things finally clicked a little more & it wasn't horrible to study. Now it's either neutral or fun and I have been coding every day. More importantly posting on GitHub the vast majority of days. 

That's insane to me because I always dreamed of doing that, but it was just too much for me at first. Now I can study while having actual fun.

I feel like I am on track & I can actually land a job in the next coming months when I finish up key personal/portfolio projects (full stack).

116opqo,FTC has proposed banning non-compete agreements. PLEASE go make a public comment supporting this for your own good.,"Short summary:

The FTC has proposed a rule to ban non-competes, and retroactively invalidate old ones.

For those not familiar, many tech companies outside of California force employees to sign horrible non-competes that prevent you from getting other jobs related to that. These are downright evil.

Why?

1. They can be super broad, capturing massive industries or technologies

2. They can include ""lists of competitors that we can add to at any time""

3. They apply to nearly everyone, not just those with sensitive information

4. They are absolute bullshit. These contracts essentially would prevent you from working at companies with the exact skillset you grew.

If you were laid off right now, and couldn't get a new job because of this? How stuck would you be?

Please, please, please go make a public comment here before the FTC stops taking comments. Discuss how it restricts competition.

1affaoj,Parted ways with hired Indian dev shop - they want to launch my app independently,"Hi there,

Long story short; I fell victim to a sweatshop that assigned me two juniors who produced very unreliable code and dragged the project to 2.5 years without delivering a functioning beta version. Due to the lack of progress and cumbersome collaboration efforts, I have told them that I am ceasing the project and say good bye. The owner of the dev shop didn’t want to accept any blame and even went so far to say that he will launch this project independently. As the project is close to my heart, I am not willing to let this happen.

Does any of you have experience with this or have any advice how to handle the situation? I‘m not in a financial position to legally go after them but I definitely need to take some sort of action.

I suspect it's got something to do with them wanting to control how you use the site, but that's garbage. This can't be a best practice at this point. What's the rationale behind this trend?

11ko5k5,My designers are driving me insane,"I'm a frontend web dev and been working at this same agency for a few years with more or less the same groups of people. We're very ""design-first"", with about 8x more designers than developers. We primarily work on client emails, websites, and landing pages. What I feel is a major hurdle for me and my team is how painful our design review process is and how little flexibility the designers have.

When we send our work to design to review, we're good on all of our spacing fonts, and line-heights being exact. Not a biggie. However, we get feedback for how specific pieces of text break on very specific viewports, and so we need to put max-widths on very specific elements, or wrap multiple words at the end of a paragraph/headline to keep them from breaking from each other, also within a small range of screen sizes.  Even social icons need to be adjusted one a per-icon basis in different locations because they don't like how something like the top of one icon ends in a different place than another. We're talking pretty consistent feedback of 1-5px on various items here.

The design team has somewhat come around to accessible color contrast for text/backgrounds, but other than that, accessibility and anything with dark mode is completely ignored because it doesn't look as good. My concerns are usually met with things like ""Who even uses dark mode?"" or a complete dismissal for accessible components like buttons with large enough click/tap targets, or underlining text if they feel ""it doesn't look as good"" then.

They always design for 3 screen sizes, but all these ad-hoc tweaks once they see some content in action adds a ridiculous amount of time and effort to things that we (devs) think need to be let go and not worth it and no person is ever going to notice. I lead development at this agency, but when I bring up these concerns, they're dismissed because making the design and text breaks perfect is always the priority.

Does anyone else have to deal with designers that go \*beyond\* pixel perfect or am I being too lax on my end? Any concerns that my team is being held back by not getting to fully embrace accessibility and dark mode (particularly on emails) in our daily work?",2023-03-07 03:46:31

15vpear,Why do people seem to prefer Chrome's devtools over Firefox's?,"Hi, I'm pretty new to web development, and probably have very limited knowledge compared to most of you.

For context: I am a daily Firefox user, and the developer of the CustomTube extension, which mostly deals with CSS.

I've seen people say that Chrome's devtools are ""the one thing that Chrome has over Firefox"", and that they can't fully switch to Firefox because of it. I just can't comprehend that. From my perspective, Chrome's devtools are extremely frustrating to use, to the point where I avoid using them whenever possible, and try to do 100% of my development on Firefox.

\-----

I'll just share my reasoning here.

1: You can't edit injected rules in Chrome.

I realize this may be an extension exclusive issue, but it's extremely annoying nonetheless. Here is a rule from CustomTube in Firefox devtools:

[Firefox devtools](https://preview.redd.it/lrhsc22f34jb1.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bacfcf6343618462f185ff98e1683d1d175b1c8)

Notice how on the top right, it tells me the file name and line where the rule is located. I can click on that and it will open the file in the Style Editor.

However more importantly, it lets me edit the selector and declarations, as well as add new declarations, \*\*all from the element inspector itself\*\*. See, a big part of my development process is editing the existing rules in the inspector, and then copy and pasting the edited rule into the file itself.

Now let's take a look at that same rule in Chrome devtools:

[Chrome devtools](https://preview.redd.it/vmkkxi9c44jb1.jpg?width=456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=236b1355f87ed6c4ed89bdc378b101a3d4cc9cca)

Notice how it no longer tells me which file the rule originated from nor the line it is on, instead saying an unhelpful ""injected stylesheet"".

But more importantly, the selector and declarations are in \*italics\*, and therefore cannot be edited for... some reason. This completely screws up my development process and adds unnecessary steps to get the same effect I can easily get in Firefox.

2: Autocomplete is worse in Chrome.

This one is much more minor, but it still annoys me. In Firefox, when I type ""!"", it automatically suggests ""!important"", which is exactly what I'm looking for. But in Chrome, you have to type ""!i"" for it to suggest ""!important"", which messes me up every single time. I know it's not the biggest deal, but what other CSS thing starts with ""!""? Nothing! So why not \*always\* suggest it, like Firefox? It's a small QoL thing that goes a long way.

3: It feels slower on Chrome.

I mean obviously Firefox is faster and smoother than Chrome in general, but this seems especially true in devtools. Could just be my machine though.

\------

That ended up being pretty long. Like I said, I'm new to web development, and I acknowledge that you guys probably know \*\*WAY\*\* more than I do (maybe I sound like the most misinformed freak right now, who knows lol). Just in case it came off as hostile (which I didn't intend), I don't mean for this post to be an attack on anyone or anything, I was just sharing my viewpoint to show that I'm at least \*somewhat\* informed on this.

I'd just like to know why many people prefer Chrome devtools despite these annoyances. Perhaps Chrome devtools only suck for CSS? But all I can do is guess. I genuinely don't understand, so if someone could explain, that would be great.

Edit: Or if you think I'm wrong about the points I brought up being bad things, feel free to explain. I'm open to being proven wrong.",2023-08-19 19:36:58

15fgwq5,Why are we using token-based authentication over cookies?,"For years I have been doing embedded development and have always had an interest in learning more about the web. So recently I took to learning (and building) a modern web architecture - including the backend elements. Everything I have learned broadly makes sense to me - except *authentication*.

What I've found is that common architectures use API *tokens* post-auth. So users authenticate with the backend and are given what is commonly referred to as *access* tokens (and possibly *refresh* tokens alongside it). The *access* token is then expected to be present in all future web requests often in a header like so:

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

But *why*? Why make your frontends more complex by requiring them to manage token persistence? Not requiring the user to login on each visit is the expected UX these days. But you get that ***implicitly*** with cookies, so I don't understand the need for API tokens at all.

*\*\* And if the API is expected to be used with something other than a browser (e.g. some python code or whatnot) the semantics do not really change all that much. Perhaps even in this scenario the \`Authorization\` header makes sense .. but supporting this in the backend is trivial. My argument is mostly about the added complexity to a frontend.*

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The scenarios are:

**For token-based auth:**

1. User visits webpage
2. Frontend queries localStorage for tokens to determine is user is authenticated
3. In frontend: if authenticated goto 7 else render login form
4. User authenticates with backend
5. Backend sends API token in body of response
6. Frontend stores token in e.g. localStorage (step 2 now will succeed and skip re-auth)
7. Frontend renders authenticated pages
8. For each subsequent request frontend explicitly sets \`Authorization\` header with token

**For cookie-based auth:**

1. User visits webpage
2. Frontend queries e.g. /api/users/whoami on first render (browser sends any cookies present)
3. Backend reads/validates cookies and responds with some body content indicating auth (or not)
4. In frontend: if authenticated goto 8 else render login form
5. User authenticates with backend
6. Backend sets auth cookie and responds with success message
7. Browser implicitly retains cookie  (step 2 now will succeed and skip re-auth)
8. Frontend renders authenticated pages
9. For each subsequent request frontend does nothing (cookies are implicitly sent by browser)

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How I see their securities stack up:

**Token-based:**

* XSS can read localStorage and exfiltrate the token (there are ways to mitigate this)
* XSS can just use its execution to make authenticated API requests
* No cookies, no CSRF

**Cookie-based**

* XSS can just use its execution to make authenticated API requests
* Has cookies, but (should be) using \`HttpOnly\`/\`Samesite\`/\`Secure\` mitigates CRSF

Not to mention with cookie-based auth your frontend can be simpler by offloading auth management to the backend, effectively; the ""on first render"" request instructs the frontend on if it should attempt to render authenticate pages or just redirect to the login page (due to bad/corrupted/expired credentials). Whereas with the token-based approach you have added XSS attack surface *and* are necessarily adding more complexity to your frontend.

If you opt to use something like request interceptors, or web workers to isolate access to your token by retaining it in-memory (and so XSS cannot explicitly *read* it out for exfiltration) then the token-based approach improves to be roughy equivalent with the cookie-based auth anyway (i.e. the first bullet does not apply).

**The** ***only*** **downside I see to cookie-based auth as described above is that your frontend is required to make a web request on first render** to e.g. /api/users/whoami in order to determine its user data and whether or not the backend has validated the authenticated session. It is conceivable that at-scale these extra web requests may be undesirable.

Again, I am quite new to web development but this is something that stuck out to me during my studies. I have no issue being wrong here - but I simply do to understand the benefit of token-based authentication. Before \`HttpOnly\` and \`SameSite\` were a thing, and use of cookies was very insecure, I do understand the motivation. But given modern mitigations I just don't quite see the intent.",2023-08-01 16:10:30
13ai2h4,I f*cked up my interview,"Im a freelance web developer for 3 years and i consider myself a junior-mid developer (I have at least deployed 5 projects). i have a recent interview for a senior role where i botched it up, and felt really down but it was also eye opening for how much knowledge i have yet to learn and how much inept i am in communication.

So the question was, in a messy codebase that even changing some parts of it will affect other parts of the codebase how would you go and fix it.

I said i would start by normalizing the database taking out fields from tables that are independent from it and turning them into new tables, i would also make sure that parts of the codebase should not be tightly coupled with each other, i could divide parts that are common and put them in another maybe helper function or so. (this is how i remember it)

At that time i was so tense so i was stuttering and even pausing for a long time with answering. So i would like to know from the seniors here how would you go answering the question? Thanks!  


  
Edit: Wow this blew up, thank you for all the answers you gave. Its hard/impossible learning these kind of things without a mentor so it is nice to see the subreddit helping me out. Seriously thank you. Also just to clarify im actually looking for a junior role but one of the hiring agency tried me for a client that is looking for a senior role. i have no idea what seniors (even juniors) do but i have to know what kind of question they ask seniors so yeah i went with it and yeah its a stab in the heart but it is what it is i have to know haha.",2023-05-07 08:57:09
119114t,Buy a good monitor if you care about your eyes!,"Hi everyone!

Recently, my main 2k 24inch Iiyama monitor started behaving weird so I sent it ro guarantee for repairs. I love this monitor. Very crips image, high resolution, easy on the eyes, many settings..

While that is being repaired I had to use my old 1080p LG 34 inch( I know that's crazy) monitor. Because of the low resolution and big size of this monitor, you can literally see the pixels from a normal use distance. After using it for a day, my eyes were hurting. They were red and watering constantly.

I realized the importance of a good monitor today after putting these two monitors side by side and comparing them.

So this is a reminder to spend a bit more money when you buy a monitor. Especially if you look at a screen for a long time which we all almost always do.

Also turn on blue light filter, lower the brightness. Don't make the text too small and use eye drops. Get up every hour and stay hydrated.

Would you all mind sharing your tips for developer health? I'd really like to get better.

Thanks!",2023-02-22 14:34:37

16n9f4e,How do you learn even most of AWS? It feels like its own professional career.,"The entire product line is huge and staggering it feels like adding a second career on top of my career where I have to keep up with fundamentals and programming frameworks. Traditionally I just push code to staging and test/debug with my local machine and don't have to think at all about how it's being hosted or managed on the cloud. Also, I've been generally against vendor lock-in with learning a company's products but like 90% of web jobs today require some knowledge of these cloud products.

I'm unemployed, so I'll have to learn and practice with AWS outside the context of real-world professional use. How do I decide what problems to solve with AWS without it feeling overkill?

AWS is like a hundred products so I guess it's impossible to be great at all of them... so if as a web dev which AWS products should I ""main""? I guess front-end devs have to main Amplify and Tailwind and back-end devs should main Lambda and API Gateway, with the occasional side of Route 53.

As a web dev/programmer I dread the thought of losing work.  I have rarely lost even an hour's work in decades because I save obsessively.  That applies to git too.

As I reach working updates, I commit and push to the origin repo.  I don't usually provide great messages because why bother articulating every minute change of a stream of commits, many of which may be unrelated.  At times I groom code performing a sundry of different improvements.  

I don't want to have to remember my local repo is out of whack with the origin repo.  Plus, saving feels like flushing the mental stack and relieves the cognitive load.

It's like reaching the point where you realize you're only going forward from here.  Rolling things back to a prior state happens but in practice it's rare.  More times than not, once begun, I carry forward with some improvement.

I know these practices would be considered atrocious in an public/shared open source repo, but they have never given me grief as an independent maintainer of code for my team (or personal projects).

Are you an obsessive committer?  Do you still bother trying to explain each tiny tweak?

1abthsp,Bombed an interview yesterday that left me questioning myself,"I'm a self taught web developer with 6+ years in the industry from your typical stuff like wordpress, shopify, and static sites to full stack web applications. I've always struggled with imposter syndrome and really have only interviewed for the job I've had the last 2 years. The 4 years prior I worked at a consultancy and moved from their B2B EDI division to working on the web app we sold after many instances of asking my division lead to give me a chance. I did well and during covid our group had less business so I assisted elsewhere in the company working for multiple clients and eventually got placed on numerous projects with stacks I didn't know, I taught myself on the MERN stack and I was getting placed on projects using things like PHP, C#, [ASP.net](https://ASP.net), and Python as well as other web technologies I had no prior experience with. I figured this was more a test to see if I could cut it as I didn't have the best relationship with the division lead I previously mentioned and assumed they were hoping I'd drop the ball. Surprising myself, I somehow managed to get comfortable with every client project they tossed my way and while I wouldn't apply for certain positions based on minimal experience with some of the languages I had to learn on the fly, I never received a client complaint, my direct report had nothing but good things to say, and I never gave the division lead an opportunity to get rid of me.  


I left the toxic work environment and got the job I have now and was feeling pretty confident in my skills albeit knowing I had gaps in knowledge due to not having a traditional education in Computer Science. Up until this latest interview, I thought I did fairly well for myself.  


Yesterday, I interviewed at a larger company close to FAANG for a senior role that, on paper, I had everything they were looking for and have in industry experience for their specific type of business.  


The call wasn't an assessment or leet code, just a conversation with a team lead and some technical questions. I came ill prepared due to scheduling too early and getting stuck with an urgent ticket at my current place of work.. lesson learned for myself, give myself plenty of time to study, review and prep. That wasn't the issue though, the issue is some of the questions that were asked are what I would consider core knowledge, I'm sure any comp sci grad would know.  


One question was to explain the difference between ""javascript inheritance and class inheritance"". I've unfortunately not delved into the specifics like this and no matter how hard I search I can't find any results for ""javascript inheritance"", my best guess is the interview meant prototypal inheritance, regardless I didn't have an answer.  


Another question was when you click a DOM element, what happens within the browser/javascript?  


I explained click events and a scenario where you'd have an event handler for click events but I got the feeling from the interviewers demeanor that my answer didn't dive deep enough, should I have spoken to the sequence of events within the call stack step by step? I've never looked too deeply into the inner workings of something like a click event, i just know how it works (as far as I explained) and how to handle it for my purposes, nothing more ""under the hood"" than that.

At one point I even openly apologize for not having an answer/adequate answer, re-iterated I was self taught and had an understanding I had gaps in knowledge and strive to correct/fill those gaps when approached, pointed to my prior experience of having to hit the ground running at my former consultancy job. I *knew* that none of that mattered. I fumbled on questions that I would assume everyone in industry (thats interviewing at least) should have the answers too, or at least thats how it felt to me. So I've been in a slump all day, even if I look back at all my prior work, client feedback, and peer reviews, I keep seeing the very visible confusion, disbelief and/or disappointment on the interviewers face and it leaves me questioning everything. 

What else do I not know?

Is the little imposter syndrome voice in the back of my head right?

Do I truly deserve to be where I am?  


I hate feeling like this and it's left me in a funk all day not knowing what else I'm potentially lacking and where to start learning/reviewing so that I can HOPE this never happens again.

15spqt0,"I lost out on a job, and I'm ok with it.","Short background.

I taught myself to code during lockdown, no real direction, I just learnt python as a language because I've always been interested in programming, and it seemed I'd never get this much free time again.

Using what I had taught myself I developed some scripts, learnt to build executables to automate parts of my Job that would otherwise take ""forever"". I repeatedly demonstrated what I had done to management who pretty much went, "" yeah that's great... anyway, this isn't your job"". Kept getting strung along about being promoted for my efforts until I met some people from another team within the business who liked what I was doing and offered me a job in there team.

I was over the moon, I felt like I'd done it, broken into tech. I got work from home days, flexible hours a pay rise! but there were downsides.

The team I had moved into had this internal tool for booking and recording utilization times of the operations staff, the person who built this tool left within 6 weeks of me joining, and I was left alone to figure this stuff out.

I work well under pressure, but I had to learn the code base with minimal to zero documentation on how it all worked, I learnt JS, jQuery, Django, Basic GCP and how to use a UNIX terminal, within about 2 months. I had effectively become a full stack developer with no experience apart from the projects I'd done before that got me noticed by the team.

Moving forward.

The person who built the tool, the one who left, his position became available to apply for, I was encouraged to apply, and I did. I completed the technical challenge and felt I did ok in the other interviews, but I didn't get it. They hired an external applicant who has more experience than me, with a heavy focus on front end development, and I'm ok with that.

My manager told me that it wasn't my technical skills that let me down, it was my personal interview. In a feedback session he said he didn't understand why I didn't mentioned this experience or this project that I worked on, and to be honest, I don't know why I didn't either. I put it down to be being put in the deep end for the last 4 months, and to be honest, I'm already burnt out and probably wasn't on my A game the day of the interview.

Which is why I'm glad for the new hire, it means we can spread the workload more evenly, not everything will be on me, with the new hires focus on front end development, I now finally have a direction to go in, which will be backend development, and over the last 4 months, this has been the aspect I've actually loved about the job. Additionally, with someone who has experience joining, I may finally have someone to learn from that isn't a book or a YouTube video.

I'm not really posting this as a question of how to deal with failure, and I'm posting this as a soundboard to work my own feelings, insecurities and imposter syndrome out. I actually feel like failing this time might work out for the best in the long run, and has given me direction for the rest of my career, (possibly a bit far sighted lol)

1ake0hd,[Rant] Javascript dependency hell is worse than I ever imagined...,"I have a large project, everything works fine until you need to introduce some minor change, some minor update; then your entire job consists of babysitting dependencies that decided to break.

Minor versions don't cause.... step back, minor versions break everything just as often as major versions and the worst is that you aren't even aware what broke.

Some dependencies break when you update ubuntu, or when you run it on another machine; minor update makes it work on windows, installing it causes dozens of other dependencies to break.

I dust some ancient javascript code that ran jquery and it still works, I dust some C++ old code I wrote as a teenager and it still compiles; I take a 2 year old modern project and I get segmentation fault core dumped while doing npm install and my browser has a mini-stroke and a gazillion warnings.

And you think just don't update anything, well not only that isn't how you should go about things, you sure not going to patch that security vulnerability?... (which probably only exists because the library you installed to pad text to the left has also a couple of miners) but also, they still break on their own; if you just dare to update the operating system, which isn't supposed to be ""portable"", what the hell?... I have had to drop around a hundred of dependencies from the black hole that node\_modules is and make my own custom solution, and the system is now faster and more reliable, but it seems that no matter what I do, the dependency tree is still insane.

Here's some advice for every junior out there, when you go implement your own solution and some nerd goes and tell you ""duh, you so dumb why reinvent the wheel"", don't listen to them; that code will most likely be simpler and have less to no dependencies and do exactly what you need it to do; don't make the same mistake I did, every single library I installed to do something that I could've done myself has backfired, every single one of them, no exceptions. The closer to the basics you are the better, otherwise node\_modules will suck you in, your life, hopes and dreams.

18cnxs0,Why does every major website seem to implement infinite scroll?,"I'm saying this in lieu of the recent reddit redesign for mobile web, where there are a bunch of smaller problems, but by far the biggest issue is infinite scroll. With pages, older posts are loaded in and newer posts are no longer loaded. With infinite scroll, everything is loaded at once, which causes anything past the first 30 posts to be practically unviewable due to lag. This is especially a problem on less powerful devices such as mobile devices, and the Reddit developers seemed to realize this up until  the last month or two.

It's not just reddit that does this. Linkedin, Discord, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google, and Youtube all have infinite scroll, and for the life of me I have no idea why since its flaws are very apparent when you try to scroll past anything more than the first few results.

I want to genuinely ask why so many of these tech companies force such a banal way of navigating when it clearly has flaws.

11ljoaa,Any long-term self employed web devs getting jaded?,"I've been a professional web developer since 1999. Went out on my own in 2008 and have been building custom websites since then. Always focused on small to medium customers to spread risk.

I've noticed the last 3-4 years the industry is getting more and more... I don't know... scummy? I used to go to meetings and people would be excited, respect your input and appreciate your technical knowledge. Now days I get the impression that people feel like I'm trying to screw them over and they often question my technical responses even though they have no knowledge themselves.

The popularity of things like wordpress and services like Wix also means I'm competing with other ""web designers"" that install a free theme, tweak the logo/colours and send the bill. Whereas I work with the customer to get the requirements, sub-contract a designer then build the signed off design from scratch in a custom CMS.

I've also found recently that people will call me, tell me they don't want to spend that much for my services but then ask me to fix their free Squarespace site because they don't know how and the squarespace support is unresponsive. And I'm expected to do this for free.

It also seems like much more is expected, like marketing (even though I state we don't do marketing unless requested - due to the already low profit) and such. Or asking why they aren't #1 in Google for X keywords - 15 mins after going live with a brand new website.

Or the constant phones calls saying ""just a quick question, can you remind me how to...""... which translated means: ""I don't want to learn, I want you to do it right now to 'show me' and I don't want to be charged because it's just a question."".

Ok, that came out as more of a rant, but has anyone else been in the industry as a one-man band for a while and find it harder work nowadays? Or is it like this everywhere due to Covid and stuff. I have a few designer mates who also mention that their web design jobs have really dropped off, and the web design customers are much harder work than in previous years. Yet their other design work as taken off.

Sort of wondering if it's an industry-wide thing, or just me.

17s6e0h,Tailwind.,"I've been a dev for nearly 7 years, and working with React for a little over 4 years. 

Since adopting the React workspace I've moved from CSS modules over to Styled-components and I'll be honest, I love it so damn much - I've reached for it with every project over the past 2/3 years and it's been so much fun to use.

Recently, however, I've been looking at job postings as I'm considering moving back onto the payroll, and Tailwind is mentioned pretty frequently.

I've looked into Tailwind a few times over the past couple of years but I'm always put off by the reels of inline util classes. Just this afternoon, I fired up a Supabase demo that has Tailwind as a dependency and even with the barebones app set up I felt sick seeing stuff like this:

`className=""absolute left-8 top-8 py-2 px-4 rounded-md no-underline text-foreground bg-btn-background hover:bg-btn-background-hover flex items-center group text-sm""`

I'm not trying to throw shade at Tailwind here, but the above seems messy to me. Has anyone out there made the leap and if so, how do you deal with the visual mayhem that appears to come with it?

Edit: 

For clarity, I'm just trying to understand how it can benefit my workflow. I know standard old CSS better than I know myself, any and all tools have pros and cons, I was just struggling to see the pros of Tailwind on face value.

Thanks to all who shared their experiences and disclosed the positives and negatives they've discovered while using it. 

I'm going to build a little CRM as a side project with TW and see how I get on. I love styled components and it's been the solution for me for a long time but it's good to stay open to new tools.",2023-11-10 15:28:28

1apht60,Loving Laravel after being a MERN developer,"After doing web development with Node/React for many years, going back to Laraval/Blade has made me realize that following 

- Modern PHP (v8.1+) is a very nice language to work with. Paired with PHPDocs and PHPStan it pretty much rivals Typescript in type-safety.

- My development velocity with Laravel is far greater than what I had with NodeJS. Blade with components / Livewire is fully integrated into the framework with leads to tight backend-to-frontend code integration without needing any boilerplate code.

- Unnecessary complexity kills projects. Laravel with blade components/ Livewire minimizes complexity and us more than sufficient for most web applications. The PHP toolchain is also much simpler than the mess which is Javascript toolchains.

- The hosting costs can be way down. Where NodeJS applications are almost exclusively hosted on expensive cloud infrastructure, start-ups can save a lot of server costs by deploying of cheap VPS / shared hosting (at least until their application gains traction)

In summary, PHP / Laravel is still a solid / pragmatic option and I wish more people would choose it for new projects. It is truly a joy to work with.",2024-02-13 02:02:29

Seems crazy to think of all the changes to the web dev field. When I started you had one job, Webmaster, and you did the lot, from speccing the kit, to building the stack, to organising the domain as well as all the development (including art). Today you can specialise in the most niche sectors of IT.

What's the point of this post? Nothing really. I'm sure there are others out there with similar stories, but I just realised I was on a 30 year anniversary (although technically it would be sometime mid October for the exact date) and as nobody around me IRL would grasp the enormity of change that's happened, I thought I'd drop my comments onto Reddit.

I have a good job that pays well and I'm extremely grateful and proud of what I've achieved with my life especially without any formal education in the field. However, lately I've been feeling a bit stagnant. I don't care as much about my day job meaning I usually do the bare minimum to fulfill the Jira story requirements and have very little motivation to go beyond. Don't get me wrong - I don't cut corners and always ship decent code and I think my bosses are quite happy with my work (I got multiple raises in the past 2 years, recognitions in teams channels etc.). But I can't shake this feeling of slight disinterest in the project. This carries over to my personal life - I have no side projects, no real motivation to start any and I prefer spending time playing football and hanging with my wife and dog. I love programming, love reading about programming and also talking (this especially ) about it with my friends from the industry but I don't really live and breathe code. It makes me quite sad because I really want to continue improving at my craft but I just....prefer doing other things more in my free time. I guess I need to come to terms that I will never be a 10x developer. I thought about changing jobs but with a mortgage and a wife it feels quite risky as the current one pays quite well and is pretty chill. I don't know...I make a lot more money then most of my friends and should be over the moon but somehow I feel... unfulfilled. So the question - does this just happen ? Or should I just switch jobs? I don't know...I don't even know if this is on topic. I drank 3 glasses of wine and felt the need to pour my heart out.

- open the property to view the analytics like normal, then at the bottom left click on the grey cog for settings and open your admin settings

- then under ""Data collection and modification"" click on ""Data Streams""

- click on the stream for your client

- Under ""enhanced measurement"" you see the little pill tags for everything youre measuring.  To the right is a grey cog for settings. Click on your stream settings. A sidebar will pop up. These are all the streams you are collecting data from. You dont actually need them all.

- Toggle off the outbound clicks, site search, video engagement, and file downloads. You dont need to collect that data since you dont have that data. Then hit save.


Google analytics will now not take as much resourses to load because its loading like 50% less scripts to monitor things you dont have on your site.  Place your analytics tag at the bototm of your page right above the closing body tag.

1270brj,Why does reddit ship thousand lines of internal css in its html,"When visiting e.g. a subreddit page on reddit the browser loads the html-document, which consists of 90% CSS-code, which are way over a thousand lines of CSS.

When i learned to write webpages the use of internal & inline CSS was discouraged for obvious reasons like effects on caching and so on. With today's frameworks there even is CSS compilation and automatic cache busting. So what is the point / advantage / reason for reddit doing this?

&#x200B;

Example:

view-source:https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/

Result:

my browser downloads a compressed but non-cacheable, over 1mb of size (uncompressed) html page that has 90% internal CSS in it.


Update:

I understand that it's meant as a Single-Page-Application. But opening a new tab of reddit or refreshing the tab each time makes u load that 1mb of css over and over again while it wouldn't have to.

If the html is actually static, contains the web-app and all content is getting dynamically loaded then why do response-headers indicate that my browser should not cache the html? (no e-tag, must-revalidate and max-age 0)

If its a SEO-thing than it 1) either means SEO is broken or 2) there is no good way of specifying prior / important CSS

I'm not referring to Skeleton components that fade into view after content is done loading. Those are legit. I'm only talking shit about the transitions tied to scroll position. You know, when new elements get scrolled into view, they quickly transitions from \`opacity: 0\` to visible. Sometimes there's a slight horizontal or vertical shift as well. If there are multiple elements in a row, sometimes it's staggered by a fraction of a second. Do these have a name?

I can definitely see why someone might think they're nice. I remember briefly thinking they were cool , but now they just scream WordPress template. 

I'm also pretty hesitant of any motion that's not serving a specific purpose or telling a specific story. What's the story being told here? ""Hey, I'm an image! I'm new and wasn't here before"" - yeah, we know - that's how scrolling works. Just show me the content and get out of my way.

Facebook's web marketplace is literally atrocious. 

Even if we disregard the number of people who don't know how to make a proper listing, which of course isn't facebook's fault, there's still a HUGE problem with how the site opperates and the many missing important features every online marketplace must have.

For starters, you only get basic categories and can't use filters. All you can do is set the distance and price. The most infuriating part about this is sorting by price, which doesnt work at all. Like if I sort by ascending the prices are still all over the place, honestly I have no idea what went wrong there..

Then there's the problem with making new listings, you have to upload each picture one by one and if you are on mobile, good luck on editing anything. As soon as I leave the description or change viewing mode (for example portrait to landscape) everything gets reset.

* Async Queue System - Every method call waits for the previous one to finish and operates on the most recent version of the proxy.
* Full access to the entire DOM API if you don't want to use a custom method.

I mean, I know the HOW - the syntax, some basic properties, how it generally works, but it seems that in the last few years there is just an exponential amount of /things/ - I barely got flexbox but now there are grids, there are all these crazy specific properties that I have no idea how people discover and when to use.

There is so much stuff that IDK how you can keep track of all the interactions and when to use almost identical things with slightly different names.

And if you don't do it just right your site looks bad or is not accessible.

Adding to that the fact that you would depend on a third party which may impact the performance of your web pages.

So, why do we insist on capturing users' data through these analytics third party when we can simply set up a log visualization tool at the server level, and get the important data from log files (number of unique visitors, viewed pages, referrers, user-agent...) ?

Maybe Analytics tools have the benefit of providing detailed metrics, but these would only be useful if your business depends on user behavior tracking, which isn't the case for many websites out there.

16sdw7a,"Built a React website, now client has moved to a new (standard html) host service and can't get it working, what should I do?","Hi, as in the title, I built a React/NextJS website for a client with the following tech stack:

* React/NexJS to serve the website
* MUI components for design
* Heroku to host it (this was back when it had free tier but I had a paid Dyno) and I just setup the CNAME to point to Heroku's config

&#x200B;

The type of website I did was totally overkill to use a stack like that, all it had was Home/About/Services/Contact with a few images and a third party contact form email.I did this for 2 reasons:

1. I wasn't employed in IT and wanted to generate a portfolio, so used the latest tech
2. I had already made my own website, so I copied most of the design so it was really quick to setup but still clean and multi-screen friendly.

&#x200B;

When it came to renew their contract for the next year, they decided to go with another company. That company has since asked me for the website files, so I zipped the project and sent it. They're now asking me to login to the cpanel and make the necessary changes  to get it running.

I've already informed them about how it was hosted before, so what should I do now? I don't see how it will work in cpanel/standard html hosting. And if the clients decided to switch, should I even be handling any of this?

TIA.

What if instead you could build applications to work ON TOP of existing sites?

Enter - extensions.

- It’s easy to get and keep users
- You don't need a server
- You have no hosting costs.
- You don’t need a domain
- No need to handle malicious actors.
- You don't need to worry about scaling

And best of all, you don’t even need css (for many extension ideas). You can just whip together some JavaScript, and then you have an extension. Here’s an [example open source extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pomodoro-focus-task-manag/dmbalohccebhfhnadejgcpikngacbfek) I built to give you an idea of what you can make

I'm new to frontend web dev and I made this simple weather app project that uses openweathermap api. I want to upload this project to github, so that possible employers would be able to see it. Just want to ask how to hide API key, so that other people won't be able to use it when I uploaded it to github.  Although my subscription is free, for me it is a good practice to always hide sensitive information.

I tried to use dotenv, but I'm getting errors like 'require is not defined' and 'Cannot use import statement outside module'. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Below are the steps that I followed, please tell me if I did something wrong or if I missed a step.

1. npm install dotenv  in the root of my project
2. Created a .env file in the root of my project
3. Used the following in my js file but they returned an error

* require('dotenv').config()  // returned 'require is not defined' error
* import dotenv from 'dotenv'; //  returned 'Cannot use import statement outside module' error

If you guys know another way to hide API key and still be able to host it on github, please let me know.

Not sure if this is the correct community to ask this question, but if not, please guide me to the correct community.

Thanks in advance!

&#x200B;

*Edit:*

*Hey guys! I'm really grateful for all the comments. Read through all of them, and seems like the API key will still be visible no matter how you hide it in the FE. Will try to do this on the BE using the suggestions given. Thanks again!*

My credit card expired a couple of months ago, right before the auto-renewal at my domain registrar was supposed to happen. I didn't notice right away. It looks like an automated process detected the lapsed registration and it was instantly purchased by a dodgy opportunistic company. There wasn't even a website behind that domain and never has been.

[sav.com](https://sav.com/) now owns my domain and they're asking for $2,500 USD for transfer of ownership. I think I spent $15 USD buying it originally. They snatched it up less than two weeks ago.

Do I have any legal recourse? I just want it back. They don't need it and no one else is ever going to want it, let alone at that price. The only person who would consider spending anything on it is the previous owner.

**Update:**

Ok so [sav.com](https://sav.com) was offering $2,500 USD for my domain and it looks like they were also the registrar; however, it now seems to be owned by a guy who's offering it for sale on [daaz.com](https://daaz.com). I ended up bidding for it from some random Argentinian guy. I don't really get how it was available for sale for $2,500 on the registrar's site while also being available to bid on somewhere else.

Me: $100 bid, got a $500 counter offer.

$200 offer, got a $300 counter offer.

$240 offer (which scalper accepted).

1aprjzi,Help me convince my boss that we're not charging enough,"Hello!

I currently work as a Lead Developer in a digital marketing agency. We're basically a startup but have been going for around 8 years or so and have fairly big clients (some of our websites are actively used by celebs/high end fashion). As the lead developer, I constantly have my Boss on my back about how little money we make from Web Development a year... As you can imagine, this gets pretty frustrating when I think we're not charging enough and I'm the only developer at the company so I'm spread thin at all times.

To give some more context, I have built a ""framework"" which comprises of a number of WordPress plugins that integrate very nicely with Gutenberg which means there should be minimal new things being built going forward so the websites should be fairly cheap to produce.

For a standard service website which includes 3 pages and a simple contact form we charge around £1500 and a further £150 per extra page needed.

For a ""standard"" Ecommerce site we are charging around £3000. By standard, I mean that it uses all the standard WooCommerce features but we also include a ""free"" integration of [algolia.com](https://algolia.com) search for products and posts.

All websites are designed from the ground up by our Designer (this is included in the price) and without kissing our ass too much I think they're probably some of the nicest looking websites in the country.

Since my ""framework"" can easily pump out websites my Boss wants to just that - pump out 3 or so websites a month. Sure this is feasible with my framework but I also don't get the time to properly maintain the websites since we're always trying to get more business. I'm also not paid well as we can't afford it and we don't have the money to bring in another developer so I feel like we're in a hole we can't get out of but increasing the price could help.

*A simple question that might sound VERY STUPID to experienced developers. I apologize in advance.*

I've been studying on async/await. I'm not an expert however, I do believe I have a solid understanding of how it works since I can play around [JSON Placeholder's Free FAKE REST API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

My issue seems to lie on something else. Based on this somewhat complex for beginners example of fetching APIs using async/await and handling data. How exactly did the developer know and made those decisions that, ""I need to declare this and that"" in order to make this function work? I am not familiar with this stuff.

* How do I know that I need to declare these variables?

&#8203;

    const value = 1 / rates[fromCurrency]
    const exchangeRate = value * rates[toCurrency]

* How do I know that I need to pass in the parameters to rates and treat it like an index?

&#8203;

    rates[fromCurrency]
    rates[toCurrency]

* How does a developer know the structure of an API?

&#8203;

    const { data } = await axios.get(`${REST_COUNTRIES_API}/${currencyCode}`)

* Where did the destructured array came from? Where did exchangeRate and **ESPECIALLY the countries** came from? Seeing that getCountries function is referring to the currencyCode. Or is currencyCode === countries variable?

&#8203;

    const [exchangeRate, countries]

* How does a developer know that they actually need to declare this variable in order to achieve the correct results?

&#8203;

    const convertedAmount = (amount * exchangeRate).toFixed(2)

167gxw4,Upwork and fake/pseudo accounts,"Is it just me or am I having such bad luck? I’m a senior dev looking to hire another Sr or Mid dev for some JS and PHP work. So far I’ve hired two devs on upwork and both of them ended up being clearly not who they say they are in their profile. The tell tale signs are they never turn on video in meetings (which is fine, no biggie), they always seem to have “mic issues”, and always hesitant to screenshare, and always don’t know anything in meetings and prefer to talk through slack instead.

The work is also mediocre and I’m certain they’re just subbing it out to a cheap dev in India or Pakistan. Anyone else have a similar experience with Upwork? I guess I need to do better vetting before hiring.

Edit: Since this is starting to gain some traction - I’m looking for someone to work on a web app built with Vue frontend and Laravel backend. It’s a SPA using the Quasar JS frontend framework (which is pretty easy to get the hang of as long as you have high proficiency with Vue and Vuex). I built the app myself and needing someone to take over backlog of feature requests from users, while I incubate some other projects. Looking to hire someone immediately. I’m based in the US so highly prefer someone who can be available during US working hours. It’ll be a long term relationship, and I have plenty of other work available for the right person or team

Edit2: Appreciate all the insightful comments. So what have I learned from this post? If you’re in the market to hire a developer, make sure to require a video interview and run through their work on a live screenshare. Scammers will always be creative with excuses so if they can’t do it for whatever reason, move on to the next candidate.",2023-09-01 19:42:42

I saw this happening before, but assumed it was something else. When I looked up the details, I finally sorted it out. Namecheap's http forwarding service is now taking \_several seconds\_ to respond, while the site redirected to takes a small fraction of a second to transfer the whole page content (non-trivial, it's a github page).  


I contacted namecheap support about this, and was befuddled by the complete lack of understanding by their chat support. Not only did they not seem to understand what I was telling them, but they presumed to start explaining to me what they saw as the problem -> They were explaining to me like I was 5 as if I didn't understand. So either they are grossly incompetent or they are just having fun at my expense. Asking me to ""wait 5 to 10 minutes while I check the status of the domain"" seemed like a cruel form of performance art.

This sparked a conversation in our private team's standup where we shared how we felt about it. Many felt worried or unhappy with how it was communicated to us. Mainly because when a member of the team reached out to understand what had happened, the company responded they can not disclose more info due to legal reasons.

Being a small (60 employee) company is what makes it harder to understand. I guess you would expect this style of communication from a large corpo but not a startup where you are so close to each other.

As someone deeply involved in QA and test automation coaching, I've always sensed a gap in the availability of a comprehensive and detailed software testing glossary. A lot of resources either omit certain essential terms or don't provide a thorough explanation.

With that in mind, I've curated what I think is one of the most comprehensive glossaries in this space: [**https://ray.run/glossary**](https://ray.run/glossary).

While I've done my best to cover as much ground as possible, I believe that collective knowledge is powerful. I've integrated a feedback feature through a ""Was this helpful?"" form on the page. It'd be awesome if you could skim through and provide your insights or point out any potential improvements. Your expertise can make this glossary even more developer-friendly and robust.

Here are a few things on my roadmap:

* Linking each term to its respective Wikipedia page
* Incorporating synonyms
* Classifying terms with relevant tags (like automated testing, manual testing, etc.)
* Enabling a hover-over definition feature for these terms in Rayrun articles.

I genuinely value your input and appreciate any feedback or suggestions you might have. Thanks for helping improve this resource for our community! 👩‍💻👨‍💻🛠️",2023-09-25 01:37:31

I dreamt of my own software company, even losing sleep brainstorming the perfect name. Heck, I even photoshopped myself into a pic with a young Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Youthful enthusiasm, right?

15 years on, I've seen the ins and outs of the tech world. Worked at various places in different roles, contributed to company growth, and got a front-row seat to the challenges of the software business. And yet, every so often, I see folks with no team (or very small team), just a good idea and execution, making it big. It's both inspiring and a tad frustrating.

So, where am I at? I've given it a shot. Built apps, launched sites, and yes, left a few projects in the 'forever in beta' phase. None really took off. Whether it was marketing, product refinement, or just not hitting that 'eureka' idea moment, I've hit walls. And while juggling a full-time job and family, diving deep into a new project requires more than just time—it needs that spark.

I've got the experience, the drive, and the know-how. Yet, most of the time, I grapple with finding the right idea. On the rare occasions I believe I've struck gold, the challenges of execution or marketing rear their heads. Whether it's the market's saturation, the intricacies of the idea itself, or just the sheer difficulty of getting the word out, turning my dream into reality has been a multifaceted challenge.

14ot7sy,"On the search for a truly ""good"" UI framework.","There's a lot to unwrap here, but please listen.

I love to use React or Next.JS, as I have for something like 3 years now.

For my previous sideprojects, I have been using the [Carbon Design system from IBM](https://carbondesignsystem.com/).  
That worked exceptionally well, as it is very opinionated and easy to set up. The documentation is excellent, yet it's not the best and not the worst looking.

Recently I have started a more serious project that I hope to turn into a startup in a little. For this, I didn't want to keep using Carbon as my UI framework/library, because it has limited functionality in the sense of how many components there are, support for dark mode, and really good looking components. Also, customizability is not thaaat great, though it can be done.

So I started looking around.

I've come across [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) first, and it looked freaking awesome. I was impressed by looks, truly native support for dark mode, typescript and so on and so forth. What then devastated me is its lack of proper compatibility with NextJS 13, and also that it's not really finished yet (as is declared on their website clearly.) and therefore not really ready for production. 

The docs are somewhat limited, and there isn't a real fix for the currently still flashing dark mode (which is a big contra for me personally).

&#x200B;

The next thing I found was [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/), and I even started building with it. The lack of a Layout component, and some other issues with the docs and it being a comparatively small project with slow support and the discord not being too active was not what really turned me off.   
ChakraUI looks decent, but it's too unopinionated for my liking. I want to ship, not have to configure Buttons with 16 lines of props first.

&#x200B;

I then wanted to settle with [Ant Design](https://ant.design), but after reading through the docs, the, admittedly shitty first setup documentation and a lot of random Chinese elements spread throughout, I decided to post my journey on here and ask you guys for recommendations on truly good looking, documented and opinionated UI frameworks.

Sidenote: I also heard of MaterialUI, and I haven't really read into it, but I dislike Material Design itself very much. I just hate the looks, but if there is some kind of ""theme"" or whatever that I could put on top of it, I would consider using it.

17fj2gc,MyciDB - The mushroom cultivation tracker | Web application,"[https://mycidb.com](https://mycidb.com)

Hi,

A year ago I was looking for an indoor mushroom cultivation tracker. Unfortunately there is no real solution on the market so I decided to create a tool that could benefit everyone.

During the last year I build this web-application. I personally used it with some friends during all the development phase and now it really fit our needs.

The last couple of months I made it ready for everyone that wants to use it and not just only a few people.

There is a free plan that is way enough for casual/novice growers.

I won't bombard you with ""Why you should use it?"" or ""What's the prices?"", for those questions you can go directly on the website to get all information: [http://mycidb.com](http://mycidb.com)

I'd greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions you might have :)",2023-10-24 18:03:54

11a2l0c,[Rant] I hate my job,"I hate my job. There's no task management or issue tracking tools implemented, we have to be on a constant google meet call from 08:00 to 17:00. Whenever my boss wants me to do something he just enters the meet call and blurts it out and I have to write it down on a txt and I sometimes forget about the other tasks I have to do because I have ADHD so I forget the task I was doing because I was writing down and doing the new task I got assigned. My bosses also sometimes assign us tasks using a WHATSAPP group instead of something such as discord or slack. This wouldn't have happened if they used something such as redmine(I used it on my last internship and I accomplished my tasks just fine) or trello.

The APP I'm working on has a disastrous codebase, it's PHP (there's nothing wrong with PHP, I like it as a language) where there's no templating engines and most HTML is written IN THE SAME BLOODY LINE and it's a total clusterfuck, the worst of all is that I have to adhere to that ""convention"".

I’m a full stack dev coding in PHP and JS.  I’ve been at my job for a year now and before that I did a bootcamp.

I feel like I’ve hit a plateau.  The grace period of “learning on the job” is largely gone and now I’m expected to get tickets done.  But I don’t feel like a very good programmer.  I understand most of the code I read, and I feel I have a high level understanding of most of the things at work (sql, graphql, vue, docker, laravel etc).  But to be totally honest I actually WROTE waaay more code at bootcamp, most of what I do now is reworked copy/paste code from elsewhere in the codebase, stack overflow, or ChatGPT.   I feel like I’m in this gray zone of getting tickets done but not really advancing as a dev.  I want to be a good dev, a senior dev one day.  Is my only option to put in extra hours with a side project, or extracurricular classes?  Because I’m too burnt out to do that after work lol.

I am 22 years old, Bachelor's degrees in computer science.I live in a third world country.
I've been learning web dev for over 2 years now.
I have built projects for personal use and for clients. I landed an Upwork job 6 months ago a front end react dev, making 20$/h.
Once the contract ended. I had no luck landing more jobs on Upwork. So i struggled for a while and I was forced to job hunt locally within my area.
Now I am working 40h/week. Building a full stack website for a Healthcare company. 
I work alone with no designers, manager or even other coders.
Just me and my boss.
He would browse dribble for hours and get me some next level bs animation or UI to implement.
And I do it. No matter what he throws at me , all good by the end of the day.
The thing is he is a dickhead, toxic and a narcissist. Just not fun to work with.
And I get paid 400$ a month, working 40h/week.
It's really unfair, I dream of landing a job in a foreign company but I don't know what do. How much do I have to learn, what should I even do.
I am really confident with my skills, at least for a mid/experienced position.

13nw7x1,Hardest Time EVER Finding Work,"I lost my job as a Front-End Developer after 6 years in Feb of 2020. The woman that replaced my first boss had a problem with men in general, me specifically and tried to get me to quit for over 2 years but eventually fired me when I never did. Then, a month later, the pandemic hit in full force and scared the shit out of me because I have several pre-existing health issues that Covid seemed to hit the hardest. I had money saved up & didn’t need to work for a while so I tried to ride it out. I stayed busy the whole time polishing my skills mainly focusing on JavaScript changes post 2016 that I hadn’t had time to learn on the job. Mainly using Udemy as my educational choice I brushed up my skills and became a much better developer trying to focus on a job once things returned to “normal” again. 

Late last year I totally revamped my resume and built a website that featured work that I’ve done recently and over the years. Then I hit the job sites trying to find my next job. It’s well over 6 months later and I haven’t even gotten an interview yet. Because I’ve primarily been the only developer at most companies where I’ve worked I’ve acquired a diverse set of skills. I’ve worked with ASP, PHP, C#, MS-SQL, MySQL, Adobe Creative Suite, Affinity Design Suite, JavaScript, CSS, Less, Sass, Google Analytics, Magento, Joomla, WordPress, etc over the years and used them successfully to get the job done. Unfortunately, I never concentrated on one of them specifically, so I don’t really have a go-to skill to hang my hat on. Jobs that I think I’m qualified for all seem to have a requirement for one skill that I *don’t* have very much experience with & that seems to be one of the major reasons I haven’t found work yet. The other thing that I feel may be a liability is my age: I’ll be 59 next month. 

I’m at the point where I need to start making money again. Now. I’m also considering looking for work outside of the industry. Before I started working in web development, I delivered pizzas for a few years & I may have to resort to that. But my fear is that if I settle for that I may never get another developer job & I’ll be stuck barely scraping by because the money is half of what I’m used to making and may not even pay all my bills each month. 

I’ve also recently started thinking I need to diversify my skills to become employable (yeah, I know, what an epiphany!) so I’m taking a C# Developer course since I already have experience & there seem to be a lot of jobs available. So what’s my point, you’re probably wondering by now? I obviously need to do things differently to get back in my preferred career again, but I’m not doing it very well. At. All. I’m completely open to suggestions at this point if anyone has any advice on how to pull myself out of the hole that I’m currently stuck in. I live in NE IL, btw, about an hour outside of Chicago.

Apparently [the way to get reputation](https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation) is by asking and answering questions, which I hardly ever have good reason to do because I'm a good citizen who SEARCHES for existing questions and READS existing answers before posting them myself. 99.5% of the time, if it's a question worth asking, someone has asked it.

15ywc43,I keep on getting scammed.,"I have been a web developer for quite a few years now. I started out in this field young, and I am still a teenager. I started out as a hobby but after around a year or so I got my first contract remote job. 

I was hired for $800 but I received only $100 and they ran away. As I really needed money (it was during COVID) and my classes were off, I got another remote job but was extremely cheap. I was working at \~ $5/hr. 

Although I appreciated the team as they had made the deal clear beforehand and actually were really supported. No complains on this one. 

Then after it was over, I got another contract after a year or so. I was busy in high school for a year. This was quite huge. I was asked to build an entire frontend and backend. I did it within around 2months, and the contractor says, their client withdrew from the project and paid me only $120 for 2 months of work.

I am tired of this .I am from a poor country and as I am applying for colleges, I am trying to save some money for college. Also, the financial situation is poor at home so I tend to take responsibility of my own expenses.

For me, I appreciate every little bit of money so even though the pay is not attractive, I agree to work for different teams and they scam me all the time. 

like, are all the young developers bound to be scammed? or am I just dumb to work for such cheap rate and still struggle to make money. Are there any opportunities for us?

The quality of my work is unquestionable as I put all the effort and time in it. And the contractors actually appreciate this but all I needed from them was a timely payment.

I recently joined a new company after being laid off from my previous job. I'm facing some really challenging problems here. For instance, we are building a Chrome plugin that is technically similar to Grammarly. Someone has already created a basic version of the plugin, but it's filled with bugs. Essentially, the task is to underline the first three words of every sentence a user writes in a text box on various websites like Gmail and LinkedIn. I initially thought this would be an easy task, but I soon realized it's not. Grammarly has shared a blog post detailing the basics of how they approached this issue (you can find it here: [https://www.grammarly.com/blog/engineering/making-grammarly-feel-native-on-every-website/](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/engineering/making-grammarly-feel-native-on-every-website/)), and it seems quite challenging to me. 

I have less than three years of experience in web development, mainly focusing on React websites and Node APIs, not plugins. After spending three months and reading the blog post, I feel overwhelmed. I've already communicated to the project manager that I need assistance from a senior developer; this task requires a team effort. I don't believe I can handle it alone and create a plugin similar to Grammarly. 

I'm now in a dilemma. Should I consider quitting? I've only been with this company for a short period, and I'm concerned about how it might reflect on my employment history. Or is there another option that I'm missing due to stress and confusion? Your insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.",2023-11-01 17:24:36

I understand that a company might need to cut costs but logically shouldn't they be letting go of the high-paid individuals who have newly joined and have no clear understanding of the job yet.

One reason that I could think of behind these kind of layoffs is the age of the existing employees. Most of these comparitively underpaid employees are either getting old (say late 30s or early 40s) or are veterans in a company, so if a company wants to only hire fresh faces, then it makes sense to fire the existing. But I don't think many companies care so much about optics.

Another reason could be this weird fetish of hiring as many laid-off FAANG devs as possible at matching (or higher) salaries for roles and levels that are currently being handled by folks for much much less pay. Imagine a colleague with lesser experience than you working on same tech stack and delivering same quality work but getting paid thrice your salary. And when the push comes to shove, it's the existing employee that's thrown out first! It's a terrible practice.

Are such layoffs common? What do you think could be the reason for such layoffs?",2023-08-10 21:09:35

Update: Thanks for all the great responses! Yes the vast majority of people said delete it and yes I delete most old code eventually, but you do have those gems that it's just hard to get rid of. I think what I'm going to do is a combination of things I saw here. One is time stamped comments so I can know how old it really is (sometimes changes will make something appear newer).

Also I'll delete code more often, but I will probably do a commit dedicated just to that commented out code. The next commit will have it completely deleted. That way I can find more easily later if I need to and it won't be mixed in with other things. Maybe I'll tag it with ""commented code"" or something.

The other thing is I will create a separate reference repo just for useful snippets that I don't want to solve again. It looks like some people are using text files for this, but I don't see any reason why this can't be a whole repo.

And to the people who are anti-comment, I love my comments. They have saved me so many times. It's not always code. I write very detailed comments, with references links to API etc. Even if you are anti-commented out code, I hope you see the validity in regular comments!

Look maybe I'm wrong and if so I would like to learn and change my ways.

I work fullstack and mostly frontend these days, I like to work by actually writing my code and building things with as much control as I can, but a lot of employers, especially smaller ones hire specialized developers and then instead of having them working with more speficic advanced things they expect and want them to work with tools like Wordpress, Wix, and the likes. I don't like that, I want to write code, that's what I studied for and hope to do for a living.  
Not use tools I honestly dislike and have no experience with.

Using CMSs for content management on sites you built is fine, but hiring a coder to just sit down and make wordpress sites just grinds my gears and I turn down jobs like that if I can.

I've been studying alot as a full stack and am able to develop web apps but I always feel like I don't know enough for implementing auth. Like I can't do it right or I'm missing something.

I feel like I don't know the proper way to do it and it scares me to launch any product.

So I'm here to ask for advice on how to overcome it and what are the recommended best ways to implement a secure auth into an app.

What is the industry standard?

Is it jwt secure httponly cookies? Oauth? Session cookies? A 3d party service? Access+refresh tokens?

Are there some good resources out there that explain well and in depth how a good auth solution works in 2023 for nodejs (and in general)?

What and how to store data in the db? ( apart from hashing )

All the tutorials I've found don't make me very confident on my ability to include a scalable and secure system...

I know there's passport Js which feels outdated and not really well documented, stuff like firebase auth, aws cognito, clerk etc but I'd like to avoid vendor locks and would prefer to understand how things work better at lower level

159kr91,Does anyone else think stand-ups are kinda pointless?,"Update:

Wow this post blew up far more than I expected. 😁

In retrospect, using the word ""pointless"" (which I meant as hyperbole) was probably too much.

Thanks to everyone who participated. I now have a much more round perspective on how stand-ups are used.

These perspectives will definitely affect how I communicate during stand-ups. 

Reflecting, I think Async stand-ups provide the best cost/benefit ratio. They allow every dev to pause when they are at a good point.

Original post:


For context, I'm a web developer in a team of about a dozen people.

At every place I've worked my stand-up (and pretty much everyone else's) tends to be something like

Today I'll be continuing on ABC-123. I'm making good progress. No blockers. 

It seems the only really useful piece of data there is the ""No blockers"" part. I understand theoretically how saying WHAT you're working on could be useful, but then I'd have to say something like

Today I'll be continuing on ABC-123. Yesterday I began implementing the GraphQL mutation, and was able to get a skeleton of it working with some mock data. Today I'll be working on writing unit tests. No blockers.

But if I did that, to all the other devs it'd be kinda like ""duh"". That's what ALL of us do more or less for each backend ticket. 

And for non-devs, it's just a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo except for the ""No blockers"" part.

So what's the point? If it's to identify anything that I might be blocked on or having issues with, I should (and do) reach out when those occur. There's no need to wait until the stand-up meeting. If I need help with anything involved or even if conversation of any kind occurs it gets moved to after stand-up or a separate meeting, since the meeting is timeboxed to 15 minutes. 

And to he honest, it's kinda annoying to have to interrupt my flow for the meeting. We do Async text updates sometimes which is better, but it still requires me to stop what I'm working on for a meeting that seems pointless. 

A bigger issue actually would be the context switching cost, which can cause that meeting to cost a few hours or more since you have to leave flow and get back into it. 

Sorry this became a bit of a rant 😂 but I'm just curious if I'm alone in this perspective and just whining about something that has actual benefit

Update: I alluded to it above but our stand-ups are daily. I'll leave question above the same since I'm curious about non daily as well, but that's where I feel they're probably the least benefit for time cost if developers on the team are proactive.",2023-07-25 20:55:00

1aqdo9m,How do you convince a restaurant that only uses Facebook that a website woild be beneficial?,"Hi there,

I am currently looking at restaurants around me and I see that the vast majority are using a Facebook page as their ""website"". Usually, they only post about their menu changes, with the occasional announcement or photo.

Of course Facebook has its place in a social media strategy, but it is poorly suited as a website replacement in my opinion. Its main attraction is that it is easy and free, but I cannot help but think that these businesses could benefit from having a real website with a CMS that allow them to make the menu changes. The Facebook/Instagram etc could then be used to promote the place and reach out to customers instead of being a boring ""menu of the week"" page.


How would you go about discussing with these businesses to see if a switch to a website would make sense, while trying to show them how they could beneficiate from having both a website and social medias?

I was using http://monkeytype.com/ to practice typing on the keyboard, and while typing through random quotes I had the idea to combine typing practice with typing through the Bible. Working on this project has made me look at every word and see passages of the Bible anew. When I was developing this site, I used John 11:35 as the edge case since its the shortest verse in the Bible. Typing it over and over made me realize that Jesus wept because he loved.

So I went on my NameCheap account to see that ""Error Info: Renew not supported later than 12 days before expiry date for this TLD. "". So I hopped in a support chat, the agent told me to credit my account of the $18.56 for a renewal and that they would do it on their end.

And .... They don't, I start another support chat and ask the dicey question.

Me : What is the technical reason ?

Agent 1 : Allow me 5-10 minutes to contact our team in this regard.

Agent 2 : Thank you for waiting. The rule about the renewal of .FR domains are set up not by Namecheap, but by our upstream provider. The ""Domain renew by"" date is indicated in the Namecheap account, you should renew (have the domain auto-renewed) before that date. If not renewed. it enters the redemption period and will require a redemption fee to be paid along with the regular renewal cost. The domains that were not renewed on time will have ""Alert"" status and are removed from the Namecheap account the next day after the expiration. If you'd like to transfer the domain, our Concierge department will help you with this.

Me : is your upstream provider 1API ?

Agent 2 : No, it is not our upstream provider.

Agent 2 : I cannot disclose our internal information, regrettably.

Yes, a 10 million customer company use a company that use other company for one of the main TLD.

To end this story, I have transferred my domain to OVH for 6€, and they renewed it for free!

TLDR: Don't use NameCheap for [.**CH**](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/cctld/ch/), [.**ES**](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/cctld/es/), [.**FR**](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/cctld/fr/), [.**LI**](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/cctld/li/), [.**PE**](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/cctld/pe/), [.**SG**](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/cctld/sg/), [.**COM.SG**](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/cctld/com-sg/), [**.COM.AU**](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/cctld/com-au/), [**.ORG.AU**](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/cctld/org-au/), [**.NET.AU**](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/cctld/net-au/) domains.

17vuklg,"What do people mean when they say ""consume the back-end API""?","So I only programmed CRUD apps using templates like pug or jinja. I think for this reason I never understood what people meant when they said ""consume the back-end API"" or that the back-end job was to create APIs (except when dealing with microservices), but now that I am learning React  I think it's becoming more clear to me.

For context, I did some flask, django and express CRUDs, in every app I always made it so that each page had an url and every time the front had to talk with the back-end there would be a page transition and html would be generated in the back-end using a template language.

Now I am learning React and it seems that I can do things different this time.

 So the role of the back-end in this case (for example REACT + flask )seems to be to make these APIs that only pipe data and not html/css/files. The front-end instance in the client will call these endpoints and get the data (probably using a REST API made by the back-end team). Am I correct?

Of course, the front will need to be delivered in a traditional way and there might be more than one page that's delivered like that, but most of the time I will need to use something like the fetch API (never used it) to get data dynamically.

I also undestand that there's thousands of different ways of doing everything but I'm just trying to get what people are talking about about most of the time.",2023-11-15 14:16:44

15fclvx,Should I be concerned about the legality of web accessibility?,"So I’m currently learning about web accessibility and I’ve been reading there’s actually quite a lot of legality involved. There seems laws which is unique to each country and I’m scratching my head on how it all pieces together. There’s a lot of information on the individual laws but not working internationally, if certain businesses are excluded (e.g., b2b), or how legal action is taken, how much you could be fined etc.

The app I’m building is from the UK but it’s distributed internationally and it has few customers as it’s a B2B. Right now, as we personally know the companies we’ve not needed to do accessibility as it’s not needed by them. Should I still be concerned about them trying to sue me if business relationships go south?

When shipping internationally, what laws do I follow (especially for my above B2B example business).

The legal actions in the UK taken against businesses seem pretty minor if non existent;  I.e., the BBC got fined £3,000 which is obviously small for a big business. Apart from the financial loss of losing customers if they can’t check out because of an inaccessible website, should I just ignore the fact that I could be sued?",2023-08-01 13:27:24

18n6fep,Helpful tips I received during phone call with a recruiter at a large company.," 

I just got off a ""coffee chat"" I was lucky enough to schedule with a recruiter at a large tech company and I think the advice she gave was very helpful for me at least.

For some context I am a full stack engineer with around \~3 years of experience and no college degree.

* When applying always aim to get your application in as soon as possible. This puts your application earlier in the list of hundreds of applicants and will increase the odds of a recruiter picking up your resume.
* When doing cold outreach, try to get in touch with a member of the team you are trying to join or the hiring manager. Most recruiters inboxes are flooded and they have no choice but to ghost a majority of the people reaching out.
* Build connections at companies you want to get a position at, 99% of people will not give blind referrals so its important to find communities and build friendships with people at other companies.
* Q4 is the slowest time of year for hiring so most of the time its worth getting a good break so you can stay motivated through Q1 which is the busiest time of year.
* Include metrics/numbers in your resume (she really emphasized this one). example: ""Increase API efficiency by \_\_\_\_\_."" ""Refactored UI and increase customer feedback by \_\_\_\_\_""
* Cover Letters don't have much of a impact as you think and quote ""A cover letter does not make up for a bad resume""

I hope you guys find this helpful and if I remember anything else from my talk I will makes some updates to this post. Also feel free to add any other advice you have to the thread.",2023-12-20 21:58:41

The irony is, I graduated with computer science degree and with a good grade at that. But I sort of just stopped learning after leaving because I liked my colleagues, I liked the company, I enjoyed the work. 

Now I have no job, and I regret not spending time learning additional skills nodejs, angular, react, mongodb, express, python and the myriad of platforms out there like aws, azure, heroko, netlify... Heck.... I don't even know git because I used tsvn. 

I could really do with a new job and I am interviewing but explaining that I'm confident in html, css and javascript and I'm sure I can learn a library isn't cutting it.

16xjb4p,Web Dev Not billing enough.,"I've been trying to convince someone they should get paid more for their work.

They built a website, configured servers, docker, etc. It contains about 100k user records and accounts. It has all the usual, signups, logins, forgotten passwords, mobile version, full text searching, moderator admin, etc.

Each user can have a group of associated records they manage. Without giving too much away think of it as a bunch of bands put in their next handful of gigs. (It's not music). 

What would this be priced at? $1, $1000, $10,000, $100,000?

The server is scalable via docker swarm.

My passion project for the past few months has been to use large-language models to compare news articles against eachother and find key differences. The aim? Make it super easy for people to see multiple perspectives on a news story because we live in a world where media outlets rely on people's lack of time to research beyond the narrative they want to spread. 

So I got out of my comfort zone of using Python and building ML models all day, learnt a whole new tech stack. and built [NewsCord](https://newscord.org). 

It's my first time doing front-end development so go easy on me! It's simple to use. Paste in the article you're interested in and hit search. compare your article against similar ones from different publishers. Or, just head to the Trending News section and see the top news for the current big news topics.

1bik83u,Do I suck at programming or is programming/my project just really hard?,"I'm currently building a SaaS for a client (I'm a freelancer), and I'm super anxious that I won't finish the project. Not in terms of delivering on time (that's not going to happen, I've already accepted that) but in terms of my skill set. I'm being paid in monthly installments so I can focus solely on this project. Not finishing it would mean I'd need to pay everything back to the client.

I've been a web developer for 6 years, focusing on Frontend for 5 years, and I've considered myself a Fullstack Developer for 1 year. What I'm building now uses Nuxt 3 + Facebook API + Stripe + Supabase, and it's just very big – maybe too big for me. But, you know what they say, ""fake it till you make it."" I'm programming every day, learning, watching tutorials, making progress, and I see myself getting better every day. However, there are days when I think, ""how on earth am I supposed to do this alone?"" and it just stresses me out.

I've already hired a couple of freelancers to help me here and there with Supabase and the Facebook API. However, I have to be mindful of the budget, so I need to do most of it on my own.

Today, I experienced major frustration, which made me feel really bad about myself. I wanted to quickly implement a Google Autocomplete input in my existing form to ensure that users enter valid addresses. First, I had issues changing the database structure, then the Vue Google Maps library had an issue so I had to switch it, setting an initial value didn't work, and then I had issues implementing a custom validation rule into the form library I'm using. Now, I'm trying to figure out how I can trigger the input with the initial values, which is just a formatted address string so I can retrieve the latitude and longitude values.

Time spent on this task: 5 hours. I wanted to finish this task today and failed. Some of you probably would have finished this task in less than 1 hour. Now, I'm seriously wondering if I'm the worst programmer on the planet or if this is a struggle every programmer faces.

I'm really anxious about failing because it would be problematic financially. When I took on this project, I thought I could do anything if I just tried very hard. Now, with the Google Autocomplete input issue I faced today, I'm not so sure anymore...

Sorry for whining, just a small breakdown. If you've read this far, thank you very much.

**Edit:** I think I've found an answer to my question. After posting this 2 hours ago, I went for a walk and then got back to my laptop. Breaking down the issues I'm facing on a piece of paper really helped! I managed to solve the autocomplete issue within a couple of minutes and then moved on to the next task, which involved displaying leads from Facebook, making them searchable/filterable, and some CRUD operations. I  estimated 15-20 hours for these tasks, but after breaking them down and focusing, I got everything done in less than 2 hours! This meant I made up for the time I lost over the autocomplete. The reason for the quick progress was that I had already written reusable components. 

So I came to the following conclusions:

1. Yes, this project is hard.
2. Yes, I have a lot to learn.
3. I do not suck at programming.
4. Being realistic about my skills is why I have a Facebook API expert and a backend expert by my side, just a Slack message away.
5. I can finish this project, and I'm confident it will be a success :) 

Thanks for all the kind words from you guys. I'm breaking the tasks down as you guys suggested.

1bmfrjm,Majority of web apps could just run on a single server,"This sentiment gets stronger every day I follow the web development scene. Surely there are many ( in absolute numbers ) that require complex infra but majority of websites and apps get <10 rps and 50 on a busy day. 

Obviously latency is lower if there are endpoints around the world but the data still needs to be accessed. What's the point of being 20ms away from client if the db is 200ms away from that endpoint? And yes, someone has to pay for all that infrastructure.

Obviously caching is useful but that's something you get with a cdn or just plain http caching. Often the whole thing can live on cdn, just push the new files after updates. Maybe a few api endpoints are needed for some dynamic functionality but that can be handled for example with JavaScript. 

Most projects might as well run in container on $5 vps. That would likely be faster as well, at least it's running and probably with a local db.",2024-03-24 08:18:03

1baisdh,"Our full-stack web framework reached 10,000 stars on GitHub!","**TL;DR** \- 3 years ago, my brother and I had an idea to start a new web framework, powered by its own DSL/compiler. A lot of people told us we stand no chance (we weren't sure either tbh), but we kept going. **Today, we reached 10,000 stars on GitHub** \- below is a short story about how we started and what it took to get here.

**If you like what we're doing, we'd appreciate it if you supported us by starring our repo:** [**https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp**](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp)

# The story

As a developer, starting your own web framework is probably one of the scariest things you can do. It is almost certain your project will die, and as the added bonus, other developers will make fun of you along the way, counting all the reasons why it won't work.

[Three years ago, when we released Alpha version](https://preview.redd.it/h68liv6mgbnc1.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6555566ebec64893442c9c023471baaccf049af)

We kept going. We had a vision in our mind and we wanted to see if we can make it a reality. **We didn't care at all whether Wasp lives or dies, we just knew that we needed to see it through, and that's all that mattered**. In a few months, we released Alpha version and got our first 100 stars. As a result, that brought in even more questions, and we weren't any closer to figuring out if the concept we imagined can really fly or not.

**But, we also couldn't believe that somebody actually starred our repo. We were both surprised and motivated**. I still clearly remember my brother asking me *""Matija, can you imagine that the project we created gets to 1,000 stars on GitHub?""*. Both of us immediately shooked our heads and laughed, thinking *""yeah, right, like that's gonna happen!""*.

9,900 stars and almost 3 years later, here we are today. Wasp is getting close to entering the elite 10,000 stars club on GitHub, next to the giants of the industry. **The framework we started, and developed further with the invaluable feedback from the community, is being used by all kinds of developers - from weekend projects, to startups and top enterprises**. Startups made with Wasp have been acquired. I just saw a job ad today on Upwork, where a company is hiring for Open SaaS (an open-source, free boilerplate starter for React & Node.js, powered by Wasp) developers - [https://github.com/wasp-lang/open-saas](https://github.com/wasp-lang/open-saas) 🤯

Looking back, I still find it hard to believe it. Starting from my brother's girlfriend's (now wife) apartment with pretty much no open-source nor community-building experience, we made it to the product that developers all over the world use daily, and willingly choose to use it over the mainstream, famous frameworks we all know. We are incredibly honored and humbled by this.

We still have an a lot of questions (figured that won't ever go away), but now it's also starting to feel like we got a couple of the answers right.

[Today - never thought we'd get this kind of feedback from anyone!](https://preview.redd.it/31p1b7kygbnc1.png?width=545&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5538d67fe8f0d3eefb837dd18be9501d9227d3d)

&#x200B;

I work for a non profit and we have an agreement with a company that runs its own ""custom CMS"" and built our website.  I am completely new to website design and management to be clear. With this company we have access to content management so we can update website pictures, text, add forms and videos, etc. We can even add new pages easily. However we have access to absolutely nothing on the back-end. If we want to do something like embed a plugin, we need to send the code to this company who will have their team do it and they charge $25 every time we want to ""add code"".

Now we are trying to update our website to adhere to our national chapters branding guidelines. This includes using a specific font. We cannot change the font ourselves. I emailed them and they got back to me and said to change the font it would be $75. Now, as i said before, I do not know much when it comes to building and updating a website on the back-end. Does this sound normal? Keep in mind we pay this company every month already.

- DRY

- Separation of concerns

For me felt like a religion but made sense at the time. After working with a lot of teams, creating projects by my own, trying different frameworks and languages it fell part.

Having the UI and logic on the same file makes sense a lot of time, easier to follow and review, and if gets too big split into other components.

I also see the same conversation around Tailwind, I really like self contained components, I don't think you need to abstract everything into 3 separated files and a append-only styles.css file, but maybe i'm missing something.

When does the ""separation of concerns"" makes sense and when it doesn't?

Ex:

Feature Name - Due: March 6th

Dev name - 3 hours

I've just started doing some work on this one internal project for an agency, only about a month in so I'm still getting used to their code base and quite simply some things I've just never used before. We have to log our time on each task, which I have no problem with, but there's also a max time that the task should take, and it honestly just stresses me out more. They have due dates as well, which is obvious for anything development-related, but I feel like when I'm working, all I'm thinking about is how fast I'm going to make sure I can finish in the allocated time I have, even if I'm working on it days before its due.

Maybe this will get better with time, but in my mind I'm thinking there of course should be a due date and logging time, but unless there's an absurdly high time log, why max it out?

The hours are also chosen by people who don't do the development, so sometimes I finish a task in 20 minutes that I was given 2 hours for, but it becomes a problem when it's some bigger task and the hours are tight.

* If present, send a short secret code to the email
* UI will show a text box for the secret code
* Once user enter the secret code and submit, backend will verify it
* Once verified, UI will show ""new password"" and ""confirm new password"" fields, to update the user's password.
* Redirect to login screen once successful.

Does the flow look okay?

My main question is with the 2nd step - checking whether the email is present in the database. Should I return message saying ""Email does not exist in the records"", or just say, ""Code sent to email"" irrespective of whether the email exist or not. I saw some people saying the latter should be followed as a security best practice to not allow bad actors to abuse the sytem to know whether a particular email exists in the database.

I know my company wouldn’t have the first clue if I gave them the local files or repo, so I wondered how you’d pass over a site you’ve made. 

I know a lot of people go Wordpress, but I’m a next.js dev and only really worked on software products for businesses. 

I guess I could host it for them, but always wonder how that’d end up? And they wouldn’t be able to edit content (for the level of sites I’m thinking). 

Need some insights! Please share your valuable knowledge 🙏🏻",2024-03-12 19:38:09
1bcgy8a,How do you explain to non-techs about necessary code cleanup?,"I inherited managing a business logic site for a pretty big company ($B+/yr in sales).  The site is complex, pretty important to their operational workflow, and is the most atrocious site I think I've ever worked on.  Zero OOP practices.  I don't think there are even any classes that aren't third party libraries.  Each page is mostly just a long script.  HTML intermingled into logic.  Bugs all over the place.  Code is repeated frequently.  The mobile site looks like they literally just copied the entire site, and made the copy mobile friendly so every change I now have to make twice.  Security vulnerabilities all over the place.  The list goes on.  I gaffaw constantly while reading through the site.

I should note that I'm on retainer for X hours a month to maintain the site, not a full-time employee.  I was brought on several months ago, but they haven't had much more than minor tweaks so I haven't really had to dive into the code too much.  Lately they've had a few bigger changes they've requested, and as I've been doing them, I've been rewriting the parts I work on.  Basically I set up a framework, and have been moving logic into a proper OOP structure whenever I have to make more than a minor tweak to it.

My hours last month were significantly higher than they were expecting (way over my retainer) (and higher than it should have been for the tasks I was assigned) due to me refactoring so much of the code.  They had some questions about it, but ultimately accepted my explanation without too much fuss.  I tried to instill on them the state of the code, and the work it needs to get to where I could consider it ""maintainable"" -- they were amenable, but want me to scope out projects to do it.  The people at the company that I report to are pretty close to luddites, so I'm not really sure they get it.

So, that brings me to my question, and where I'm not entirely sure how to proceed.  The first project I'd like to do is scrapping the ""mobile site"", and making the desktop site responsive.  I can already tell this is going to be a rabbit hole where I end up wanting to rebuild huge swaths of the front-end framework (front end is in an old version of Angular, it's not as bad as the back-end stuff, but there are a lot of parts I can tell I'm going to want to completely redo), so even semi accurately estimating is definitely going to be hard.  Rather than trying to do this all as one giant task, I'd rather do it incrementally, a few pages at a time, which they don't seem to get.  I'm a senior dev with 20+ years of experience, and I'm used to having a bit more autonomy with code cleanup, especially with customers that don't understand code at all.  I guess my ideal scenario is to convince them to just give me a larger allotment of hours each month to refactor/clean code but I'm not really sure how to convince them of that.

Any thoughts/advice?",2024-03-11 22:46:30

1bdqkm3,I still can't see the point of SSR. Looking to understand what I'm missing.,"First off, let's forget SEO. I get it, SSR is better for SEO. I'd just use Astro if I wanted powerful SEO. 

Okay, so I'm mostly a Vue.js user, and here I'm talking about creating a dashboard that is hidden behind a login/authenticated workflow. Did I mention I don't care about SEO? Cool. 

Now, I normally create my dashboards using an SPA built with Vite. It works perfectly well. However, the community these days seems really gung-ho on the SSR thing; it's all about the meta frameworks (Next, Nuxt, Sveltekit, etc) and I really feel like I'm just not understanding why SSR is being so widely adopted. I genuinely think there must be benefits here that I'm not seeing – why else would there be so much buzz?

You might say the SPA takes time to load all that JS, but with bundle-splitting between routes that's not really an issue anymore. After the initial load, it's all there and cached, ready to go. It seems to me that grabbing all the text of a full HTML file on every route request seems much worse in terms of performance than just grabbing a teeny bit of json data.

What am I not getting about SSR's benefits? Should I be using it?",2024-03-13 12:45:42

1bn7uv0,Is this an example of workplace bullying? [backend engineer],"Hi. I joined this company as a mid-level backend engineer around a year ago and it has been a cause for a lot of personal stress. Although I decided and told upper-management that I am quitting, as I still have to deal with some of the shit I've been getting, I was wondering if I am being bullied, gaslighted, and whether it is something I should have reported (or report), or whether it's just me being too sensitive.

My experience prior to joining was working in startup/smaller businesses and in most cases there was a rather relaxed approach to engineering where you are allowed to solve a problem the best way you see fit and people will give you feedback or constructive criticism as needed without any babysitting and little ceremony.

Ever since I joined I lost my self-esteem as a software engineer and have been feeling like I am a terrible one, because whenever I work on a problem and open a PR, I get rounds and rounds of reviews with a lot of comments that come from a) personal preferences, or b) from obscure business details that are not documented anywhere, ending up in blocking my work, ending up in me being seen as being slow and not up to par with the rest of the engineers. And there is a lot of babysitting, and at times requests that don't seem reasonable to me. The stakeholders of the project request the changes and we communicate with them directly and sometimes there's back and forth about the details. I think that part is normal, though.

What has bothered me a lot though, is the following situation. All the information about what needs to be done has been already communicated and the details are all present → I work on implementing those changes and couple of days later, suddenly the team lead comes and leaves a PR review, picks an implementation detail and says, oh, did we confirm this with the stakeholders? It's not something obvious from the ticket or from what has been communicated already, but it's something this particular engineer knows is important because they have been involved around that code for a while. All good. This started being a problem once I got multiple PRs open that weren't moving forward because of the constant back and forth, and constantly having to go to people and ask for re-reviews on top of all the context-switching.

As a result, I was told I am being slow and, indirectly, that the problem is me. Not to mention that when I told the manager I am really stressed out the only concern of theirs was about how to improve my ~~productivity~~ performance.

The same team lead has never been straightforward in one-on-one communication about what is the expectation of a certain task or what their question about a particular situation is, but has always been indirect almost to the point of being passive-aggressive. I've never heard an outward rude comment from them, but more along the lines, that they are unsure about the solution but then expressing themselves really ambiguously almost as if they don't know what's wrong but something doesn't sit right nonetheless. Or when I ask for a review, the review comes at the last moment or not at all, or after something has been merged, etc.

IMO, the communication has always felt:

* as if I am being rushed, that the assumption is that I am being slow and that I need to hurry up with X or Y even though there's external factors out of my control that block my work
* that most things I do or suggest are wrong or won't work as well as I assumed (ie. the emphasis is more often than not on the cons)
* that they have some beef with me but won't come in a collegial manner to address and work through it but would rather cut corners around it

I am glad that I gave my resignation, I don't know how this looks from a more objective perspective, but it has caused me a lot of stress. I have another month at this company and I hope I can endure it well.

So I've got a client who wanted me to build them a website I gave them a price and stuff and they  paid me in full to do the website for them and I've showed them how to work the website and everything 

So fast forward 2 months the website has 0 sales
so now they blaming it on me like it's my fault. Now they want me to do a refund on the payment  

But I've checked and they have a few pending payments and I don't see any contact between them and the client regarding payment Completions and stuff 

I've also been taking a look at the social medias they've hardly been advertising the website on any of the platforms since they got it 🙄

I've even stated that I don't do refunds and I've given you guys the platform I've showed you how to use it l. It's not my responsibility to drive customers to your website...  They still want me to do refund for them.... 

Just to keep in mind the market of products they selling is gas guns and safety / self defense items

1bkdhdc,Was I right to terminate my client?,"I had a client that was coming from Wix to WooCommerce (....yeah, sit tight)

They would also often take days to reply to any emails.

We both agreed a formal contract would need to be drawn up, so I decided to explain to them that for our development, we would have 3 seperate stages before delivery. This would include a backend delivery, frontend delivery, and refinement/content stage, and then final delivery date.

During the backend delivery deadline they decided to disappear, and didn't return until a week beyond the final delivery date.

I sent them two seperate emails noting that their feedback was required during the frontend & content stages, and numerous times before & after I reiterated that content may not appear as expected until the content stage, and that if there are any issues I would be able to provide a zoom meeting.

They still didn't return until a week past the final delivery date.

When they returned, their only feedback was anger at the fact I hadn't inserted some initial content correctly exactly how they wanted it for a specific component...despite the fact that numerous times they were told that when it comes down to initial content, this would occur during the refinement/content stage. (in which they were entirely unavailable).

There was absolutely no feedback on basically anything else, backend, frontend, functionality... nothing.

Despite the fact I even offered free zoom meetings during these periods ...and despite the fact I had already made it clear their input would be required when it came to getting the required content right, and that I would be willing to provide unlimited revisions for the specified component...  instead of discussing the issue productively & working with me to revise any misunderstandings, or taking advantage of the fact I offered unlimited revisions for this content-related issue already... they instead proceed to claim I was ""refusing"" to follow instructions, and demanding I immediately follow direct (ambigious) instructions (that would have looked terrible & didn't make sense), instructing me to 'not think', accusing me of performing a botched job, and telling me they know better and that I do not, along with doubting my professionalism and ability to perform the job.

This is despite them having 0 experience in real development, having only used Wix.... and having treated me like a tech support service, previously making phone calls to ask about hardware/software related issues they were having, how to perform tasks in word, excel, and others. At one point even calling me to ask how to switch their laptop on.

Eventually I dedided to call everything off and terminated our contract, due to violation & misunderstanding of 2 different terms & inadequate communication, along with just being a massive headache.

I guess the whole experience has left me frustrated & annoyed, even upset. I have had many successful clients, but never have I terminated a contract.

What would others have done in this situation?

Was I right to terminate a client like this?

1bjfqse,What's the best domain registrar in 2024?,"In the past, I always bought my domains from Google Domains. However, seeing as they were sold to Squarespace, I recently found myself in need of a replacement. I did a bit of looking around and figured that I would share what I learned in case it's helpful to anyone else.

**Best domain registrars**

There were a few registrars that kept showing up more often than any others. They usually had glowing reviews, and few to no complaints. Here they are in approximate order of how commonly they were recommended:

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/)
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
- [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/)
- [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)

One catch with Cloudflare is that you are locked into using their DNS.

**Dishonorable mention**

Most people recommended avoiding GoDaddy due to poor customer service and scummy business practices such as price hikes and buying up domains that people search for.

**Final thoughts**

Instead of looking on a registrar, you can use [ICANN Lookup](https://lookup.icann.org/en) to check domain availability.

Feel free to share your experiences with these registrars or add any options I may have missed in the comments.

Farewell, Google Domains :(

1bixziu,I’m a developer…kinda?,"
I’ve had this idea for a job board for forever.  But everyone was way too expensive to hire. So I started teaching myself coding at the middle of last year.   The journey had been up and down, but now I’m at a point where I’m comfortable with front end development.  The problem is, now I need to learn the back end, and I am very burnt out after spending all my nights and some weekends to get to where I’m at now.  So I’ve been looking at different options, here they are:

1. Pay $10,000 for someone to start my project and hopefully have a mvp by the end of it.  I have a better job now, so I can save the money in probably a few months
2. Continue to learn, whether it be self learning or taking a class.  Self learning is cool, but I have no one to ask questions to.  And taking a class would take far too long.  

Those both are a little far away for my liking.  So, I thought of a new idea today!  I thought about just hiring a backend developer.  I could build the front, which would save me lots of money, and someone could do the backend.  The only issue is, I have no idea on how to hire a backend developer.  Do I hire a company?  Do I try and get a freelancer?  If so from where?  I’ve looked at fivver and that option doesn’t work for me because I need someone I can have a conversation with and I don’t understand accents very well in learning environments.  Upwork seems promising, but I have my doubts.

Why do webdevs use that formatting language in forum software, Reddit or other applications now, instead of the good old BBCode or plain HTML?

Of course I can't speak for others, but personally I always find Markdown to be unintuitive to use  compared to HTML or BBCodes as there is no ""system"" behind it, so to say. In HTML or BBCode, all tags follow a logical system, where in Markdown, basically random punctuation symbols are used, which sometimes conflict with actual written text - I have seen quite a few instances where unintentional ordered lists were created by simply having a number followed by a sentence-ending dot, or where a whitespace at the start of a line messed up a post by causing it to be treated like code.       
In addition, I regularly read complaints in Reddit comments about longer posts lacking paragraphs, where the issue simply was that the OP did not know that they have to double-tap Enter to create a new paragraph. Things like that never happened with BBCode in forums, because a [b] or [list] never is part of actual written text, and to create code blocks, you had to write a [code].

1b7urk0,"Isn't CSS more ""declarative"" than CSS in JS?","Modern JS frameworks like React and Vue pride themselves on allowing the developer to only modify data, causing the UI to update automatically as a function of the data. The flow of logic is unidirectional.

In that sense, why not just update the data fields of the DOM (class, name, etc), and let the CSS automatically update the UI?

At the end of the day, CSS in JS is still a unidirectional data flow, except instead of purely relying on built in CSS logic, you're relying on a combination of JS logic (the returned display is a function of the state of the data) and CSS logic.

So perhaps the only true difference / preference for CSS in JS is that users prefer to reason in JS rather than CSS? Does that mean that if one has a strong mastery of CSS, that CSS in JS is a worse solution?",2024-03-06 08:30:58

1bhuj5w,What specific topics or features do you find frustrating when a jr frontend developer doesn’t understand ,"One of the biggest pain points I hear about junior developers are their lack of understanding of the fundamentals. 

In the world of front end development I believe the fundamental languages are html css and JavaScript. Most roadmaps and videos do a good job of listing the topics needed to learn for each of these languages, but don’t really give you clear expectations of what you should realistically be able to build as a competent junior front end developer.

If a junior wants to truly build real fundamentals skills and be able to apply them in the real world what features should they be able to build in your opinion?

These hopefully 🙏 can range from “I expect a junior to answer this question or implement this feature with relatively low effort” to “While I still expect you to be able to answer or build this, as a junior I expect some difficulty.”",2024-03-18 16:11:21

1bdbtm9,Do you or your friends use social networks given what you know as devs?,"Probably a bit of a loaded question but I wanted to discuss something as devs because we get a first class seat to understanding how our technology works under the hood. 

Over the years I have increasingly gained a bitter taste in my mouth regarding social networks. The landscape is significantly different that what it used to be. Does anyone else feel the same way -- a wave of uneasiness  when using social networks?  


I'm not one of those types that are hardcore anti the technology, or want to be radical in hating on social networks themselves, but I cant help but wanting more when it comes to my current experiences. To be honest I just don't feel safe using social networks in terms of the data responsibilities, lack of control, inauthentic experiences, and so on.   


Have you coped or changed your behavior or relationships with social networks over your careers as devs? Do you (like me) stopped using networks, or have any friends that have just stopped or people in your friend groups that are hard to contact as a result?

1bcvda7,Am I charging too little for this kind of site?,"So, probably a generic post you guys get a lot but I’m curious if I should be upping my prices, or remaining the same for the local market / use cases my customers have.

I run a business in which I make websites for short term rentals(Vacation Homes, Trailer Rental Properties etc). I developed a small “engine” of sorts which is essentially a back end with a decent API that allows you to take in direct bookings and manage these in an AirBNB like manner. It’s pretty straightforward and I’ve come up with a method in making these sites so I can usually throw one together pretty good in about a month or less with all the bells and whistles. I usually do this from scratch atop a framework with my engine.

Now, I usually charge minimum of about $4k for these sites and will float around that price for most small, locally owned businesses. My reasoning for these prices is generally because I live in a “low” cost of living area and local businesses around here usually don’t have the funds to shell out $8-10k for a website, especially if they’re just getting started. They will usually go to a template firm around my area which will charge $2k for a slapped together website from a template with some plugins then call it a day. Customers oftentimes compare my price to theirs asking why I charge so much. Should I still charge this price to remain competitive, while also not undervaluing myself too much, or should I increase my prices? I’m also thinking of keeping these prices for my first 3-4 clients then upping the price once I have something to show off and justify the cost. I am trying to build a decent portfolio for my business, while also being attractive to smaller rental businesses. Any advice on this would be much appreciated. 

Edit: to clarify a little more, I’m not necessarily losing customers due to these other firms, I just at times need to explain more how they’re getting their value from this compared to a short lived 1 week project.",2024-03-12 11:51:32

1bd08cv,Large file hosting problem. Perplexed but thinking of self-hosting. How do you guys do it?,"Hey, I haven't handled such a job before, its sorta weird in that it sounds easy at first.

Client says: ""I have 20TB of data (zip files, each ~2GB) that'd be served to ~1000 different centres in one large country (no one is gonna be on the other side of the globe or way too far). Each client will download ~10GB of data/day. Help me host.""

I was like, eh, simple, throw the files in S3, or if client is particularly feeling like it, Google Drive's paid plans. Anyway, I hop into the cost calculator on S3 and the egress rates stack up pretty soon haha. Its $6000/month (1000 users * 20 GB/day * 30 days * 0.01$/GB)! Other cloud services also rack up pretty similar charges unless I'm forgetting to check some popular service.

The download speed isn't that high of a concern, it seems, so I was thinking this:

1. Buy 10 $500 boxes and turn them into NASes, each with a complete mirror of his 20TB data (the parts list comes close to $500 exact for this, with some extra cold spare drives).
2. Get static IP commercial connections (10 connections @$50/month = $500/month)
3. ???? (some software solution here, which is where my programming work comes in. P2P? IPFS? Just a simple webpage that links to one of the 10 hosts randomly or by querying the current network congestion of that host, something?)
4. Profit.

This comes down to $5000 one time investment, and $500 +electricity/month to keep it going. Am I being insane for not using AWS or similar or is this plan good? The 10 servers would be geographically separated as well, so there's no issue of a single outage taking down everything.

IF you think this idea can work, do you have any suggestions for the software stack? I was looking at https://annas-blog.org/how-to-run-a-shadow-library.html for inspiration so far, but I'd love to bounce some ideas here. Have you had to solve something like this before?",2024-03-12 15:38:23

Hi,

Been trying to scrape facebook events. However it is as if facebook changes where the elements on the page is located. Sometimes I manage to go further in my program, sometimes it crashes right at the beginning since it can't find the element I'm looking for.

For example, this is the xpath's for the same button on an event page (see more button for the description):

//\*\[@id=""mount\_0\_0\_kc""\]/div/div\[1\]/div/div\[3\]/div/div/div\[1\]/div\[1\]/div\[2\]/div/div/div/div/div\[1\]/div/div/div/div\[7\]/div/span/div\[2\]/div

The xpaths were extracted from by just checking manually. I'm using java selenium and chromedriver.

Is there anyway I can get around this? I have not tried using proxies or going headless and stuff like that, but I doubt that would change anything? What are my alternatives?

FYI: I'm trying to scrape events data, like location, description, host, time, title. I get the links for each event by going to a [https://www.facebook.com/""hostname""/upcoming\_hosted\_events](https://www.facebook.com/%22hostname%22/upcoming_hosted_events). and then getting all the links from there, which always work. However it is when I then go to the seperate links that I run into issues.

1bcrn8f,How common are remote dev environments?,"I recently became part of a commercial tech project which uses a very strange dev setup:

* Nobody runs the project locally during the dev process.
* For every git branch, an instance of the project is spun up in a container. 
* If you want to test out some frontend code you've written with a casual log, you have to pull, commit & push first, and then wait for the container to restart (10-20 seconds)
* If you'd like to do the same for backend code, you'll also need to `ssh` into the container where the branch is hosted and read from a log file.

Idk, maybe I lack experience, but this feels terrible. I've always thought of commits and pushes as a thoughtful act. Instead, the commit history literally looks like ""started adding feature"", ""logs"", ""logs"", ""debug"", ""debug"", etc. The multistep process + the wait for the container to spin up isn't how I visualized working on a commercial tech project.

1bl0a9v,AI Will Increase Demand for Quality Developers? Thoughts?,"
Curious as to your thoughts about something, hear me out...

Just finished developing a new online operation.  Not massive or overly complex, but good size and consisted of lots of small details that I had to get right otherwise the entire effort would have been worthless as the quality of the end project simply wouldn't have been there.

While finishing, I was envisioning a future when these AI bots are actually good at typing code versus today's version of them which are basically useless.  I couldn't stop thinking that to get all these small details hammered out with the quality I need, I would have to put a huge number of hours into never ending prompts, probably just as much if not more time than simply typing the code myself.

In the future when this most likely becomes an actual scenario, there will be three options:

1. Spend large number of hours giving never ending prompts until all small details are ironed out, and the quality is there.

2. Type the code yourself, again ensuring quality is there.

3. Shrug your shoulders, say ""good enough"" as it only took mere minutes to get 70% of the way there and view t as a waste of time to put a week into getting everything 100% correct, resulting in a lower quality end product.

I'm guessing many if not a majority of people will opt for the third option, resulting in a cricular spiral downwards.  For one, AI will be training on AI generated code, so will be training itself on lower quality code from there on in.  Plus many developers will learn on AI too heavily, and either their skills will get rusty over time, or newer developers simply won't ever bother learning all the nuances and complexities of proper quality software code.

Give this a while, and employers, clients and business owners are most likely going to start getting frustrated because we'll be in a world where quality developers who actually know how to code are running low as too many developers have become accustomed to only copy and paste from AI, their skills are no longer that great.  As an end result, quality developers will once again be in high demand.

What are your thoughts about this?",2024-03-22 14:15:37

&#x200B;

It took us an astounding 14 attempts and almost 3 months to pass the API App Review. For context, our API use case is fairly standard. All we require is to fetch Instagram comments on our users' own posts – as simple as that.

&#x200B;

I felt the reviewers didn't not understand ANYTHING about Graph API itself. They're basically following a prefixed script to reject any applications that are NOT demonstrating a short list of predefined behaviors. For example, fetching IG comments requires \`pages\_show\_list\` permission per official API doc but our app has absolutely nothing to do with FB pages. Still, they wanted us to prove we have a valid use case for FB pages to be approved.

1bhra9b,Received an offer as a student,"Hey, i'm a student and a friend of mine received an offer to make an application for a restaurant to manage their personnel. Now he asked me and a friend to hop on and help him make it but we are considering our options of what to make it with and I wanted to get some feedback on our options. 

&#x200B;

**How we should make it**

So we were thinking of making it exclusively for that restaurant or making it more general so that other businesses can also use our app. 

We are more fond of making it work for multiple businesses so that we can make a business of our own out of it. This would require more work though. This would mean we have the option of letting them fund us while we develop this app and they would get shares in return or if they accept just use the app for free forever. The other option is that we just make it in our free time without funding and that would mean more risk for us because we basically have to handle everything including creating a company but then we are sure we would have full control of the application.

The other option of making it only for that restaurant would mean we get guaranteed funding but then we won't be able to expand it and they would own the app we develop.

&#x200B;

**With what we should make it**

We would make an website as dashboard that communicates with an API. For the api we are considering using c#, laravel and expressjs because that's the languages we know. I'm personally not a fan of laravel because of the speed but that's the easiest one out of our options to make it in based on all 3 of us our experience. 

As for the database I was thinking of putting all the personnel data inside of a mongodb and for the configuration use MySQL but I don't know if that's the best option or if we could just go fully on MySQL or MongoDB.

The frontend we were thinking of making it as a progressive web application or as a flutter app. We don't have experience in flutter and with pwa but we do have a lot of experience in html.

Keep in mind that after this year we have 1 more year of studying and then we would go work/start our own company or something. So if we would want to start a company now would be the best time because we have a lot of helplines we can turn to. And it's much cheaper.

1bmyxih,My Ip address has been blacklisted by my host!,"Please help shed some light on this!

 I just switched website providers to A2 Hosting and when I try to login with the right password to cPanel, but it denies me access multiple times, then I lose access to the site editor and the dashboard and A2 Hosting reports their website is down.

I figure that that's the issue, but then their support contacts me with this. I've never encountered anything like this across all my website providers, and I'm paying top dollar for business hosting, how can they think a 30 day fix is reasonable? What are my options here? They didn't offer anything but a temporary solution.

I included their email to me below if anyone wants to take a peak. Thank you

**It seems that your last known public IP address \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has been listed in the server firewall - Imunify - global list. This seems to be related to the IP reputation itself and sadly, it cannot be delisted. As a workaround I have added the temporary exclusion specifically on the server you have with us. Also, you are able to add this exclusion in the Customer Portal on my.a2hosting.com for 30 days following these steps:**  
**1- Log in to the customer portal at my.a2hosting.com**  
**2- From the top menu bar, click “Services”, then from the expanded menu click “My Services”**  
**3- Select the shared or reseller account you want to check if the ip is blocked on**  
**4- Scroll down to the “Check Blocked IPs” section**  
**5- Input the IP you want to check, the current IP of the device you are using will be populated in the box**  
**6- Once you input the IP you want to check, click the “Check IP” button and the system will check the server to see if the ip you input is blocked.**  
**7- If the IP address is blocked, the “The IP address is currently blacklisted message”**  
**8- To whitelist the IP, simply click “Add to Whitelist” and the system will unblock your IP address.**  
**9- Once whitelisted, the system will display a confirmation message “The IP address has been added to the whitelist”**

1bgev8r,Introducing EmailBuilder.js – a free and open-source email template builder,"If you've ever had to write HTML/CSS for emails before, you know it's tables all the way down. 

While there are some component libraries that help with this, we wanted to take a more no-code approach to building templates so non-devs can contribute to the template content. This was the reason for our main product, however, we recently decided to open-source a community version of our much-loved email template builder.

We call it [EmailBuilder.js](https://emailbuilderjs.com/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js), [Playground](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reservation-reminder)). It's a powerful block-based email builder that takes the best parts of other open source libraries like [Editor.js](https://editorjs.io/) and email component libraries and puts them into an easy to use no-code builder.

The output is a well structured JSON file or HTML that renders well on across modern email clients and devices. We can all finally start building better product emails without the need to use 90's style HTML and CSS 😵‍💫

Since the builder is completely free and open source, teams can self-host and extend the builder as needed.

Be sure to give it a spin on our playground/demo with some of our sample templates:

* [Welcome email](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/welcome)
* [One-time passcode (OTP)](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/one-time-password)
* [Reset password](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reset-password)
* [E-commerce order receipt](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/order-ecomerce)
* [SaaS subscription receipt](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/subscription-receipt)
* [Reservation reminder](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reservation-reminder)
* [Post metrics report](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/post-metrics-report)
* [Respond to message](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/respond-to-message)

We'd love to hear what you think and we're excited to see what everyone builds with it.

If you like it, please consider giving it a [star on GitHub](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js) 🌟 (I'm one of the co-authors).

1bo8u0c,Is it possible to have a stable React app?,"I started a hobby [side project](https://www.tinylogger.com) (a distraction-free blogging platform) in 2018. I quickly developed the first set of features in React and Express, but since then I've spent a **ridiculous** amount of time just keeping up to date with the changes in the React ecosystem:

* refactoring with function-style React with hooks
* installing Redux Toolkit, ripping it out, and using Context instead
* using `styled-components`, then ripping that out and going with `tailwind`
* moving from Create React App to Vite

I don't think I'm jumping on the ""hot new thing""; every technology choice I made seemed to be widely accepted in the React community (that month.) 

As a result, **I spend like 30% of my time developing features and 70% fixing my tooling**. That's ridiculous! By contrast, I have an app I built in 2017 with JS/jQuery/HTML/SASS that I haven't needed to touch. It's not pretty but it's stable.

I love React's approach to modular UI, but is it even possible to build a stable app? (Please think twice before suggesting *another* framework - I'm scarred from rewriting my app!!)

---

**Update:** thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful responses. I'm impressed with the quality of the conversation here, and it's given me a lot to think about. I think the biggest misconception is that when a new version of a tool comes out, or even when a library stops being supported (like Create React App), staying on the outdated version will break my app because other tools won't support it anymore, or that the expectation is that everyone who uses the tool will update. I think the ecosystem can be pretty persuasive with its marketing, introducing new features as ""the right way to do things"", which has had me scrambling from one technology to another. But a lot of your points around PM/dev tradeoff decisions are helpful to hear.",2024-03-26 14:09:47

Because the Next.js docs suck.

I'm a dev who's been writing HTML/CSS/JS since the days of Geocities.. Professionally I've mostly worked with Angular, which is a framework I still most love to work with, but throughout the years I've used countless libraries and frameworks.

Never, ever, have I used something so frustrating like Next.js. I never really liked React, but this is... next level.

Is it just me, or is this normal? People criticize Angular for having a lot of ""magic"", and for having a steep learning curve, but damn... either those people never tried Next.js, or they have gotten so used to the horrendous dev experience.

Magic directory structures (app vs pages), magic filenames, magic functions, next/router vs next/navigation, obscure errors when importing React components, ...

I just find it mentally very taxing to be working with a framework that does both client and server. I much rather have my client code cleanly separated from my API code. Or a clean MVC framework where you are never in doubt where the views are, and what is done server-side. This mixed model is incredibly confusing.

As you can see, the timestamps are irregular enough. I am sure these accounts are spam because:
1. All of these users have email addresses that, when Googled, are on the open-web (so they've likely been scraped and picked-up for spamming).
2. None of these users ever verify their email address,
3. None of these users show up in HotJar or in Analytics data

The only downside so far (other than having a bunch of fake accounts) seems to be that my email spam rating has gone up (the verify-your-account emails are sent, and I guess those users mark it as spam).

So, a couple of questions:
1. What is even the point of such an attack from an attackers perspective?

1bgxvrh,I created a Vue like Web Framework using my own programming language,"Hey everyone, I've been working on a semi large project using my own programming language [Vortex](https://github.com/dibsonthis/Vortex) as a way to stress test the language. It's a simple web framework called Whirlwind, very similar to Vue, but written completely in Vortex. It works alongside the WebAssembly version of the language.

Whirlwind achieves reactivity through a core concept in Vortex called hooks. Hooks are simply controlled side-effects that fire when a variable is either accessed (onAccess) or modified (onChange). The current implementation of Whirlwind leverages hooks quite heavily, but the reactive system can be quite complex to debug and reason about. It uses nested hooks (i.e we check if a variable already has a hook, if it does, we fire the original hook at the beginning of the new hook, then fire the rest of the new hook's code), and it becomes a bit of a black box.

The next iteration of Whirlwind will have a much simpler reactive system. Still using hooks, but in a more controlled and visible way.

Here's an example of a simple component:

    import [component, value] : whirlwind
    
    const template = `

            data.title = parent.nameDiv.nameInput.value()
            parent.nameDiv.nameInput.update({

            })
        },
    })
    
    const SimpleComponent = component(template, data, methods)

Notice that each component (much like Vue) has a HTML-like template, a data object, and a methods function that returns an object of methods that act on that data.

Most of the reactivity happens with the data object. Whirlwind sets onChange hooks on the data behind the scenes that causes the elements to update and re-render accordingly.

This is what the simple component looks like:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/kksnaqonewoc1.gif

You'll also notice that the template uses a `prop.color` variable. This means that when we use a SimpleComponent anywhere in another template, we'll need to send in a color property. This is how the component is declared in the parent template:

    <div className: app>
        <SimpleComponent color: black />
    </div>

Here's a brief breakdown of the different things you can do in Whirlwind:

&#x200B;

* Inline styles: Using the `$` symbol we can declare inline styles on an element, i.e `$color: red`
* Custom IDs: Using `#` symbol we can add an ID to an element, that can then be referenced by our methods. In the example above, we get to a nested element using the IDs we declare in the template, ie. `parent.nameDiv.nameInput.value()`
* Event handling: Using the `@` symbol, we can declare event handlers. We can handle click, onblur, oninput, onmouseenter, onmouseleave events etc. We can also handle custom events that are emitted from other components. Ie. `@click: updateTitle`
* Props and normal HTML attributes: If we don't use a symbol, we can pass in normal HTML attributes (using JS attribute syntax, eg. className instead of class). If it's a custom component, those attributes become props that we can use inside the component.
* Conditional rendering: We can use the `%if` directive to conditionally render an element, i.e `%if: showDiv`
* Loops: We can iterate over a list in our data using the `%for` directive, i.e `%for ""someList, val""`

Here's a small demo of some of the functionality we can achieve in Whirlwind:

1bgqah5,At what point are vector images less performant than raster images?,"Hi all! I'm rebuilding my website. I want to show off some projects of mine but would like to have my site run as quick as possible for as many people as possible.

I was planning on recreating a layout from my mobile app as a vector graphic (with no gradients or filters), but I was wondering if this was going to be too computationally expensive and would be worse for performance than just a raster screenshot. If not, then at what complexity point would you consider that happening (if I were to not use filters or anything but just shapes)?

Also, the font that will be displayed in those vector images (if they do turn out to be the better option for performance) will have a font that will already have been loaded on the page. In that case, it's better (and possible) to just link the already-loaded font to the vector, right? Or would converting the text to outlines be better? Thanks!",2024-03-17 05:39:54

Unified Platform: Looking to deploy both frontend and backend on the same platform for simplicity.

Monitoring: Would be nice to have built-in monitoring tools to track app performance and health.

Version Management: Need the ability to manage preview and production environments easily, similar to Vercel's workflow.

Containerization is not a limitation.

1bslonl,How do you keep front end validations on sync with backend validations?,"I am building an Angular + SpringBoot full stack app, and I am wondering what is the correct way to keep form validations on sync between them.

Let me explain

Let's suppose the backend allows usernames to have maximum length of 20. Now the front end should validate a max length of 20 in the username field. But the thing is, if / when the backend changes (for whatever reason) max length for example to 15 only, then you might forget about updating the front end as well. And now the frontend accepts 20 as max length, while the backend is more restrictive with 15 as max length. You lost the sync between the two, and it might become a bug if you dont update the frontend as well to have a max length of 15 too.

Now, this kind of disparity between backend validations and frontend validations could grow exponentially, the more fields / forms you have, the greater the chance some of them become not synchronized to each other. If you forget to sync both validations at same time, you might get some unexpected behaviour.

So how do you do this in your apps? How do you keep frontend validations on sync with backend validations?

Also, is it just acceptable to avoid the problem as a whole and just validate on the backend?",2024-03-31 21:37:47

1bnrtnw,The pros and cons of different niches a solo developer/designer could target,"I know HTML, CSS, JS, React and I'm learning design + UX/UI etc. I'm hoping to start working as a solo designer/developer eventually. I also love making animations and have illustration skills so I hope I can work that into my offer.

I've been looking around at what other people are doing and these seem like the two main options:

**Small businesses**

Pros:

* A lot of small businesses need better websites

* They often just need simple static sites, so would be easier to use templates and manage a higher volume of clients. Maybe a rinse and repeat process for each

* There would be preset packages, no negotiating around price/scope of work

* Might be better for work/life balance, in that it could eventually be somewhat automated, without stressful deadlines for a big client, etc.

Cons:

* Charge less

* Lead gen could be rough, possible cold calling etc.

* A lot of education needed to show small business owners why paying more for a better site is worthwhile

* The sales pitch is a better site will help generate more leads, but you can't actually promise or guarantee that

* Might need to manage, or help them manage, ongoing content to help with their SEO

**Funded startups, larger companies**

Pros:

* They already understand the value of a well made site. The funnel is shorter. So the sales pitch is just about why your skills/price are the best

* Funner to design - maybe get to do illustrations and animations

* Learn more through more complex builds

* Charge more

Cons:

* I have no idea how you'd start getting clients in this niche as a beginner. Maybe posting on LinkedIn, emailing startups once you have portfolio sites, or starting with small businesses and working your way up to larger companies.

* Lots of competition from the new design/dev monthly subscription model (?) and bigger agencies

* There seems to be a lot of overlap here with branding design, which I know nothing about

* Projects are possibly higher stress

* More work could be needed to negotiate and scope proposals

I got some solid advice that you won't really know if a niche is viable for you until you try it, so start, try a few industries, and be ready to pivot. However I'm also still curious if my take on the pros/cons of these niches is correct. What did I miss or get wrong? Are there other niches I'm not aware of?

Last time around, I had a realization that I’m fairly algorithmic with my recommendations: I gather information about their preferences and functional needs and then match those to options I can find online.

This website ([https://easylaptopfinder.com](https://easylaptopfinder.com)) attempts to provide a simple UI to intake information about what someone needs and apply the results to a matching algorithm against a list of products.

These design are pretty much unique, and it is incredibily hard to replicate them with interface tools such as Gutenberg blocks or elementor without injecting my custom code or css full of !important clauses, which results in an unconsistent mess.

I am currently looking for a CMS which allows me to fully design the layout with full code (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript... I'm willing to learn other languages such as Python or Ruby if necessary). However, the managers of my office don't like this idea because most of our projects require customization freedom so our customers can fully change elements such as text, colors, images... any time.

The website is a complete disaster and I'm constantly mind-blown about how it was built. It is a WordPress/WooCommerce set up on a custom theme with some custom functionality and was built back in 2016. Over time the website has created so much bloat in the database and strain on the server.

When I originally started with the company their website had been down for a week. So I was thrown into this broken bloated mess of a website and had to get it back online. I managed to do so, and then one of the first things I did was contact the host (HostGator) to make sure we had server backups set up correctly as I'm not super well-versed on the server end of things. The host set the backups for us and assured us a backup would be generated every week on Friday. The new backup would replace the old one.

Now here we are. We are running into issues with server RAM and CPU due to how bloated the site is. I contacted the host and although I don't think a backup would be the solution to the problem we are facing, I asked about a backup. Much to my surprise, the last one hadn't been generated since 2022. This was a shocker to me.

In my almost 20 years of doing this stuff, I have never run into this issue. Now I feel guilty as I was completely unaware that backups weren't being generated on the server as they were supposed to.

1bqc1em,How to go from solo dev to working with someone,"Kind a TLDR but I own a company non tech service based company that has 35 employees. The industry is super low tech so as a younger person in the industry, I always hated all the software tools available for our niche. I ended up building my own app for certain things over the last few years in my free time. MERN stack. Front end and backend. The employees really like it and want me to replace more features of the archaic software that they use. But I dont have enough time to run the company and build and maintain this. And there are parts of dev I love and parts I could live without. I don't really know anyone else that codes so long story short, if I wanted to hire someone starting part time dev work, what would everyone recommend.

1. Is there a good place to find freelancers thats not upwork. Hard to weed through so many listings there.
2. How do you safely share things like .env files.
3. Do people normally pay people by the feature or hourly?
4. Whats the easiest and least annoying way to ensure person actually knows what they are doing.

I am seeking honest and constructive opinions on design for the website - creative-data(dot)studio. My customer (I am not involved in the design whatsoever) had quite an extravagant idea when it comes down to layout and design.

&#x200B;

His justification is in the belief of how people should perceive his services. However, I am uncertain if it is effective or appealing to his audience. As you may know, when you work on something you own, you can spend endless hours fine-tuning without realizing when to stop. So, I am seeking your advice. Let's apply Pareto principle - what should be removed, changed, adjusted? What should be left alone as ""good enough"". Please tell me everything that’s not quite right with his website, so I can show him this post with ""what people are thinking"".

&#x200B;

What would you change on the site? Colors, fonts, images, or perhaps the layout? Do you see any flaws in the design? I would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions.

1band7u,[ShowOff Saturday] I'm proud of this app I created to Automatically Censor any video.,"I built an app, just to run locally, that used Transformers.Js to run a Speech to Text Model locally (whisper) to transcribe the video, and I fought with FFMPEG to get the video to censor at word level timestamps that I was able to get from the transcription.
It worked great, but took _forever_.
_And then I thought_, well, other people might want to be able to use this as a service. 

So I've been working on releasing a software as a service to do just that. The super stars of my tech Stack that have made this possible are:

- Wasp Lang. Batteries includes full stack framework. React, Node, Prism. 

- FFMPEG.Wasm. FFMPEG in the browser baby.

- DeepGram, much much much faster STT API. 


Will be providing free access to the beta that will be coming out soon. At least to the first few testers, check it out :)

1b4oi79,What is the best stack for a site: no users / all “static” + some interactive behavior in the UI + must be optimized for SEO?,"(asking for a friend)
  
1. I have a tabular dataset in a google sheet which I update every day. It has about 10,000 records. From this dataset I need a site whose sitemap would come out to about 500 urls in two main categories e.g. /widgets/ and /manufacturers/. The extra records are needed to build tables of data on each of these 500 pages. I need all these 500 pages to be good/great for SEO — separate URLs/meta; fast page load times etc.
  
2. There are no user accounts and the only changes to content are when I update the google sheet.
  
3. On a couple of pages I need a form with about 20 controls (inputs, checkboxes, buttons etc). These trigger a call to a regular REST api for some more data. The backend already exists and returns more tabular data.
  
4. On another 5 pages I need to have some charts from another REST endpoint which already exist and I have a working prototype in vanilla js and chartjs.org.
  
I know all this can be “wrapped up” into a React/spa like:  

* Scrape the google sheets into one big json. 

* Make a React spa to load the entire json (each time). 

* Use React to wrap up the forms in no3 and charts in no4.  

    
But, doing just straight up “regular” React spa alone will be terrible for SEO because of the meta and individual pages will be slow as each would load the entire json of content etc. — is that correct?

1bdjp0o,It's hard to continue building things when you have limited time and resources and the things you've built already didn't have the desired results,"The most common saying on getting experience in this field is to build stuff, however, most people interested in this line of work come from very inimical environments and have very little time on their hands while navigating life in those conditions and on top of that the resources necessary for progress in this field are scarce to them.

Then they do build something, they spend whatever time and resource they can scrap by and build something hoping that would lead to a breakthrough, but days turn to weeks and weeks to months and the thing they built fail to bring the desired result.

It must take a special breed of human being in this situation not to feel depressed and demoralized.

Take me as an example, I'm a Laravel developer with front-end experience as well. I couldn't get a proper foot in because much experience is needed, to gain this experience you need to build side projects, but I think knowing what side projects to build also requires some experience and side projects can take time to complete especially when conditions aren't optimal (so it's a chicken and egg problem).

You might think that being jobless would mean you have a lot of free time on your hands to do anything, but being jobless can also mean being broke, and when you're broke, every waking moment of your life is spent chasing the penny. You can't really be creative when you have to worry about where your next meal is going to come from; among other things.

I, however, felt that building some projects on the front-end might bring the breakthrough I need. So, I set out to build UI Dashboard. I spent a lot of time on it and I am proud of what I made, but the result was abysmal. I barely got 3 stars on GitHub and nobody gave a damn apart from three people. Then I built something similar to tailwind UI for Alpine JS and that was actually better received, it netted me 39 massive stars on GitHub, but still the result I desired from this endeavor still eluded me.

It's been about two years now since those two projects and I am in no better position, both financially and mentally. I don't have any motivation to keep going when I'm not getting any favourable results.

So, maybe that advice is not really the best advice to give to everyone on this path, people face different conditions and challenges and maybe having a harem of sophisticated side projects is not really a good benchmark for hiring a ""junior"" or ""inexperienced"" person.

Edit: the GitHub stars thing is actually dry humor or sarcasm, I'm not quantifying my abilities by how many GitHub stars I have.",2024-03-13 05:26:40

However, there are a few features that are almost right-out-of-the-box for some of the cms backends I used in the past that I do miss.

Chief among them are the ability to easily have contact forms that send emails, and a way to remove the *.html extensions and use subdirectories.

1b6r14p,"Thoughts on ""Ship, Show, Ask""?","I work on a medium-small team with about 15 engineers. Our codebase is just under 10 years old, so while its not ancient, its definitely ""mature"", with all the issues that come with that.

Recently, one of our leads shared [this link](https://martinfowler.com/articles/ship-show-ask.html) to a ""branching strategy"" that favors rapid shipping by encouraging developers to identify whether they should ship (e.g. merge without review), show (e.g. open a PR but still merge without feedback), or ask (e.g. actually wait for reviews).

So I read the article, and for the most part I think this feels reckless, and is basically saying that not checking each other's work is a feature not a bug. I am completely with the author that we should rebase often and never have long term branches, but outside of that I feel like this makes the assumption that everyone on the team always ships perfect code without making a single bonehead mistake. It seems like you _could_ get this to work by having really good automated test coverage, but again, this makes the assumption that no one ever makes mistakes when writing tests. It feels like a great way to introduce a culture of cowboy coding into our codebase really quickly.

Now to be fair, if I was working on a very early-stage startup that consisted of 3 people doing 60 hour weeks to ship an MVP or something, my attitude about this would be very positive. It goes without saying that this would be the best (and probably sanest) way of introducing lots and lots of new code in a very short period of time.

What falls off for me though is that my team is not really a bleeding edge startup like that, and there's lots of legacy code and gotchas that require care and consideration. To make things worse, we just hired a bunch of engineers, effectively more than doubling the size of our front end team in a week.

The lead in question dropped the requirement down from 2 PRs to 1, which I don't love for onboarding but can live with. Then they were trying to convince us to drop it to 0 and to have a team wide meeting where we advertise this new approach the same week all the new hires arrive, despite our original team having never actually tried it. We ultimately punted on talking about it until after they've settled in and we know their coding styles but I know he's going to want to bring it up again soon.

Am I crazy for thinking this is a terrible idea? It's hard for me to distinguish whether I think its a bad idea because of all the new hires or because I hate the idea of shipping unreviewed code in general. This just kind of has a ""move fast break things"" attitude that I don't think at our age and size is a great approach for us. The dev in question who posed this does a lot of internal facing work so I don't think they realize the impact this could have on the customer facing side of the app.

1b9mgci,Need Help: Optimizing MySQL for 100 Concurrent Users,"I can't get concurrent users to increase no matter the server's CPU power.

Hello, I'm working on a production web application that has a giant MySQL database at the backend. The database is constantly updated with new information from various sources at different timestamps every single day. The web application is report-generation-based, where the user 'generates reports' of data from a certain time range they specify, which is done by querying against the database. This querying of MySQL takes a lot of time and is CPU intensive (observed from htop). MySQL contains various types of data, especially large-string data. Now, to generate a complex report for a single user, it uses 1 CPU (thread or vCPU), not the whole number of CPUs available. Similarly, for 4 users, 4 CPUs, and the rest of the CPUs are idle. I simulate multiple concurrent users' report generation tests using the PostMan application. **Now, no matter how powerful the CPU I use, it is not being efficient and caps at around 30-40 concurrent users (powerful CPU results in higher caps) and also takes a lot of time.**

When multiple users are simultaneously querying the database, all logical cores of the server become preoccupied with handling MySQL queries, which in turn reduces the application's ability to manage concurrent users effectively. For example, a single user might generate a report for one month's worth of data in 5 minutes. However, if 20 to 30 users attempt to generate the same report simultaneously, the completion time can extend to as much as 30 minutes. Also, **when the volume of concurrent requests grows further, some users may experience failures in receiving their report outputs successfully.**

I am thinking of parallel computing and using all available CPUs for each report generation instead of using only 1 CPU, but it has its disadvantages. If a rogue user constantly keeps generating very complex reports, other users will not be able to get fruitful results. So I'm currently not considering this option.

Is there any other way I can improve this from a query perspective or any other perspective? Please can anyone help me find a solution to this problem? What type of architecture should be used to keep the same performance for all concurrent users and also increase the concurrent users cap (our requirement is about 100+ concurrent users)?

# Additional Information:

Backend: Dotnet Core 6 Web API (MVC)

**table 48, data length 3,368,960,000, indexes 81,920**  
But in my calculation, I mostly only need to query from 2 big tables:

# 1st table information:

Every 24 hours, 7,153 rows are inserted into our database, each identified by a timestamp range from start (timestamp) to finish (timestamp, which may be Null). When retrieving data from this table over a long date range—using both start and finish times—alongside an integer field representing a list of user IDs.  
For example, a user might request data spanning from January 1, 2024, to February 29, 2024. This duration could vary significantly, ranging from 6 months to 1 year. Additionally, the query includes a large list of user IDs (e.g., 112, 23, 45, 78, 45, 56, etc.), with each userID associated with multiple rows in the database.

|timestamp \[current\_timestamp()\]|
|timestamp NULL|
|double(10,2) NULL|
|int(11) \[1\]|
|int(11) \[1\]|
|int(11) NULL|

# 2nd table information:

The second table in our database experiences an insertion of 2,000 rows every 24 hours. Similar to the first, this table records data within specific time ranges, set by a start and finish timestamp. Additionally, it stores variable character data (VARCHAR) as well.  
Queries on this table are executed over time ranges, similar to those for table one, with durations typically spanning 3 to 6 months. Along with time-based criteria like Table 1, these queries also filter for five extensive lists of string values, each list containing approximately 100 to 200 string values.

1biba55,"Email from web hosting company, looking for advice on how to proceed.","I have a very simplistic website that I started back around 2003, I have never monetized it its just a simple informational website I did for fun.  It gets what I think is a pretty good amount of traffic for what it is even today.    I was originally hosted with Lunarpages, who was sold / merged with HostPapa in September of 2019.

Last week I received an email and then a second similar one that said the following:

  

*I wanted to follow up regarding our previous communication about the inode limits on your account. As mentioned earlier, exceeding these limits can have significant implications for your website's functionality and stability.* 

*In the shared hosting environment, the inode limit is hardcoded. As such, the account will immediately stop working as soon as the limit is reached. This ensures that every user has access to a fair share of server resources, and the server's performance is not impacted by one user's activities.* 

*Even so, we have temporarily withdrawn such limitations to accommodate the resources in our servers in the best way possible. We did not want to impact your business without first reaching out to notify you.*

*I would love to discuss the best possible solution with you, please let me know a good time we can connect over the phone.*

Between a few phone calls and emails it seems that they are all of a sudden saying that basically I have too many files in my website.   What is interesting is that the website has remained wholly unchanged for around 10 years now, and they have never had any issues until last week when I am all of a sudden ""over the limit"".   I have not added any new files for years, so not sure why its all of a sudden an issue.   There have never been any emails or notifications of any sort about this past, including when I renewed the hosting plan for 5 years in February of 2021. 

I have attached an image of some of the website stats, the file count says its currently at 242,120 of infinity which I read as no limit.   Other items have limits, this one says it does not which is also a bit confusing.    They are saying that the limit I am supposed to be under is 150,000, so I am roughly 92,000 files over. 

What does stand out to me is that while I am in year 3 of a 5 year hosting plan, they are trying to get me to upgrade to a higher plan that will allow the number of files I have.   Of course this new plan is more than 3 times more expensive than what my current contract is at.   I suspect they are just trying to get more money out of me.   For comparison, my current prepaid contract is at $4.95 per month for hosting, they want to change it a plan that costs $14.69 per month, which is a discount from the normal cost of $20.99 per month.   

So I am looking for feedback from others that may have knowledge about these sorts of things and advice moving forward as to how I might proceed.

Thanks in advance for any and all help!  ",2024-03-19 03:59:21

1bb0aen,Would web scraping be legal in this particular use case?,"Hi devs,

I have an idea for an app I want to make for storing memes/photos found on social media. Basically, a user finds a photo online they want to save, but instead of saving the whole photo, this app finds the url to the image itself and saves that to the database (or the backend scrapes the link to the image itself from the post's url). Then, when the user opens the app, the app uses the urls to load all the images, allowing the user to avoid filling up their storage with photos that are already hosted online. Users can then use the app to copy a photo to their clipboard to send to their friends. The only monetization for this app would be unlocking features like folders and custom themes, and not monetizing the actual photos.

I did some research into web scraping. Since I am not monetizing the content itself, it's not being republished online, it's all content that's publicly available anyway, and since saving these photos is an action that social media sites allow, I'm assuming that it's technically legal? The only problem I can think of is that if for some reason my app gets popular, it could be argued that I am causing a burden on their servers, although it would be difficult to make anything that compares to the serverload that these huge social media sites already deal with.

Am I right or am I just being naive? I would like your opinions. I think this would be a fun project but I don't want to start on something if it'll end up just being a waste of my time.",2024-03-10 03:19:56

1bqkiyo,How I Built Mailwind: A SaaS Odyssey from Zero to One (User) and the Quest for V2,"A few months back, I was hit with a need for a client: the ability to easily craft transactional emails that could be tweaked and improved without a fuss. My mind immediately went to Tailwind.

After some digging, I stumbled upon Maizzle and thought it was pretty neat. But what I was really hunting for was a cloud solution to this puzzle. So, I rolled up my sleeves and created Mailwind.

Mailwind is a SaaS API that lets you hook up your email provider (think Resend, Sendgrid, etc.), whip up Tailwind layouts & templates, and with just a simple API call, generate and shoot out the email.

Now, here's the kicker—I've got virtually no users (just one paying, bless their soul) besides myself, using it daily for my clients.

I'm currently pouring my heart into developing version 2, packed with features like:

* i18n support
* Asset integration (say goodbye to hosting on Azure Blob, S3, and the like)
* A smoother onboarding experience
* And a whole lot more

I've tried spreading the word on Google, LinkedIn, and even Reddit, but it's been crickets in terms of user sign-ups.

I'd really appreciate your thoughts and feedback!

1bomfne,PSA: Vultr's new TOS gives them full rights to resell your website/app/database contents/etc.,"Last week, when I tried to sign in to my Vultr account I was greeted with a popup demanding that I accept a new TOS to continue.  Being a completely normal person who reads TOS documents when asked to, I skimmed the new TOS to see if there was anything objectionable.

Unfortunately, **the new agreement is requiring us to fork over rights to our apps/software for anything hosted on the Vultr platform**.  That goes way too far.  No other datacenter company requires this. 

Here is the relevant section from Vultr's new TOS:

> information, text, opinions, messages, comments, audio visual works, motion pictures, photographs, animation, videos, graphics, sounds, music, software, Apps, and any other content or material that You or your end users submit, upload, post, host, store, or otherwise make available (“Make Available”) on or through the **Services** (collectively, “Your Content,” “Content” or “User Content”).

> ...

> You hereby grant to Vultr a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and distribute each of your User Content, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, and otherwise use and **commercialize the User Content in any way that Vultr deems appropriate, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you** or to any third parties, for purposes of providing the Services to you.

This is NOT standard contract language for web services.  I don't know of anywhere else that requires this.

For comparison, Digital Ocean specifically limits this clause to uploads on their website (ie, for community articles, forum posts, etc), not for all hosted services (which would include virtual machines, databases, etc).  Additionally, commercialization rights are not granted and it is not perpetual:

Digital Ocean TOS Excerpt:

> We will periodically differentiate between our websites such as digitalocean.com (which we will refer to collectively as the “Websites”) and all of our other services, such as our cloud infrastructure and other paid services (which we will refer to collectively as the “Services”).

> ...

> By providing your User Content to or via the **Websites**, you grant DigitalOcean a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels.

Though requesting limited permissions for the purposes of user uploads on a forum or other community site is fairly standard, it is not reasonable for a service provider partner to require full, irrevocable commercial rights of anything hosted on their services.  That'd let Vultr take and monetize customer databases, apps, software, etc. which almost every business would likely find objectionable.  Vultr needs to restrict their request as is done elsewhere in the industry.

Here is another example -- AWS does not have such broad terms, except for their generative AI product:

> 50.12.7. PartyRock Apps. “PartyRock App” means any application created or remixed through PartyRock, including any app snapshot and all corresponding source code. By creating or remixing a PartyRock App, you hereby grant: (a) AWS and its affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to access, reproduce, prepare derivative works based upon, transmit, display, perform and otherwise exploit your PartyRock App in connection with PartyRock; and (b) anyone who accesses your PartyRock App (“PartyRock Users”), a non-exclusive license to access, reproduce, export, use, prepare derivative works based upon, transmit, and otherwise exploit your PartyRock App for any personal purpose. We may reject, remove, or disable your PartyRock App, PartyRock alias, or PartyRock account at any time for any reason with or without notice to you. You are responsible for your PartyRock Apps, PartyRock Data, and use of your PartyRock Apps, including compliance with the Policies as defined in the Agreement and applicable law. Except as provided in this Section 50.12, we obtain no rights under the Agreement to PartyRock Data or PartyRock Apps. Neither AWS, its Affiliates, nor PartyRock Users have any obligations to make any payments to you in connection with your PartyRock Apps. You will defend and indemnify AWS and its Affiliates for any and all damages, liabilities, penalties, fines, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in any way related to Your PartyRock Apps or your use of PartyRock. Do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information in the input that you provide to create or use a PartyRock App.

Note how the license grant doesn't infect the rest of AWS offerings, but is only restricted to their AI product offering ""PartyRock"".  

It's possible Vultr may want the expansive license grant in order to do AI/Machine Learning based on the data they host.  Or maybe they could mine database contents to resell PII.  Given the (perpetual!) license, there's not really any limit to what they might do.  They could even clone someone's project and sell their own rebranded version, and they'd be legally in the clear.

I sent my objection to Vultr support, but I've just been getting the run around so far.  I've been trying to get them to at least let me access my account without agreeing to the new TOS so I can migrate out to another provider, but I'm now on day 5 of being locked out with no end in sight.  Migrating all my servers and DNS without being able to login to my account is going to be both a headache and error prone.  I feel like they're holding my business hostage and extorting me into accepting a license I would never consent to under duress.  I'm self employed and the product I host (currently) on Vultr is what pays my rent, so not being able to manage it is a pretty serious concern for me.

Anyway, I don't know what Vultr's plans are, but I think it's definitely worth pushing back on this overly expansive license grant they're giving to themselves.  If Vultr gets away with it, other hosts may try to sneak it into their contracts, too",2024-03-26 23:16:12
1bo45py,I'm wondering how this effect could be created using CSS only or even CSS with JavaScript,"[Here's the site](https://www.hyggecafes.com/cafe) which contains the effect

It's this effect on the images where it moves in the background as you scroll

My initial idea is (And I'm still not advanced as a Front-end dev) that we could throw them behind everything using the `z-index` property as well as `position: fixed` and then use a transparent `div` element over them, but if we do it this way the images will not follow the div element and the effect will not work how we want it to.

Do you have any suggestions on how we could achieve this type of effect?

1bdhtj0,Do You Test Your Tests?,"Sometime back I found some year-old test code that ALWAYS returned SUCCESS, regardless of the actual functionality. Turns out, someone added a quick return SUCCESS; at the beginning to disable it, but then...well, let's just say it never got fixed.

This got me thinking: TDD emphasizes writing failing tests first, but what about the flip side?  Do we ever test that our tests actually fail when they should?  It feels like there's way more edge cases to consider compared to just checking a test passes.

Even scarier: what about tests that start passing for the wrong reasons after a code change?  Did they magically fix a bug, or are they just masking a new issue?

Ideally, shouldn't tests be held to the same standard as any other code?  Maybe with their own unit tests?

Anyone have good practices for keeping their tests in check?  Share your war stories (and hopefully success stories) in the comments!

I've been coding for years, but let's just say that my experience is \*ehem\* antiquated.

It's incredibly tedious to built everything from hand and slow. There has to be a better way.

What would be the ""easiest"" framework for me to get up and running? I want to minimize dev time and learning curve as much as possible.

I keep hearing about Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, etc, etc and I'm quite overwhelmed. I know pretty much any tool can build anything, but what's something that can get me going quickly and won't be a waste to learn for the forseeable future?

I won't lie that the batteries included part looks cool with the django admin panel and all (though I tend to be weary of magical APIs).

But since we only need an API, he suggested DRF. Which looks to me kind of ass-backwards as they took a fullstack-monolith framework like Django and twisted it to behave like a REST API. I guess it's amazing if you're a django veteran looking to build modern REST API. But is it good if you never used django?

IMO if you want to hammer in a nail, you use a hammer. Not the butt of a screwdriver. But then again, i'm a junior maggot so i'd love to hear some insights on using tools repurposed tools (i.e. django retooled to be only an API in the form of DRF) as opposed to something like FastAPI or Flask.",2024-03-08 08:01:09
1b782sx,Re: WebDevDaily.io is a waste of time,"Earlier, I came across a post within this group regarding a platform I created called [WebDevDaily.io](https://webdevdaily.io/).

I'm not entirely sure what the content was within the post since it was deleted, but based on the replies i wanted to respond for clarification.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1b7002w/webdevdailyio\_is\_a\_waste\_of\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1b7002w/webdevdailyio_is_a_waste_of_time/)

WebDevDaily is a coding challenge platform offering front-end challenges for those unaware.

Yesterday, we pushed out an update that changed the frequency of the challenge releases. They went from every 24 hours to every 7 days. (Challenges are now released on Mondays at 8 a.m. EST.)

Moving away from ""daily challenges"" was mainly based on sustainability. We can provide higher-quality challenges with tasks and assets by moving to weekly challenges. (Which was a highly requested feature).

The most frustrating part for this user was streaks. The streaks have not been removed; it was just a bug with our recent release, and we are working on fixing that.

WebDevDaily is free to use, although we do have a pro version. However, this does not limit the general concept of the platform. It just provides some extra perks. 

I created the platform to explore learning about creating a SaaS and provide a way for developers to practice coding! This post probably did not need a reply, but I wanted to give some insight.

1brdvi7,How liable are devs to lack of resourcing around security practices if something goes wrong?,"My company is about to release a new product, we've already have some so nothing big. 

Also not first time me sending things to production either but I'm at the point now where i'm senior enough that I feel I need to start challanging management for any gaps I see in terms of security, mainly because I'm not really seeing anyone else doing it, like I might have before. 

With that said, we are mainly a JS shop but conerns would be:

* Time spent reviewing current NPM package scans (Snyk or otherwise) and producing a reasonable report or checking realistic current threats. In addition to the context they run i.e. you server, the clients device etc..
* Implementing more prudent session handling i.e. JWT vs cookies vs shortening logout/renewal time, stuff

It's a startup, resources are tight, several months a go many devs were indeed let go.

HOWEVER security isn't that bad, we have tokens, domain locks, two factor auth, https (duh), policies on servers set, ""least access needed"" policies, some reviews of packagee, not TOO many third party scripts, static scan in CI/CD...however I am a nervous person.

My mind still sometimes goes towards imagining dramatic arguements where I exclaim ""I don't care if we don't have enough customers, I don't care money is running out, it's your fault for pivoting too much and not having the apptitude to sell what we made over the first several years...I will not be liable to the lack of resources allocated to reasonable security practices, I will not be labelled as a negilgent developer"".

1blt693,How to find clients who can appreciate quality?,"I've been a full-stack freelance web developer since 2008, primarily working for agencies specializing in highly complex web applications and high-quality websites.

I've always been a perfectionist, prioritizing quality over quantity. Through these agencies, I've delivered projects for banks, requiring websites to pass multiple security audits, government projects requiring a11y audits, and large companies with insane performance and SEO requirements.

Due to this focus, I consistently deliver high-quality work, even if the client doesn't explicitly request it.

However, at this point, I'm ready to switch from working for agencies to launching my own website and seeking clients directly.

To research the competition, I did a google search. After reviewing 40 random results from the first 200, I was shocked (I live in Hungary, your results may vary).

The competition is absolutely terrible. Out of the 40, I'd trust perhaps 2-3 to deliver the quality I was producing a decade ago. In fact, I think my 83-year-old neighbor could create better results after a weekend of learning WP with Bricks. This is obviously an exaggeration, but not by much.

So, what should I do? I feel like I'm not even doing the same job as these people, but apparently this is what the market wants.

I have no idea how I can compete with them. I don't usually provide CMS to my clients because they can't maintain the quality I deliver. And now I somehow have to compete with people who primarily work with WP and premade themes and plugins.  

(Please don't be angry at me if you work with WP and premade themes, there's nothing wrong with that if you know what you're doing.)

To find clients who can appreciate what I can provide, I would first need to educate them about things like what a static site is, how performance can affect user satisfaction, how UX influences user experience, and how a11y can broaden their client base.

But the difference between what I offer and the competition is not even just these things. I can't even articulate it but I can give examples: some competitors' websites have non-clickable logos, no hover effect on buttons, contact forms without any kind of validation, dropdown menus which disappear when you try to click on them, etc.

How could I educate a client about, let's say, the importance of mouse-free navigation when they typically expect and apparently happy with a barely functioning navigation with a mouse? How could I persuade them of the benefits of high performance, like appropriate image sizes and formats when they seem content with a 3.4mb png on the front page?

Honestly, some of the aspects I consider quality surpass even this specialized community. For example, a normal button to me doesn't just have a hover state; it has different properties depending on pointer media query, hover media query, active state, focus, and focus-visible states. But to the average user this is just a button. it's hard to explain why it's better, and this is just a small example, there are hundreds of things like this.

I have no idea what to do. I feel it's pointless to even try. What I deliver wouldn't even necessarily be more expensive but somehow I still need to differentiate myself, and I have no idea how to do that given the huge difference between me and the competition.

I could probably try to find clients in a more advanced country, I think my written english at least is good enough for that, but I suspect that I would have the same problem there as well just to a lesser extent.

Apologies for the length of the post and sorry if I seemed to be bragging, if you saw my competition you would understand.  

I would appreciate any advice.",2024-03-23 14:14:43

What I mean is... There seems to be consider improvements in other technologies (like consumer electronics for example) but web hosting tech appears to have stayed predominantly the same over the past decade with shared hosting, cloud hosting, and VPSs unchanged.

I'm here with a followup on my post earlier: [https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1bhra9b/received\_an\_offer\_as\_a\_student/](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1bhra9b/received_an_offer_as_a_student/)

So first of all we wanted to give a bit more info about the company we are going to make it for. The company will have more than 100 employees and it has multiple investors behind it. They would want the application to be done by next year because that will be the time they open their doors.

Now we decided (as a lot of people suggested) to make it specifically for the company that asked us but we will still tell them our idea of making it more scalable in the future. We will also be sticking to MySQL for the database and Laravel as backend and then seperate Vue.js projects for the required dashboards.

Now we are still wondering if we should make the app for the employees it into a PWA app or make a flutter application. It would require a calendar integration and I read that that is kind of hard to do so we are still contemplating which one we should choose for the app.

And lastly we were also wondering what price we should ask them for this application since we know that this would be a costly application in a professional setting but since we are just 3 students we are kinda lost here.

I know that giving a price for this is hard so here is some more information on what exactly we will be making.

**Restaurant Dashboard**

* Manage employees (flex and permanent employees)
* Upload shift tables for permanent employees

**Employee APP**

* Flex employees
   * Select when to work
* Permanent employees
   * Give available hours
* Both
   * See total hours
   * Total earned
   * Some other stats

We don't have to use an algorithm to make the shift tables, they would do that themselves and they would upload that to the app for their permanent employees to see.

There will also be a system in  place for more experienced employees to get paid more. (we don't have to manage payments)

They would allso have multiple rooms inside of 1 building

P.S.:  We are in the same class and our graduation topic is Software and AI development so not Full Stack but we have been studying IT for 4-5 years with quite a bit of projects done. Right now we are also working on a website for a festival with 2 webshops in laravel.",2024-03-18 20:06:41

1bmz4en,"Request library doesn't work for 8080 but works for other ports. FastAPI, Uvicorn","Hi community,

I am building a uvicorn fastapi server - client model. My code was working fine on port 8080 and I decided to add CORSMiddleware to my application to avoid the cors error.

\# app.add\_middleware(  
\#     CORSMiddleware,  
\#     allow\_origins=origins,  
\#     allow\_credentials=True,  
\#     allow\_methods=\[""\*""\],  
\#     allow\_headers=\[""\*""\],  
\# )  


Surprisingly , my code just doesn't work on 8080 anymore. It works on other ports but not this one. I don't understand why. It used to work for the last month. I am not sure if adding CORSMiddleware was the reason but this was the last important thing I remember doing.

I tried sudo lsof -i:8080 and I see this

COMMAND PID USER  FD  TYPE  DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME

`webfilter 6220 root  32u IPv6 0x5c28b320858683ef 0t0 TCP localhost:50715->localhost:http-alt (CLOSED)`

`webfilter 6220 root  37u IPv6 0x5c28b32085849bef 0t0 TCP localhost:54767->localhost:http-alt (CLOSED)`

and so on.. Multiple entries with the same PID but different FD. Everytime I make a request call I see this. Whats webfilter? and why is it closing my port? 

Please let me know what info I need. I don't even know what all to share because I haven't been able to figure out the cause of it.

But is there a consensus on which one makes the most sense?

The ways that I can think of are

- an .APNG file
- a .PNG sprite sheet, which the browser can animate through
- a .WEBP file

The animation is large (in terms of pixel dimensions, about 1920x1080), and only a few seconds long.

It would also be beneficial for file-serving reasons to be able to activate different portions of the animation (ie on mouseover) all from within the same file — I assume sprite sheets provide a benefit here, unless WEBP or APNG have some sort of jump-to-frame ability? If not, multiple files would need to be loaded for the different animation parts.

Is there a go-to method everyone is using these days?",2024-03-20 02:52:30

1bgeddw,"Thinking about moving 2 projects to a VPS, looking for advice, gotchas, etc.","So I have 2 sites that are related...they share a database (currently RDS) but not a server or front end. One is on a subdomain, the other on the main domain of that same domain.

One is a NextJS app that I'm hosting on Netlify, and is now getting enough traffic to where I'm having to pay $25/mo for the level 1 functions tier. The other is just on a cheap-ish tier on Heroku at $15/mo for the server, and the free tier on Netlify is doing fine for that, though I do get like 2m pageviews per month. It's a CRA app.

RDS for the postgres database is costing me like $75/mo though, which is not ideal but the 2 sites combined just have too much going on data/traffic-wise to get away with lower tiers.

So I guess the question is: How much do I stand to save by moving this all to a VPS? I know that's a loaded question, but hopefully the context on what I'm having to pay helps. I'm pushing the limits of the basic dynos for Heroku, and the Next site is growing and I hope to grow it quite a bit soon with a new facet of that project.

Just not sure how VPS CPU/RAM usage costs compare to hosted services, what kind of issues I might run into running the DB on the VPS (I guess there will be less latency since it's all on the same box though, which sounds nice).

How complicated is it to set up domains to point to a running Nextjs app and another React app on a vps? How complicated is all of this in general? I'm a professional web dev and have been for a bit, but I'm never really the dev ops/hosting person in these things, so not a ton of experience. I did have a Django app on Digital Ocean back in the day, but mostly just followed a guide to get that working.

Anyway, sorry for the sloppy question, just hoping for some insight from those more experienced with this kind of thing than me.

I then added up features to let any user submit reviews and add new places. Long term, I will try somehow to build a community around specialty coffee

Here users vote for the specific coffee-based beverage in a location. They can also add some extra info: e.g. does the place have electrical plugs? Is it remote work friendly or is it just for coffee? What milk types does the place serve? And more.

An example:

[https://coffeeradar.io/coffee-bar/coffee-syndicate/](https://coffeeradar.io/coffee-bar/coffee-syndicate/)

Of course this doesn't want to be any kind of alternative to places on Maps or similar. It's just a very specific directory for a specific niche. There are a bunch of apps and similar sites, but I wanted to build my own version

Coffee Radar should help both remote workers that want to work from a café and coffee lovers finding exactly the place they're looking for.

A project of this kind largely depends on the network effect: more users, more information, the more the platform will actually help. So I don't know if this will ever take off. I started building this because I needed some variety from my daily practice

Due to the nature of the website (lots of pages get indexed on Google) some users found it, signed up, and added some places they know, but I didn't promote this website much so far

It's a WP website (I know that some of you will hate that), with a bespoke theme and several plugins I've created from scratch. Later I will build a proper app with Expo or something similar.

I love working on this project: there's always a new API to try, always something to iterate and improve, always something new to learn, always new features that can be added

A side project like this one helps to keep the passion for coding alive, and to create for the sake of creating compared to the usual daily grind :)

1bnk1bu,What's the easiest way to use an SSG with a headless CMS without using Netlify or Vercel?,"Basically, I'm thinking of getting into using astro as an SSG alongside something like TinaCMS.

But so far, all my (admittedly shallow) research has pointed me towards using Netlify or Vercel to get this workflow to work.

I'd like to avoid using other services for various reasons. The biggest being that most of my clients already paid for their own cPanel hosting, so it'll be hard to justify getting another 3rd-party service (and I'm not sure how well Netlify's infrastructure deals with traffic from SE Asia).

Basically, I'm really just looking for a way to use some form of CMS with my static HTML+CSS+JS website, since most of my clients want to have a blog section. 

Currently, how I do it is I convert my static HTML pages into a custom theme and then using Wordpress on my client's cPanel hosting. This is honestly clunky. However, I really want to move my clients away from using Wordpress (maybe using headless Wordpress is ok, but Wordpress in all of its entirety as a page-builder makes me gag and gives me anxiety-attacks).

Any thoughts and insights? How would you go about solving my requirement, if you were in my shoes?

EDIT: I appreciate the responses. One of the reasons why I'm hoping to avoid bringing in another hosting service is not just cost: many companies have a bunch of red-tape for approving the use of a 3rd-party service/vendor. So with the current clients I have, I know that if I propose we include Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare as part of the pipeline / infrastructure, it'll mean that the auditing team will come in and freeze all work for 2~6 weeks. I know, it's crazy. But it is what it is.",2024-03-25 17:51:50

1bk4viz,Node JS Auth with JWT + Refresh Token,"First a bit of background.

I'm a Javascript dev with 10+ years of experience mainly working on the front end of websites and web apps but am looking to extend into full-stack territory by learning NodeJS.

To that end, as a learning experience I am building a web app from scratch using NodeJS, React, PostgreSQL and Prisma.  
I have my database designed, I have the models built in Prisma, I have my API's documented in insomnia. I have a basic Node app with a number of GET routes for accessing data in the database seeded by Prisma.  
So far so good.

What I'm working on next is authentication and this is where things start to get tricky.

What I have so far is a registration form that creates a user in the DB, and a login page that allows a user to log in and access the system.  
When a user logs in a JWT is created and an HTTP only cookie is created, when a user then attempts to access a route in my node app the cookie is sent with the request and the JWT is verified.  
When a user logs out the cookies is destroyed.

What I want to add next is a refresh token to go along side the access token and for a new refresh token to be issues whenever a new access token is created (so token rotation).  
What I can't seem to figure out is how to check a JWT to see if it is expired, obviously when you verify a JWT it will tell you it's expired but it seems tricky to actually be able to do anything with that information as at that point an error is generated.

So far all this is implemented without any 3rd party auth packages as I want to make sure I fully understand it and for me the best way to do that is to build it myself.

Any help and or pointers would be grateful.

1bd98a5,Advice on microservice architecture,"Here's the current situation,

I have a CRUD app that manages tasks. Frontend is react-admin, backend is express with mysql db. The task entities have a status that can be one of ""created"", ""in\_progress"", ""completed"" or ""cancelled"".

Due to some new requirements, in order for a task to reach a ""completed"" status, certain task data (name, type, etc) is required to be submitted to a 3rd party service. Once the task is submitted, that service returns an id which needs to be saved in the task data.

Unfortunately the 3rd party service is a web portal with which to submit task data. Users must log in, submit the data and enter the provided id manually back into the CRUD app. There's no API available.

I want to automate this process and my idea is to create a new service that uses puppeteer to login, submit the task data and then save the id back into the task via the update endpoint on the express server. I'm exploring new territory here and I'm wondering is this a good approach? I was planning to also build this with express, but was wondering if this could be a good use case for lambda functions? I was thinking it would make sense to trigger this service via a queue, maybe SQS but I'm not sure if I'm overcomplicating things. 

Any advice welcome. Thanks",2024-03-12 21:31:10

1bbpjmu,JWT as cookie,"I'm currently building a website with Next.js (ex: www.example.com) and an ASP.NET Core Web API (api.example.com). I had a few basic requirements:
1. Authentication logic should be in the backend only, not touching Next.js. Zero-trust.
2. Next.js is able to authenticate to make requests for server-rendered pages to the API, but ONLY using the client's credentials.
3. Client is also aware of its login state for client-side render changes.
4. User doesn't need to log in frequently, so a refresh token is required.
5. Session management is stateless as far as the API is concerned (achievable using JWTs).

I thought for a while on the best way to handle this; I read that HTTP-only cookies are considered the best from a security perspective for XSS protection. So, I settled on using HTTP-only cookies. A user would log in, and 2 cookies would be set by the API: an access token, scoped to both the site and the API (since they share a domain, that way Next.js can read that cookie and make authenticated calls if needed), and a refresh token, scoped to only the authentication endpoints (to reduce exposure). The login request would return a JSON containing the expiration times, so the browser can know its token statuses to refresh and redirect back to login.

Now, I've actually tried to start implementing it, and it seems that from the tutorials I'm seeing that using a JWT in cookies is pretty rare (or just using cookies in general for a backend API). It seems like using an ""Authorization: Bearer"" header is strongly preferred. Is what I'm doing considering an antipattern? If local storage isn't considered secure enough to store my refresh token, what other options do I really have for maintaining login between sessions? ",2024-03-11 00:15:08
1bbfqnu,How to source information from a root document?,"Context: I have a custom made ttrpg for my friends and I keep all my notes in html. On their character sheets they have their character information, as well as relevant rules. I want the rules to come from a root file so updates trickle down into all constituent files.

The structure as of now: The project folder has a separate html sheet for each character, a folder of stylesheets and a folder of scripts. Presently I am using scripted custom elements for each rule. It works, but it's not as modular as I'd like it to be.

The problem: First of all, my js knowledge is very very limited, but if you use the right terminology I can usually find my way. I'm just not sure how to feed the question into copilot.

The custom element is structured such that it carries with it the rule itself wrapped in a <p>, as well as a title/header wrapped in either a <h1> or <strong> depending on context. It works fine, but I want the flexibility to restyle the title based on context rather than having it set by custom element script. I can't help but think there is a better way, but I don't have the js knowledge to know or know how to ask.

What I'd like to see: I'd like each rule to be text only (not carrying <p> tags) and carry the title and description somehow separately, but linked. I'd like the styling of the information to be dependent on the html file they're pulled into. I imagine it looking something like a script that declares this is rule TITLE with DESCRIPTION, and that I can insert into stylized html tags at the level of the html file.

How would you do this?

Edit: also, while I'm here: is it inaccurate to formate a custom element tag as <custom-element />? It seems to work, but Trebedit sees it as a still open tag.

Edit 2: Some code.

Js, rules

    /* Rule - Traits */
    class RulesTraits extends HTMLElement {
        connectedCallback() {
            this.innerHTML = `
            <h1>traits</h1>
            <p>From experience, characters learn traits at the GM's discretion.</p>
            `
        }
    }
    customElements.define('rules-traits', RulesTraits)

Js, traits

    /* Aquan */
    /* Ancestral origin, language, culture. */
    class CardAquan extends HTMLElement {
        connectedCallback() {
            this.innerHTML = `
            <p><strong>aquan.</strong> You can walk or swim as a move action. You can breathe only water, but you can hold your breath for a single whole Encounter. You can speak, read and write aquan.</p>
            `
        }
    }
    customElements.define('card-aquan', CardAquan)

Html

    <section id=""traits"">
      <rules-traits />
      <trait-aquan />
    </section>

The end result is that for each character I can stitch together their 'traits' with relevant 'rules'. And, I can share a custom element across multiple html pages (and update the source script to update all the pages that use it).

This setup works, and it works quite cleanly (better than objects or iframes) but I'd like to pull the h1, strong and p tags out of the scripts so they can be styled however the context requires.

Edit again again: 

I guess my question (short of an alternative method) is if the custom element class can take two call backs or inner.html (just a reminder, idk what these things mean my js knowledge is garbage) as in:

    class YadaYada extends HTMLElement {
        connectedCallback() {
            this.innerHTML = `title`
            this.innerHTML = `description`
        }
    }

or

    class YadaYada extends HTMLElement {
        connectedCallback() {
            this.innerHTML = `title`
       connectedCallback() {
            this.innerHTML = `description`
        }
    }

Such that the html tag can

    <h1><yada-yada TITLE /></h1>
    <p><yada-yada DESCRIPTION /></p>",2024-03-10 17:26:45

1b79be3,Best way to deal with monthly hosting for clients,"I saw a post in the nextjs sub about someone seeking advice on reducing the cost of hosting 100s of websites. This got me thinking on my own solution, so I came here to ask about it. Any and all advice appreciated.

Right now if a client needs a site, I typically create them an account on whatever platform I use for their project (Vultr, Vercel, etc.). They use their own card for monthly hosting fees, and thats it. They have the keys to the kingdom. I have access, but if they wanted to shut me out they could. 

In that nextjs post, I saw that many people actually paid for monthly hosting themselves, charging each client the base cost of their plan, plus whatever fee they throw in, keeping all of their clients sites under their own account. This seems like a great way to make some extra income per month, and keeps all of the sites centralized, but at the same time it does seem that this could pose a security risk, as well as not really provide the clients with true ownership of their sites.

The way I saw it before was that if I develop a site for a client, they own where it lives and they pay for it monthly through the platform, but now I'm not sure if this is the right way to be going about it.

Any thoughts? Thanks",2024-03-05 16:22:29
1b6nrz5,Where to go from WordPress,"In my career I mean - I graduated in 2019 and immediately got a contract position with a great marketing agency where I got some awesome Symfony and Vue experience under a senior dev. About six months later I took a different contract position with hopes of a better long term payoff, but I was alone. 

So, five years later, I've been running a WordPress-based Learning Management System with 100,000+ users for this company (alongside some other smaller Education projects), and honestly I'm getting sick of dealing with WordPress, which my company refuses to switch from, which is fair as they've dug this hole too deep at this point. I want to pass this responsibility onto someone else and move on with my career, but I've been stuck using WordPress for the past five years. I've learned a lot, but since I was on my own, I often spent way more hours a week than I wanted to working, and never had the time or willpower to learn more outside of my work hours. This job has led to three huge WordPress/PHP portfolio pieces. I also manage the servers and have learned my way around Linux by dealing with these massive servers and user counts, but I'm not great at that side of things and would rather focus on development. I've managed development teams abroad alongside myself, and managed the CI/CD and version control, albeit in an amateur way, figuring it out myself as I go.

I've dabbled with personal projects in Vue, React, etc but never came close to finishing anything. Now, I'm ready to start getting some certifications(?) or at least personal projects under my belt, but I'm not sure where I should focus. Should I continue with my PHP experience and learn Laravel or Symfony, alongside Vue or React? Or should I just forget PHP and SQL to instead focus on Javascript-based backend frameworks and document-based database systems? 

To clear things up, I'm looking for a long-term position with a company as an in-house developer, so I'm looking to improve skills that will fit what those types of employers might be looking for. While managing the dev teams abroad, I discovered I enjoy project management as well, so that could be an option, but it feels like it would require a complete career reset which I cannot afford right now. But if anyone has any advice, suggestions for courses or certificates, or frameworks to potentially stay away from, any help would be much appreciated!",2024-03-04 22:10:05

I have a grid template with 2 columns. The column on the right is defining the height of the rows with its content..

I want the content on the left to be square. With a given fixed height it's easy using `aspect-ratio: 1;` (cf. [Code pen](https://codepen.io/Sanjibukai/pen/poBvQqg)).

But when the height is unknown it's not working... The element is indeed square but the element is now driving the height messing with the layout:

It's like aspect-ratio is using the width of the element to define the height..  
While I would like to have its height defining its width..

1bmc2ik,Thoughts on migrating from traditional SQL to something else? N00b questions.,"I recently took a good gander at MongoDB - I've used primarily MySQL and now MariaDB for ... literally decades now. I have some experience in MSSQL and some other relational setups. My current primary project is maybe a .sql around 80MB-ish (fluctuates) but it is always growing and some of the things that it needs to do are hopelessly convoluted because of the legacy system(s) it is designed to work with.  


There is always caching and more performant queries, but I started to wonder: maybe I could use something besides what I am familiar with? I just don't really know how to translate what I'm currently doing over to MongoDB (or hey, feel free to throw other ideas out). I'm moving away from primarily PHP and doing more stuff in Node when I can, so changing the way I interact with data is something I'm currently open to in this short window as I phase through technologies.  


I thought I'd understood what the differences were, but I read about the size limits in MongoDB and hit a brick wall immediately in trying to figure out how I'd implement some stuff I currently do.   


I'm not looking to fully replace all my functionality, but if I can translate data on a different server to some other format and create good endpoints, my primary software can use it for some of the more tedious calculations. I currently either serve stale cached stuff, or will cause the user to wait when the logic gets a bit too complex (which primarily only happens with certain metrics that are doing queries across systems).  


The primary bane of my existence is that there is an external data source which requires a lookup against three different columns to establish association with two other commonly used tables - there isn't much of a way around it traditionally outside of: caching and then also having a ""lookup"" table (which is the route I am currently going to ""speed it up""). Properly indexed or not, the last year or 6 months of data might be queried against and some of it may now actually be different - moment to moment.   


This has frustrated me endlessly in a few areas. LEFT JOIN ON OR OR statements are VERY slow. Even with indexes, because you can't utilize them for that. One workaround is jamming everything into placeholders (thank god I've never hit any query length limits for characters - even sometimes pushing in THOUSANDS of phone numbers as multiple parts of a query). While some data can be cached out and calculated against, there is a trade-off between just how accurate it is to do that at any given moment.  


When I first started to learn about MongoDB I was like ""aha, I see, I am just kind of doing things wrong, maybe if I restructure all of this, I should go towards this more open format"" - it seems much easier, except then I can't really fathom how I'd go about some tasks I currently do or try to predict if I'd even be making an improvement swapping technologies versus just juicing more out of what I'm currently doing in SQL.   


I don't even mind storing everything as objects - in all reality I need to run some stuff like haversine formula and date comparison windows across tables all under 50,000 rows each, primarily three tables that interact like this. My hopes of aggregating all that into a MongoDB and query against it felt kind of dashed when I learned about the size limits - but am I misguided here?  


I have worked on projects much larger than my current endeavor, so I know the treacherous road ahead when it comes to trying to have everything cached - or running calculations that are somewhat stale to conserve resources - or background generation of temporary views/tables to hold the required data, etc.; - I know the SQL solutions - but I'm open to other ideas that may be out there that some of you have utilized to handle middle-sized sets of data out to UI in various mechanisms.   


Currently, I'm utilizing some fairly complex queries that usually involve unions and other things to try and squeeze out performance when it is required. I have very few users that need to see these reports, but I still don't want to choke the server up whenever the recalculation has to happen. I'm adding a lot of ""gamification"" elements, so I'd predict that I'm going to be calculating a lot more things in real time as I move forward. I don't want to be going down the same paths I did previously where I've wanted to run queries (or tried to) that will cripple a server.   


Thanks for reading this and any help :D. I'm open to almost any ideas. If you want to get too technical about how I might be able to restructure what I am currently doing, send me over a PM. Once again, thanks in advance, and good luck out there!",2024-03-24 04:17:48

1bgh0ez,[Showoff Saturday] I built NexusTrade – an AI-Powered Automated Investing Research Platform,"Hello r/webdev!

I'm super excited to show off [NexusTrade.io](https://NexusTrade.io), an advanced automated investing research platform! NexusTrade allows non-technical users to create, test, optimize, and deploy fully automated trading strategies using natural language. I built it because I noticed that trading manually was too slow. I would deviate from my set strategy, lose money, and end up kicking myself. I started building it before ChatGPT was ever a thing, and after the release of it and the OpenAI APIs, I pivoted towards making an AI-Focused investing research platform.

# NexusTrade's Features

**1) Fully Automated Algorithmic Trading**

NexusTrade was built to be able to  configure any strategy you can imagine in a simple, easy-to-use UI.  While NexusTrade strategies currently work with technical indicators  (think Simple Moving Average, Rate of Change, and the amount of a  position the user has), [I just released a design for integrating with fundamental indicators](https://nexustrade.io/blog/creating-an-automated-trading-strategy-using-fundamental-indicators--technical-designdocument-20240212) (think revenue, net income, PE ratio, etc).

For example, if a user wants to create and deploy their unique idea, they could just tell it to Aurora, the AI-Powered agent.

To read more about how it works, [check out this article.](https://medium.com/@austin-starks/what-is-the-true-value-of-ai-and-automation-in-trading-and-investing-012e65e55cf3)

**2) Performing Financial Analysis**

The vast majority of finance platforms  only show you the stock's current price and its volume. Best case  scenario, they'll throw in a couple of other metrics like the PE ratio  and the Earnings Per Share (EPS). However, these static values aren't  going to help you make better decisions. It's understanding how these  values change over time that dictates where the stock will move next.



[Change in Google's Net Income](https://preview.redd.it/6tgk9ivzmroc1.png?width=2486&format=png&auto=webp&s=b49ec246ed2db303a110010ace616a0ef14db660)

NexusTrade not only offers essential  fundamental metrics but also includes simple definitions to help  beginners understand their importance. Additionally, it displays  industries that the company belongs in right below it, which is  important for understanding the correlation of this stock with other  assets.

**3) AI-Powered Financial Research Automation**

NexusTrade features a number of features that allows for financial research. [Not only can users compare companies to each other](https://nexustrade.io/blog/memes-aside-is-gamestop-gme-a-good-investment-fundamentally-20240213), but they can also search for novel investment opportunities with [a powerful stock screener](https://nexustrade.io/blog/new-feature-launch--an-ai-feature-that-no-other-investing-platform-has-20240213). For example, if you were  looking to find new AI stocks, you can simply ask Aurora the following:

[Asking Aurora to query for the top AI stocks](https://preview.redd.it/w26kksxhnroc1.png?width=2332&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a7e291d5f5e51607b162d3fe5b21a5d5a897916)

This includes a wide array of sectors, including biotechnology, cloud computing, and 3D printing, along with a  range of fundamental indicators like EPS, PE ratio, net income, and  gross profit.

This feature taught me that Amazon is the AI stock that makes the most revenue in the market. Did you know that?

This feature also helps you find novel investing opportunities. Want to find AI stocks? You got it. Interested  in profitable biotechnology companies? No problem. Finding new stocks  based on facts and data has literally never been easier!

NexusTrade is transforming the way  people approach the stock market by giving users innovative tools to  test out new ideas and perform financial research. It's free to try an  easy to use, so why not improve your investing skills?",2024-03-16 21:46:19
1bg4nyu,I built a Backend Api SaaS Boilerplate,"Yea, there are a lot of these. In javascript land... in untyped land with php or python.

It contains all the good stuff like auth, ef core, stripe integration, tests, background services, metering so you can monetize your api as a standalone product.

I used adsense for a bit, and now a similar service, but I worry I'm missing out on money AND control/experience by not branching out. The /r/adops sub talks as though running your own system is standard, but I wouldn't even know where to start.

Throwing a script tag on my site and letting them go to town doesn't feel great. I've had a few instances where they changed something and either bad/obtrusive ads got through, or ads were shown to paying users who aren't supposed to see them. I just hate trusting companies who don't really seem to have any interest in making sure my paid users don't see ads, and also just seem to not be getting me that much income.

So I guess two questions...

What's the most profitable way to run ads on a site with decent traffic?

If that's to use a service like adsense etc, which of those services are actually good about giving a simple way to turn off ads for certain users?

1bahgfe,I built an open-source self-hostable user auth platform for Next.js that can be set up in 3 minutes,"Hey everyone, I am building an open-source user authentication library for Next.js. You get everything including OAuth, credential sign-in, pre-built pages, and emails with just a few minutes of setup. Everything is customizable either with theming or low-level components.

Github link: [https://github.com/stackframe-projects/stack](https://github.com/stackframe-projects/stack)



Here are the reasons why I built this:

I have worked on a lot of side projects and I think the most annoying thing is that I spent a lot of time on things that are not the core business: user auth, user profile, payment, dashboard, etc.

So my vision is to build a framework that helps all the devs to remove this unnecessary time spent for their new projects. Auth is the first thing to accomplish this vision.



Here is the comparison with other auth services you might know

* Auth0/Clerk: not open source and has vendor lock-in. Also, they have crazy pricing if you reach a scale
* NextAuth: the dev just decided that they don't support passwords. Also, it is not that easy if you want to connect it with your database or customize the UI.
* SuperTokens: it is pretty hard to set up. Also, they have some features that are not open-source. I want to be 100% open-source and only make money from hosting.
* Supabase/Firebase: They don't have UI components out-of-the-box, it is not the end of the world but still a lot of work to do. Also, their integration for people who don't use the other parts of their services is not great.

1badx82,[Showoff Saturday] The First White-Label Software Marketplace,"Hey everyone,

We're working on something cool with huge potential. A white-label marketplace where you can find, customize, and even sell software for every business need.
Here's the cool part: imagine picking almost-ready software and then tweaking it to fit your, or your client’s, business needs. And if you're on the creative side, to sell your white-label software to others who can rebrand and use them as their own. It's about making software adaptable, super fast to deploy and cost-efficient.

We're currently in the beta phase, which means we're testing the waters and fine-tuning our platform to ensure it meets the expectations. Feedback of any kind is appreciated!

1b5cowx,My DB designer application,"I think designing a database could be a similar process to creating the wireframe of an application.
Having a sketch, seeing the column names, types, relationships makes it a lot easier for me to make decisions regarding the database that I want to create.
The feedback loop is faster since the sketch can be shared and easily modified.


I started working on a ER Diagram like application that you can see here:

[DB Diagram](https://irosgrim.dev/db-diagram/)


It's a static web application, meaning that the data is only saved on your own local storage and not sent anywhere else.


This started as an exercise. I simply wanted to disconnect from what I'm normally doing at my job and it's a ""todo"" style project that allows me to push it as far as I'm willing to go.



Features:

* define tables, columns, data types

* define relationships

* define constraints 

* generate and export SQL(proof of concept)

* copy paste

* export/import JSON

* export PNG

* add notes similar to sticky notes

1bsh9x3,I am a non-technical solo founder looking to be conversant in full stack ,"TLDR: I now own a PHP Laravel application and a flutter native app. I want to learn the basics so I can ask better questions when scoping projects/features with my devs. Where do I start? 



I am a non-technical solo entrepreneur, building a services marketplace platform. In an effort to accelerate time and decrease cost, I found a white label app solution. I am now in the process of negotiating with the original developers to add customization to their white label solution so that I could launch my MVP.

I have two friends who are full stack developers acting as my technicals advisors. However, I want to level up my skill set and be in a position to ask better questions. 

Last month, I knew nothing about development or programming. Really nothing. I didn’t known what’s the difference between frontend and a backend. 

I am trying to level up my understanding of the basics of design - I’m thinking high level concepts so I can see the forest vs. specific syntax and get caught up studying trees. But I don’t know what questions to ask or where to start. 

Over the last month, I’ve 
- Launched a landing page in Webflow and learned about containers, div, responsive design, and used ChatGPT to to write a simple JavaScript snippet to enable a feature in a form. 
- Learned the definition of the word: “deploy”
- Tried and failed to deploy my Laravel app on BlueHost. Realized that I can’t install node on a shared server. 
- Switched from BlueHost shared to Hostinger VPS, and successfully launched the app. Again, with the help of ChatGPT, which gave me command prompts for SSH, helped me troubleshoot errors, defined basic terms, etc…
- I also learned about the basic PHP Laravel design structure of Model, Control, View as well database migrations and seeders
- I still can’t read a single line of code but I’m trying to see the forest for the trees

Most of what I’ve learned has been through fumbling in the dark and using ChatGPT. I looking for recommendation on what I should be learning to piece it together instead of this highly unstructured self-developed syllabus.

Should I take a basic CS class from the free catalogue published by Stanford? YouTube videos?

1brv9cm,How do developers do forms? (survey),"Hey fellow developers! I have a question about how you make forms (**skip to the bottom if you're in a rush**).

My mom, the President of a condo association, asked me to create a website for people in her building to list their units for rent or sale (we have people who rent every year and we don't want to pay Airbnb fees), so I created the site https://sea-air-towers.herokuapp.com/ . Its code is at https://github.com/JohnReedLOL/Sea-Air-Towers-App-2 . I started with the code at https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter and built on top of it.

A screenshot of the form to list your unit for rent is at https://imgur.com/a/XdCWwsX . The View (template) for this form in the code is at https://github.com/JohnReedLOL/Sea-Air-Towers-App-2/blob/main/views/apartment/create.pug . It uses the pug templating engine, which converts to the following HTML:  https://gist.github.com/JohnReedLOL/d180a56c606f10e697216c2656298dad .

The overall architecture of the backend is [Model-View-Controller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) and the .pug template files are the View. The Controller that corresponds to create.pug is [postCreateApartment at line 580 of apartments.ts](https://github.com/JohnReedLOL/Sea-Air-Towers-App-2/blob/cd53f4db1fac65dbf42f87b67c238d0e9e90e80b/src/controllers/apartment.ts#L580). When the user clicks ""Create Listing"" at the bottom of the form that you can see at https://imgur.com/a/XdCWwsX ,  that Controller code in apartments.ts gets called. First the Controller validates the input (that's what all those ""await"" lines are for at the top of the postCreateApartment function) and then it saves it to the database, MongoDB (which happens at [line 663, `apartment.save` , which saves the apartment](https://github.com/JohnReedLOL/Sea-Air-Towers-App-2/blob/cd53f4db1fac65dbf42f87b67c238d0e9e90e80b/src/controllers/apartment.ts#L663)). The Controller links the View (the .pug template) with the Model (that corresponds to what gets put into the database, MongoDB). The model for the Apartment is at this file, Apartment.ts: https://github.com/JohnReedLOL/Sea-Air-Towers-App-2/blob/main/src/models/Apartment.ts . That shows exactly what gets put into the database. You can see all the fields (ex. apartmentNumber, landlordEmail, numBedrooms, numBathrooms, etc.) and their type (Number, String, Number, Number, etc.). In that model file you may notice ""mongoose"", like `import mongoose from ""mongoose"";` and `mongoose.Schema`. Mongoose is the name of the [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping).

**Question:** This was written in JavaScript/TypeScript and uses a NoSQL database, and I know people use different programming languages and databases, but other than that, does everyone do pretty much the same thing? I mean obviously some people use Ruby on Rails or something instead of Node.js/Express, and some people use MySQL or some other database instead of MongoDB, but other than little differences like that, do we all do basically the same thing? And if you do something different, can you explain how what you do is different?",2024-03-30 23:10:37

So let's say I have a user form, I have to call the API to fetch the user, then call the API again to fetch the photo:

    {
      ""id"": ""123"",
      ""name"": ""John Doe"",
      ""_links"": {
        ""self"": {
          ""href"": ""http://example.com/api/users/123""
        },
        ""photo"": {
          ""href"": ""http://example.com/api/users/123/photo""
        }
      }
    }

I guess it's not a big deal (I'd prefer to have the photo from the beginning and only call the API once, though).

A bigger problem arises when I have to get the photo of many users and display them at the same time in, say, a list:

    [{
      ""id"": ""123"",
      ""name"": ""John Doe"",
      ""_links"": {
        ""self"": {
          ""href"": ""http://example.com/api/users/123""
        },
        ""photo"": {
          ""href"": ""http://example.com/api/users/123/photo""
        }
      }
    },
    {
      ""id"": ""456"""",
      ""name"": ""Jane Doe"",
      ""_links"": {
        ""self"": {
          ""href"": ""http://example.com/api/users/123""
        },
        ""photo"": {
          ""href"": ""http://example.com/api/users/123/photo""
        }
      }
    }]

Right now, I'm fetching all the users. Then I use a loop to fetch the photo of each user, then I map each user id to their photo. Then, to display the photo, I do `idToPhotoMap[user.id]`.

Is there a better way to do this?

Note: I don't want to modify the original user object, because it'd be messy when using it in a form. I'd have to keep track of what fields were from the API and what fields were added by me.",2024-03-30 00:59:27

I have been a user of Postman for some time now and I fully understand the difference of public and private collections and storing secrets as variables and so forth. I believe the ""meat"" of this seems to be scanning public collections. 

Yea, I get that private collections are stored in Postman's cloud servers and if those were compromised it would be catastrophic event making headlines. 

This article seems to infer that security variabilities exist and using Postman as a tool is bad. The idea that if a user's credentials are exposed are a security threat everywhere using SaaS, not just postman.

Recently the security team at my company began ~~a smear campaign~~ raising concerns about using it for API development, testing and documentation. We use exclusively private collections, and have it locked down for the users on our team, we have a subscription with Postman.

I have done as much digging about this across the web as I can to validate what he is saying in the article. There are comments at the end of the article that discuss this might be baseless fear mongering.

While I know alternatives to postman exist, I am questioning the legitimacy of this individual and his article. To make a statement like this is 

Upfront, I do not want to just have our team dump postman on one article, it would be a minor earthquake in terms of setting up another API environment for our team and our many APIs.

1boeym8,Are there any courses that are worth it when progressing on the path to team lead? + Thoughts on team leads,"Hey everyone, hope this doesnt get angry downvotes haha.. **please dont downvote if you disagree, I'm trying to learn, and so Im sharing my** ***opinions*** **so people can give their thoughts on them.**

But I'm looking to upskill myself a bit in the area of skills a team lead should possess. I am still early 20s so have a bit to go, but on my career track Im a few years ahead versus my age.

This seems to be a commonly accepted opinion, but I want to say my opinion is that a good dev, or experienced senior developer. Does not necessarily make a good team lead. This isn't to say a good dev cant be a team lead, but rather many companies and people see it as an obvious next step of progression for a senior dev. 

Having said that, I think a lot of the requirements for a team lead come down to 3 things:

1. Experience in your field, industry and life (wisdom)
2. Aptitude towards *leading, managing, and cultivating* your team members
3. Good understanding of the business

With that in mind, Im wondering if there are any courses I can complete to make myself more suitable for the role and try grow towards it. I know theres no single piece of paper that will make companies offer me the role, but, I'm hoping there are *courses*/*certifications* that will make me more attractive for the role, and genuinely make me better at it.",2024-03-26 18:22:11

1bmpxhv,Slow loading time of a page,"Hey everyone I have a website with multiple pages that are more or less a library of songs from my fav artists. On one specific page the loading time is between 2-3seconds. In comparison the other pages (granted with less content) load in under 1second. 

the Songs come from Google cloud and so do the videos (when user presses play on the song it also plays a video where the cover art for that song was.). I did this hoping the loading time would get better but it didn't. I also applied ""preload = none"" on the videos since the user chooses which video to play by pressing play on a song. 

This also didn't help so I tried to see if it may be the images that are on the page (each song has a cover art and there are about 30 songs on this one page) so I removed all of the images and the loading time didn't improve a single bit.

1bls14c,I like sketching while explaining code so I've built an all in one tool,"I'm a big fan of Excalidraw (a wireframing tool with a hand-drawn style) and have been using it since its release. It's very simple and resembles paper sketches, which is why I often use it while coding. Recently, I started looking for an extension or app that integrates with it but couldn't find any.

Being a coder myself, I decided to build it without gathering feedback from anyone. My reasoning was that even if others didn't find it useful, it would still benefit me. The result is a minimal web-based code editor that supports HTML, CSS, JS, TS, and also includes some cool features like linting.

Regarding Excalidraw, it's more than just having it on the side. You can connect pieces of code across your files using Excalidraw elements. Simply select a piece of code, right-click, and choose the ""Link with Element"" option. After that, hovering over the code will highlight the corresponding element in the Excalidraw tab.

I'm currently working on adding other features such as file imports and support for frontend frameworks. I'd love to hear your feedback. Do you think this could be useful for developers, or is it just something for my own use?

1bjn5kg,Storing session data in a non-http-only cookie,"I would like to improve UX for authentication in my pet web app.

Just to clarify about the title: I'm talking about storing session DATA, not session token. You CAN NOT use session data to authenticate your requests - requests are authenticated with a session token which is stored an http-only cookie. Session data is basically your userid, username, email and when your session expires. Right now it's just stored in-memory on the client.

Is it okay to store such data in a cookie accessible in JS? That way I could: 1) redirect unauthorized users to signin page immediately by checking in my middleware that they dont have session data / it expired. 2) Authorized users will get page rendered faster since session data is already in the cookie - no need for another server roundtrip.

There is no security concern for impersonation or anything like that - if someone tries to set session data cookie manually, well then, all their API requests will be either unauthorized or at least authenticated with their actual data, not impersonated one.

So basically honest users will get a faster, more responsive experience and malicious actors won't be able to get access to any data they're not supposed to.

So the only concern I have - perhaps it's not ok to store user's email in a cookie accessible to JS, for example, that way chrome extension can get access to it. It's not a huge security concern but some people may not like that their email is in the open.

So is that okay or not?

A step-by-step explanation if that makes it more clear.

Currently:

1. Make a request for the page

2. Server sends back HTML response

3. Client renders pages, then makes a request to the server to get session data

4. Client gets response with session data, stores in memory, uses it to render profile page

What I would like to do:

1. Make a request for the page

2. Server sends back HTML response along with a cookie with session data

3. Client renders pages, gets session data from cookie, uses it to render profile page",2024-03-20 20:14:50

1bg7umc,"P2P Whatsapp, Instagram and Metaverse As A PWA","Hello everyone,

[chat.positive-intentions.com](http://chat.positive-intentions.com/)

I'm excited to share with you a messaging application I've been working on that might interest you. This is a chat app designed to work within your browser, there a focus on browser-based security and decentralization.

What makes this app unique is that it doesn't rely on messaging servers to function. Instead, it works based on your browser's javascript capabilities, so even low-end devices should work.

Here are some features of the app:

* Secure messaging: Your messages are encrypted, making them more secure.
* File sharing: Easily share files using WebRTC technology and QR codes.
* Voice and video calls: Connect with others through voice and video calls.
* Shared virtual space: Explore a shared mixed-reality space, similar to a metaverse.
* Image board: Browse and share images in a scrollable format, similar to Instagram.

Your security is a top priority. Here's how the app keeps you safe:

* Decentralized authentication: No central server is required for login, making it harder for anyone to gain unauthorized access.
* Unique IDs: Your ID is cryptographically random, adding an extra layer of security.
* End-to-end encryption: Your messages are encrypted from your device to the recipient's device, ensuring only you and the recipient can read them.
* Local data storage: Your data is stored only on your device, not on any external servers.
* Self-hostable: You have the option to host the app on your own server if you prefer.

The app is still in the early stages and I'm exploring what's possible with this technology. I'd love to hear your feedback on the idea and the current state of the app. If you have any feature requests or ideas, I'm all ears in the comments below!

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

* The app: [chat.positive-intentions.com](http://chat.positive-intentions.com/)
* More information about the app: [positive-intentions.com](http://positive-intentions.com/)
* Follow the subreddit to keep updated about the app: [r/positive\_intentions](https://www.reddit.com/r/positive_intentions/)

Note 1: As a solo-developer, i dont have the capacity or knowlege to do anything like an ""official launch"". i expect the app will progressively get better with feedback from users (as it has so far).

Note 2: I think the app has (approximately?) reached a feature-complete state, but i'm not sure. I'm looking for feedback on what features are missing, and what features are not needed. The next step would be to grow the number of users by making the app more user-friendly and easier to use. (I need your help on this)

Note 3: The app is not open source yet (sorry), but im open to answering questions about how the code is working (more details can be found in the docs). Open sourcing the app is something i would like to do in the future, but not a priority right now. Some parts of the app are open source.

Note 4: The UI is a clunky implementation of Material-UI. It's something i will fix as i move towards open sourcing the UI components. i will take the opportunity to also give more attention to a ""desktop friendly UI"" (right now the app is best experienced on a mobile device).

Note 5: Id like to keep the wording i have for ""pods"" although i have recieved feedback about it not being clear what it means. A pod is what you might think of as like a ""chat room"" and will be further developed to support group-chat. you can create a pod with a connected peer in the contact-details-page. The wording ""pod"" comes from how a group of whales is called a pod.",2024-03-16 14:53:55

* URL routing
* Session based - Filesystem or Supabase
* JWT Auth for json only API calls

* Websocket, CSRF Token
* HTML, CSS and JS in python.

* I've used classes to contain the REQUEST and some RESPONSE functions i.e. setting header, session or cookies, instead of setting them globally or manually in templates.
* HEAD properties can be set in any routes/function. 
* DOM generates Unique ID every runtime so it's using itself as ID. It changes every refresh.
* Complete CSS properties in python with media queries and pseudo elements/selector.
* Basic JS manipulation i.e. innerHTML, style and setting events

1bd0xee,"Manual deploying and retrieving SSL using Docker Compose, NGINX and certbot - I think there are ways to improve my workflow","There is workflow of how I **manually** deploy my pet projects (like [this one](https://github.com/Kenya-West/vkrss/tree/feature/dockerize-with-nginx) | later will be on [master](https://github.com/Kenya-West/vkrss) branch), please read below how I deploy it and find ways to improve or share how you make it.

1. I create `docker-compose.yml` which contains at least 3 services:
   1. The `app` which can be anything. It is a pet project itself;
   2. `webserver`, which is an NGINX that utilizes following config templates:
      1. `templates/default.conf.template` with and `ssl` and `app`-related sections commented out with `###`  prefix;
      2. `templates/certbot.conf.template` with `certbot`-related stuff, like opening 80 port and `.well-known/acme-challenge` route handling;
   3. `certbot` to retrieve certificates.
2. Then I deploy source code by `git clone` >!(or just manually creating all necessary files - there aren't many in the case when my own docker image is already on registry published)!< and do the following:
   1. `docker compose up -d certbot webserver` to get SSL certificates; check logs of `certbot`, optionally;
   2. `docker compose down webserver` if it is still alive, as SSL certificates are made and it needs to work with SSL now;
   3. Now I do the magic: I un-comment all the lines with `###`  prefix in `templates/default.conf.template`  to enable SSL and handle routes to `app`; I use this command:  `sed -i 's/### //' templates/default.conf.template`;
   4. Then `docker compose up -d certbot webserver app` and all done!

I guess it is not how it is usually done when deploying stuff manually. Your thoughts guys?",2024-03-12 16:06:22

On this app every user will have the possibility to post, like on twitter or Facebook.
I'm implementing the reporting procedure for posts that violate the app policies.

When doing that on mongodb I thought 2 ways of doing it:

1) adding the 'reported' boolean property on the posts model which is false by default.

2) creating a new model called 'reported' where properties are the post being reported, the user reporting it, the reason and the post owner.

The first option will take less space on the database but the second one will make looking for reported posts way quicker in case of several thousands of posts.

As i am by no means an expert when it comes to web development, i was thinking of using a web designing tool such as Wix (which we all know about as its ads are literally everywhere).
However, i'm pretty sure that it isn't the best option, also its prices are pretty high and im not interested in its features.

I tried searching online and i found some softwares to make digital family trees but they dont seem to fit my requirements. 

What i am searching for is an online tool that allows me to create a web page without having to code it. Doens't have to be complicated, just need to put some images. Also it'd be nice to be able to link some other pages to it (for instance, when you click on the name/picture of a relative, it redirects you to a web page with his informations and stuff).
Of course my grandfather wants to put some money in it, i would say that something around 10€ is good.

We have a new CEO and she has tasked me with updating it ASAP. I am not a web developer, although I’m an artist and have some design and tech sensibilities.

There's a few issues I'm facing. The main one is that we don't have a budget (why I'm in charge of this atm). Additionally, our current site is on Squarespace and it wasn't built using a template. There are certain things that I apparently can't customize (like some random ugly backgrounds), so my coworker and I have decided we should start fresh with either a new host or template or both.

The other thing is that my little sister was in a serious car accident last week ar v had to go out of town suddenly for her surgery. She's fine now, thank god, but I'm burnt out and having a hard time thinking through this. Any help or advice is massively appreciated.

More about the site, it's cumbersome and doesn't have a ton of rhyme or reason to it. Theres a massive amount of info on it that I also need to edit, but I'm struggling in strategizing how to best approach this in such a short time span and everything. 

I think my best bet is to just pick a template and work from the ground up, like worry about editing/updating the content as I build it, but I have no idea what is the most cost effective host. I don't have a ton of time to thoroughly I don't have a ton of time to thoroughly research this. It looks like there are free Wix sites but they are stamped and can't take payments. I think I'd like to stick with Squarespace, but have some concerns. 

Do I have to buy each template individually? How does buying templates on them work? Are they expensive? I don't have wifi right now.

My coworker says she's mostly worried about migrating the back end stuff... will it really be that challenging?

This is working good for me but I have one concern and that is the user is created in firebase from front-end so there could be a case where a user exists in firebase auth but not in my db. I can create the user in backend but how would I know if this a valid request (exp: request from my sign up form) or something else. What I like about create user in front-end is I get back a token from firebase and I can use this to authorize user but not sure how I can do that if I am creating user in the backend?",2024-03-08 23:57:59

I want some folks to experience how people with disabilities and various issues browse the web,"TL;DR: I'm looking for some web experiments to have people experience what it is to have certain disabilities. Not just visual ones, but hopefully others as well. Do you have a few cool sites to share about such topic?

The web has various solutions to give people with disabilities or specific preferences the ability to consume content. The strides with A11y rules has improved a lot but its difficult to figure out how much and what needs to be done to make the experience better for people.

So to guide devs and improving their work, it seemed like a good idea to have them experience certain things. So what I'm looking for are stuff like this, so websites or pages with:

* filters for various colors to experience color blindness and how that can lead to various issues
* a way to experience dyslexia. Having letters change constantly and whatnot
* an experience for bad of hearing. Where stuff gets told but its difficult to make out what was actually said and how subtitles can help with that
* a screen reader and how people use that to read the web and what they need to make it better
* where you have blurry vision or other types of visual impairments
* some way to experience autism or adhd and how websites can help with how they navigate the world
* hand tremors. Perhaps some way that makes the mouse shake uncontrollably where you need to click stuff

Bonus points if it has some gamification angle where difficulty builds up and people end up very educated on the topic.

In a way I want to take a group of people on an adventure around health and how we can build better websites with just a few changes. To also work with designers to improve things and to talk to product owners and such to make sure these things get put on the backlog.",2024-03-08 10:09:53

1b8wyi8,Why not different versions of JavaScript depending on client?,"Developers transpile TypeScript / JavaScript to the oldest version they want to support (say ES5) with any polyfills they think may be needed. Web servers then serve this to all browsers that make requests.

Why not do this?

First, transpile to a version per browser we want to optimize for at build time.  Say Chrome 110. The output will be newer, less bloated JavaScript than ES5 and remove any unnecessary polyfills.

Second, transpile as normal at build time, without any optimizations against a particular browser.

Finally, upon receiving request, if a user agent is provided and there is a specialty bundle we made for that, serve that bundle. Otherwise, serve the normal one.

We can generalize this logic to many browsers. For example, our web server can serve a bundle that is maybe 30% of normal size for Chrome, 40% for Firefox, and then normal bundle for unrecognized / no user agent.

I haven't seen this kind of thing offered by any tools or cloud platforms, but feel it would dramatically improve speed for the most common users, on modern browsers.",2024-03-07 15:09:04

1b8o23u,Bit of a back-end question.,"Let's say you had a friend that owned a mid-sized auto shop that was looking to branch out into auto parts distribution as well.

Now obviously shopify is not going to cut it here (though they did attempt to manually input everything from the CSV into shopify... made it all the way to M too). So I guess my question is what backend solution would be ideal here? I'm leaning hard into firebase because that's what I know and I think it would be really easy to track things like parts in the catalog, individual orders, etc., while also being able to build supplementary applications like an order handler on the business side and possibly a mobile app later on down the line. But since some of the better stuff with firebase scales in price with increased usage, I was wondering what other backend solutions people here have used for similar endeavors.",2024-03-07 06:52:53
1b7ha30,How do you deal with third-party API rate limits?,"I class myself as a pretty good web developer, but I am always facing imposter syndrome. One of the big thoughts I have in my head is “am I dealing with third-party APIs the right way”?

I always end up going down the route where I use a queue to queue API Calls. Is this standard practice? 

The only problem with this approach is that, I think, the queued API calls have to work in a asynchronous manner, where if a user makes a request to my backend, the backend will essentially launch a background task (push the API call to the queue) to get executed. The queue has settings to not go over the rate limit. This then results me in long-polling a task object or the changed resource object in the database to see if the api call has completed (scenario dependent of course). I feel like this is the only correct scalable way to not go over the rate limit. 

The only other way I can think of is to do it synchronously in the initial request the user made, which could mean essentially polling in a while loop in the request to check if the api call can go through by checking a counter in Redis or something (but couldn’t this lead to race conditions?) 

One last way is just forcing the API Call to go through, and if there is an error retry.

I usually use Google Tasks and Google Cloud Functions for my apps.

The domain name would be nice since the actual website could also have my custom domain name, but it's a bit pricier and forces to me to use harder things like AWS (which isn't exactly a bad thing).  
Cheap hobby tier on a website like railway would allow me to host this and future apps effortlessly.

**Backstory**

I've been working as a front end developer for \~20 years, but have been a product (i.e., Tool) design [fanatic](https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths) all of my life. When I was growing up, I dreamed of becoming an industrial designer. I used to page through [newspaper advertisements](https://www.reddit.com/r/90s/comments/n8j19l/best_buy_ad_may_24_1998/) to see what new tools and products had been created, and excitedly doodled a few ideas of my own. I would daydream about material science formulas and creative design projects. Well, my middle-class family fell on hard times in the latter half of my youth. I wasn't really able to focus on my future as I struggled mentally during and afterward. I'm doing much better now, but I'm waking up to an untenable reality: My passion for building great products is being exploited by my company.

**Work History**

I've worked at a small agency, two startups, and now two medium sized organizations.

At the beginning of my career, I lucked into a div-jockey job without a degree and got my foot in the door of the software industry. I fell in love with the creative power of programming.  After many years of reading books, learning patterns, experiencing tutorial hell, and through the mentorship of two gracious/brilliant teammates, I learned how to build Quality Software.

In parallel, as I built interfaces, interaction design became a stand-in for my industrial design passion. I learned the basics of UX and aesthetic design. In the startups I worked for, I helped to steer our product towards UX excellence while keeping the SDLC light. One company recognized my skills and contributions by promoting me to Tech Lead, Senior Software Engineer. I took ownership of the responsibility that came with this title, and became a part of the [glue](https://noidea.dog/glue) that enabled our team. It was challenging, rewarding, and well-paid work for my area.

Eventually, I became frustrated building a product for what would always be a small audience. I wanted to have a bigger impact and to work for a company for which my skillset would be more useful. One day, such an opportunity showed up at my doorstep. Well, I took it, along with a signing bonus and what seemed to be a roughly equivalent TC, but with only a Senior Software Engineer title. I didn't think much of this, as I figured my contributions would be recognized in time and I would be rewarded roughly in proportion to my overall impact.

**The ""Pay-bands"" Exploit**

However, at this medium-sized company, the title locks me into a pay band that doesn't recognize my additional skill sets. For two years in a row, I've been denied any sort of pay increase because I was hired ""at the top of my pay-band"". My gross salary, with realized bonus, is now less than it was at my last job, despite 11% inflation during the same period. Adjusting for inflation, the stable part of my TC (salary+bonus) has decreased by about 20%.

I'm mentoring my teammates, performing tech lead duties, catching and filing bug tickets for other teams, optimizing my team's SDLC, progressively [refactoring](https://refactoring.com/) the sophomoric, [muddy](http://www.laputan.org/mud/) codebase I inherited towards durability and maintainability, designing and running profitable experiments, dogfooding our product, steering my teams and the company's efforts towards improving conversion and retention through well-designed products built quickly, and I'm getting stiffed, annually.

Am I a misfit? Should I ask for a different title? A promotion to L5? Or quit, and go work for a company who values my skills? (Are you hiring?)

I need a change that doesn't involve returning the exploitation. This situation is causing me profound stress and significantly impacting my quality of life. I want to continue to build beautiful tools with my quality teammates, but the unfairness of this makes me sick to my stomach. Please help me.

1bsdvbw,Having issues with NGINX redirecting a POST request.,"I don't know if this is the correct subreddit for this, if it isn't, please remove it.

I'm trying to set up a Nginx reverse proxy and I'm slowly losing my mind trying to figure it out.

I have my Nginx server listening at 80, and it performs great. I have a page with a form where I want to be able to send `.json` POSTs from that page to a Python HTTP server that can process the requests. I have the server at port 8000.

On the website, I want to be able to reach the server by navigating to `<IP>:/sub/folder/` so that I can send the `.json` POSTs from my `<IP>:/sub/index.html` page by making a simple relative request to `./folder`.

When I send a curl to `<IP>:8000`, I reach the server and get the correct response.

I have tried to set up Nginx `proxy_pass` with the following configuration:

    location /sub/folder/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000/;
    }

This results in a 301 which sends me from `<url>/sub/folder` to `/sub/folder/`, followed by a 404 at `/sub/folder/`.

If I go back to the Nginx config and turn `/sub/folder/` into `/sub/folder`, navigating to `<url>/sub/folder` returns a 404.

Here's the full `nginx.conf`: https://termbin.com/96km

When I curl to `<IP>/sub/folder` and I get a 301, it appears in the `access.log` and it is picking up the 301:

    192.168.50.223 - - [31/Mar/2024:15:24:42 +0000] ""POST /webhooks/submit HTTP/1.1"" 301 178 ""-"" ""curl/7.81.0""


When I curl to `<IP>/sub/folder/` and I get a 404, it appears in the `error.log` and it is picking up the 301:

    2024/03/31 15:57:03 [error] 31162#31162: *11 open() ""/usr/share/nginx/html/50x.html"" failed (2: No such file or directory), client: 192.168.50.223, server: localhost, request: ""GET /webhooks/submit/ HTTP/1.1"", upstream: ""http://127.0.0.1:8000/"", host: ""192.168.50.13""""

I've tried using `https`, I've tried changing out `127.0.0.1` for `localhost`, I've tried removing the final `/` in the `proxy_pass` line, I've tried proxying to `https://<IP>:<port>/sub/folder` even though the HTTP server is at root, among more.

Here's what the backend Python server looks like: termbin.com/hl5x

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Also, I apologize if this post is unclear, I'm very new to web development and I have my mind scrambled since last night trying to figure this out.

1bsbnjz,User : IdentityUser,"Question for all you experts,

I am building a react frontend and dotnet backend for an eCommerce bookstore. Like most websites, I want the user to be able to register, get a confirmation email, log in, get a JWT token, and all that jazz. Correct me if I'm wrong but if I add a mail service and jwt tokens and use the traditional identity user, I can't (or shouldn't) really reuse that identity user in my relationships with my custom entities (like review or order), right? Maybe it's better to have a custom entity user inherit from the identity user. Is this common practice? I just think it's odd that I'd have to have an entity from the identity framework representing a user (for logging in, email, jwt purposes) and then a different customer/user entity for relating to the rest of my custom entities. Can anyone tell me if I'm on the right track with this? Currently I have my user class set up like this:

public class User : IdentityUser

{

public string FirstName { get; set; }

public string LastName { get; set; }

public string Address { get; set; }

}

But I am currently just hoping that that means that the User class will essentially take over for the IdentityUser in all cases. :( sorry I am a bit lost here. Is the answer to simply scrap the User role and replace it with a simple IdentityUser and use that to relate to the rest of the custom entities? I really need some guidance on this one.",2024-03-31 14:27:04
1bropdo,Feasible in this day and age?,"I know this might sound a bit weird, but I'm drawn to doing brochure-style informational websites using html, css and perhaps a bit of js. 

Benefits: simplicity, no wordpress database or framework to deal with. Transparent code base whose inner workings I understand. Working at low level allows maximal fine-grained customization and creative control. 

Simplicity is perhaps the wrong word, since html and css have *a lot* of details to learn about, such as coding for accessibility concerns for example. As well, working at this low level also entails knowledge about the browser and hosting. And even an informational website might still have some sort of backend. 

But are DIY website tools just too easy and ubiquitous these days to justify my approach? I would argue that no matter how easy something is, there will still be a market for the service since there are people who just don't have the time or don't want to do it. And just to be clear, I'm not a designer, I would outsource the actual design work to a designer and I would code it and get it hosted etc.

1bq9lji,Understanding complexity of web dev project & tool options,"Hi everyone! New to this subreddit but I don't know a better place to ask this question. I'm working on a startup idea, and the product is an online website/platform.

The core functionality of the platform is case management - customers create profiles for their clients or ""cases"", and then add information and documentation related to the case. They should be able to view all of their cases, modify or add information to existing cases and keep track of deadlines. We also want them to be able to share case information with other customers on the platform, and control the amount of information related to a case that they're sharing. Presumably, we'll need backend integration with some kind of database to manage storing and sharing information. Down the line, we're hoping to add AI capabilities to the website.

Our target customers are organizations, and we want employees of the organization to have individual accounts where they have personalized dashboards, access to only their own cases etc. Different kinds of customers would also have different functionalities associated with their accounts. For reference, we're looking at something like [LegalServer](https://www.legalserver.org/) or [Epic Healthcare](https://www.epic.com/) in terms of architecture.

Now, my question is: how complex would this kind of website be and what tools should I be thinking of to make it? Is this kind of architecture possible with website builders like Wix, SquareSpace or others that I haven't heard of? If so, would a beginner be able to design this website within a reasonable timeframe? Or would you recommend hiring more experienced UI/UX designers?

This is important to chart out our timelines and what kind of talent we should be bringing on. I'm sort of spearheading the product dev process but I personally have experience working with WP on only basic stuff like blogs, informational pages etc. That's why I need help understanding how complex our idea would even be to implement. Happy to answer any clarifications, and thanks in advance!",2024-03-28 23:06:23
1bq8z8r,Not sure on what 'level' of dev I am,"So this is a bit of write up but I'm hoping the community here can help me gauge myself better than I currently can.

I'm considering looking for a new job at a different company ( I'm a FS dev  )  however having trouble really knowing what level of dev I am between Jr / Mid/ Snr. 

To give as much context as i can: I've been a self-taught dev for the better part of the last 5 years, over that time I've built your standard websites as a freelancer in html/css/js and standard CMS' like WP , Ecom sites in Shopify and more recently pivoted into fully complete web apps in React / Node deployed on cloud platforms ( mostly Firebase / AWS ).

In addition to my 'side-hustles'  I've also been a FS dev at my current company for the last couple of years - the trouble is im a solo dev. I don't have anyone to learn / compare / review with so I'm really not sure how I would stack against others and if i was to go into a team somewhere else I know there'd be nuances that I'm probably not familiar with that you get working collaboratively rather then solo.  The only time I've had to work as part of a team of devs is on one project I co-developed on with another external vendor (which was a great experience to be able to share workloads!)

At my current company being the only dev there I also am the go-to for a lot of the technical design of services / apps we maintain or  build and am also expected to liase with third-party's for anything 'web dev' related i.e API's and SaaS integration - I'm also generally the person to coordinate any other resources we might need on a new project i.e UX design from another team, legal sign off's for copy approval. 

TLDR:  I feel very capable working through most problems independently, liasing with non-tech business and external party's but I've rarely had the chance to work with and learn amongst a team of experienced devs so I'm not sure where i sit.",2024-03-28 22:40:31
1bq8h39,"First time transferring domain name and DNS. I have some questions, please help","I am transferring a client's domain away from Wix. I want to use Cloudflare, but they do not allow transfers in without first changing the nameservers to Cloudflare's nameservers. Unfortunately, Wix does not allow you to change nameservers. So I have opted to go for namecheap for the registrar and then use cloudflare as the DNS. I have created and hosted a new website for them on my cloudways server (wordpress application).

So I have a few questions for the flow of getting this done:

* Should I point the domain to my new website (in Wix's DNS) before I transfer the domain? Because I read that I cannot edit any DNS records while the transfer is processing (they want this live ASAP). Or should I transfer the domain first and then once it is transferred point the A record to my new website?
* Will anything break if I just transfer a domain to another registrar (not altering any DNS records)? Will a new registrar automatically change the nameservers upon transferring?
* Should I add all the DNS records to the new DNS before transferring the domain (I could use namecheap as the DNS as well before transerfing the DNS to cloudflare)

I also have a few questions about their DNS records, they have weird things in there:

* They have 3 A records all on the root domain pointing to different IP's. What is this about?
* They have 3 TXT records for google-site-verification=XXXXXXXX. Each one with different values but all with the root domain name. Why do they have 3 of these?
* Should I clean-up their records or just leave it the way it is and just change the A record and delete the other 2?

Looking for some feedback on a project I've been working on the past few days. It is my first time using bootstrap and it is quite satisfying to use but can see it can get quite in depth with different features. It uses the PokeApi and you can select as many generations of pokemon for the pool of cards that are randomly selected. 

I like the little sprites in the middle but understand that when you get through all the pokemon you can then see what cards the opponent has coming up removing the difficulty element!

Currently I haven't coded the computer taking turns yet, however in the future I might come back to it and try and implement a server so you can play 1v1 with friends online. For this what would people recommend, I haven't ever used Node.Js but have seen there is socket.io or websocket that can be used with it but it looks like quite a steep learning curve?

Hope you're all doing well!

Over the last few days I have been getting into learning Git Hub and using it in my development process (currently working on a custom Wordpress theme). I mostly work solo, so I've never really been bothered.

What I really liked was the idea of automatically deploying local changes to the web server via Git Hub actions. I wanted to set up two actions - one that would fire automatically when merging into my ""staging"" branch to update my staging environment with those changes, and one that I would trigger manually to sync my live website with the latest main branch.

While setting them up, I wondered about the very limited options for deploying to a server using SFTP. I've only found some outdated and very unpopular plugins such as ""wlixcc/SFTP-Deploy-Action"", with only 215 stars.

Then I wondered:

Is this actually a thing? Is my idea an unusual approach? Are there much better solutions out there? How do you guys do it?

I would be very interested to hear your POV!

Btw: My web host only allows SFTP and SHH connections. I've also considered 3rd party services like ""DeployHQ"", but I'd definitely prefer to do it with GitHub.",2024-03-23 23:57:10
1blsq0r,Thinking about shifting from design to FE development,"I actually studied CS and graduated in 2021. I loved coding but wasn't the best. I wasn't the smartest guy but liked creating my own mini projects. Tbh honest I had no idea about front-end and ui/ux designer roles when I was in University. I was just influenced into believing that if I can't leet code I suck and that I'm not worth it. I also had some health issues. 

In comparison code is usually exact. I can at least point out when something is wrong and explain my decisions with more confidence. There's also more depth. I just zone out sometimes pushing pixels on figma.

I liked both design and development.

For some reason I thought I would be a better designer than a developer. I think I fell for all the fancy YouTube videos. I thought it'll be fun ""collaborating"", ""advocating for the user"", ""getting a seat at the table"". I actually spoke with a bunch of other senior designers working in the industry and they all seem to have lost their soul. Passionate about their work but seem burnout.

After gaining some experience as a designer I think I don't want that power. Much of design is such a mess. We have no idea what we're doing. We talk so much but never arrive at a decision. My mind feels scattered. I'm never in that flow state.

The most important part I can't work independently on my own. There are so many moving parts and roadblocks. There are so many ppl involved.

It's fun but I feel like I'm capable of much more and could probably get more work done and be paid more. Not to mention the bleak state of tech industry and future of automation.

But on the other hand I'm not sure if I want to spend my whole day typing away at my keyboard.

Another realisation that hit me. I'm gonna be a manager one day. I don't think I can lead a team confidently. Design decisions are so hard and full of ambiguity. I realised this talking with my manager and PMs.

In comparison, code is usually exact. I can at least point out when something is wrong and explain my decisions with more confidence. There's also more depth. I just zone out sometimes pushing pixels on Figma.

I like the SaaS industry and will probably work in this space but it's clear that companies want more devs than designers. Development skills would be more valuable in the future.

I'm also aware that no matter which path I choose my job satisfaction and growth depends a lot on the company. I don't wanna be 30 and realise I made the wrong decision.

Can someone give me advice.",2024-03-23 13:54:43

1bkerse,EJS + JQuery + NodeJS ,"Hello there! 

I probably have a very simple question but it has been a doubt since I’ve started a project I’m working on.

I’m trying to build an web app that uses NodeJS and Mongo Db on the backend and I’m trying to get my way with JQuery and EJS template files on the front end. 
The web app will have to do some DOM manipulation but nothing heavy. 

Until this point, everything works. My question is more about how the code should be structured: 

I have a simple list on the EJS file and some JQuery code under the `script` tag in the same file. Is there a way to place the JavaScript code somewhere? I would prefer to have it somewhere, and then I would include it somehow.

Also, depending on the solution, would it be worth to replace the EJS with React for example? I would prefer not to, since it requires learning it.",2024-03-21 19:15:33

They can then download the files or even allow the general public to download them.  However, I want to make sure that each user is charged appropriately for each download, and the user's files are made unavailable fairly quickly if the price of the downloads exceeds what they have paid for.

I've looked into doing this with AWS S3, but it seems like I can only view the logs after 24 hours.  This could lead to a lot of bandwidth being used if something goes viral or a user uploads a big pirated game or movie.  S3 can also be a bit expensive, so bonus points if the service is a bit cheaper.  Pricing like Backblaze would be ideal (I don't expect ""normal"" users to share their files that widely), but I'm not sure they support this use case.

1bh1p0o,How to use event delegation for events that don't bubble?,"Let's say I have a custom web component that renders a template containing a button, and we want something to happen when the button is clicked:

    <template><button class=""mybutton""></button></template>

We could add an event listener every time the component is attached, but that could degrade performance by adding a post-render step and, if this component is used many times, by adding lots of identical event listeners. The solution is [event delegation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_delegation), with which we just set one listener on a root element and see if events match the element we want:

    document.addEventListener(`click`, event => {
      if (event.target.matches(`.mybutton`)) {
        doStuff();
      }
    });

The problem is this only works for events that ""bubble"", like `click`. There are [several events that don't bubble](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31802555/2053389), like `focus` and `blur`.

So now let's say I have a web component that renders a template containing an `<input>`, and we want something to happen when the `<input>` loses focus:

    <template><input class=""myinput"" /></template>

`blur` doesn't bubble so event delegation won't work. What are the alternatives?

The ones I can think of are:

- Specifically for `blur`, we can use `focusout`. But let's say we're targeting an event that doesn't have an alternative.
- Use other events that do bubble to try to detect the element losing focus. The problem is this reinvents a big wheel — we shouldn't try to mimic native browser functionality if it's at all possible to use the native functionality.
- Use the `[onblur]` attribute to somehow re-dispatch the event so that it bubbles, e.g. `onblur=""this.dispatchEvent(new Event('blur', { ...event, bubbles: true }))""`. The problem is this makes for some pretty bloated HTML, and using `[on*]` attributes [is officially discouraged](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes#event_handler_attributes).
- Add event listeners when the component is attached to the DOM. The problems are the same ones that led us to use event delegation in the `click` example.

Is there a way to use event delegation for events that don't bubble?",2024-03-17 16:26:28
1bgh96s,"A simple, modular and observable Go framework for backend applications.","Building backend applications in Go is truly amazing.

But when you want to make something production ready that can be easily maintained, evolved and reliable, you often face a bunch of complexity (and boilerplate code) to put in place before being able to focus on your app logic (dependencies wiring, observability instrumentation, testability, etc)

We created and open sourced [Yokai](https://github.com/ankorstore/yokai) to try to help on this: a ready to use framework that allows you to focus on your application logic, and that takes care of the rest.

It's built on top of what we think are really good Go libs (OTEL, Fx, Echo, Cobra, Viper, Zerolog, etc), with those 3 principles in mind:

- simple: it's quite easy to use, configure and test
- modular: it's coming with available modules to extend your applications, and an easy way to build and share your own
- observable: correlated logs, traces and metrics instrumentations are built in

It comes today with the possibility to write HTTP APIs, gRPC APIs and workers (for async needs), with some modules to extend them.

You can find more details in the [documentation](https://ankorstore.github.io/yokai/).

We really hope it may be of interest for you, and we're open to feedback, advices and hopefully contributions!",2024-03-16 21:57:31

Specifically, the Phoenix animation on the homepage (desktop version only) and all blog article featured images are now served via CDN.

The integration was quite simple. Given I was serving my assets from a back end already, I just had to setup my CDN and update my URLs. For those who are curious, this change alone significantly improved my performance score (according to [PageSpeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) insights):

Was already expecting early adoption pains since it's not 1.0 yet. Despite that, I'm actually pretty impressed with it because a lot of its features are pretty much like VSCode.

**Comparisons I've made**

\- **Performance.** Definitely fast, but just milliseconds anyway. Fast feedback does feel nice though. But I'm running on an M3 Max currently so I wouldn't really say VSCode is slow either. Opening a project via \`zed .\` vs \`code .\` is night and day though. Zed is faster.

\- **Extensions.** Currently it only is able to extend: Grammar, Theme, and Languages. I personally rely on Git Graph, GitLens, Error Lens (), which aren't here yet unfortunately.

\- **Keybindings/Features**. Just some you'd probably care about if you like shortcuts in VSCode.  
 **->** **Same as VSCode:**  
\- **Find Files:** Cmd + P  
\- **Run a Command:** Cmd + Shift + P  
\- **Search Text Project-wide:** Cmd + Shift + F  
\- **Find symbols Project-wide:** Cmd + T  
\- **Find symbols File-wide:** Cmd + Shift + O  
\- **Open/Close left dock:** Cmd + B (⚠️ If you align file-tree dock to Right, this still opens Left)  
\- **Open/Close bottom dock:** Cmd + J  
\- **Open Terminal:** Ctrl + \`  
\- **Open file tree explorer:** Cmd + Shift + E  
\- **Close Current Buffer**: Cmd + W  
\- **Close Whole Project:** Cmd + Shift + W (this is kinda just Mac-specific lol)  
\- **Refactor change variable name:** Fn + F2  
\- **Change Theme: Cmd + K + T**  
\- **Wrap Text:** Opt + Z  
\- **Cmd + Option + Arrow:** Navigate Open Tabs  
**- Syntactic Fold/Unfold:** Cmd + Opt + { or  Cmd + Opt + }  (it feels A LOT better to 

**-> Different (VSCode -> Zed):**  
\- **Open a Project:** Ctrl + R  -> Opt + Cmd + O  
\- **Move lines up/down**: Opt + Up/Down -> Cmd + Ctrl + Up/Down  
\- **Splitting Panes:** Cmd + \\ -> Cmd + K then Arrow Keys (Would say it's easier)

**-> Only in Zed:**  
\- **Open/Close Right Dock:** Ctrl + R  
\- **Syntactic Selection:** Opt + Up/Down (You can select everything inside braces. COOL!)

\- **Features I wish I had here.**  
   \- Git Graph (💡 Can use LazyGit or GitUI as a substitute on the CLI)  
   \- Error Lens  
   \- Source Control Panel (diffs, stage changes, commit) (can also use LazyGit for this)   
   \- Navigating terminals (On VSCode, I could: ""Cmd + P > Term 1, Term 2"" to switch terminals)  
   \- Folding/Unfolding by Hierarchy (VSCode has Cmd + K + 2 useful when unfolding everything outside the cursor)

Hope that was insightful. Will personally use this as a cheatsheet as well. Playing around with it this early isn't really a reason to avoid it, it'll only get better in the future. Let me know if you found something cool that I didn't haha.",2024-03-13 17:14:21

    function customIcon(iconName) {

        let icon = document.createElementNS(svgns, ""svg"");

The issue is that while the elements are all correctly inserted into the page, the SVG is simply invisible (the `use` element says it measures 0\*0). Inline SVGs definitely work on the website, as it has icons built-in in seemingly identically the same way, confusing me even more as to why mine doesn't work.

I've validated my JS doesn't contain errors, there's no warnings/errors printing to console, and I've tried both `setAttribute` and `setAttributeNS` for the ID/classes. viewBox has to use `setAttributeNS` because of its case sensitivity.

So I slap on the free package of 5GB/month and I store my images and videos on it. The total files doesn't exceed 300MB but suddenly the egress usage went up to 11GB within a day, though it's possible because I didn't 'close' my localhost that streams a video all night from the storage (accidentally because I didn't know what 'egress' was).

Supabase team recommends upping to a higher package, but if I have larger egress, wouldn't it still exceed the limit very fast? since that 11GB within a day was only from 1 device, imagine 10+ devices? 

I fetched the images and videos directly from it's URL provided, so either I'm doing something wrong or I'm doomed to subscribe large cloud storage like AWS S3? The site itself would be deployed to production since it is my client's site.

1bcffnf,Error Handling Question,"Hey first post here because I got into a debate over this at work and I guess you could say it’s a matter of opinion but curious what others think, I don’t want to influence the answers so I’ll try my best to give the best points from all sides along with some cons. We have a section on our site which shows several different ad type things which are not really related but different things we’d like the user to do in a carousel. The UI calls one api to retrieve these items to display. An issue came up that the entire carousel failed to load because item 2 in the carousel requires some data from vendor which failed to respond and so the api gave a 500 with an error message indicating that the data couldn’t be retrieved from the vendor. We had a discussion around the design of this api and several ideas were thrown out:

1) The api should give a 200 ok and just not return item 2 which eliminates any impact to the end user other than item 2 being missing. This seems to contradict the idea that 200 indicates that the request was successful and seems to mean we need to catch any exceptions for item 1, 2, 3, etc separately so that one item will never impact another, even if the exceptions are unexpected and unable to be handled.
2) The api should give 200 ok but return item 2 with a status that indicates that an error occurred. This again lessens the impact to the UI, the successful items display and now there is a visual indicator that something went wrong so we are more likely to notice that the vendor is failing but again 200 is for success and we have to catch even unexpected errors and we may also need logic on the UI about what to do if expected attribute are missing.
3) Make no change, an unexpected error occurred so the service is correct to give a 500 (maybe 502 to indicate it was the vendor api that had an issue) and no additional dev is required if we go this route. The downside is the other items in the carousel could’ve displayed but get suppressed.

Wondering what other devs think about these or any other ideas on how this should be designed.",2024-03-11 21:47:09

I know there's plenty of plugins on the market that do this, but my situation is a bit unique in that it needs to be made from scratch.

I was hoping somebody might be able to help with resources to learn the fundamentals of PHP for this particular usage, or enlighten me of a faster way to do it haha.

I’m slowly learning PHP in general, but I'm on a bit of a time restriction and it would be really helpful if someone with far more skill and experience than me could advise me on VSC extensions, resources for learning wordpress dev, useful time saving tips so i can fill in the gaps for basic code writing with AI etc etc.

1b6lu3t,Any backend suggestions?,"I work for a large service provider for charter schools. We are currently planning to revamp our entire system for websites. We currently use a CMS with a page builder and our organization is fairly quickly outgrowing that system.

We have decided that we will be increasing the size of my team to develop the new system. At this point we are pretty much for sure going to be using Svelte-kit for the front.

Outline of what we do and why we need to change: Currently we support about 30 schools between 3 different states. Originally when we started in the 1st state it was nice because we could have that overarching brand page, any content repeats on our schools can just be set on the overarching brand page then we can link to it from all of the individual schools. So if ever update that content it will trickle down to the other sites. But now we are split between 3 states and those 2 new states have some ridiculous compliance requirements that make it so we can't do that anymore and all of our documents need to be individualized. So now the small web team we had is being completely overwhelmed managing static content.

So that brings me to what are we looking for in a backend.

We need a system where I can set data structures and then fetch that data with Svelte-kit for the website. Every individual school will have its own Front-end application. Ideally, we could use the same backend for the entire organization, then with that, every school can then have their web dashboard to control whatever fields I give them access to on their website. Then at the district office, we can also have specialized dashboards for each department where they get to control certain fields at all of the schools.

Right now if I had to start this project this instant I would go with the svelte-kit front-end application for each school website. Then I would probably build a [pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) as the main backend for everything then I would use Svelte again to build custom admin dashboards for everyone that needs it. but if there is a headless CMS option that can give me those fully modular unique dashboards for different groups in our org that is what we are looking for.

I have looked into a few headless CMS options already but, any suggestions are appreciated.",2024-03-04 20:52:09

My client is having trouble with his current developer (who I believe is a friend of his). He doesn't have the credentials to access the site and edit it himself, and the dev tends to take days in her responses. As his business is preparing to set up a new menu, its become fairly urgent for him. 

Right now, our current plan is this: we're prioritizing the site existing with the correct menu. The site, in general, is a pretty simple static site with the menu, location, hours, history, and a Doordash link. He's basically given me the go-ahead to cut any corners I can and use whatever free templates are at my disposal to slap anything simple together. One criteria he has is he very much so wants access to edit the site, even if it's html (which he's said he's familiar with, and considering how much he understood when we were talking I believe that), which I'm also trying to sort out the best solution to...

The thing is, we were also planning on a continued working relationship with improvements to the site, as well as having a retainer fee for edits to the site that he doesn't have time to dedicate to. While places like Word Press COULD give me a very simple base with the edit ability for him, I worry about the long-term when I get a chance to fully flesh the site out and future edits or additions. For one, I plan to code the sites I make mostly, and hosting is something I want to provide. They're a pretty big deal in the community and I'd love to have them to point people towards, but it'd also feel strange using a site I made completely differently than any other I create. 

Is there a good solution that could evolve as needed over time?

**Tried webpack**: I was able to separate logics as components using it but it also compiles code in single index.js file instead of creating exports in index.js files. But it separates components as folders and generates types properly after some tweaks.  The problem is that it doesnot create index.js file that contain commonjs export syntax that will export the each components and also for main index.js file that exports all components. 

Used storybook as well as nextjs to check if my components (Skeleton for example) were fine when used directly. Both worked without errors and only if I compile that same code using webpack and publish them as package , I am gettting 500 server errors in nextjs as well as vite.

I wanted to make server side supporting UI components but webpack and roller adds use context everywhere that without using ""use client""  at anywhere i import and use those ui components, I get self is not defined errors and after using use client, i get 500 error in nextjs.

So my question is how can i solve that?  Thanks for reading.   (I know you will think I migrated issues from bundler to server errors but all these are related to each other.)",2024-03-31 05:13:32

I am looking to hire help for design and development work for a sizeable portfolio of sites for medium-to-large companies. I need expert results for these sites (designing and building out new pages, sections, features, and troubleshooting these sites).

These sites are on WordPress, Webflow, Wix, and Squarespace.

I'm not clear on who I need to hire:

* Do I need to hire a web designer and web developer as separate roles?
* Do I need to hire individual experts for each of these platforms?

1brmfce,Let's talk about bloat and performance in computer,"So I was unsure about were to post this, maybe r/programminghorror , maybe more tech savy people like r/linux because we might want to discuss this as developers or users I've programmed mostly for webs, python (sparingly used scripts for scraping) and tried even some more ""obscure"" GUI frameworks like tk and gtk to a lesser extend.

The main topic when when it comes to performance is electron. This recent discussion on twitter was wild for instance: [https://twitter.com/SheriefFYI/status/1759278577814806970](https://twitter.com/SheriefFYI/status/1759278577814806970)  
Basically most of today's problems in needing a faster computer come from the website, you can have many small native system applications but when it comes to the web, everything nowdays is on social media and you're mostly forced to use those front-ends with **heavy frameworks like react** where search doesn't even work because content gets hidden with a user side Ctrl+F as it happens on twitter (call it X if you want it).

But those slow webpages have also come to the desktop with electron and 99% of the time those are better on a browser except for few things like maybe notifications (not entirelly true) or screen capture (firefox can't do it).

From time to time someone makes very simple webpages discussing about all these topics, particulary I like this one, and things explained in this article about how much computers have become faster or slower and what software vs hardware engineers are seen and what have they done [https://danluu.com/slow-device/](https://danluu.com/slow-device/)

This quote was quite interesting:  


> A question one might ask is how much performance improvement programmers  have given us. There are cases of algorithmic improvements that result  in massive speedups but, as we noted above, Discourse, the fastest  growing forum software today, seems to have given us an approximately 1000000x slowdown in performance 

  
Nowdays **even microsoft uses a webview** for installing windows and we're adding bloat that doesn't just consist on apps you might be able to unistall if something like the EU enforces it, but with the AI buzzword now it's getting added to everything. I don't want to sent my data for a external AI to organize my files, I want improvements in programs as basic as the file explorer, where are for example .png metadata compatibility? It's been there on the standard since 2017 so I can organize myself adding tags instead of a **power hungry AI**, doesn't matter if it's not my computer.

If only the top enterprises that talk about caring for the **enviroment** instead spent more money at creating native clients, I bet that would lower **energy comsuption** quite a lot and reduce waste because people wouldn't need to replace old ""slow"" computers.  


# While this was mostly a rant about the web and electron, here are some things I found out for making old computers usable or current ones snappier:

I also enjoy watching videos about old computers being revived with some linux distro and most of those at most go into using an extension to request h264 videos so those machines can play video without dropping frames like crazy.  
However, there are front-ends for youtube like [piped.video](https://piped.video) or invidious that not only serve in the format you want but are also much lighter and don't take seconds to switch to full screen

I'm also aware, I'm not the average user, but recently, I found myself much more productive in the few past years (and maybe my computer as well) as I incorporated some CLI and batch processing tools, and probably that would help some people, you can also **search for ""<CLI utility> GUI""** and you'll stay away from shady apps or needing to open websites, **yt-dlp** is amazing if you edit videos and need to hoard youtube, **ffmpeg frontends** like shutter encoder.

With tools like powertoys or **shell scripts leveraging magick** those I don't need to open photoshop to resize pictures and run some action, I was making some videogame-like project and I could shave something like a houndred MBs with Png Gaunlent, which is a front-end for PNGOUT and other utilities.

Also learning about how unoptimized png is for quickly compression when exporting an image sequence from blender or after effects and **using TIF or lossy EXR** instead reduced my rendering times a considerable amount.

Yeah, the last part was possibly more useful on graphic design, but since some people here might work at that I thought you could consider it useful.",2024-03-30 16:52:08

Many of them offer a ""timer"" popup that automatically launches after ""n"" seconds, but that's not the same. **I need a solution like YouTube that gives one button that says ""Share"" and when you click it brings up a popup that has the social share icons.**

For reference, I built a diy solution in Elementor, but the modal doesn't auto-close after the network icon is selected or the post is finished being published socially.

1bqdcbu,Used car listing website - dynamic fields or over engineering?,"I am building an used vehicle listing website as a solo project. It supports not just cars, but boats, motorcycles etc.

I implemented a multi-step form, which builds the listing and sends it onto backend.

For now, all the listing fields are hardcoded. Means that for vehicle color for example, I have manually added a text field, then on a listing page I have a mapper where I have manually added a map key which tells the page which icon to use, how to display and translate it etc.

Then when I told about this project to my friend, a debate started whether its better to use dynamic fields or not.

Technically it would allow the system to be more flexible, but on the other hand how often a new type of vehicle gets invented.

Right now I am leaning towards a hybrid approach, where it would be possible to add maybe vehicle category-specific fields using an admin panel or something, but I still feel like that could be over engineering it a bit. 

Like how hard is it to manually add some enums, pop in a text field and add translation keys.

As a (very) contrived example imagine a page where the user can update their name, email and phone number and all three are different GraphQL mutations. We only want to call mutations for information that was changed, so if the user changes their name and phone number, those are the only mutations we execute. Then, loop through the resolved promises and when one failed, inform the user, so when updating name and phone, if phone fails, we'd be able to display a success toast for name and error toast for phone. Something like:

    const mutations = [];
    
    if (nameChanged) {mutations.push(updateUserNameMutation());}
    if (emailChanged) {mutations.push(updateUserEmailMutation());}
    if (phoneChanged) {mutations.push(updateUserPhoneMutation());}

Not sure if this is the place to ask, but I have some questions on Authorizing a web app..

I am working on a website for a company that utilizes a CRM called HighLevel.

The frontend is entirely built with Svelte 4. 



About the site:
It is a public customer based site, so customers can fill out a form with data that will be sent to our CRM.



About HighLevel:
HighLevel supports the Authorization Code Grant flow w v2 APIs.


Where I’m at:

I have already generated an app and have generated the Authorization Page URL.

I have written a page on the site that successfully retrieves an access token. I BELIEVE this should only be used by the site owner though, right?

If so, what are best practices for doing this?

Currently I have a resource /initiate which generates the token and logs it to the console.

Basically, I just grabbed this token and stored it in our environment variables. Retrieving the. Access token from the environment, I am able to make requests to the CRM.

I just did this for now, to get the form submissions working.

Is there a standard or recommended way I should approach this though? I am working for a small company. Still need to utilize the refresh token to retrieve a longer lasting access token.

I am working as a freelancer, so I might not be there forever - but I want to ensure I use best practice.

Not sure if a public facing /initiate page is necessary, or subject to abuse.

I just get the impression something using a JS framework would probably be more impressive to employers even if it is technically simpler than my other projects, but I'm hoping they will see that if I can make consumer products that people actually buy written in assembly (built into circuits I've designed no less) that I can also do/learn whatever they'd need from me",2024-03-25 03:28:56
1bmo00z,A question about frontend testing,"Hello developers!

I have a question related to frontend testing. I have a lot of utility functions like these -

    /**
     * Returns array representation of an image element.
     * @param {HTMLImageElement} image 
     * @returns {Float32Array}
     */
    export function getArrayFromImage(image) {
        const canvas = document.createElement(""canvas"");
        canvas.width = image.naturalWidth;
        canvas.height = image.naturalHeight;
        const ctx = canvas.getContext(""2d"");
        ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0);
        
        return ctx.getImageData(0, 0, image.naturalWidth, image.naturalHeight).data;
    }

Now, I'm trying to add unit tests for them. How do I do it?

All the frontend testing libraries/frameworks that I could find can test components and not functions that could run in a browser. The utility functions that I want to test are very small parts of the components that they are being used in, thus, adding tests for the component for the sake of testing this function won't really make sense (right?).

I'm thinking of adding special components that only use these functions in different ways, only for the purpose of testing them. Is that how it is done? Or is there any other way of doing it?

Thanks in advance!",2024-03-24 15:54:07
1bmkunc,Best cloud service for a school project,"Hello everyone!

I'm currently working on a school project involving a full stack application with a RESTful API with basic CRUD operations. I'm using a dotnet backend with an SQLite database, and I'll be using Rider as my IDE since I'm working on a Mac. The frontend will be built with React.

I've previously deployed a similar structure using Azure, although I used MSSQL at the time. Unfortunately, my Azure account has expired. The experience with Azure was a bit challenging, especially on a Mac due to compatibility issues with MSSQL and Azure itself.

Anyways I'll get to the point. I'm looking for a relatively user-friendly cloud service that offers free deployment (or at least provides free credits for new sign-ups). I've explored AWS, but I didn't come across any free credit options. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",2024-03-24 13:32:28
1bmij6e,HTTPS on the apex domain ,"Hi, I’ve got a domain connected to a Bigcartel shop. Unfortunately Bigcartel seems to be defaulting to a www domain regardless of what you will add. You can add only one domain and only this one gets the ssl certificate. So in my case www.example.com is secure and working.

In Namecheap (my domain registrar) I’ve setup www to be pointed to the Bigcartel’s CNAME and for @ I’ve setup the URL Redirect Record to ‘https://www.example.com’

In the result visiting ‘example.com’ was redirecting correctly to the ‘https://www.example.com’ but when visiting ‘https://example.com’ it’s stuck hanging on load in browser possibly due to problem with resolving the SSL certificate.

/api

/private/api

My assumption is that I can make private endpoints listen only to specific IPs and connect my VPN to a gateway VPN that attaches to the network and subnet which will host the VM for the Spring Boot server, from there I can somehow use Postman to make calls to the server endpoints from my computer. However, upon searching more I found that people can actually spoof IPs making this security measure fairly worthless. My second idea is then split up this project into two spring boot projects with the private one being held in a completely different subnet, but this would make it more cumbersome to maintain.

Do you have any experience with that?,"One of the prospective clients I'm talking with is currently using [Sanity.io](https://Sanity.io) Headless CMS for their mid-size website and wants to migrate to WordPress (preferably WordPress Headless). 

I searched for experiences with this, but the results are the reverse: Moving from WordPress to Sanity. That makes sense, as Sanity is pretty new and is built around that expectation. 

I asked the client why they were planning this move. They said they were pretty smitten with it when they started a few years ago, and they have grown with it. But they also see it as impeding their future growth and success. It's getting more complex to maintain, build new features, and train their non-technical staff to use them. Plus, not many are familiar with its unique quirks. Cost is also one more reason. 

Why WordPress specifically (and not Prismic or any other CMS)? WordPress is FOSS and has big community support, especially in their industry (Digital Publishing). That's good enough for them to build a solid base on for future growth. 

We have experience migrating from other old/proprietary CMS to WordPress, but this request is a bit surprising. Do you have any experience with it? Please share if you do.

1bkgxrm,"Really frustrating issue with welcome emails/password reset emails being flagged as spam, even on 3 different mail relay services, but with some very confusing and contradicting scenarios. Could use some advice on where to go (more info inside).","I'm running a site built on Laravel. I already had a previous site set up on a different domain, and I was just using Gmail SMTP+app password for now because it was new and very low volume, and the welcome emails/password reset emails never had any issues delivering. I cloned the site for a new project, got a new domain, and again, Gmail SMTP had no issues. 

The moment I switched to Postmark, immediately the same emails were flagged as spam, despite me verifying with their support that my validation stuff (spf, dmarc, etc) were all set up properly. If the content of my emails was the problem, you'd think I would have had this problem before (I'm using the default Laravel email text as well, so I know it's not weird wording that would be causing it). I tried this with 3 other services (Resend, Sendgrid, and Mailgun) and I had the same spam issues with all of them. 

On all the flagged email I've received from all my tests, 100% of them have shown spf, dkim, and dmarc all as PASSED by gmail. https://i.imgur.com/eosKR30.jpeg

It gets more frustrating, because the aforementioned situation should lead me to believe that the content of the email isn't the problem, but whenever I send test emails via other methods (ones that send raw text with nothing else) these deliver successfully on all services. The other methods I'm referring to are:

> Mail::raw('Hello World!', function($msg) {$msg-to('testemailhere@gmail.com')-subject('Test Email'); });`

and 

> curl ""https://api.postmarkapp.com/email"" \  
  -X POST \  
  -H ""Accept: application/json"" \  
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \  
  -H ""X-Postmark-Server-Token: xxxxxxxx"" \  
  -d '{  
        ""From"": ""sender@example.org"",  
        ""To"": ""receiver@example.org"",  
        ""Subject"": ""Hello from Postmark"",  
        ""HtmlBody"": ""<strong>Hello</strong> dear Postmark user."",  
        ""MessageStream"": ""outbound""  
      }'  

Obviously the second one is only used with Postmark, but it delivers successfully when sent this way.

I've checked my domain and the the email contents on various spam checkers and nothing shows up as blacklisted or flagged/spammy, which makes sense because the emails work fine with sent through Gmail SMTP, and the raw emails also send fine through the test methods I mentioned. So it just makes no sense because no test gives me consistent results that help me pinpoint the problem. My domain is obviously not blacklisted/flagged because certain emails deliver fine, and the contents of the email are also not spammy or problematic, because they also deliver sometimes.

Anyone have any advice on where to go from here?

1bk3j0m,Issue with Turbo Rebuild Removing Next Module,"
Hey folks,

First: this is my first monorepo with pnpm and turbo.

I'm encountering a puzzling issue with turbo and pnpm and haven't been able to pinpoint the root cause. Here's my turbo configuration, which is fairly straightforward:

    {
      ""$schema"": ""https://turbo.build/schema.json"",
      ""globalDependencies"": [""**/.env.*local""],
      ""pipeline"": {
        ""build"": {
          ""dependsOn"": [""^build""],
          ""outputs"": [""build/**"", ""dist/**"", "".next/**"", ""!.next/cache/**""]
        },
        ""lint"": {
          ""dependsOn"": [""^lint""]
        },
        ""dev"": {
          ""cache"": false,
          ""persistent"": true
        }
      }
    }

My project structure is:

* `./apps/portal`: nextjs
* `./apps/gateway`: express+tsoa
* `./apps/api`: express+tsoa
* `./package/database`: prisma package

Upon a fresh clone of the repo, running `pnpm install` followed by `turbo build` works perfectly. However, if I run turbo build again without making any changes, the Next module is somehow removed from `node_modules\.pnpm\next@14.1.0_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0\node_modules\next`, causing the build to fail.

In order to make it build again I need:

1. kill turbo process
2. run `pnpm install --force --prefer-offline`

 I am running on Windows, with developer mode enabled to allow symlink.

* Turbo version: 1.12.5
* pnpm version: 8.15.4
* Next.js version: 14.1.0
* Node.js version: 20.9.0

I'm puzzled why the Next module is removed and why these steps are necessary to rebuild successfully. Has anyone encountered a similar issue or has insights into what might be causing this behavior? I'm looking for any configuration advice or troubleshooting steps that could help resolve this oddity.",2024-03-21 10:38:36
1bjoec6,Digital Ocean AppPlatform Intermittently Links Wrong Domain for SSL Certificate,"Strange issue here, wonder if anyone else has experienced it: 

Intermittently, a user of our app hosted on DigitalOcean’s AppPlatform will see a site not secure warning when navigating to our domain.

When the certificate is valid, it’s issued correctly to our domain from Google Trust Services, LLC. Expected.

It’s my understanding that DO’s AppPlatform manages certificate creation and renewal so it would seem this is an issue on their end. I’ve created a support ticket in the hopes that they can address it in a timely way.

That said, if anyone’s seen this before and is aware of how an app’s config could potentially be causing this on their AppPlatform I’d appreciate any insights.

For example planetscale using amazon & coachroach db uses google cloud (GCP). When decided on what database as a service to use do you need to make sure whatever DAS will be in the same datacenter  as whatever you using to host your app? For example if your going to use cockroach db then use should use GCP to host your app (preferably in the same colocation)? Am I overthinking this and perf should be fine just as long as your somewhat close? 

I would think if you don't do this then the latency could be really bad (doing database requests across the public internet). Assuming of course that you don't have really light data needs.

1bj9mtf,SERN Stack with Render,"I'm working on a portfolio project using the SERN stack, which will be hosted on the Render free tier. As I understand it, both front and back end have to be hosted separately, does this mean that there would be a spin up time for the front end, then an additional spin up time for the back end request? I could make the front end static, although this would be quite a big limitation for the project as I don't fully understand how to go about making a multi page site static with React. The real solution is probably using a different back end, but this project is specifically to learn the SERN stack. Is there perhaps a better hosting solution?

I'm experiencing strange behavior with the LCP metric.

The **2nd strange thing** is that:  
- LCP result in PageSpeed is around 1.5 - 1.8 s, but I'm not able to reproduce, because LCP is always under 700 ms in Performance tab in DevTools (photo attached). Could it be possibly because of the simulated throttling?



Any ideas?

1bi985v,Is it worth it for me to relearn a web stack like React with Astro over using WordPress?,"Title is pretty much the question. In a previous post I tried asking how I could find a decent contractor and came to the conclusion that it's just not worth it and I should build the site myself.

I'm kind of a weekend warrior type dev. It's not my full time job and I'm not super great at it, but I know it well enough to be dangerous. I'm way more familiar with building WP sites than having to learn a whole new stack. 

The thing that keeps getting at me is that I know WP is dated and kinda slow, and from what I have learned with React. It's way easier to build a component than have to mess around with the WP loop in PHP. 

When I ask ChatGPT this question it really boils down to site performance and making things more custom. I dont know that I need to go too custom or crazy, and now a days I can just use ChatGPT to help my build additional functionality with WP if I don't know how haha. 

So am I fine with continuing on with WP or am I shooting myself in the foot with a slow site? Seems like I cannot get my sites up into that 70+ range for performance with WP sites and thinking maybe React would get me there. Though I don't know how much that really impacts SEO.

Basically, what’s the procedure for 
- bug reports 
- feature suggestions  / ideas 

What software do you use to keep track of it? Who takes in the information and organizes it to delegate to devs? Is that person basically the liaison for the dev department? And what about CTO duties? 

I also assume the CTO makes all the daily decisions on the tech side but only involves the CEO for anything larger (massive new features, etc)? Or does the CEO typically handle everything and delegate down to the CTO?

&#x200B;

Its basically a ""video editor"" which syncs text(and other clips) with audio. Its like a mini after effects I guess. I checked wappalyzer and couldnt find if they were using any library etc. I tried inspecting through devtools, and when you press play, the audio plays in the background while the main editor view keeps changing div content(its not canvas or svg or anything similar). Not sure how they are ""timing"" these div changes to audio timing.

&#x200B;

Assuming these are just divs and they are just changing divs every frame, I am also not sure how they are able to export it into mp4(there is an export button at the top). Maybe they are playing it in a headed browser(playwright, puppeteer, browserstack etc) and then just screen recording it? But this wouldnt give 4k quality etc. And export video seems to have multiple options related to compression level, so maybe they are using some ffmpeg library to render the video to mp4. But then if our assumption about divs are correct, how are they taking some divs and passing them to ffmpeg utility to generate a mp4?

P.S If anyone wants to create a video, I think you can try it without creating an account. Adding an image below on how the editor looks

        static DoSomething() {
            console.log(""hello world"");
        }
    }
    
    CollectionClass.DoSomething();

Option 2: Dictionary

    let CollectionDict = {
        DoSomething: () => console.log(""hello world"")
    
        // or (depending if one-line or multiline function)
    
        DoSomething: () => {
            console.log(""hello world"");
        }
    };
    
    CollectionDict.DoSomething();

If you know of other ways I'd be interested to hear. I personally prefer option 2, but what is the proper way to have a collection of methods around a common topic?

The methods are all static, these are never used on an instance of anything; they are individual processes but are grouped under a similar category.

I have only recently been converting my templates to a more OOP approach as I have always used OOP and wanted to organise my snippets. I was fine sorting out the PHP, but since JS has a few ways to do things because of it's syntax possibilities I am stuck, unsure how to proceed.",2024-03-15 17:43:13
1bf6vpm,Complete Web Component Frameworks/Systems (OS or Licensed),"I am a veteran Ruby on Rails engineer looking to move away from React, and more into Turbo land. In doing so I am having a hard time finding a UI framework that works with how my brain does. In particular, I have no problem making a neat usable UI, but I don't really like CSS. Like at all. I love the _component_ nature of React. I want to concentrate on the logic, which the components let me do for the most part. In the past I have used `semantic-ui-react`; Its a fairly complete component kit, has sensible defaults for spacing and such, and flexible enough to let you do quite a bit, without having to know/remember/lookup 500 CSS class names. I rarely had to write custom CSS, save for sizing/coloring a logo in the header or something. I understand I _am_ being picky. I want the _component_ html tag nature of React, thus Web-Components, and not have to write stuff like `<button class=""btn btn-primary"">`. Really? Is the button a btn? I'm shocked. (I accept the ""full buy in"" nature of using a framework like this and ""giving up"" the freedom.)

All that being said, I am trying to find something like the above but for web-components. It does not have to be open source, I am totally ok paying for a License for something as well. Something that can easily be introduced (preferably without requiring Node) and gives me.. _components_. Some of what I have looked at below with my concerns / thoughts.

I could even consider with the idea of wrapping React components to be Web Components (with something like react-2-web-component, preact has a package to do this also), but I would be concerned with performance & playing nice with turbo frames/streams. This could let me use semantic-react-ui or shadcn/ui maybe?

* Nordhealth Design System (private) - This. _This_ is what I want. I would not be writing this post if I could use it. It's got everything I want, sane defaults, looks good, plentiful component set, page layouts, flexible, etc. I emailed the support address but haven't heard back. Their terms state for Nordhealth use only.
* SAP UI5 Web Components (Apache v2) - Looks decent enough but would require Node. Bundle size for even a few components grows big fast. How does Apache v2 work if I wanted to use it in a SaaS?
* Vonage Vivid (Apache V2) - Looks decent enough as well, limited in number of components.
* IBM Carbon - The square blocky rough edges look turns me off. I could probably fix this fairly easily. No CDN support. Not even sure if it is usable outside of IBM?
* Arcgis Calcite - This has the same rough edges as Carbon but they pull it off better. My biggest concern is can it be used _outside_ of Arcgis? While it _says_ you just need an Arcgis account to use them, the license falls under their ""Master Licensing Agreement"" and... I have no idea what that actually says.
* Vaadin - This looks good too, but its centered around Typescript or Java. There is zero documentation as far as simply using the web components themselves, ala CDN. $140 a month for the Pro license seems a _little_ expensive for a single developer but not out of my realm for use; or at least the monthly over yearly seems odd? Does this include any sort of perpetual license?
* Duet - Same as Nord private. Also not of the same [personal] caliber.
* Shoelace - Last but not least. It is good. I really wish it had a table element, and any sort of templates for actual page layouts, app bar, side nav, to name a few.
* Umbraco (MIT) - Just stumbled upon and need to investigate further.

I have looked at ""all"" the web component lists/blog posts/articles out there for the past few years; most other frameworks I've found are abandoned, have 10 components, or are bare bones with no ""look"" to them. I some how manage to find yet different ones each day (like Umbraco).

So... Does anyone know of any Web Component based UI Frameworks that are fairly _complete_ in the number of components included, has a nice default look & feel to it, is flexible enough to let you design magnificent user interfaces. Again, if it has to be licensed thats fine. I think my second best option is to spend a fair amount of time using something like Lit or Stencil to ""wrap"" something like Shadcn or Fomantic into Web Components, but... in all honesty, I'd rather pay for something.

Thanks for any help you can provide.",2024-03-15 05:46:35

1bf2xpz,How to find a good web dev contractor?,"Hi All,

I'm exhausted... I used to dabble in web dev myself a few years back with Wordpress but then ended up getting a day job in software implementation. Now a days I'm a senior application consultant helping gazillion dollar businesses with adding custom functionality into their software and back-end systems, and I simply don't have the time to do web dev after work.

Regardless of my job, I want to get out of the day job and start my own web dev business. I have a client right now that I'm close with so they know I'm trying to farm this work out. I've mainly used upwork in the past. Mainly for SEO stuff that never really resulted in anything good. I've also had a dev build some custom functionality for WordPress that ended up being absolute garbage after about a month to the point where I just gave up on it and was out $400. 

I've learned from these experiences so this time I'm trying to vet candidates a lot more. I posted my job posting on how I need a website built and what I'm looking for as well as providing examples. I got over 100 applicants in 2 days. Goodness.. 

So far I've review all applicants and narrowed it down based on price and how the sites look. Off the bat, a web dev that is $12/hr has a site that looks as good if not better than some that are $50/hr. So it's pretty hard to tell who to go with so I started archiving the expensive folks and shortlisting the ones that had good sites at a fairly low price.

Okay now I'm down to about 15 applicants, and I hit them with 6 questions to vet them even more and understand their workflows. Pretty much all of them responded, and holy cow a lot of them were freaking essays. I got to thinking though, did they use ChatGPT to fluff this up? Sure enough only 3 of the candidates actually wrote their answers to me while the others used ChatGPT :(

So now I'm down to the three candidates and I start looking at their sites more in depth, and I run them through PageSpeed Insights. Woof, one of them had a rating of 9 for mobile and a lot of the others were pretty bad too. 

I'm thinking to myself, okay, you get what you pay for so let's go back and look at the expensive folks. I run their sites through PageSpeed and it really was not much better, just a tiny bit. 

Now the only thing I can think of with someone more expensive is maybe they can build a site faster so the overall cost will be the same or less than that of someone who is cheap and takes forever, but I don't really know that for sure. 

Overall, this process is a nightmare. How do you all find a good web dev, that is legit, doesn't BS, and uses best practices? I'm looking to build a WP site, but don't want it full of BS plugins to design the site. I want a clean, smooth, fast site that can start landing my client leads. 

Does anyone have any tips? Should I just avoid upwork all together? Any insight would be greatly appreciated, and if you've made it this far thanks for reading!

tl;dr - trying to find a web dev on upwork and it sucks because there are so many applicants and even when I try to vet them they all seem about the same even though their price range is wildly different. What's the best way to find a good solid, HONEST web dev to help me build sites at a decent price?",2024-03-15 02:10:18

I am looking forward making a living from web dev by my own as a freelancer.

\- Customers that want a simple informative site. Simplest situation, I would go with nextjs or astro for this.

\- Customers that want an ecommerce. Here I have no experience, and I have been reading and watching some videos about the solutions. As far as I know I have these main options:

* Shopify as a complete CMS (simple frontend included?)
* Shopify as a headless CMS with nextjs for the frontend.
* Payload which is nextjs + CMS.

They do a lot of business, and have avoided any legal issues so far, but the possibility of partnering with a few new marketing firms has got them anxious. 

They have asked us to think of areas that they could address in future contracts to avoid litigation due to liability (such as our hosting provider going down, possible data breaches,  ADA compliance, etc.) They have made it very clear that they are not expecting us to write contracts or be legal experts, and that everything we bring forth will just be in addition to the legal guidance they will be receiving.

Currently, we have the UI made within Unity itself (see [https://imgur.com/a/sHFPODC](https://imgur.com/a/sHFPODC)), but I'd like to eventually get it moved over to a webpage. For context, this is an interface for employees at an escape room to see room progress at a glance and send clue messages or override puzzles when needed.

The Unity project handles all of the room logic (when players enter this keycode/move that lever, then open that door/start that light pattern/play that audio clip), and presumably it would be the one to initialize the server, so the webpage would be locally hosted on that computer (I can't think of a good reason not to just locally host.)

So given all that, what framework, if any, would you recommend for a complete web dev beginner to create said user interface and handle the communication between the Unity application and web page? I'm not trying to make the most beautiful website in the world, but I would like it to be a couple steps above bare bones HTML. I am fairly comfortable with c++, c#, and python, and I've used js for a couple one-off personal projects. Stretch goals would be for the page layout to be somewhat dynamic, so that an employee who is out of the room could glance at their phone to see how much time a group has left or see if they've requested a clue. And a really stretchy goal would be to add the ability to to access that user interface from a different network. It would also be nice for there to be some sort of URL alias so that we don't need to enter the IP address to open the interface for a given room. Edit: I also think I want to use websockets (based on my limited reading/understanding) so that employees can see in real time what players are doing. Currently we can see exactly which button on a keypad is being pressed as they press it, which I'd hate to lose.

1bcfam4,How to deal with initial data needed for a new feature in my app?,"I have an app that has been running smoothly for a while now and I will soon deploy a new update that implements a new feature. For the feature to be functional, it needs some initial data to be already present in the database.

I had such features before, but the amount of data needed was so small that I can manually added it to the database after deploying the new version in less than a minute.

This time is different, though: the amount of data is not trivial to use my usual method. As a workaround, I hid the new feature behind a feature flag, to give myself the necessary time to manually add the data to the database.

So, I'm wondering, what's the more ""correct"" way to implement this? I have the app running in my dev environment, and thought about add the data using the dev app, then export the tables from there and import them from the production app. But I don't know how safe this would be.

For reference, my app is a dockerized Django. And the initial data is in the realm of \~150 rows across 2 or 3 tables.",2024-03-11 21:41:52

Hey all,

I'm trying to add a custom border to the top of my clients footer section. here's an example:

[https://ashevillebeecharmer.com/honey/](https://ashevillebeecharmer.com/honey/)

if you noticed the ""custom ""border is an SVG of semi-circles copied and pasted together with it's respective path

**MY questions are:**

Is this designed in a software like illustrator?

How could you possibly figure out the best ""path"" without going absolutely insane? (I *must be* missing something there.)

on the example given the CSS reads

.scalloped-top-footer {

1. position: absolute;
2. left: 0%;
3. top: -0.6em;
4. right: 0%;
5. bottom: auto;
6. color: #e69721;

The issue is that on the desktop site, the tabs look silly since there isn't that much information to display in each one, which wastes a ton of space for nothing, so it would make sense to turn the three 'tabs' into three columns each with its own data all displayed together, but that requires more that editing a css class, should I make a desktop component/page and a mobile one for these changes?


2- And regarding the css difference between a desktop and a mobile page, do I simply use the same class name for a component, then use media queries to define it twice, each with it's own selectors?

3- What about tailwind classes that has stuff like md:-- or sm:--? Are those the same as media queries, just in a more compact way?

      firmId String
    
      isCustomerActionRequired Boolean @default(true)
    
      requestStatus RequestStatus @default(REQUESTED)
    }

The basic idea with this application is: There are certain set of company information some which I am already tracking in my company model and some which I might not be tracking in my company model.

Let's say The firm needs companyName for their action and the companyName might be missing, I am building a system which allows the firm to request companyName from the user, which is tracked using the Request model, where value is the value entered by the user for their companyName and the requestedFields is where I store the key values and types for the kind of the information required.

I have a config on my backend which looks like this:  


         fields: [
            {
              key: ""COMPANY_NAME"",
              type: FieldType.TEXT,
              displayValue: ""CompanyName"",
            },
            
          ],

&#x200B;

Now for each object in the fields model I create a row in the Request model the type of the field is used to render specific components on the client side

1b9kff0,Node + Prisma + Graphql - Working with large databases [NEED ADVICE],"Hi.

New to backend development, and would like some advice or opinions you have over an issue i am facing right now in the early development stage of a web application.

Going right into the problem:  
I have 2 tables that hold vehicle data (Vehicle) and vehicle attributes (Attributes) data, and another table (VehicleAttributeValue) that connects these two. This 3rd table gets pretty huge very fast since lets say a single car can have around 25 attribute values. The application should be able to deal with a pretty big number of vehicles, lets say 5000+, so now we are at 125000+ rows for VehicleAttributeValue table.

Q1: First question for me as i am pretty new to backend and database development is, is this 125000+ number of rows common in relational databases or starting from this i am choosing the wrong database here?

So now the actual issue starts happening when i need to query that data using graphql. If i keep my limit relatively low (around 100) the response is delayed quite a bit (2+ seconds) but its returning... If i increase it to a very large limit (maybe practically unrelalistic idk) like 1000, NOW, node js runs out of memory. So this does seem more like a graphql (javascript/node) issue where node runs out of heap memory, rather than a database issue but im not sure.

Q2 (3 and 4): I know i can increase node heap memory limit, but that should not be the real solution here i think. What is the right approach to solve this kind of issue? Should i see my database schema as the first issue? Should i see graphql resolvers as the first issue? Where do i start with improving here?

&#x200B;

PS: If i should provide more information over the application i sure will, just let me know.

&#x200B;

Stack:

Keystone JS (node / typescript / graphql / prisma / mysql)

NextJS (react / graphql) <- irrelevant for the issue

&#x200B;

tldr:

i have a connecting table in mysql that holds many many rows, 125000+. When i query data that involves that table, and i query for a large amount of rows, node runs out of heap memory. Am i doing something wrong from the get go? Am i using the wrong stack? How can i improve it?",2024-03-08 09:48:40

Does it still suck to develop for like traditional Sitecore or is it actually a nice fast headless CMS? We aren't a .net shop, does that matter since it's headless?



Context: I run a corporate website (not ecommerce). We currently use a mid-tier 'hybrid headless' CMS. It's been fine, I guess. Their editor interface is slow and clunky, and their development tools are non-existent / painful. Add in dismal customer support, a massive site outage, and I am considering a migration.

Our parent company uses monolithic Sitecore. This is a no go for me for obvious reasons, but Sitecore does have a newish hybrid headless CMS.

I am looking for a lightweight headless platform that is fast for my editors, and a toolset and workflow that is pleasant for my developers. I am not looking for a lot of bells and whistles, our site is static HTML with JS, and we have homegrown tools for personalization and form submissions--but I am looking for a platform that has decent integrations into Translation Memory tools, or at least can accommodate a sane multi-language site.

1b81akf,Good design patterns for rendering  inputs forms with dynamically defined fields (with Python FastAPI and Jinja2 as hard requirements)?,"We have a medium size internal dashboard we want to add a new section to. The idea is that a subset of users will be able to upload a JSON which contains some representations of objects that need to be rendered, this could be any number text input boxes, check boxes, toggle sliders, range sliders, file uploads, drop down menus, etc. When the user clicks a button the input will all be gathered in a JSON and will be POST to a particular page.

I am strictly limited by working within the confines of a code base that is current using a mix of FastAPI and Jinja2 templating. Other than that I'm not really typically a web developer--I typically write lower level libraries and am used to working in a heavily OOP manner employing common (Gang of Four) software design patterns to do so.

I had two ideas each about how to go about, but I'm not sure which is better (if either). I'm also interested in knowing if there are any design patterns which strike you as applicable for developing this type of feature. I'm still trying to figure out how one might implement OOP design structures in FastAPI since it seems to lend itself to heavily towards modules of functions.

In general, I can either
1. Generate the template each time (I.e. Look up the JSON by a UID, parse it/run whatever templating function will return that HTML) or
2. pre-build templates when their JSON is first loaded and pull up this pre-prendered template by a UID.

Side note: eventually different versions of a particular form will exist (think UID + version) and we want to keep track of them all and possibly make them all accessible for viewing (i.e. A drop down in one corner).

Im general I lean towards option #1 since it allows us to do things like have new theming/CSS/styling features or other changes propagate to old forms if we decide to change how a toggle switch or input form looks or works in the future without needing to generate some script that goes through updates each form's appearance",2024-03-06 14:39:07

1b7joem,Need Help Identifying and Managing Bot Traffic Influx on Shopify Store," Hey everyone,

I'm encountering a issue with my Shopify store that I hope someone here might have insights into. Currently, I'm seeing a significant influx of bot traffic, with upwards of 50k sessions per month. Google Analytics is flagging this traffic as Direct, and it seems to be limited to just hitting the home page without any further engagement.

All of this traffic appears to originate from China. However, since I also have genuine traffic from the same region, simply blocking traffic from China isn't a viable option.

Upon further investigation using Microsoft Clarity, I've noticed that the visited URL is listed as '[https://Electron](https://electron/),' referred from contoso.com, which is a fictional company associated with Microsoft. I'm unsure if this discrepancy is due to Clarity not being able to gather sufficient information to track these sessions accurately.

Despite Shopify and Google Analytics supposedly having mechanisms in place to detect and block bot traffic, neither seems effective in this particular case.

I'd greatly appreciate any suggestions or insights on how to better identify and manage this bot traffic issue. Thanks in advance for your help!",2024-03-05 23:07:13
1b7f4d8,Creating a website which is heavy on data and charts,"Hi all

Very new here but looking to learn about web development. I'm hoping someone can help me wade through the quagmire of different CMS options, subscription models and widgets!

What I'm hoping to achieve:

* I have a keen interest in personal finance and want to build an accessible website for things like tax planning, pension saving and budgeting
* As you can imagine, this will be quite heavy on data and charts - I'd like users to be able to enter their own financial situation and see outputs in the form of dynamic charts and insights
* Ideally they would be able to create a login and save their previous workings
* I am looking to minimise the amount of actual coding I have to do. I have a background in Python/C++ from university, so I understand the logic and can get into the weeds if I need to, but it's not a core strength

Thus far I've found it really hard to work out which CMS would be right for me, and struggled to find any good options for building dynamic charts particularly where these would be generated by user-defined variables.

Does anyone have any tips on where to start? Really appreciate it.",2024-03-05 20:08:45
1b7bvwx,Need advice on creating my first full website,"Hey guys!

My barber is opening a small barbershop and he asked me if I can make his website, as I'm a very recent computer science graduate.

What I mean by ""website"" in this scenario: 

1. Something that is not VERY complex, both in terms of looks and functionality. Will probably have pages like Home, Prices, Book, Gallery, Contact. 
2. Will need a database to store the bookings, most probably in an SQL database. Will also need a backend of some sort, as he wants to have a system with automatic emails (probably confirmations and reminders of bookings) ()
3. Will require deployment 

My current experience is: I've done multiple front-end only websites, mostly with React. I also started diving into Next.js, but don't have crazy experience yet. I also know some Java and Python. 

My main questions are: 

1. Would you recommend React or Next.js? I've heard Next.js is way easier to deploy, so I'm currently tempted to use that. Change my mind if I'm wrong.
2. What deployment platform do you reccommend? I have some limited experience with AWS, but I've heared Heroku and Vercel are some good options to consider. Please help me understand why I should choose one over another. 
3. What do you recommend for the automatic emails? if it's easier, I might also look into automatic text messages (so on phone #), but I feel like it's easier working with email.
4. What should I use on backend? (if I even need one) 
5. Should I bother with user account creation or am I going too far?
6. Should I make a separate ""admin"" platform (for my barber) to manage booking and such? If not, please give me some ideas on what I could do.

I know it's quite a lot, but I don't have much experience with building a website, so I'm looking for advice. 

Thank you!

1b6v8fr,Seeking Advice: Best Web Stack for Displaying Process Summarization for Beginners,"Hello everyone,

I'm working on a project where I need to display a summarized view of various business processes, their inputs/outputs, and associated roles in a clear and concise manner. The data is structured as follows:

- **Inputs and Outputs** related to each process.
- **Roles** involved in the process, categorized by their responsibility (Responsible, Approval, Consulted, Informed).

Here's an example of the kind of summary I'm aiming to display:

| 4             | 1.1.1.1      | Monitor regulation trend | Applicable regulatory laws | Regulatory trend monitoring report | MANAGER Regulation; VP Regulation | Risk Director | Stakeholder | Board of Director |

I'm relatively new to web development and looking for advice on the most suitable web stack that would allow a beginner like me to achieve this. The key criteria are:

- **Ease of Use:** Something that's beginner-friendly and has a gentle learning curve.
- **Flexibility:** Able to handle the dynamic nature of the data (as the number of roles or processes can change).
- **Scalability:** Can start small but is capable of scaling up as the project grows.

I've heard about various technologies like HTML/CSS for the frontend, JavaScript or Python for scripting, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB for storing the data. However, I'm not sure how to piece these together for my specific use case or if there's a better approach.

Could anyone recommend a web stack or specific technologies that would be best suited for a beginner working on this type of project? Any advice on frameworks, libraries, or tools that could simplify the process would be greatly appreciated.

I'm thinking of starting a web dev business as a side hustle for the time being, then scale over time to eventually become my primary career. I'm currently an Electrical Engineer, but don't feel like this is my place in this world. Although I have had great experiences and have seen a lot of cool things, I struggle to see an enjoyable future in this.

I began developing a free Google website for my wife's business, and really love everything about the processes. Being self-taught, as most people are, it was fun learning how to code different aspects of the website and watching it come to life after I figured it out. That instant dopamine hit was well received and I would find myself working on her website for hours on end.

All this being said, I was thinking of continuing my Meta Front-End Development training in Coursera and want to work with web designers to build my skills. I am not much of the creative type, hence why I want to work with the designers, and focus my attention in the more technical side. I am sure that I will develop my skills and learn more about design techniques as I go and may get to the point of doing the designs myself.

I said all of that to ask:

1. Is this a dumb idea, or is there still a good market need for web developers?
2. Will AI take over and wipe out the need to hire web designers/developers?
3. What are some of the best ways to begin this venture?

1b5mjsw,Inside Chrome Browser - Part 2,"This a nice blog, explaining what happens inside the browser when you do a navigation, basically when you enter some text in the address bar.  
  
This is part 2 of the Inside Chrome browser series, so it shows how processes and threads communicate when you start doing any navigation.  
  
As mentioned in part 1, everything outside a tab is handled by a browser process, so it has threads like UI thread which handles drawing input box and buttons, and network thread to handle the network stack and to get data from the internet, and more.  
  
The blog shows how when you enter something in the address bar, the UI thread first checks if it's a query to send to a search engine or a URL of a site you requested. If it's a site, it starts a network thread and starts showing a loading spinner in the place of the site favicon.  
  
It shows how if a server responds with a redirect request with header 301, the network thread communicates with the UI thread, and a new URL request is initiated.  
  
The blog also shows how once getting the response from the server, the network checks if it's an HTML file that needs to be rendered or a zip file that needs to be downloaded (if it's then it needs to be passed to the download manager)  
  
If it's an HTML file, the network threads tell the UI thread, and then the UI thread starts a renderer process which takes care of rendering the web page.  
  
And, in last it shows what happens when you try to navigate to a different site now, and what happens in the case of the service worker.

1b4zrou,Whare are the best (and easiest) tool to use for creating static vanilla HTML/CSS sites with reusable blocks?,"Hey!

EDIT: For those coming and interested in what I ended up using, I followed [Jaydan Urwin](https://youtu.be/uzM5lETc6Sg?list=PLtLXFsdHI8JTwScHvB924dY3PNwNJjjuW)'s tutorial on how to use [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and that's exactly what I needed! Being able to reuse code blocks and create divs for each project, etc... cool stuff! See the finished website [here!](https://declos.ca)

So a little bit of background, I'm a graphic designer and I currently host a little portfolio site through Cloudflare pages. Thing is - the way I currently build my website is the most janky thing ever - I use php to reuse components eg: footer, header, etc.. but php requires a site to be hosted and CF only supports static HTML so - I host the website locally, then run a bunch of wget commands to download the html files, then rename the files to remove the php suffix to the file names to not mess up my links. Another annoying thing is creating new blog posts, I need to manually duplicate past project files and manually write out the html for the page, which isn't ideal. Needless to say - that's a really annoying way to work, even though all the scripts kinda run on their own - I need to find a better way to actually build it.

So that's why I'm looking at alternative solutions. Problem is, I know nothing about frameworks or any fancy modern system that helps you build sites nowadays - the only thing I'm familiar with is vanilla html, css and a little bit of js.

So, what I'm looking for in terms of solutions:

1. An easy way to create reusable components that aren't .php or require hosting.
2. An easier way to create blog posts.
   1. I've looked into headless CMS' of the world and Hugo, but I just can't wrap my head around them. Hugo seems to have a structure it likes to follow and seems hard to customize without knowing Hugo intricately, and linking a CMS to my local folder of html files is a task that seem not super straightforward for someone with zero knowledge like me.

What would y'all recommend I look into solutions wise? I feel like I'm a bit helpless here without having to learn a complete framework to help me out, but maybe that's the only way forward..? Or not..? I'm not even sure what tools a framework would provide me with.. Anyhow, if anyone has any recommendations I would be tremendously grateful :) (Preference for FOSS stuff, I don't want to go into SASS subscriptions to build my site like webflow, just want better tools to help me out.)",2024-03-02 21:49:23

I am not exactly a novice to web development. My comfort zone is scripting (PS, Bash, vbScript, etc). I am a full stack deployment engineer but not a developer. I have experience setting up infrastructure. I've setup databases, clusters, web & app servers, load balancers, reverse proxies and implemented firewall rules all in enterprise environments. My employer provides a product, and my responsibility is to deploy an 8-pack of servers (2 per env) and all the infrastructure required for the product implementation of a given client. We keep track of our progress in MS Excel. We call it a workflow.

This is where your help comes in. One day I was bored (the deployments take 12 to 18mos). I decided to setup IIS on a seldom used Jumpbox that few people are even aware of. Someone put a bug in my ear about Bootstrap and jQuery. I was shocked at how easy it was and how far I got in just a weekend. I have the UI developed that could potentially replace our MS Excel Workflow which is clumsy and can be like trying to swallow an elephant in a single bite. I was able to enter new clients and servers and all the information needed to process a client deployment. I even added a bunch of bells and whistles and made it look gorgeous! However, all the data I was entering was ephemeral and only served the purpose of gauging the 'look and feel' of the UI. I needed the data to persist so that I wouldn't have to keep re-entering it. So, I spun up MySQL and exported a bunch of CSVs from SharePoint and imported them into a database I created for all this. This is where I sit now.

TLDR: I need help deciding on the server-side solution to use to connect the bootstrap/jQuery front-end to the MySQL database backend. Right now, I am thinking that I need to delve into PHP and Ajax. This is intimidating to me. I don't want to spend a lot of time on a learning curve. Bootstrap/JQuery was a pleasant surprise at how easy it is. I do not get that impression of Ajax/PHP. I'm not even 100% sure that these are server-side or not. I need guidance. I have time, but I need/want to spin something up relatively quickly. Can you guys recommend a pathway, please?

1bsgk2s,Data engineer - Need your advice on FE things,"Hi all,

I collect all sorts of interesting data then pipeline it all into a SQL db. I then do some neat stuff to make the data easier to digest, time series, aggregations etc.

Now I'd like to start offering insights from that data back to people. 

1. What's the easiest way I could create some kind of front end / microsite that would make it easy to display this data? 
2. I'd like some form of email sign up too as I'd love to release a monthly newsletter on data insights. 

Data really is my 'thing' and I'm not good  on Front End development and TBH don't want to get bogged down on building and admin of FE. 

* Any products/Services out there I can utilise for this FE? Or some easy frameworks I can use to achieve the above?
* Ideally I'd want something like a streamlit dashboard displayed as a site with some different sections for different data displays but with a sign up email form too.

Now in another I call XPageViewModel I create a class and the first thing I do is do an init function in it where I add the state and setState to it. 

const state = null
const setState = null

init(state, setState) {

Abd then using dependency injection I add the view model to the react page and call the init function. This way I have access to the entire state using the viewmodel across all components without passing it as prop.

1bs7d5i,Browser fingerprinting and add-ons,"I'm a web dev and I develop browser add-ons as a hobby project.  I'm aware that having add-ons can make your browser more unique to fingerprinting scripts.  I am interested in minimizing the finger-printable surface area of my projects as much as possible.  

It is (unsurprisingly) quite hard to get good data on what metrics are used by these proprietary fingerprinters.  So I have some questions for anyone who has some experience with this.  

1. I am not aware of a script loaded from a website having any ability to access the add-ons directly.  So they shouldn't be able to see which addons are running or even how many?
2. Website scripts would be able to detect mutations to the DOM e.g. a dark reader changing the background colour.  So I guess this is a dead giveaway that you are running a specific add-on?
3. Website scripts and web servers would be able to detect requests blocked by the browser.  Add-ons like uBlock are pretty ubiquitous so using their default block list is probably not much of a give away, but using less common block lists would probably make you stand out?
4. Is there a case for blocking 3rd party scripts outright?  For fingerprinting scripts to be effective they need to track you across domains, which means they are almost certainly being loaded as 3rd party scripts.  Blocking them seems like a no brainer for online privacy.  Websites which break without them could be loaded up in a separate environment as needed to mitigate the risk of your traffic being correlated. 

Thanks in advance, I appreciate any input, even if it's just letting me know I'm totally wrong haha.  

Side note: This is mainly aimed at firefox and its forks.  Chrome has most of the same APIs but I doubt it's users are that interested in online privacy.  ",2024-03-31 10:36:15

1brpe8s,"Firewall issue: SOME emails blocked, but not all","I use CSF (ConfigServer Firewall) and Cloudflare, on a CentOS server.

On March 22, I discovered that SOME emails to users on my server were being returned to senders. Some were definitely coming through, but some weren't. I ended up having to disable CSF, at which time hundreds of emails started to come in.

This problem didn't happen on March 21, so it was a new issue after I hadn't changed anything. So it had to be something automated.

These IPs were in my Temp Block:  
64.145.93.198  
50.223.38.94  
72.177.80.230

And this is the only one in my Perm Block:  
50.223.176.171

But IPs that were definitely blocked were (based on the ones that came in to me after I disabled CSF):  
170.10.151.103  
170.10.150.241  
198.2.144.27  
149.72.208.120  
168.245.59.112  
167.89.89.106

You can see that none of the delayed emails have IPs in the same range as those blocked.

I THINK that I have CSF configured properly with Cloudflare, but it's complicated and confusing so I wouldn't bet my life on it. But I hadn't changed anything with Cloudflare recently either, and disabling CSF is what seemed to ""fix"" the problem.

Any suggestions on what could have been blocking the emails? ",2024-03-30 18:59:22

1. FAANG / CTCI style problems: There are resources all over the place for these including Leetcode and CTCI. These involve classic algorithm / data structure and system design questions
2. Takehomes. These even can take different flavors, though here I'm referring to largely startups who will ask you to build a simple frontend and backend for a problem without a time limit.
3. Real world / business problems. These are meant to simulate the coding you might do on a day-to-day basis at a mid sized company and involve building out classes and a set of functions that together can be leveraged to implement a solution.
4. Domain specific problems. Here I'm thinking of interviews specifically for frontend, ML, DevOps, etc. where you have to build a solution using a specific set of technologies.

The internet is filled with practice problems for type 1. Takehomes (type 2) can be time consuming but you have as much time as you need so you can figure it out if you care enough (4/5 takehomes involve parsing CSVs in my experience). Domain specific problems (4) can be a little tricky to prep for, but there are a number of resources for prepping these such as [https://bigfrontend.dev/](https://bigfrontend.dev/) for frontend.

However, I have found it much more difficult to find resources to practice for Real world / business problem (type 3) interviews, despite many companies favoring them (I have even conducted this style of interview). Sometimes these are listed as system design questions too, but they are all about writing working code and not drawing lines and boxes. Companies like to say that this is a problem you might expect to see in the real world unlike Leetcode-style probems, however they are tricky to prepare for since they're still timed and often much more complex than a DFS or LinkedList question. They still have a certain setup to them that can be gamed like Leetcode, but I'm curious if anyone has found good resources for practicing for these questions? I keep feeling like I get more tripped up by these questions just because I haven't gotten enough reps in for this style.

Some examples of this sort of problem I've seen:

1. Implement a banking system. Do this in 4 parts getting more complicated over time adding features like checking bank account balances or exchanging funds.
2. Create a simple marketplace where various items are bought and sold over time. This might have several parts where we first buy and sell items of different kinds and then have to account for certain items expiring over time.
3. Implement a car rental system, where cars of different kinds can be searched for, rented etc.

In case I'm not being clear enough:

1. Autocomplete --> as you type the word, it'll suggest words that finish what you're currently typing  
Ex: If I type ***Ao***, it will suggest anything that **starts** with ***Ao*** (ex: *Aomei*) but NOT something like *Kaolin*  

2. Substring match --> as you type the word, it'll suggest words that have what you're typing as a substring  
Ex: If I type ***Ao***, it will suggest both *Aomei* and *Kaolin* because they include ""***Ao***""  


I'm currently using the substring match, but I can feel that it might sometimes feel overwhelming for a user? Imagine you type ""ao"" and get 400 suggestions.

At the same time...autocomplete requires a complete match at first, so if you don't know exactly how the word starts, it becomes difficult.

I thought of doing HTML/CSS/JS for front end, use MYSQL for database, and do Django for backend (I dont have any experience with backend languages, so I just went with django).

Can any web developer give me some advice on how to do this? As in the steps to take? A video tutorial?

For example, I was trying to create the register and login pages, but I have no idea how the backend and database should work. I can code the front end, but how can I do the backend? How can I connect the database, and the other logic so the register and login work?

1bp6xqd,Need a second opinion on hosting my web dev portfolio (Migrating from Vultr),"I have a personal website that runs in a VPS with NGINX reverse proxy to resolve my portfolio projects as [appname.mydomain.com](https://appname.mydomain.com), DDOS protection by Cloudflare, Certbot to get SSL certs, PM2 for re-starting failed/crashed apps and automatic weekly backups.

These projects are full-stack React/Express/Passport/PostgreSQL/MongoDB applications and do not get a lot of traffic except from LinkedIn/Resume. Currently I am paying around $7.50/month for the 1GB RAM/32GB SSD/1 CPU and have no issues except Vultr now owns everything on this VPS based on their recent Terms & Conditions changes. I am okay with it for now since these are all just portfolio projects to showcase my skills but would like to move to another platform soon in case I make apps to sell or prefer the code to stay private/self-owned.

I am pretty good at infrastructure and have my own UNRAID server with drive parity and UPS power. I can technically use Dynamic DNS, port forward and host my projects there but I am worried about my server going down due to IP changes when a hiring manager is trying to view my projects or server becoming slow when I am doing other things on it like VMs/Dockers/Transcoding/Gaming Servers etc.

I have considered AWS Lightsail as a replacement VPS and it seems pretty solid so far without stealing your code/projects to train AI portion LOL. I also considered hosting my front-end on Cloudflare pages which pulls directly from GitHub and builds it for me. And hosting my back-end on AWS Lightsail or even go serverless with Lambda. I am also learning Next.js right now and will check out Vercel as well but I don't think it will give me as much flexibility as I would like to have with my own VPS.

I know the world of hosting is massive and there are many many options. Would love to hear what you have to recommend? Any pros or cons going self-hosted vs cloud? If cloud, which providers would you recommend? What about back-end in express vs serverless?

1bp6mbd,View Transitions API feature detection for MPAs,"Hi all, I've started experimenting with the new view transitions API for my website (which is a MPA not an SPA)  and I've quickly realised that I have no idea how to detect if the API is supported by the browser or not. It is relatively easy to check for generic view transitions support, but there is no known way of finding out if the MPA variant is supported (currently its in experimental, but can be turned on, while the SPA variant is turned on by default now for latest chrome releases).  


Basically why I need this detection is: I need to know if my site will use the transitions to turn off other fading effects that would interfere with the transitions - if I have no way of knowing this I either need to remove all fading in transitions for the first fold of the pages of my site which looks quite nice on browsers that don't support view transitions (today pretty much all browsers since the feature is still experimental for MPAs) or I cant really use the view transitions because of the animation interferences.  


There must be some difference between the two variants of the API that can be used to detect if its MPA supported not just SPA (since generic support will return true even if the MPA is not supported, which means I would turn off animations for no reason).

  
Any idea how to detect it?

1. const link = restPath + encodeURIComponent (name); **Get 400**

(Love Cloudinary by the way, just have too many images and users and can't afford the price increases as I grow).

My googling failed me, maybe because it's a vague thing to google, but basically I just want to make sure all my bases are covered as I download and reupload all my images. I currently use cloudinary's api to do kind of a weird crop on images....I crop a circle out of a certain part of each image for a little icon, and also use the whole image for other things. I considered just using Sharp for this and storing it that way rather than using a transformation...or I guess I could just download that crop from cloudinary, but I'd still need something for it going forward. Am I right in thinking that my best bet is to, when someone uploads an image, run Sharp (or something else?) to figure out how to do that crop? I assume Sharp can handle cropping to certain coordinates and then cropping into a perfectly circular image.

I also want to store the image in its original size, but in most cases deliver a more optimized version of it. Is it safe to just use webp for everything nowadays? Or should I store my images in some other format...I guess what are the reasons for one approach over the other? And do people typically just store 2 versions of an image or is there some other magic method to make this make more sense? It feels a little tedious, but I don't know what else to do...I don't want to show my users 1000px wide images when they need 420px wide images, but some users want to re-download their images so I need to give them the full size image in one spot.

I have seen base 62 mentioned, but also other bases such as base 10, base 58, etc. What is the relationship between Unicode and ASCII (I believe those represent English and other languages) and base conversions? What is the relationship between bits, such as 64 bit, to the aforementioned topics? 

2) ""Design of a Unique ID Generator: After enlisting the requirements of the design, we discuss three ways to generate unique IDs: using UUID, using a database, and using a range handler...We use a range-based sequencer in our design, which ensures basic level mapping between the servers and the short URLs. We can redirect the request to the respective database for a quick search."" I Googled range handler and nothing comes up. How does using a range handler relate to designing a sequencer?

1bny3ag,Transitioning From a Long-Term Web Development Partner,"We're facing a challenging situation and could greatly benefit from your collective wisdom. Our organization has been in partnership with a web development firm for over a decade. Throughout this period, our experiences have been mixed, characterized by inconsistent follow-ups, frequent staff turnovers, and delays in making necessary updates or upgrades to our website.

Currently, we're in the midst of developing a new website, a project that has extended over a year due to various delays. The development is about 90% complete. Our initial plan was to maintain our relationship with the current developer to ensure a smooth transition from our old site to the new one, including data migration. Additionally, our arrangement with them includes profit-sharing from the old website's sales.

However, we've hit a significant roadblock. On the agreed completion date for the new site, we were informed of an additional 30-day delay, a change that was not communicated until the last minute. This situation has left us feeling stuck and considering our options to move forward without their involvement. I feel like this is the last straw. 

Here's where we need your guidance:
1. Gaining Control of the Old Website:They currently host our old website. What steps can we take to gain control over our old website and its data independently?
2. Transitioning Incomplete Work: With the new site being 80% complete, is it feasible to transfer the work done so far to a new developer without losing significant progress?

Our primary goal is to regain control over our web presence and ensure the completion of our new website on a separate URL, all while moving away from our current developer. We're looking for advice on how to navigate this transition smoothly and effectively.

Any recommendations, guidance, or referrals to developers who have experience with such transitions would be immensely appreciated.

Thank you!",2024-03-26 03:35:43

1bnsdj7,Help on getting started…,"I am a backend and database engineer with 10+ YOE. For complicated reasons, I ended up owning tasks to make a front end for something. I literally don’t know what to google, so I’m asking here not looking for a solution but mostly to start figuring out how things are called. 

I made up an example to explain my use case. Say I am making a recipes website. On the backend, this is easy. A recipe has steps, each step has ingredients. On endpoint and table for each and a middle table between ingredients and steps because it’s many to many. Users can make their own recipes, search other recipes or just see existing ones.

However, realistically, in the front end, I would like the user to be able to provide the recipe name, plus the steps with their respective ingredients. Creating the recipe is one API call, each step is another call. 

So, here’s where my question comes in. From a front end side, do these forms that make multiple calls have a name? Or is multiple calls an anti pattern? Among the mind numbing amount of frameworks out there, are there any candidates that would make this easier? The api already exists. Also, is vanilla JS still a thing that can scale for this?",2024-03-25 23:16:53

# [CSS Grid as a minimal starter 16 Col Grid framework] Frankenstyle

*\*\* Before you Start* : **Note** \*\* **I know already what a lot of people are going to say.**

\- Yes. I know about Flexbox. And it is 2024.- Why the heck would you do that? - CSS Grid:a.) already is a framework. frameworks are deadb.) CSS Grid is it's own layout machine- This thing is not right. (o.k. fork it and fix it then \~ or not)- Why do you need that? When there is / Bootstrap Tailwind Pure Minimal Pick One

**Has anyone found a good example or written some sort of minimal grid framework using css grid with a basic flex fallback?**(actually you know, doesn't even have to have a flex fallback)

The point is to have a LIGHT 16 column grid system with the emphasis on CSS Grid.Yes. There are other minimal grid systems like minimal, Pure, etc. Many are flexbox

ok. how about some really lightweight flexible css grid code that is easy to do css grid layouts. Besides just a page specific or section specific thing? Yes. CSS Grid is fairly easy. Yes. You can easily just plot out a layout and one size does not fit all.

https://preview.redd.it/t5e2qd81u6qc1.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=07611fd08f6535e284d9d9731c14609183bc3dc9

Anyway \~ I started working on a CSS Grid \[Grid Framework.\] 16 column with 'show-grid'

[https://codepen.io/simonayriss/pen/dyrKYOP](https://codepen.io/simonayriss/pen/dyrKYOP)

It would just be nice to be able to pick up from a small footprint and go from there with really a small starter of code. I know already. CSS Grid already has all of that built in and already is a framework.

But that's not what I'm getting at.It would be nice if something was a bit more intuitive, have positioning, mobile, all that built in with some styles. Oddly just after I started typing this I found this: [https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/ExvBzQ](https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/ExvBzQ)

Be nice to have a minimal :col-1 col-2 or span-8 kind of thing. I'm trying to do a 16 column grid edge to edge full width - with a background image full cover and a 'show-grid' class that shows the 16 col grid. and maybe some positioning left top bottom right etc oh and nested tables some basic styles but easily expandable.Naming convention can be more semantic but minimal.

A minimal starter with easy positioning that is not tied down the page grid itself.It's flexible. Easy to manage. Great for layouts.Yes I know!! CSS Grid already does that!but a minimal framework that is a good starter tool with logical layout flexibility is a kinda cool. And yes, you can always do it in CSS Grid. ;-)

Got links to something cooler and open source? (no promotional links)

Know how to make it better / See something wrong? of course - fork it.

Any ideas? You can make something better? Of course let's check it out.

This is far from semantic I know it is not.  Also needs mobile, positioning, etc.It's just a non-production hobby side project. Nothing serious.

I am primarily a Python developer and Django is my go-to framework. My proficiency in JavaScript, on the other hand, is quite basic. I can add some light interactivity to UI elements, but that’s about the extent of it.

Recently, I encountered an issue in an application I’m developing. This led me to explore the world of serverless computing, specifically with Vercel (Edge) Functions. The journey was challenging, but I managed to deploy a working solution to production in less than a day, which I consider a success.

Now, I have a question regarding the transferability of knowledge between different serverless platforms. For example, if I learn how to use Vercel, will that knowledge help me get up to speed quickly with other platforms like Cloudflare Workers/Google Cloud Run/Firebase Functions/...?

Lets say I have an endpoint that returns a question and a list of possible answers. In a single language app I would just return the question string directly like ""what color is the dog"".

I see 2 approaches basically. Keep all the translations on the frontend and return a translation key essentially. Return ""q-dogColor"" and look that one up in en.json or de.json on the frontend respectively.

Or I manage basically another set of translation dictionaries on the server and just make the language part of the request and return ""what color is the dog"" again and simply display it on the frontend.

I got right into studying for the interviews, 2 weeks before the interviews I literally ate and slept leetcode. This was my chance and I was going to do everything I could to not squander it.

1bj3230,Django - JS - Career Development,"Hi! I saw that vague career-help questions aren't allowed, but I've got such an odd scenario and specific case that I was hoping to ask for help on where I should go next.  


So, I started web-programming about a year ago, having initially done some light code work for an open source video game (SS13). I got hired in a summer internship for a newspaper, but they kept me on once they figured out I'd learn any code stuff they threw at me. So that's weird case/background of how a non college trained (me) and not super experienced coder (me) got a web-development job.  


I work with some way more experienced coders, but I try not to bother them too much since we're covering a lot of ground with a few hands. I was hoping to get recommendations on where to best learn Django and Javascript, with Django being the particular framework we use at the paper (one of our executives actually helped found it...)  


I've gotten slightly comfortable with JS, having used Chart.js for some newspaper pages that need a special touch; but I'm still not really sure how to apply or use it. Django is also alien to me, since the coding I did back when I worked on open-source stuff was C based.  


I'd love any recommendations for resources on JS, Django or MySQL - as well as general advice for where to go next, and what to do. I really love my job and what I do, but it's a little hard to not feel underequipped compared to college-trained coders with 20 years on me.

1biws4a,API Design for serving data to a React View with many components,"I have a react application and I am learning React Query.  

The application view I am designing is composed of many different parts, it shows lots of different information about a broadcaster.  


My main question is im unsure if having many APIs to serve the UI is better than 1 or 2 large APIs.  Heres my use case:

There is a header which shows the name of the channel, its status (live etc) and a meatball menu to perform actions on the broadcaster such as add to favourite etc.   


Then there is basic details about the broadcaster so when their channel was created, when it was last live, how many followers they have etc  


There is also a comment log that shows a list of comments people have said about the broadcaster.  


Each of the above examples are essentially their own separate scenarios and therefore I have designed separate components, e.g.  


A header component - uses data from basic details api and meatball actions api  
A metadata component - uses data from basic details api  
Comment log component - uses data from comment api  


My idea is that each component would be served by a different API for example

Return broadcaster name and its meta data (which would serve data to the header and metadata)  
Return current follower count   
Return current actions available for the meatball menu   
Return the list of comments for a broadcaster  


I see a number of advantages of going down the route of separate APIs.  


Since I am using react query I can benefit from its cache on data that is fairly static or isn't likely to update often.  Such as the metadata of the broadcaster.  This could have a longer staleTime compared to the likes of the follower count which I would want to be updating each time and not fetching from the cache.  


It also makes my components more composable in that I can re-use them across different views more easily.  If the follower count is only querying for its own data, its not expensive to have this in many places.  


The disadvantages I see is there will be many http requests to load the screen.  Im not entirely sure how best to handle loading states for 4 queries in a nice way from a UX perspective.  Id be grateful if anyone has a nice example of this.    


There is also a higher chance of a request failing since there are 4 of them and data not being shown for a component.  Arguably having 1 api could be seen as worse as if that fails theres no ui at all.

The alternative I see to all of this is to just create a single API that returns all data for the screen.  But in my opinion this isn't great because lets say a user performs an action on the meatball menu.   If it was a single api, the app would have to refetch all the data again to get the new list of actions and much of the other data it doesn't care about (metadata, followers, comments) for that particular action.   


It also means if I want to re-use a component on a different screen thats much harder to do as the component is coupled to that screen and api.  


So I guess the over arching question is, in this example or any example where there are many different components that each serve data. And the data in those components needs to update based on actions that can effect it, how would you best go about designing the APIs to serve the UI?",2024-03-19 22:03:48

1bipkow,Inside Chrome Browser - Part 4,"I came across this nice blog. It shows how the compositor enables smooth interaction in the browser when user input comes in.  
It shows ""input events"" for the browser are not restricted to typing in a textbox or mouse click, instead for the browser input means any gesture from the user.

  
It says that when a user does any gesture like touching a screen, the browser process is the one that receives it first. However, the browser process only knows the position of the gesture (x, y coordinates).

  
As everything inside a tab is handled by a renderer process, the browser process sends coordinates and event type (like touchstart) to it. Now, it's the renderer's job to find the appropriate event target and run the event listener.

  
The blog says that if no input events are attached to a page, then the compositor thread can create a new frame without interacting with the main thread, and that gives a smooth scroll.

  
Then, it talks about non-fast scrollable regions. So, when a page is composited, the compositor thread marks a region as a ""Non-Fast Scrollable Region"" if it has an event listener attached to it, as running JavaScript is the main thread job. When an input comes from the user if it lies in the Non-Fast Scrollable Region then the compositor sends it to the main thread, and if it lies outside then it directly creates a new frame.

  
It shows how ""Event Delegation"" hampers smooth scrolling behavior by the compositor, as it marks everything as a ""Non-Fast Scrollable Region"" and hence the compositor has to communicate with the main thread and wait for it every time an input event comes in.

  
It also shows how using ""passive: true"" in the addEventListener hints to the browser that you want to listen to the event but the compositor can go ahead and create a new frame as well. You can check for ""event.cancelable"" if you want to ""preventDefault"" something with ""passive: true"" (also check ""touch-action"" to eliminate the event handler).

  
The blog says that the main thread uses a hit test to find the event target using the paint records to find what is underneath the point coordinates.  
Then, in last, it shows how you should minimize dispatching events to the main thread, as it hampers the screen refresh.

  
As continuous events like touchmove, deliver 60-120 times a second, so it might trigger an excessive amount of hit tests and JavaScript execution which will affect screen refresh (screen refreshes 60 times per second).

  
Chrome coalesces such continuous events and delays dispatching until right before the next ""requestAnimationFrame"", to minimize excessive calls. And, if you want to get information about those coalesced events, then you can use something like the ""getCoalescedEvents"" method in the pointer event (this will help to get intra-frame events).

  
It was a nice read. It is written by Mariko Kosaka.

Not asking you to do it for me, just looking for an high level explanation of how would you approach the problem and what components/libraries/tools would you use.

The gantt chart should have the following characteristics:

* The diagram should allow for multiple rows for tasks that are executed in parallel
* User should have the ability to add multiple tasks, modify their duration by dragging the right/left side of the task box,  and move them up/down across rows
* Tasks can have properties
* Every time something in the diagram is changed, some computations will need to be performed (e.g. expected total time, total cost of the project, etc) and displayed in the web page

How would you structure the project? What would you put in the front-end and what would you leave to the back-end? Which tools/libraries would you use?  ",2024-03-19 09:51:20

Most of the time im not understanding the complicated querying that every service offers, I've tried mysql, postgres, and different ORMs but each had some crazy weird querying.

1bi26au,Alternative to SCORM for web courses?,"Hi,

I have been askes to integrate web courses into an existing system and there are several requirements that are challenging. Basically I have three main features:

1. Support courses in the SCORM format. This is basically a zip archive that contains metadata and a player as html file. This player calls some JavaScript methods to track progress. I hope this is correct, because I am new to the whole topic.
2. We have to consume another API that provides some learning information via API, but not over SCORM, so somehow a custom player is needed. I am not sure yet, how often these contents are updated, but I might be cheaper to convert them to SCORM manually.
3. These content items are grouped into larger courses which have their own progress tracking.

I really hate that...

1. I hate the coupling between content and presentation in SCORM, making it really hard to update styling and the whole presentation.
2. SCORM packages are pretty large, because they contain images, fonts and so on and a lot of these assets are just normal layout items and not part of the course itself. It would be difficult to share them between courses.
3. SCORM packages can contain videos, but you cannot control how to host them. You can also not provide different qualities.
4. We might end up with multiple players.
5. Because the SCORM packages are black boxes we cannot track progress across items, estimate the time it takes to complete the course and all these things.

eudrq6,Why PHP is the best back-end language. Period. (Not Satire),"(Unpopular Opinion Warning)

I never understood why people always flame PHP. My leading theory is that many developers had a bad experience with it in its earlier days and sort of habitually bashed it over the years. Yes, the earlier versions of PHP had a long way to go. But in 2020, I don't understand why all these new technologies are in the spotlight.

PHP has a fast and secure method for making direct connections between the client and the server that is simple and effective. Meanwhile, these newer frameworks, such as Node, have been having security issues and other problems because the way that connections are made is completely different (and more complex, but not necessarily in a good way).

In fact, these trendy new NoSQL databases are nor even remotely practical in many web development contexts, and only very useful in fewer situations which aren't even always related to web devlopment anyway.

Some stacks such as MERN prevent live editing without breaking everything or having to recompile your app as well. Meanwhile, PHP is better than it's ever been with the Laravel ecosystem, continued support/production, and the ability to do everything these newer fad languages/frameworkds can do.

The simple truth is, PHP just works. I heard someone say earlier on Reddit that no one cares about the blueprint, but only the finished product.

I think I'll stick to LAMP. Can't wait for PHP 8.x!

But seriously, why do we echo chamber against PHP so much?",2020-01-26 22:02:55

tkoql3,Everything should not be code,"Hello webdevs,

I help start-ups get off the ground, and I've been noticing a pattern recently.

These people, who have a business idea and stars in their eyes, will try to find a developer to build their webapp.

Often, because they have little money, they will turn to inexperienced developers.

More often than not, these developers are only comfortable with one tech stack and will use that for everything. Usually React or PHP.

But in 90% of the projects, the business requirements can be filled entirely with no-code solutions, or with small amounts of code strategically dropped where needed.

Coding when it's unnecessary is silly. Code is expensive and hard to maintain. It should be used when the requirements need a truly custom solution, or when you're at the scale where performance and UX excellence are key.

That's not the case for most projects that are starting out, who need flexibility at low prices.

If someone asks you to furnish their office on the cheap, you go to IKEA, you don't custom-sculpt every office chair.

No-code is a powerful set of tools for system builders, and ignoring that does not make us better programmers.

Edit : it's apparent from many replies here that some developers have their head in the sand regarding the current capabilities of no-code. Webflow, shopify, bubble, softr, airtable, stripe, mailjet, zapier all provide powerful tools to speed up development and lessen the amount of code you need. As for the ad-hominem attacks saying ""just because you can't code doesn't mean we shouldn't code"", I'd like to clarify that I have over 20 years of experience as a web developer and CTO, and that I would not have recommended anyone build an app using Microsoft DreamWeaver.",2022-03-23 07:44:57

yk4yfk,I feel like lately there has been way too much hate for Tailwind CSS than it deserves.,"I am nowhere being an experienced web dev and still learning in the early stages. I saw so many hate on Tailwind CSS these days on this subreddit and don't know why? It helps people that are bad in design (like me), without needing a designer. They all say, you need to repeat the classes for each element again and again. <-- Yes this is true, but it eliminates all other unused classes. It only uses the used classes which leads to performance. I started with Bootstrap and ended up with Tailwind CSS because it is much easier to work with, much more fun (in my opinion) and shows a faster result. 

I know many people that hated on Tailwind CSS **UNTIL** they tried it, now they want nothing but Tailwind CSS.  Yes, it is still important to know CSS by your heart and don't jump on frameworks because its easier. I am a freelancer myself and I use tailwind most at the time, I only do custom CSS if the clients asks me to do so.",2022-11-02 13:13:55

2sbvyo,"[rant] ""You're lucky you're good with computers"" -- no, I'm fucking not.","Just a heads up, this is a bit of a rant post.


Recently, I graduated from a grueling 4 year CS-related degree. I lined up a nice cushy job with a great salary after graduation, which I'll begin in two months. In the interim, I've moved back home with the folks to relax, unwind and connect with some old friends before moving cities and starting the next chapter in my life.

I met up with friends at the local pub the other night to catch up on life & everything. Chat invariable turns to the employment hunt. To my surprise, I learned that out of 5 of us at the table, only 3 were employed, with myself being the only one to be working in my degree field.

My good friend Amy, a Journalism major from a prestigious liberal arts school of much more renown than my decent tech university, turns to me and says, ""You're so lucky you're good with computers"".

I get what she meant, and god bless her soul I know she meant nothing bad by that comment. She's a good girl, with a sharp mind. But I can't stand when people say that.



Luck has nothing to do with it.



Of course, I didn't say anything to her nor did I make any comment, but as the night continued on and I listened as one by one my friends recounted their tales of wild parties, drugs, debauchery and typical crazy-college-story-madness, I couldn't get those words out of my mind. 


It bothers me when people negate our accomplishments with brash attributions of ""luck"". It really fucking bothers me. She was not the first to ever say this to me, and she definitely will not be the last, And I KNOW every one of you have heard it before -- whether you're the techie at home who knows how to reboot the router or the seasoned development professional, you've heard the words before. You're so ""lucky"" you're good with computers. ""I"" could never do that. It just comes ""natural"" to you.

Bullshit.


None of us were born knowing how to write JavaScript. None of us were ""naturals"" at programming. We were driven. We put in the time. We learned, through hours and hours and hours of grueling self-teaching, how to do the things we wanted to do. Did I want to give up? Did I get frustrated? Did I ever want to smash my keyboard with my face after spending 16 hours coding to meet a last-minute project deadline? You bet. 

But I did it, because it was something I was driven to get good at. Something I wanted to learn. And the fact that it leads to a valuable job that is in demand factored into that decision making process.

It bugs me when people attribute the success of myself and every single one of us to ""luck"", like our skills were just given to us arbitrarily with a roll of the dice. Like we didn't need to work for them. Like we didn't need to sacrifice for them. Did I go out and party as much as Amy? Definitely not. Do I have as many killer stories as she does? No way! But what I do have is a work ethic; something seriously lacking in many of my (Millennial) generation. I did not sit idly by, take some pacifistic approach to my education and future, focusing on fun and an easy-going academic life, and then complain when there weren't jobs being handed to me in a field that was already dry before even applied for university. And having our planning, drive, dedication and foresight all wiped away under the guise of ""luck"" is not only demeaning, but outright insulting. 

It's just humorous to me, because its not like I was in any way gifted down this path; I would say I'm an ""ok"" programmer. By no means an excellent one. All through education, my WORST grades were math and science, the ""hard"" stuff. My best grades were in the languages and humanities. Programming did not come easy to me. I busted my ass off, didn't party in school, worked a full time job, several internships and freelanced, all to make something of myself -- and now others write it away as ""luck"".

Luck has nothing to do with it.

-----

TL;DR: Friend struggling to find employment in oversaturated field says I'm ""lucky"" I have the skills I do -- Luck has nothing to do with it, I busted my ass for years to acquire those skills, and to have that all written off is insulting. Don't believe or let anyone tell you that your hard work is ""luck"" or that you were just a ""natural"" when in reality you put in the time to learn a valuable skill, a skill which others lack the conviction and willpower to learn.",2015-01-13 22:10:23

Don't reinvent the wheel metaphor here, is what I'm asking. Why would you build from scratch? Chances are that it will never look as good as a web-builder anyways, and will be loaded with bugs, not to mention it taking 10x the amount of work.

Edit: getting downvoted a lot in the comments and on the post. Not sure why. Plenty of people answered the question and it seems I hadn’t thought of many reasons why something should be coded from scratch.

104ihyd,22 years old. I make 6 figures. But it is all meaningless. Need some guidance.,"Hi. I am 22 years old. I learned how to write code at age 12 and have been doing so ever since. I started out in game development and fell in love. It was awesome learning how to create games. During high school, I started freelancing as a web developer because that's where money was and it was a path I could take to avoid the insane college debt.

Fast forward to today, I hate my job. I am drunk af as I write this. If I'm not drunk, I would be high. Why? I despise my professional life. I have an AMAZING girlfriend and she is the only reason I have kept going on for so long. But I can't take this any longer. Working 8 hours a day, doing meaningless bs is killing me.

I make $114k/yr as a 22 year old. I know, I hit the lottery. But let me tell you, money isn't everything. When I graduated high school, I had all these plans to start my own agency and make a name for myself. But I never did it. I have become complacent in a salary job and I just can't handle it. It boggles my mind how the Sr. Dev has done this shit for 20+ years. I am a shit employee. I work a remote job and am alone all the time throughout the day. All my close friends live in different states. I am alone so much. I cherish the days I am with my girl. I struggle to get the basic of tasks done. I just DO. NOT. CARE. I am an excellent bull shitter. I can get 8 hours of work completed in 4 hours. I usually get up early to complete the previous day's tasks before standup. Nothing is challenging, it is effortless full-stack web development. The work is too easy. .NET and JavaScript/Vue just do not challenge me in the slightest.

Anyways... I recently switched jobs in 2022 because the pay was way higher. I was making $60k/yr doing some government work. It wasn't exciting per se, but I got to work on the same project for 2+ years. The code base became personal. I made a LOT of improvements to it as a Jr. Dev. I started freelancing on the side when working this job and ended up landing a really fun contract to build a simple but effective eCommerce feature for a company. The team in this company has really awesome people. After I completed the work, they offered a full-time gig and I accepted.

So, what is the problem? This company is not what I expected. It is an agency. I swore to myself I would never do agency work again unless it was my own business. Yet, here we are. I get thrown around to project after project. Even though my team members are really awesome people, no one cares about code quality. At least, not past a simple PR. I can't focus on building a quality product because I work on 5 different projects a day with multiple meetings. Most meetings are a waste of time. We use Jira for tasks and the project managers assign me work to me. 90% of the work is super basic stuff like adding simple search functionality, changing UI designs, or fixing the god-aweful CMS. I can't stand this. At the last company, we would look at the board during standup and I would essentially pick my own work. At this new company, it is very micro-managey. I need to track every minute and budgets are tight for almost every client except for two exceptions. None of the work matters. Like seriously... Why would I give a fuck about working on some stupid insurance company's website? Or a hospital's website? Or a truck insurance company's website? At least at the last job, I was working on a system that helped disabled children in the education system.

When I came into this job, I thought it would be similar to the last. We use a very similar tech stack. But I had NO CLUE I would be getting thrown around to project to project this much. No one cares about quality, I can tell just by reading the code. Unit tests aren't a thing, we use a retarded CMS, 70% of my tasks is fixing issues with the CMS, i.e. not code I wrote.

Maybe this is the life of most full-stack developers, I don't know. But I can't do this anymore... I just don't give a single fuck about my work. The only time I am truly happy is when I get assigned a project that takes 1-3 months to complete. But that is very rare. I have recently started building my own personal project and that has helped me a lot. But sadly, that won't pay bills.

What can I do in my situation? I feel like I am just bitching about a really good job. Everyone else seems happy here. But I can't stand this agency bs anymore. It's all about making clients happy. I don't care about clients. I care about creating a quality product.

EDIT: Grammer. Added some info. Possibly missed other Grammer mistakes. This post is 50% a rant. I just feel like I can't do it anymore. I know I am depressed and should probably see a therapist or something.

Idk... I just feel lost in this world. I've achieved a lot in my life. All the personal friends and family in my life are very proud of me. But none of this seems to fulfill me. My ultimate goal is to start a business but this job drains my soul to the point where I just want to waste time getting drunk or high every night. It gives me an escape.

I hope some internet strangers can maybe knock some sense into my youthful brain.",2023-01-06 02:45:42
ho6k9n,The Internet Was Broken on May 30 And The SSL Certificates Broke It,"In case you didn’t notice, the Internet was broken on the 30th of May. The culprit:

SSL certificates.

**First of all, why do we need SSL certificates?**

Technically speaking, they should be called TLS certificates because they bear a public key which is used in Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to authenticate the server.

But this is not a technical article, so we will stick to the concepts everyone can understand.

When you go to your favourite online shopping site, you want to be assured that the site is genuine (no one is trying to lure you on a fake copy of Amazon) and everything you send or receive (like your personal data and shopping choices) [is secure](https://www.coredna.com/blogs/website-security).

So, how do the browsers know that the site is trustworthy and display that padlock near the address bar? The SSL certificate tells them so.

**So, basically SSL certificate is a guy who tells you: ""This site is ok"".**

But why would you trust this guy you do not know? Let's call this guy Sam. You do not trust Sam, but Mike trusts Sam, and Dennis trusts Mike. You trust Dennis; he is a friend of yours! This way you have a chain of trust, just like SSL certificates do.

Normally, people have a close circle of friends they trust. So do the browsers. They have a list of root certificates they trust without any reservations, and they would trust any certificate issued (signed) by a chain that leads to one of the trusted root certificates.

Some browsers (like Firefox) have their own trust store, other browsers rely on the trust store of the operating system they run on.

Now, imagine the following situation:

There is a guy called Peter who is trusted by Tom, who is trusted by Vito. Everyone trusts Vito because Vito is the head of a well-known and respected Family.
Then Vito decides to retire and announces that his son Michael will replace him as the head of the family, and whoever respects Vito must now respect Michael.
Tom pays his respect to Michael, and everything is good. But one day Vito dies…

Suddenly, it appears that a group of people respected Michael only because they respected Vito when he was alive and do not recognise Michael as the head of the respected family.

Things won’t end well for these people… So do the browsers or operating systems which do not regularly update their trust stores.
Back to Michael's family drama…

The idea of Michael and Vito ruling the Family business together for some period of time sounds like a very good idea. For Michael, as the new official Head of the Family, it is a good opportunity to get some experience from his father, be introduced to different people etc., for Vito, as a retiring boss, it means that transition of power will be smooth, and the Family business will be in the good hands.

The same happens in the world of SSL certificates. Sometimes the new root certificates are signed by the older root certificates of the same [Certificate Authorities](https://www.ssl.com/faqs/what-is-a-certificate-authority/). This is called cross-signing.

The older root certificates are more widely spread on various platforms and more likely to be trusted. The newer root certificates can take this advantage and be trusted by the systems, even while not being recognised as a root certificate on its own, just by the fact that they are cross-signed by the older (and trusted) root certificate.

However, the older root certificates have one critical defect – they expire sooner, and when it happens, the new root certificate is expected to have been disseminated well enough to be respected by the majority of the platforms.

Unfortunately, this is not as simple as it seems to be…

Imagine the following situation:

Knock, knock.

Who's there?

It's Peter

What Peter?

Tom sent me

Who is Tom?

He works for Michael, son of Vito

Come in...

Technically, this dialog is quite inefficient. Certainly, there is a room for improvement in this communication. Consider this:

Knock, knock.

Who's there?

It's Peter. Tom sent me.

He works for Michael, son of Vito

Come in...

Now THAT is a much more efficient communication.

In the world of TLS/SSL security, this means a quicker turnaround for the initial SSL handshake. For this reason, the server sends not just one, but several SSL certificates which allow to validate the whole chain of trust up to the trusted root certificate without a need to download any intermediary certificates from Certificate Authorities.

Unfortunately, the following situation may occur:

Knock, knock.

Who's there?

It's Peter. Tom sent me.

He works for Michael, son of Vito.

But Vito is dead.

Michael is now the boss.

I know, but… Vito is dead.

A mention of Vito obviously caused some sort of confusion here. It should not matter anymore that Vito was the Head of the Family.
Now Michael is the Head and everyone should recognize this fact for their own good. However, a mention of Vito creates two chains of trust, one leading to Michael and another one leading to Vito.

Now it is possible to explain what happened on 30 May when many system administrators around the world woke up early in the morning and discovered an avalanche of alerts from the monitoring systems and the angry customers:

**""Your SSL certificate has expired! We can no longer access your API!!!11111""**

To their relief and astonishment they realized that their site certificates are absolutely fine, and their websites are working in all major browsers without any issues. What would cause such a problem?

On May 30, one of COMODO (now Sectigo) root certificates expired after 20 years of a happy life.

This should not have caused any issues, because the replacement root certificate was issued in 2010 and by the end of 2015 it has been disseminated across all major operating systems, browsers and programming frameworks and runtime environments.

At the same time, the new root certificate was cross-signed by the old one.

**So, why after all these precautions and good planning, expiration of the root certificate causes such a big problem?**

Here are a couple of reasons why:

**1. The trust store (Certificate Authorities Bundle) is not up to date**

In 2020, if you use Internet Explorer 7 on Windows XP or run an application written in Java on an outdated version of Java Virtual Machine (JVM), it’s highly likely you will not have the most up-to-date list of the trusted root certificates.

In case of Java, for instance, the new Sectigo root certificate was included in Java 8 Update 51 release on July 14, 2015. The older versions of Java won’t have it.

**2. The software does not support cross-signed SSL certificates**

Application software developers do not have to worry about all the SSL magic. All they have to do in their apps is just call a URL which starts with 'https://'.
It is then the responsibility of the operating system components, application programming framework or external libraries to handle all TLS/SSL cryptography. Usually, the programmers have very little control.

One of the most notable TLS implementation libraries is OpenSSL. It is widely used by Internet servers, especially Linux based. Some estimate that about 2/3 of the web relies on OpenSSL.

Cross-signed certificates support was introduced to OpenSSL in version 1.0.2 released in January 2015. However, this support was optional, which means the software developers had to explicitly enable it in their application, but the majority of software developers did not even know about the cross-signing issue, and nobody did it.

September 2018 version 1.1.1 of OpenSSL was released where cross-signed certificates support was enabled out of the box. This means that the systems with OpenSSL version earlier than 1.1.1 must be upgraded.

About 67% of all web servers in the world run on Linux operating systems which have one little problem - package managers.

Package managers are the cancer of software industry, or a drug, that initially seems like fun, but in the end… it kills.

This is a topic for a separate article, but the bottom line is:

You cannot simply update a single package (OpenSSL library) to a new major version, because the dependencies of the newer version may not be compatible with dependencies currently installed, and the other installed packages (e.g. web servers) which depend on OpenSSL may not be compatible with the newer version of it.

In the end, instead of upgrading just a single package, you may end up with upgrading the whole operating system.

Imagine the situation:

You have a flat tire on your new car. You come to a service station and ask them to repair the puncture, but they say they cannot do that because your tire is too old to be repaired and has reached the end of life.

You say it is okay and ask them to sell a new tire, but they say that no new tires are compatible with your car and the only available option you have is buying a new car; even though your car is just 2 years old.

This is essentially what happens in the software industry.

For instance, CentOS 7 is a very popular operating system for web servers. And as of June 2020, it is in the active support stage with the end of life set to be in 2024.

However, the package manager of CentOS 7 will only let you work with 1.0 branch of OpenSSL which reached the end of life at the end of 2019. It makes this relatively modern operating system obsolete if you want to work with modern TLS cryptography.

Soon after Sectigo's root certificate had expired, a holy war has begun between software developers and system administrators.

The developers demanded the expired certificate to be removed from the SSL bundle the web servers were sending. The system administrators insisted that the developers should update their own technology stack because only completely outdated systems could not properly deal the cross-signed root certificates where one of them had expired (“I trust Michael, but Michael is a son of Vito and Vito is dead” situation).

The industry (and the common sense) were on the system administrators' side. All SSL certificate providers who use Sectigo’s certificates and Sectigo themselves issued statements weeks before the expiration date that no action was required, that cross-signing should do its job, that 10 years is more than enough to update the root CA bundles, that amongst several available chains of trust the software should pick the one that is valid, etc.

Nevertheless, some part of the software industry was not prepared for this trivial event.

19dnrix,How would you reinvent the web?,"Webdev is plagued by various problems, Javascript and it's ecosystem, CSS, and enormous complex browsers which have to implement so many different features. Also the backend-frontend interaction,  50 different ways how to transfer data and APIs.

So if you are now traveling back to the year 1990 with the knowledge of today, how would you create the web from scratch?

I think implementing a VM (WASM) from the start would be a good idea, also using a strongly-typed language with a decent standard library and a good package system would be nice. I have no idea how to solve CSS though. Maybe use a Column/Row/Stack system like Flutter.

10410qs,You need to know DSA for web dev,"I don’t know if it’s the right sub but I would’ve wanted to hear this when I started web development.

## A little story time.

I recently got a freelance gig where I had to build a dashboard for a grocery warehouse that takes in the quantity that needs to be dispatched and auto allocates vendors based on constraints like distance from warehouse and maximum weight the vendor can handle and finally show a map with optimal route stopping at all allocated vendors.

At first glance it looked like a simple app. Didn’t think much of it and under quoted the price and time(rookie mistake). Everything went well. I set up a nextjs project, scss, prisma, and map api and started with the ui. Css: in my fingertips. Did the dashboard in 30 minutes.

In the backend, I had one hell of a time figuring out an efficient way to auto allocate vendors. After some research, I realised the problem can be boiled down to multiple travelling salesmen problem or fractional knapsack problem. But again, like I mentioned earlier, I under quoted so it’s not worth my time to solve these and decided to use latitude and longitude to get vector directions and cluster vendors to multiple trips.

Gist: 

I’m not saying you need to start with DSA and mindlessly solve hundreds of leetcode problems. You at least need to know about O notation and runtime optimisation *if you want to be a software engineer and stand out in this over populated field where everyone and their grandma knows how to do html css.*

Edit: yeah I get it, it’s quite a “controversial” opinion. If you’re someone who don’t know anything about runtime complexity and stuff like that and you’ve been a web dev for considerable time period like say >4 years, please mention your work details like what stack you usually use, what type of work you do and position if you don’t mind sharing. This will help me understand if I’m wrong.

Edit2: I got where I went wrong. I’m confusing myself with software engineering and software development. After some comments here, I can see why this post was downvoted. In the example I’ve posted, I was engineering a solution and it happened to a web based and thinking back, I haven’t used any DSA in web dev for any of my projects before but I still think _web developers need to know DSA_.

Like I said in the gist, not the hardcore level but enough to know what to search for when stuck and to write efficient code whenever opportunity presents.

1acw2af,Why do people say that NoSQL isn't able to do relational data when you can do .populate()?,"I've switched to MongoDB a few years ago and love it and use it for different kind of projects and never had any issues with it.

People say if you're having relational data you should use SQL (so that you can use JOIN)...  
But nobody mentions that with MongoDB you can separate the data (avoid duplication) and simply use populate to connect them together when running your queries.

Here are the other arguments that people may say and for which I still don't agree:  
\- Performance: SQL is ""made"" to support joins, so it's faster than populate. My question is: Is there any benchmark showing that? I googled and couldn't find one. And if it's faster how faster is it?  
The benchmarks I found indicate that READ queries for simple queries (no joins) are way faster in NoSQL...

\- For simple collections it's okay to use populate but with complex cases, it's not possible or performance will be hit too much: To me you can use a pipeline to easily make very complex queries in MongoDB, so I disagree with the statement that it's not feasible. Now in terms of performance, my question again is where's the proof and how much of a difference is it?  


I find running a NoSQL query with populate so much more readable and straightforward compared to an SQL join... And we all know that readability is more important than a few more ms of performance.

On top of that, things are so much more organized in a NoSQL document compared to a bunch of columns in a table.  
I'm I missing something?

Honestly I just feel like old folks who know SQL don't bother trying NoSQL or just want to keep things the way they are + there are BIG companies that are behind the SQL tech: Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, Mysql...",2024-01-28 06:18:05

Why do people make out that auth systems are so difficult and you have to use something like Lucia or AuthJS?,"Im a bit confused and sure Im missing something, Im wondering why people say Auth is so hard to do? Because it seems simple enough to me.. heres my understanding of what I need to ""do"" below, going to skip certain things like having a db table for users because its obvious..

* Setup httpOnly JWT access tokens (valid for x min with a user id)
* Setup a httpOnly (on a specific URL like /login) JWT refresh token (rolling refresh every time its used and stored in a db for session management)
* Setup CORS to mitigate XSS
* Data sanitization for things like SQL injection and XSS
* Rate limiting (I understand this less, but I think lots of hosting providers also help with it)
* Password hashing (Argon2) with some salt + pepper

3gyx6j,The truth about female programmers and H1B programmers,"I don't know much about a lot of things but there was a similar topic so I had to say something.

Me: 40/m/Washington DC/16 years as a programmer/about 20 jobs

I can only speak from what I have seen and I have seen a good amount. 

Female Programmers at work: I have never seen any sexual harassment, sexist jokes, or anything that suggest in anyway because the programmer is a female there is some sort of issue. As far as hiring we PREFERRED a female for the simple reason of it would be nice to not be around so many guys all day.

Female Programmers learning to code: I think it is summed up best a story I heard from a Friend who is a female programmer from Ukraine. She went to a meetup group for female coders and she told me it sucked because she wanted to talk about coding but the focus was on them being females. It was also clear most women there were just starting out or thinking about starting out. I think when people find out how much a web programmer makes it is something a lot of people consider. But it is the kind of job that you need to love or you will hate I think. 

My theory on why so few female developers: Coding requires sitting in a room alone staring at a computer for hours. And in the American culture women are not brought up being pushed into doing this. In some other cultures they are so that is why out of all the female developers I met I would guess about 10% were American born. You can't grow up as a women used to working in social situations and then one day take a programming class and love it. To be a good programmer you have to love coding at the core. You can't just think it is a good idea 25 years old and take a course and be a programmer. I think this topic is one the SJWs use and like to blame men on holding them back but I don't see it in my 16 years. You can't DEMAND a company to hire more females for the sake of social justice. Coding is serious work and not a playground for social experiments.

H1Bs: They seen to have most of the contract work in the DC gov from what I see. My guess is they are brought up at a young age and told to code to make money. The are polite people but most do not have a passion for coding so in turn end up being the worse-average coders I deal with. I also am guilty of preferring an American born coder mainly because I can communicate a lot better.

Of course none of this is how things are 100% of the time but I have seen enough to draw some general conclusions.

Am I wrong ? Am I sexist? Racist ? ",2015-08-14 12:36:53

1b0jf1w,ChatGPT-ing My Way to My First Full-Stack Application,"Just wanted to share my journey to help inspire/encourage others.

I have a background in coding, but only as an automation engineer, which requires a pretty basic level of code skills. My project cemetary was massive, starting and stopping trying to learn all these different tech stacks. But then ChatGPT arrived, and my life changed.

I began prompting for everything, not just 'give me the code', but 'give me the code and explain it to me', and if.I didn't understand, would continue with, 'I didn't understand and seem to be missing some foundation, assume I'm a complete beginner'.

I started with prompting GPT for business ideas based off of OpenAI api. Then used it to brainstorm. Then to build a plan. Learn about what I need before starting an application. Prepare the tech stack. Break it down into a mult-step plan, and then finally, begin asking GPT to start spitting out code. It starts off easy, and then as the code base grows, it gets harder and harder. I started asking it, 'how do I debug this code' and 'how can you add more debug console messages to help me undertstand where the error is occuring' and so on. As well as, of course, 'explain the code in detail', each time, always learning and growing in the process. Trying to avoid shortcuts.

Ultimately, it was React for the front end, and NodeJS and Mongo for the back, on AWS. I learned a ton, cried a bit, and almost gave up countless times, but finished it, and I'm very proud of myself. Not gonna post the link to avoid self-promotion, but you can peek into my profile and check it out there.

177uaph,I kinda had a stupid thought,"I know many sites leverage bootstrap, whether some or all of its functionality. I also know that if the site is fetching the assets from bootstraps cdn, it will stay cached in the browser and won’t redownload when visiting another site using it. 

At what point should bootstrap assets be included in the browser engine? I feel the same way about jquery. These tools have become so ubiquitous that they’re shipped with so many sites. That’s a shit ton of data to download assets a larger group of developers are using regularly. 

Then, if you want your site to use the bootstrap or jquery install in the client browser, you can include it as a header to leverage it instead of fetching the assets. I could see this resulting in faster load times and decreased bandwidth usage. 

Tell me this is a stupid idea, because my gut tells me it is, but I don’t think it would drag down performance or speed of the browser itself… I dunno. It *feels* wrong.",2023-10-14 17:16:19

16edlpb,Learning web dev? I turned ChatGPT into a free tutor,"I’m a self-taught dev and been in the software industry for 6 years now, primary as a Shopify consultant. Learning to program, whether on your own using free resources or by attending boot camps or a traditional CS college degree, is a difficult challenge. So I commend you on taking the initiative!

When I had a question about a tutorial I was following or why my code wasn’t working, I really wish I had someone to chat the problem through with. Times have change and now there’s really powerful free tools for learning like ChatGPT, Bard, etc. I think what I find great about chatting with AI is you can ask your coding questions, explore CS fundamentals and curiosities.

Although I don’t personally have the bandwidth to take on tutoring right now, I’ve been working on a tool for ecom brands but it can also be used to create chatbots for different domains like providing programming tutoring. Even though usage does cost me, I want to share this programming tutor for free in the hopes it can be a useful resource. You can ask questions and chat anytime with it [here](https://www.lingoblocks.com/playground/1M32LA9HzsRt5FQfQQ5e).

**How did I make this?**
At a high-level, it’s using the OpenAI API to generate responses to user queries. In order to add supplemental material like new framework documentation, tooling and guides, it’s using a vector database and semantic search. Basically I take the conversational context and latest query to semantically search the vector database for relevant resources, then include the results in the OpenAI API call.

**What’s the difference between this and ChatGPT**
ChatGPT has a knowledge cutoff of September 2021. So its model is 2 years out of date. Saying that, ChatGPT and it’s plug-ins like Web Browsing creates a really capable tool for mentoring. End of the day, they’re all helpful tools so use whatever works for you. What I did with the coding tutor I’m sharing is added a ton of programming resources and documentation of popular frameworks and tools. So responses to your questions should be fast and up to date to 2023.

**Disclaimer**
Large language models like ChatGPT (and OpenAI API) don’t always get their answers right so please rely on multiple resources for a balanced learning experience.

Good luck on your programming journey!",2023-09-09 18:55:43

The thing is that i’ve been wanting a computer/laptop to use it for general stuff and to play some games since the time when i wasn’t even going to learn webdev and i couldn’t decide which one i want but now i’d say it’s even harder cause i see that a lotta people use Macs and a lotta people hate Windows.

I want to play games (not a lot though), be able to use it for the courses to code, browse, watch YouTube/Netflix - i just want it to be a computer for everything since i can’t afford both. 

Would a gaming Windows PC be enough?
I’ve always wanted a MacBook but since i won’t be able to play any game i want, it kinda make me want a gaming PC instead but i have an iPhone and AirPods and i like their OS.

So i want to accomplish playing some games, be able to code (when i start the courses and even after i finish them), browse, watch videos/series.

I checked and to use oauth, it pretty much demands the use of MySQL as a requirement, to store the refresh token.

Help me know if this is important or not. Can I keep using the text file db (file.txt), or do I need to get it integrated with MySQL? I’m concerned about the speed because MySQL seems to take longer when loading lots of data than using text files to read from.

* less bloated & but if you want UI components, you can download user made components manually instead of them being included and bloating.
* somehow less complex? idk why maybe because it doesn't use sass which is cool with me since beyond sass compilation I really don't care about sass and most of it's features has been added to css
* adding stuff like purgecss and font is so much easier, just go to tailwind.config.js and add anything.

It's easy to get caught up in the allure of frameworks and shiny tools. While these can certainly speed up development, they shouldn't overshadow the importance of truly understanding the underlying principles.

It's becoming increasingly common to encounter fresh graduates proudly identifying themselves as ""React developers,"" yet displaying limited knowledge of the foundational JavaScript concepts that power the framework.

Being an dev means diving deep into the core concepts, algorithms, and design patterns that drive our technology. It's about having a solid foundation that enables you to adapt and innovate, rather than just relying on pre-built solutions.

Frameworks are amazing, no doubt, but don't let them define your expertise. Embrace them as tools in your toolbox, but remember that true mastery comes from understanding what's under the hood.

Don't get me wrong, I like how it makes it much easier to keep your state on the backend where it belongs, however, it's really only good (at least from my experience so far) for fetching and rendering static content. Creating interactive UI's is, while possible, going to be much harder than using a component-based framework, and will probably require the use of web components (which have been frustrating the few times I've tried to use them) or something like jQuery.

2f4zcu,"[Serious] If you're a developer that enjoys ""shitting"" on PHP have you tried ""modern"" PHP yet? For instance PHP 5.5 + Symfony + Composer? If so how does it compare to the language/ecosystem that you enjoy developing in that you aren't shitting on?","I do Symfony. I do Angular. I build enterprise level web applications that are modular and well architected. I mean I can do high level JS development on the front end so I feel secure in comparing that ecosystem to PHP. I've hacked at Ruby (Capistrano) and read Java and Python, all respectable languages. I just don't see anything orders of magnitude cleaner/readable/well engineered than modern PHP. If you like those languages cool, they seem pretty cool to me. If you wrote PHP in 2005 I get it, you moved to Rails. But if you are still dissing PHP have you tried PHP in its current ""renaissance""? If so compare it to what you program in your spare time/professionally/what you think is the ""real deal"" please.

Honestly the fact that [people are still coming up with underhanded ways to diss PHP](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2f2utf/if_programming_languages_were_weapons/) is starting to reek of ignorance. There's serious developers out there making real awesome shit with PHP.

**Edit1:** And if you write php but haven't yet joined the ""renaissance"" what's stopping you?

**Edit2**: And if your main complaint is ""needle haystack"" or type hinting scalars I say legitimate but as dysfunctional as the PHP core contributors are they maintain a language that only grows in popularity and have shown a willingness to evolve. Realistically I would not be surprised to see those concerns addressed in PHP 7. Facebook deserves a lot of recognition in pushing the core team in the right direction. See [HHVM](http://hhvm.com/) and [Hack](http://hacklang.org/).

Oh and if you have skills and want a job writing Symfony/Angular feel free to PM me.

**Edit3:** Oh and now I'm about to get nasty (blame a couple drinks). If you think Ruby is so superior let's talk about the speed of the language which is a real a concern. Also Rails seems more like Laravel which truth be told is not engineered to scale at an enterprise level but more for hobbyists. And Python? Half your community is stuck in Python 2 wondering to upgrade to 3. And Django I've read it. It's OK but is not a modern framework like Symfony which is a HTTP Request/Response framework more suited for JS SPA applications which is arguably the future. And JS? Why are transpiled frameworks like DART/Coffeescript being written if the language is elegant? JS is required knowledge for all webdevs but don't pretend its a holy grail. And Java? I have nothing bad to say about Java, all the best things in PHP are from Java: Symfony/Spring, Doctrine/Hibernate. It's compiled but you guys are cool.",2014-09-01 03:18:15

119wgra,Why You Don't Need To Be Good At Mathematics To Become A Developer!,"You often hear many people talk about that you need to be some mathematics wizard to become a software developer, but this cannot be further from the truth.

Let me tell you my quick story about how I became a professional software developer while being literally dog-shit at mathematics.

I've been bad at mathematics for my entire life. I remember back in high school. I couldn't even calculate 6th-grade formulas. And because of that, I always thought that I was dumb.

Even once I did discover software development at the age of 14, I still thought that I wouldn't make it since everyone told me that I needed mathematical skills for it.

The only reason why I didn't give up on it is that it was the only possible way for me to unleash the creativity that has been hiding inside of me.

Now almost a decade later, I still suck at mathematics (not even a little) and I've never come across any project or problem that required heavy mathematical operations and if it did require some, the answers could always be found on the internet.

Now, I'm not saying that mathematics is useless, the better you are at it, the better for your career BUT it is by far not required for you to become a very good developer and get a career.

Of course, there are a few categories that do require heavy mathematical skills, and those are...

\- Data Science- Game Development- Robotics- Game engine design

I'm sure there are a few more but all together, this is less than 15% of all the opportunities available.

I hope this message resonates with you :)

iq4qli,The lie of GraphQL!,"I really feel like I was lied to. It's probably accurate to say community/hype around it lied than the GraphQL team. 

Going in, I was shown a mirage where as a frontend dev I didn't have to worry about backend at all. I could simply write simple json like structure and get that exactly that.

First strike was schemas! Ultimately schemas are influenced by the structure of SQL tables underneath them. So the promise that you wont need to know backend at all, shatters a little. But on positive side, it's also easy to read and you can infer relations between different columns.

Secondly, it turns out as a frontend dev you not only have to do read operations, but also write operations. Which means you actually do have to go in and write SQL. Thus you have to actually fully understand the backend anyways. Your cognitive load increases, you have to fill your head with structure of graphql AND sql tables. Because relationships aren't 1:1. And if you are writing sql then what's the point. You're just doing extra work for no reason. Before I could have called sql query and pass params in the router function, now I have to take whole trip from main schema file, to specific schema file, mutation function, to sql file. Gotta add new parameter? Good luck dragging it through router -> schemas -> mutations -> psql driver -> sql.",2020-09-10 14:48:50
7ll49o,An example of how domain name hoarders hurt innovation,"I've read mixed opinions on this website in regards to domain name hoarders/resellers/whatever you want to call them. Rather than create another thread about how they are ""parasites"" or immoral, I just wanted to give you a great example of how they are destroying innovation.

I have a new idea for a website I wanted to make. Sure, this has probably already been done, but I wanted to take this project on to learn more about WebRTC and sockets. Hell, if it ever gained traction maybe I could turn it into a full-time job. I found a package for Laravel that actually utilizes both technologies and would be a great starting point for me. I wanted to make a ""1 on 1"" coaching website where users can either go for online coaching, or professionals can go to make money using their knowledge. Subjects could include things like nutrition, exercise, mental health, etc. This website would allow people to pay coaches per hour or whatever in order to get help from them directly via a 1 on 1 webcam session. The website would also record each session and make it so they can download/rewatch any time they want.

Now, bear in mind that this would be done in my spare time and I don't make a ton of money with my current job. I'm not poor, but I don't exactly have thousands of dollars to throw at a domain name or any other startup cost really. I'm simply a programmer with an idea that I want to turn into a reality. This is one of the reasons I got into web development, because overhead costs for making a site were so low that even a poor kid like me could make something.

So the first thing I usually ask myself when I have an idea for a project is, ""what am I going to call it?"" This, aside from the actual coding, is one of the funnest parts of a project for me. I want something short and catchy, and of course, I want a .com. Since this is purely going to be a web app, the domain name is going to be a major factor in the branding.

I already know that finding a cool .com is going to be nearly impossible. Not because several similar websites exist (there are a few out there), but because all of the decent, catchy domains will be parked by someone trying to make thousands off of a $10 investment. So I begin coming up with different words, synonyms, and variations.

Some words I come up with to start off:

* coach (would be ideal)
* sesh (like session, but meh because drugs)
* session
* tutor
* 1on1
* cam (sounds kind of porn-ish)
* talk
* help

With these words, I begin checking different domain name availability:

* coachly.com - forwards to .de (real site)
* coachster.com - parked
* coacher.com - parked
* coachy.com - unresolved
* websesh.com - parked
* seshy.com - parked
* seshly.com - parked
* tutorly.com - unresolved
* tutty.com - parked
* webtutor.com - parked
* 1on1.com - unresolved
* onecam.com - parked
* camone.com - unresolved

The first domain I tried was talkhelp.com. I actually contacted them, and they want $5,000. So out 14 domains so far, 65% of them are parked/holding pages for ""this domain is for sale"", and only 1 of them is an actual, real, working website.

I realize that I am never going to get a catchy, memorable .com for my new idea. I will either have to get some garbage 15 letter domain name that has no branding potential whatsoever, dish out $5,000 for a hobby project that might never get any users, or get a .org that will be crippled from birth in terms of SEO.

So for now I've given up on my new idea, and I think about just how many other poor developers have been de-motivated by this exact occurrence, in what could have been something great.",2017-12-22 23:29:10

rgb6ds,Heres a real unpopular opinion: You dont need a Computer Science degree to be a programmer.,"I dont think you need a Computer Science degree as a programmer.

Please note this opinion is specifically from an european perspective, because i know things are different overseas.

At least not for being a programmer like most in the business. People who study Computer Science should not be the ones who set up REST endpoints or React frontends. Instead they should be the ones wanting to end up inventing complicated algorithms and technology like RSA encryption or Quantum Computers. And i mean the hard work of math and research behind these and upcoming technologies. But most of the programmers out there in 9/10 cases don't need nor want to understand what is going on exactly behind stuff like RSA Key Exchange. They will just use some renowned wrapper library in their language of choice, that has a c++ core or something written by a mathematician, which does all the work. And in the 1/10 Case it actually interest them, they can just open up a video or wikipedia and get the gist of it. But they don't need to waste five years of their lives for a degree just to learn shit they will never use and than graduate as a computer science bachelor that has practically no ""hands on"" skills at all. (At least if they don't also develop in their spare time, but most of them wont). I mean sure, they could show me the entire calculation to convert the number 15 to binary. But they most definitely have no experience in programming and maintaining a scalable java app in a tech company where they're probably ending up in. I think the only jobs people really should study for in university are jobs like doctors, lawyers, teachers, mathematicians, philosophers, economists and so on. These jobs have all one thing in common. They **need or are based on** a high amount of theorethical knowledge. While as a programmer you don't necessarily have to know a lot, you just need to know how to look stuff up and use it. And the best way to learn that is not by watching professors talk about it for five years. It is learning by doing it. By coding on your own projects in the spare time or working for a company.

So to sum it up: If you end up where i am, being a full-time web-developer in a tech company, but to even get here you studied computer science for 5 years, i think you wasted five years of your live and missed the opportunity to learn a lot of practical stuff. And i would even go that far and assume that someone who started in a position like this 5 years ago with no experience at all will most likely tear you apart, when it comes to skill. Because you will likely have spent your time partying around and doing almost nothing practical than work others didn't want to do with the little money you earn by taxes that the other guy pays.

My Backstory: I am 21 years old and from germany. I am currently working full-time as a web developer in a large tech company which i started working in right after high school with 16 as an apprentice. I had a little bit experience in programming from unity games before that. That's it. I did not have any help to get where i am right now. I just went through the regular application process.",2021-12-14 16:28:00

v0yp0v,"As a user, I prefer static HTML pages over web ""apps"".","## Performance
When I open a ~5000-word Wikipedia article (static HTML-based) in a mobile browser, the page appears on screen in about **one second**. On Everipedia (JS app), it takes five seconds.

When I open a subreddit, i.reddit.com (lite mobile version) loads in one second, old.reddit.com in 2 seconds, whereas Reddit's new ""app-like"" mobile site needs **seven** seconds to intialize, and shows the orange logo splash screen that emits radio waves for over five seconds. When navigating between posts, i.reddit.com loads in one to two seconds each time, whereas the new mobile site shows a splash screen for no less than three seconds between pages.

When I open a profile on Twitter.com, the bird splash screen shows for the first three seconds, then some spinning loading animations for individual sections of the page, and it takes **eight seconds** until the timeline actually appears! It is the last thing to appear.  On Twitter's former (2014-2020) front end, it took less than half as long.

YouTube's legacy front end (`disable_polymer`, removed in 2020) also loaded significantly faster than its new polymer one. The legacy one already shows content while the new one has merely reached its oh-so-fancy skeleton screen.

What do the faster-loading pages have in common? They are based on server-generated static HTML. The browser immediately receives **useful content** rather than **a pile of script** that it has to work through before anything useful can appear on screen.

## Conclusion
Static HTML pages are more lightweight and destroy ""web apps"" in performance. I see pretty much no benefit in a ""web app"" over a static HTML page. ""Web apps"" appear like an overhyped trend that is empty inside. 
Not to mention, single-page sites and fancy animations can be implemented with JavaScript **on top of** static HTML, as GitHub.com and new.reddit.com do, and Twitter's 2014-2020 desktop front end did.

From the beginning, JavaScript was intended as a tool to complement, not to replace HTML and CSS. It appears to me that the sole ""benefit"" of having a ""web app"" is that it appears slightly more ""modern"" and distinguished from classic web sites due to use of splash screens and lack of the browser's loading animation when navigating, while having oh-so-fancy loading animations and skeleton screens inside the website. Sorry, I prefer seeing content quickly over the *app-like* appearance of fancy loading screens.

Arguably, another supposed benefit of ""web apps"" is that there is no blank page when navigating between pages, but in pretty much all major browsers of the last five years, the last page observably **remains on screen** until the next navigated page is rendered sufficiently for viewing.

On mobile, I frequently find myself using old.reddit.com or i.reddit.com, as I love how content appears nearly immediately. On any site, whenever I am greeted with content, I feel pleased. Whenever I am greeted with a loading animation or skeleton screen, be it ever so fancy (e.g. fading in an out, moving gradient waves), I think ""do they really believe they make me like their site more due to their fancy loading screens?! I am not here for the loading screens!"".

Making a page JavaScript-based also makes it fragile. If an exception occurs in the JavaScript, the user might end up with a blank page or an endless splash screen, whereas static HTML-based pages still show useful content. For example, Twitter's web app occasionally it fails to load, showing ""Oops something went wrong! But don't worry – it's not your fault. [retry]"". This would never happen on a static HTML-based page. A page which does not work without JavaScript used to be unthinkable, but now it's the norm.

To make a page dependent on JavaScript and sacrifice lots of performance for a slight visual benefit does not seem worthed it.

>
""Yeah, but I'm building a webapp, not a website"" - I hear this a lot and it isn't an excuse. I challenge you to define the difference between a webapp and a website that isn't just a vague list of best practices that ""apps"" are for some reason allowed to disregard. Jeremy Keith makes this point brilliantly.
>
For example, is Wikipedia an app? What about when I edit an article? What about when I search for an article?

Whether you label your web page as a ""site"", ""app"", ""microsite"", whatever, it doesn't make it exempt from accessibility, performance, browser support and so on.

If you need to excuse yourself from progressive enhancement, you need a better excuse.

### – Jake Archibald, 2013

> My big concern is at the bottom of that technology pyramid. The lowest common denominator of the Web. The foundation. The rhythm section. The ladyfingers in the Web trifle. It’s the HTML. And it is becoming increasingly clear to me that there’s a whole swathe of Frontend Engineers who don’t know or understand the frontend-est of frontend technologies.

### – Pete Lambert, 2019

> The problem with getting rid of full-page reloads is that browsers and assistive technology use page loads as a signal to trigger certain useful behaviours, including announcing the title of the new page or resetting keyboard focus to the beginning of the document.

2b1u4h,2 hours ago we came up with an idea for a new app idea. We're launching it in the next few hours and had an idea you can help with Reddit...,"We're a small team of devs - ggapps.co.uk - and at lunchtime we went to the pub to sit in the glorious UK sunshine. We decided we wanted to spend the afternoon developing a new, fast product idea. The beer helped us throw a few ideas around and we all agreed (with no small thanks to the sun) on a quirky weather app that tells you what type of clothes to wear that day. Easy as that!

We got back to the office about 1:30pm, planned it out and got to building it. The plan is to launch a version, no matter how rough, in the next few hours.

I've now had a thought though - what would be amazing is if we can get people to not only use the app, but to also join us to plan out the roadmap of the next few iterations to make a kind of ongoing 'crowd-sourced' development project. You know, get you guys to trial it, offer suggestions about features etc. We can then start to credit people with their contributions and create an educational platform to showcase a products development. Maybe give transparency to code-snippets, show UX evolution, show the marketing side etc etc etc.

I'm brain-dumping a bit and haven't had a chance to think the process through but what do you guys think? Is this something that could be of value to would be product devs? 

It's called '8bit Weather' by the way. I'll add the link when it's actually built!

18k3rfp,The rise in quality of Webflow websites,"I run a small web design agency, where we build custom websites using WordPress with ACF + Gutenberg, Tailwind and Vue for interactive components.

However, a trend I started to notice is that more and more agencies are moving on to Webflow, and most of them actually build really beautiful websites in terms of UI, interactivity & animations.

On top of that, most websites you see on Awwwards nowadays are built using Webflow. Not too often you come across a really high-end website in terms of design that is handcoded.

Another reason why most of these agencies made the switch is that they often say that their designers & front-end developers are much faster in Webflow when compared to using a regular CMS or other front-end tooling, while still being able to produce high quality websites.

**So why is that?**

* Is manually coding a website losing market share to no-code? And are the talented front-end devs jumping ship to Webflow?
* Did the upcoming generation of young and talented front-end developers make the switch to no-code?
* What does the rise of no-code mean for modern web development? Should experienced front-end devs also take time to learn tools like Webflow? Or should we just take more time in learning design fundamentals & animation.

A lot of innovation in terms of modern webdesign & trends seem to come from the Webflow community nowadays.

**So this leaves me with even more questions:**

* Is the quality in terms of webdesign & UI correlated to no-code platforms like Webflow? Some Webflow agencies do set the bar quite high. Whereas the innovation from WordPress, Craft & Drupal agencies really stagnated over the last 10 years
* Does no-code change the mindset of developers to become more design oriented? Hence why a lot of those sites look visually more polished?
* Are tools like Next.js, Tailwind etc. still competitive enough to attract talented front-end devs, and is it still worth to invest in them for web design?

I couldn't find too many discussions about this on r/webdev, so I'm curious to hear your perspective on this topic.

I feel like our community focussed way too much on the tooling and experimenting with the 100th JS framework, rather than becoming better at webdesign itself.

My take is that low code is providing an answer for front-end developers who want to focus more on design, rather than starting an internet war about Vue vs. React or Tailwind vs StyleX.",2023-12-16 23:37:03

But does it have any integration with frontend frameworks like React or Vue? Or do I have to build everything?

For example, if I need a modal, do I need to build everything, the events being emitted, transitions, etc... right? The official tailwind package doesn't support any of it?

So, said that, is it not better to use frontend UIs that are already integrated with frameworks like Vue or React?

I really don't get it, building all components by itself must be a huge work for most of the projects, is it not better just to get something already done and just modify the style to own needs?

I no longer even expect that changing something in a class will actually yield any result  


I have 300 lines of CSS for the simplest shit ever, just because, for some reason, shit doesn't work, so I create another div encapsulating it and somehow then it works or doesn't idk.

If YOU actually want to build it -- which is what webdev is about -- the answer has nothing to do with what you actually want to build. If you actually want to build it, you need multiple years of knowledge and experience. Unless you want more frustration than it's worth and a crappy site in the end, there is no shortcut.

Think of it this way: I don't know the first step toward building a house. But I've been in many houses before. Heck, I've lived in houses almost my entire life. I even have a pretty good idea of what I'd like my house to look like. But without some serious help, research, studying, and experience, any attempt I make at building a house is going to be absolutely terrible. Even if I eventually get a structure in place, make the walls smooth, and put a nice coat of paint on it, we all know it's a piece of shit underneath. The roof will leak, the electrical will probably start a fire, flushing the toilet will probably flood the bathtub, and it's probably just unsafe to live in. Obviously I need the help of professionals.

So, if you want to build a fucking shed in your backyard, whatever, go ahead. But don't bring your crappy new idea to us and expect to find advice that will actually enable you to build your dream site. It's not going to happen. If you truly do want to learn webdev, take the initiative to actually learn it.

18gib76,"Why are there no ""app engines""?","I'm a professional web app developer and recently I've started getting into game development as a hobby. I know that technically you can make games just using code without the need for a game engine, but it seems that game engines are the standard as they simplify the development process and offer a lot of powerful tools.

This got me thinking that most web & app development still happens entirely in code. Sure there are frameworks and libraries to make coding things easier, but any professional web or mobile app will almost always just be pretty much entirely ""programmed"".

I also know that there are tools like Wix or Shopify to create websites without (or with very little) code, but these are always very limited and don't compare to the flexibility or power of a game engine in any way.

How come no one has made an ""app engine"" yet to make the process of developing an app more accessible? And if they have, how come that idea didn't take off?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I feel like some comments are misunderstanding my question or my intention with it so I wanted to clarify the following:

1. I am not personally looking for a no code / low code solution for app development. I love coding and I am very comfortable with it. The point of this post was just to generate discussion around an observation I had.
2. I know that game development involves a lot of coding, and I am not saying otherwise. I am simply observing that the standard for game development is to use tools like game engines which provide additional interfaces for development beyond just coding everything from scratch.
3. Some people have replied saying that things like JavaScript frameworks (React, Svelte, etc) are essentially ""app engines"", but I don't think they're comparable to game engines. The key distinction for me here is that game engines provide you with additional interfaces beyond just raw coding to achieve what you want. In the case of JS frameworks, you are still just writing code.
4. Other people have responded with other examples which I agree are more analogous to game engines but for app development. I guess that there are ""app engines"" after all, but I remain curious as to why these are not the industry standard in the same way that game engines are?
5. To summarize my question and avoid further misunderstandings, here is what I'm asking:

Game engines are the standard for game development. How come 'app engines' aren't the standard for app development?'",2023-12-12 09:45:53

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=63895
 

**Filed in 2000!** Their original argument for not supporting this is now shot, as CSS 3 defines the behavior of 'position: relative' on table-cells very thoroughly rather than the 'undefined' it was in CSS 2 ([explained here](http://wiki.orbeon.com/forms/doc/contributor-guide/browser#TOC-Firefox-doesn-t-support-position:-relative-on-table-cells))

104dpnt,"I just got my first job as a frontend web dev, with very little experience.","As the title states I have **very little experience**, I took one class in college on web design which taught me the basics of designing html and css responsively. After the semester ended I spent around two weeks studying css on my own learning about flexbox mainly, and doing some basic css courses on free code camp. I still to this day have learned 0 javascript or any other language besides html and css. I have good knowledge of graphic design as that's what I've been going to school for so maybe my knowledge of photoshop and other design programs helped me get the job. My friend works at the company I was hired at, and he put in a good word for me and got me an interview. It's in a rural area so I wont be doing any revolutionary work, or making a killing like you would working for google/facebook, but it will give me a chance to get my foot in the door, learn more, and make better money than I would working a crappy kitchen or grocery store job. Anyway the point of this post wasn't to brag, but mainly to make it clear to other beginner developers that you don't need two years worth of experience, and a college degree in computer science, or whatever to get a job as a dev. Hell, I have basically 4 months of experience, only in html and css, and I haven't even finished my graphic design degree and I got a job so it's possible just start applying!

189y8g4,Why is JavaScript Often Considered Superior to PHP?,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I've been pondering a question and thought this would be the perfect place to seek some insights. I've noticed that in many developer circles, JavaScript is often lauded as a superior programming language compared to PHP. However, from my understanding, PHP has a significant capacity in terms of backend development, and it powers a large portion of the web (think WordPress, for instance).

&#x200B;

I'm curious to know why JavaScript is generally held in higher esteem. Is it because of its versatility in both frontend and backend development through Node.js? Or is it more about the trends in web development that favor JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular?

&#x200B;

I'm genuinely interested in understanding the technical and practical reasons behind this perception. Of course, I believe both languages have their strengths and use cases, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.

&#x200B;

Why do you think JavaScript is often seen as superior to PHP?

What are the key strengths of JavaScript that might overshadow PHP's capabilities?

In what scenarios would PHP be a better choice over JavaScript?

Looking forward to your opinions and insights!",2023-12-03 17:21:58

1bnn8ie,"Woah, write fewer Tailwind classes, guys...","I know some people are die-hard Tailwind fans...

While others hate it religiously...

I'm neither, thankfully.

I like Tailwind and use utility classes where it makes sense.

But I noticed the code examples on Tailwind's homepage.

Particularly this one: [https://tailwindcss.com/#mobile-first](https://tailwindcss.com/#mobile-first)

In my opinion, that's not a very good first impression for people unfamiliar with Tailwind (and skeptical of utility classes).

I personally only use about 20-30 Tailwind classes, which can do 80%-85% of your styling.

For more complex CSS (gradients, animations, transforms), I'll usually use something else (CSS, Sass, CSS-in-JS, etc.) while reusing the same theme tokens.

I feel like this is a good balanced approach.

Even in [Adam Wathan's original post](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/#:~:text=You%20should%20still%20create%20components), he said sometimes using CSS components makes sense.

Basically what I'm trying to say is: don't go overboard and try to style everything in Tailwind.

The examples on TW's homepage are perhaps trying to showcase its capability, but classes that long get harder to read/find, especially because they're all on 1 line.

17k1640,How do I get out of this mess and find a new agency?,"Hi everyone, I hired a dev shop from India 2+ years ago to do build a web app that was supposed to be deployed in 3 months time according to their estimation. I think I don't need to go into the details to why those 3 months turned into 2+ years. What's important is how I can get the source code and part ways to hire a new dev shop.

The tricky part; 8% equity / no access to the code:  
Because of a small alteration of the app's functionalities, we required blockchain technology to proceed. As this was not part of the scope, they sent me a new quote that exceeded my budget by far, which forced me into giving them 8% equity in return for a 50% price reduction if they complete the project. 2 years later, I am much more knowledgeable about webdev and blockchain technology and basically found out that the crypto wallet integration and their simple smart contract meant barely any work.

I still owe them around 6k USD to get rid of these never-ending bugs and make it ready for a beta version. However, I don't want to pay them and rather terminate our collaboration and find a new agency. This will most likely end up in them not giving me the source code unless I pay some ridiculous price that they'll make up based on their old offer (excl. equity) etc.

As long as I still have access to the staging website, is there anything I should/can do to secure anything of value that will enable a new agency to clone my site? any tools, etc? 

Thank you for your support and time. Also, If you think that my intended course of action is bad/devious, I am open for an alternative way of handling this.",2023-10-30 19:16:45

u8vkwe,The 5 Reasons Why Your Resume Sucks,"There are many reasons why people aren't getting interviews. Here are a few things I've picked up while helping others fix/modify their resume and portfolio to land their dream job.

1 . Your resume is too wordy

Recruiters are busy people and don't have time to read through your entire resume and get to know all of your experiences and skills. As a rule of thumb, if someone can't look at your resume for 30 seconds and get a clear understanding of what it is you bring to the table, then it's too long.

2 . Your projects are too basic

When putting projects on your portfolio you want them to display your skills and show what you are capable of. If you have 3 web apps that use the same tech stack and just have different functionalities, its not enough. Broaden you scope by showcasing integrations with 3rd party applications or build different types of tools/applications that don't require the same tech stack in each project.

3 . You don't have enough projects

This is easy. If you only have 1 or 2 projects on your resume, its not enough. Getting your first career in cs is difficult and you may not have previous experience to display on your resume to fill space. So rather, focus on projects that can showcase all of your skills. This is a common shortcoming when I talk to people about their resumes (if you'd like direct help from me with this or any of the other points, read to the end).

4 . You aren't tailoring your resume to the job posting

The recruiter for the front end developer position couldn't care less about you working at that restaurant for 3 years. It doesn't pertain to the position you are applying to! If you leave things like this on your resume the recruiter feels that you are wasting their time.

5 . Your portfolio is confusing?!?

Portfolios are meant to showcase you work. The portfolio itself does not have to be fancy. A basic html/css webpage is all you need. Hell if you even want to use a website builder that fine. The point is to showcase your projects on there and make it super easy for recruiters and hiring managers to see and demo your projects. My portfolio that got me my dev job is a one pager with links to all of my live projects.

**I do regular resume/portfolio reviews for people who are applying to cs jobs. If you're interested, send me a dm and we can go over yours.**

Good Luck!",2022-04-21 19:33:15
l5tju9,Unpopular Opinion: I hate React because I love loops,"After working with AngularJS extensively since 2014, I am moving to ReactJS, and let me make a few things clear: 

React is amazing. I love it, I love solving all problems with component composition. I love the efficiency of the state management that react is designed to work with. Compared to AngularJS, the intimate knowledge you need of the library's internal implementation details in order to write beautiful, performant code is not even comparable. If I had not read most of the angularjs source code I would never have been able to write the nice code that I did. React seems to actually work automatically without the need to understand just about anything except how to write functions that call functions.

I don't love being required to use immature build tools. NodeJS is basically hot garbage unless you love working with open source code where everything you are trying to use has had ten million grubby little fingers all up in it doing whatever the fuck they want \~\~\~\~ but that's a different story. I have dug into the build process and figured out how to write my own scripts to make it build pretty much whatever I want. I'm over that.

What I will never get over is this :

When did the entire web dev community go insane and decide to never use a normal goddamn for loop again? Using Array.prototype.map is for when you need to do some quick and dirty data manipulation and messing around with intermediate collection objects would distract from the flow of the method. Deciding to write a library where it is by design the primary method of iterating over lists is the least elegant thing I have ever seen become so popular. 

Here I am thinking ""Wow I finally put in the effort to set up a web build process, I can finally support IE and use the ultimate ES6 gift to humanity: the for .. of loop!"" ...

Only to find out that no, reactjs wants this hideously-overzealous-about-functional-programming pattern everywhere.

Then I think, hm, well ok fine, so the templates are hideous, my boss won't let me use Vue... whatever.

I start writing a component and I want to iterate over the children to make sure they are the instances of the subcomponent which I designed to work with it, and also mirror themselves basically make Routers and Links in parallel but separate containers. I think, ok I finally get to use a beautiful, wonderful, jumps out of the page and yells to me exactly how the method is flowing with language level syntax, a for of loop... and I find out that what I'm supposed to do is this:

React.children.forEach(child...

9alc6j,Building a content search engine,"I’m investigating a web-based data-mining service I plan to build. I am trying to figure out system costs for the project.

The service will index the entire internet in search of the latest content/blogs that have been created. The point of the service is to keep track of new articles as they are published. 

It will be an index of the web using minimal meta data. It does not need to be sophisticated like a full search engine that stores backlink info etc. The data set will only include the URL, title, description, date discovered and date published. 

The project will have a back end spider that indexes the web and checks for new content, I expect it to index content within 6 hours of it being published.

The search interface will be a simple web form like google, we plan to do some additional processing to rank the content, we expect 100 search per second. 

I have had a look around at some pre built open source search-engine solutions, but they seem a little over kill for this project.

6omia2,Am I the only one who hates web dev after 6 years of experience?,"In 8th grade I started copy pasting PHP to build my first LAMP project. It all went downhill from there.

Along the way, I picked up Django, assorted JS, Node, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Celery, Redis, Mongodb. Recently I have learned Kubernetes, docker. And some intangibles such as log management, several iterations of package managers etc... Sorry to break it to you, all the tools you learn are meaningless. It'll be outdated in 5 or so years. In 10 years, all the things you know will become ""legacy"" code that nobody wants to maintain. I know this firsthand because I had to maintain a C# codebase that was only 4 years old but has already become a liability. The point being: when the power goes out, everything you created is lost.

After all those sleepless nights, the excitement has finally gone away. I am totally burnt out and the anhedonia isn't going away any time soon.

When I learned webdev, little did I realize how extremely repetitive web dev is. The pride of learning new tech has worn off. Web dev is full of buzzwords that are actually extremely simple concepts. New technologies come and go but after while it is inconsequential. Postgres replacing MySQL, ES6 replacing ES5, ${NEWEST_FRONT_END} replacing last frontend. I currently have a paid ReactJS project. I want to gorge my eyeballs out everytime I read Redux.

At this point, I don't have the curiosity to learn whatever new tools can offer. It's all the same repetitive chore just to get some base shit done. Is this what you call codemonkeying? For me, just thinking about this prospect makes me cringe so hard that I almost break my neck.

I hate web dev. Good thing I'm only in college now so I'll probably focus on deep learning. Maybe I'll move to Cuba after graduation and not touch webdev ever again.

11se2ry,"I made a 90's style website, with 90's tech - here's what I learned","My go to frameworks are typically SvelteKit and Vue. However, for my most recent project I wanted to kick it old school and make a website with good ole fashioned HTML, CSS, and JS.  I want to share some general lessons that I learned (rather than detailed or technical ones - unless you ask!).

**1. The fundamentals are important**

I've seen a lot of r/webdev newcomers come here and ask, ""Should I use \[insert huge framework\] with \[insert highly specific backend\] to learn web development?"" There seems to be mixed reviews of where to start - but I'd recommend starting with the basics - pure HTML, CSS, and JS. It's like learning algebra before taking calculus. I'd learn CSS before learning Tailwind. I'd learn JS before learning Next.js. 

**2. Not having all the bloat was fun**

No webpack, no npm, no scss pre-processors. It felt like I had a pencil and a blank sheet of paper. Everything was super lightweight, and it was fun styling things from scratch. 

**3. It's hard to make a super-fast website - even when its 86kb**

A goal of this site was to make it load as fast as possible.. I wanted 100% on lighthouse lol. But it was challenging. I lazy loaded images, deferred styles, and hunted for the fastest possible CDNs and Hosting. I ended up using [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) (which has an incredible, almost illegal feeling, free tier with unlimited bandwidth btw). I got it to a point that I was happy with speed-wise, but it was frustrating because adding incredibly simple stuff like a couple fonts, images on page load, and some  analytics caused the whole site to slow down considerably. 

**4. Pure HTML, CSS, and JS can do more than you think (or at least more than I thought)**

I'm guilty of finding some quick npm package or pre-made component to do the thing I want to do, but this project showed me how powerful the basics can be.

A couple cool things I learned were:   
HTML has a highlight element, `<mark>`, it even has a fully supported color picker, `<input type=""color"">`. I made an incredibly simple and good looking tooltip with plain ole CSS (which I would have used a package for earlier). I added some basic animations with nice looking `cubic-bezier` curves. CSS masking is awesome (and really powerful). And the JS was just - pure lol. It was just `getElementById(){ do what  want }\``

The site is in the period at the end of this sentence[.](https://theworldsbiggestpenis.com/) This whole project has been a bit of a joke (a very big joke!) but has also been an absolute blast. Building with the basics has been oddly therapeutic. I wanted to share my experience and throw in my appreciation for good ole fashioned HTML, CSS, and JS.",2023-03-16 00:09:47
qghp06,Dev billed me for 5 hours to examine code?,"Hello, I recently wanted to have some improvements made on my website. I found a dev on one of the popular freelancer websites. During our initial discussion, he said he would need access to the code to give me a bid. However, I did not want to hand over access to my website with no protection. So I created a contract, and I had some sort of paper trail.

Long story short, he billed me for 5 hours to just look at the code and backend of my site, and still has yet to get back to me.

I feel like 5 hours is excessive to look at the backend of my site no?

10skzyn,Why are Senior Devs still complaining about React?,"So I'm a bit late to this, but Josh Collinsworth wrote a lengthy post about why React isn't really that great and how other frameworks are way better. But he continually concedes that most libraries / frameworks use the same concepts, are comparable in performance, and are easy for devs to learn after having learned at least one other framework: [https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/self-fulfilling-prophecy-of-react](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/self-fulfilling-prophecy-of-react)

As a counter to his argument, I wrote a very short post about why I think he basically makes the case that the framework you choose in 2023 doesn't really matter: [https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2023/02/02/no-best-framework](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2023/02/02/no-best-framework)

\[Edit\]: So I’m pretty surprised at the debate this kicked off and I just want to say that I may have drawn a conclusion too quickly. After getting some really good feedback from u/stolinski, I have to admit that he is definitely right — the original author is not “complaining” about React so much as pointing out that other better options have existed for some time now. That was a poor choice of words on my part and I don’t want to come across as a *provocateur.*

I still do believe that React is a perfectly fine choice, and feel that it will continue to be a fine choice… for the near future. But I must concede that change is inevitable and we’re already seeing that take shape (Svelte, Solid, and Qwik are gaining a lot of dedicated users). Nevertheless, I’m glad I started this conversation as it’s definitely been illuminating and I’ve learned quite a bit.

1b1fjop,Designer builds a javascript game with ChatGPT,"Today I launched a movie song guessing game that I've built with the help of ChatGPT called Needle Drop → [https://needledrop.me](https://needledrop.me)

Backstory: I'm a product designer who's mostly worked for startups and now big tech, and I haven't really touched html/css for nearly a decade. I've worked closely with engineers my entire career but never really rolled the sleeves up and dived into a scripting language. I'd seen some engineers playing around with CodeGPT over a year ago when it launched–we huddled around a screen and tried to decide how quickly our jobs would be replaced by this new technology. At the time, we weren’t in any real danger, but I caught a glimpse of how well it understood prompts and stubbed out large amounts of code. 

For the past four or five years, I've played a hacky trivia game with family and friends where I play a song, and they have to guess the movie that features the song; *Guess the Needle Drop*. After many passionate debates and over-the-top celebrations fueled by my generation’s nostalgia for popular classic songs and films, people often told me that I needed to “build an app for this.”

I started doodling in Figma before quickly starting to build the website in Node, and then read somewhere that it's a better approach to learn vanilla javascript before trying to benefit from frameworks like React, etc. So I started again with a static vanilla website and, piece by piece, built out each chunk of functionality I’d envisioned. **My mind was consistently blown at how helpful ChatGPT was**–far beyond my lofty expectations, even with all the AI hype. It was like having a 24/7 personal tutor for free. I rarely had to google console errors hoping that a Stack Overflow discussion catered to my exact scenario. With enough information, ChatGPT always knew what was wrong and explained in terms I could understand.

The workflow went like this: I would describe the desired user experience, parse the code GPT suggested, copy it to my editor, and paste back any errors I came across along the way. The errors were abundant at the beginning, but I got better over time at anticipating issues. Perhaps my biggest takeaway was that I had to learn how to converse with ChatGPT: sometimes I would spend 10 minutes crafting a prompt, forcing me to fully understand and [articulate my own line of thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) about what I was trying to achieve.

Using ChatGPT to make a static local website is fairly trivial, but the deployment and automation stage is where I fully realised the scope of what I could achieve. As a product designer, I’ve had the luxury of listening to engineers discuss solutions without personally having to sweat the execution. Working solo I couldn’t stay in the periphery anymore. I kinda knew AWS was a whole thing. That git was non-negotiable. That having a staging server is sensible and that APIs could do a lot of the heavy lifting for me. I would sanity-check with ChatGPT whether I understood these tools correctly and whether it was appropriate to use them for what I was building. A few of the things that initially intimidated me but I ended up working out:

- GitHub Actions workflows
- AWS hosting and CloudFront
- Route 53 DNS hosting
- SSL certificates 
- Implementing fuzzy search
- LocalStorage and JSON manipulation
- Even some basic python to scrub data

It’s a fairly basic game, and for anyone sneaking a look with the inspector, it’s a dog’s div soup breakfast served with a side of spaghetti logic. But it still goes to show how much AI seems like a learning steroid.

So I've made a curriculum to do so--mostly bringing you through courses on other well-regarded sites that I've benefitted tremendously from and then having you do projects I would review.

From this, you would have a portfolio and a set of skills you could show off to potential employers. And I'm definitely helping you with the interview process itself.

I don't want to be paid for this--but I may some day have a side project I'd like to do with a non-profit (has happened before), and I'll need some hands to help with the bigger projects.

I made the mistake of installing buddypress early on, and that means I cant uninstall it without ripping out WordPress entirely; The problem of course is that BuddyPress is has some very big holes in its user management and since its just me right now, I really dislike the fact that by default users are not being put into a group I can actually administrate, despite having posting perms I cant change via the admin interface since not all users show up in the admin interface and the bots are using this to stay unmanagable.  Its insane and I hate it because I get about 100 registered users a day and they mostly look like random text bots seeking to leverage my domain names SEO, but I cant actually manage them unless I do raw SQL in the database because apparently while buddypress SAID they were ready for production, ""these features are pending"".  I feel lied to.

Basically, what I have now is a pile of crap and I need to replace it.  But I have no idea what I can get working as I have been out of the PHP world for a while and dont know my options , so I'm asking you all.

Is this the correct architecture? Am I rendering components where they don’t need to be rendered, and is that slowing it down? 

2.) I ran a lighthouse report and it suggested I remove the “material design icons” as it was very large. I tried removing the <link> style sheet in index.html referencing MDI, and it removed the import but did not improve performance. So I’m confused why it suggested that? 

3.) It performs just fine on Desktop, but man mobile browsers it is just so slow. Transitions run at like 5 FPS. Here’s an example:

https://nateharrell.com 

On the boba tea shop project, on mobile, everything just performs so slow. I would love to know why!! 

I noticed that when I load the page initially, it is pretty smooth. But the longer I am on the page, the slower it gets. Is this because of how things are cached, and is this the main issue?


Any pointers are greatly appreciated!! Is it my phone!? The architecture!? Too much CSS!? Nothing I’ve tried has worked unfortunately, even some of the lighthouse suggestions! Thank you all😄",2023-02-18 17:24:37

ruf4zt,This is why I don't studied computer science,"*This post will be a longer one about the IT industry, educational discrimination, society and personal feelings. I will describe my story and how I perceived the way into getting to work in the IT sector, as well as the computer science topic.*

&#x200B;

I'm a 19 years old software developer (official, still a trainee) in Germany. Since I was 14 years old, I am engaged in web development. It is my biggest hobby and in the meantime it has become my profession.

I did my two school internships out of interest in the field of software development. During these internships, my supervisors praised me and told me that with my knowledge and great interest in software development, I should pursue a degree in this field.

In Germany, roughly speaking, you need the highest of three school-leaving exams to be able to study something at a university. When I had to make the decision to go to the upper school to get the highest exam, I decided against it. From my grades, I could have easily done it. But I had massive problems with the school system and wanted to get out of it. I wanted to do something practical and not have to learn theoretical things for the next decade.

So I left school with a very good second level exam and looked around for an apprenticeship.

And this is where the whole problem starts. Many companies want the highest school-leaving exam for a normal job apprenticeship. I was lucky and was taken on by a good company near me.

On the one hand, it's really stupid that the highest exam is so often required everywhere. But on the other hand, it's sadly understandable, because the level of education in our country has dropped drastically due to an outdated system and a lack of teachers.

Many parents, for example, assume by default that their child will graduate with the highest exam, since the lower ones are already considered almost worthless by society. Students who have difficulties with the school system are not respected. It is almost like a competition.

But let's talk about studying computer science. In English, it is correctly called ""computer science"". In our language, it is typically just called ""studying IT"". This difference usually leads to the conclusion that people who have a CS degree are better programmers than those who have learned it as an IT job.

A quote which has remained in my head until today comes from our vocational school teacher:

>*""If you want to do programming, don't study IT""*

And that is the point. That's why it's called ""computer science"" in English.

**Do you really need to know complicated math, algorithms and binary trees to build a nice website?**

Of course, it could help to understand the things behind. But in my eyes, it is definitely not necessary to build a cool app and be a great software engineer.

That's why I think it's not a necessarily good idea to study computer science if you want to be a good developer. If you are interested in the technology behind computers and software and want to work in a more scientific field later on, then studying CS makes sense.

Actually, a lot of cs students I've talked to know a lot of theory, but they can't develop real software. But we, the ""causal"" programmers, are often **being discriminated by those people**, and they think they are a lot better than us.

For this very reason, we have many people in our vocational school who have dropped out of their university because it was too much for them and they would rather do a software development job. I have friends that doesn't have a Degree, and they're super intelligent and I truly love working together with them!

Also, for companies, your actual work experience and how good you are in practice counts much more than any degree.

So, I personally chose not to study CS and would make that decision again if I had to. For me, software development means living out my creativity and putting my ideas into practice.

Of course, apprenticeships also have disadvantages and problems that I have experienced myself. But that's another topic...

**My top advice for everyone here is: Teach yourself what you are interested in and do exactly that! Make your own projects, live out your creativity and show what you can!**

&#x200B;

*What I have reported here is based on my experience. It can be different in other countries, and each person also makes individual experiences. But I hope to have given a thought-stimulating impulse and am pleased about everyone who has read up to here.*

&#x200B;

All the love and good luck

bgzeuw,Headless CMS Pricing,"The way I see it, there are 3 ways headless CMS price themselves:

### 1. Pricing Based on Features

Pricing models based on features is one of the most popular ways to segment tiers of a headless CMS. On a sliding scale, the smaller projects get less features up to full enterprise, which has access to all features the CMS has to offer.

#### Pros

* Pay for the tools you need. If your project doesn’t need certain business-grade features, you don’t have to pay for them.
* Less clutter in the platform.

#### Cons

* Building a proof of concept in a smaller tier may not be accurate, as there is not full access to the platform.
* Limited access can be detrimental. As projects morph, you may need to upgrade into a more expensive tier just to gain access to new tools.

### 2. Pricing Based on Content Entry

Another pricing model that appears to make sense on the surface is pricing for content models or content entries. The size of a project is largely defined by the number of content entries, rows, or records in a project. As such, pricing corresponds directly to the number of content entries in a platform. Before committing to a headless CMS that prices based on content entries, consult with a solution engineer to ensure your content is accurately quoted.

#### Pros

* Pay as you grow. As projects grow, so too does pricing correspond directly.
* Extremely predictable and controllable. Your team knows when they will be entering more content according to a content calendar, so you can expect price increases accordingly.

#### Cons

* Discourages use of the platform. The more content you enter, the more you will be charged. So, teams tend to be judicious to a fault so as not to enter too much content in a system that charges them more.
* Estimating content models, types, and records can be difficult and fluctuates.

### 3. Pricing Based on Data

Pricing based on data largely corresponds to the data transfer in requests, whether they be JSON requests, media requests, etc. This pricing model is for projects big and small to be charged according to content *demand* rather than content entries.

#### Pros

* Pricing corresponds directly to success. As a project is more successful and gains traction, you will likely be making more sales.
* Increases can be predictable based on seasonality of your business.

#### Cons

* Based on demand. If a piece of content goes viral, you’ll have to pay more to cover those costs.

174nnru,What's the deal with contractors never wanting their code touched?,"On this current project I'm on we have a full DevOps stack. We can request reviews, github even auto recommends reviewers whose lines I've edited. Multiple times now, from devs to managers have asked that I stop editing other developer's code. I have 16 years of experience, but I have never encountered a situation where something was broken and I was asked to not edit something.

Is this something with younger developers? Is this just more common with overseas developers? I'm just confused. I keep being told that I write good code. I've even asked to be taken off the project multiple times (I work for an agency and the developers I'm working with aren't even under the agency I work for). It just feels hostile. Like, I can't add or work on anything without touching someone else's code.

I just want to make sure I'm not going crazy here.

Example: to provide an example, I was tasked to get a QA environment up. I was editing the deployment workflows and was literally laughed at by the dev who set it up calling it unneeded and that it was already setup.

Edit: Thanks everyone. I think I figured out the situation via the comments and my daily interaction. I'm pretty sure everyone is sick and tired of this project and me doing my task/job/editing-their-code will affect the contract. I don't know the terms of their contract (being a contractor on this project myself) but I'd assume from their actions that not reaching the deadline will be bad. I am more lax because I've been on this project for 2 years now and have already seen three missed deadlines. Half of the devs (including the one in my example) have only been on the project since April. It sounds like its common (or at least common for outsourced contractors) to have contracts dependent on completed projects.

seriously tho, he is a good guy, we have a good rapport, but our debate devolved today and we agreed to disagree. 
here is what sparked it: a dev poked his head over and asked

""is it okay to build a command line tool that makes assumptions about where other repositories have been cloned on your machine?""

we both said ""No!"" but we differed in that he said ""you should force the users to fill out a config file, which contains the locations of the local repos""

and i said ""why do i need a sega genisis sitting next to my SNES, before i can play mariokart!?"" essentially: put dependancies IN your app! not outside it, for gods sakes!

I'm awful at debate.  he said something about how my model disregards componentization. 30 years of SE exp tells him that the config file is better than wrapping the dependancy.

I've been going through the Tailwind documentation every time I'm thinking about how to get the style I want, and it seems very well indexed for what I'm searching on. Lots of great visual descriptions of each keyword. The VSCode extension also makes it pretty slick to explore what's available and how it translates to pure CSS.

Putting the styles right inside of the respective component makes a lot more sense to me than the flow of maintaining a stylesheet with custom class names.

Also pretty new to Next.JS, but haven't dug into that much at this point.

So take it from a seasoned webdev noob, Tailwind is pretty nice if you suck at CSS. If you haven't really tried it out yet and you also feel like CSS is a little daunting, I recommend just trying it out for yourself.

One of my job offers was rescinded because the employer called my previous employer, and obviously, he bad-mouthed me. I knew he was an asshole, but his maliciousness was out of my expectation. 

However, I don't feel too bad about it, as I think this incident serves as a filter to filter out companies that I don't want to work for. I think it is stupid for them, after 3 rounds of interviews, in total of 4 hours, that I believe I impressed them with my enthusiasm such as showing my market research about their product in the interview, they chose to trust someone whom they have never seen.

However, I think it is understandable to reduce risk of hiring the wrong person, but at the same time I think this is a practice that causes employees to not stand up for themselves when they were abused, worried about retaliation in the reference check. This is unjust.

fyo5zj,Safari sucks and I hope it dies out soon,"**Edit**  
I've calmed down now. Thanks for empathizing and offering advice, and talking sense. I was just super frustrated after working on something for a week and not being able to test on Safari - and then finding out that it didn't work on Safari eventually. Of course, I didn't really mean it when I said we should stop support for Safari. But I wish there was some way to get Apple to make the browser better, and make testing it easier.

**Original post below**  

If you are an iOS user who enjoys Safari, I don't hold anything against you. I just hate the people who made you believe that this was the standard by ensuring that you wouldn't get to use anything better.

I use Ubuntu Linux as my daily driver. I don't own a Mac. Nobody in my family owns an Apple device. A few of my friends do, but I can't go meet them each time I need to test something. Also, I am not rich enough to buy an Apple device and if I was, my pride wouldn't let me. Let's dig into the real thing now.

**The testing**  
Making websites compatible with Safari is a real pain because I have no way of easily testing Safari. It's a sucky browser with bad W3C implementations and Apple should be ashamed of themselves for having it the way it is.

All the platform-independent solutions out there are paid or you have to own a Mac. It's absolutely annoying and a genuine problem. Like, hey, I would LOVE to code for you guys, but I have NO WAY of checking if some of this code is even going to run on your system.

**The wall of shame**  
The shittiest part is that Chrome for Safari (and any other browser for Safari) is basically running the [same engine as Safari](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2017/05/02/apples-dirty-little-secret-about-chrome/) (and Chrome manages to somehow be better than Safari itself). They can call it a security measure. I call it the ""wall of shame"". Apple is single-handedly destroying PWAs and the amazing growth they could see in the future - not to mention making cross-browser compatibility abysmal to implement in the process.

**Think different? Bullshit.**  
One could have fallen for this brilliant tagline back in 1984, but if Jobs was alive today, Safari wouldn't be. 

I don't know what we can do as a community, but boycotting Safari could be a start. Start off small. Show a tiny message to your Apple users (by detecting the User-Agent) that you will be dropping support for iOS soon along with a link to this post. We can't let companies dictate how W3C specifications should be implemented. They are standards for a reason and any company that does this to developers is not worth developing for.",2020-04-10 20:34:45

17mb17,Why does Microsoft even bother with Internet Explorer anymore?,"Seriously, it's so bad that it's now cliché to complain about it. They invented it to kill Netscape, and it could be argued that at one time they were able to pass a lot of traffic to MSN or other sites they owned, and pre-filling the bookmarks was probably more effective back then, too.

Now it's a giant headache and waste of time to development agencies of all sorts. And what does Microsoft actually gain from it? They have to pay to develop it, and they certainly pay to advertise it (which makes no sense), but where does the ROI kick in? 

You could argue browser data and minimal Bing traffic make IE worthwhile. However…

What if Microsoft acquired Opera (or struck up a deal), and could rely on their expertise in the mobile world and on gaming platforms? They could integrate it into the Windows environment as necessary, and they could still collect browser data and Bing traffic. Also, they would get street cred from the web dev world. And there was some recent talk about Facebook acquiring Opera. This would be a power play now on that level as well.

TL;DR – Microsoft probably loses money on Internet Explorer and should try to buy or partner with Opera, IMHO.",2013-01-31 07:54:33

1b5dc0s,What is Social skills in webdev?,"I'm a frontend developer and I want to make sure that my social skills are good enough. I heard that mostly it's about communication but, um, what we actually mean there?

We all can communicate at work (maybe?). Um. We all can talk? We all can talk about problem solving?

I mean, for me, social skills is about next situation:

- Recuirter: * giving me a task on tech interview *
- Me after 1 minute commenting all I do: Allright, now it's gonna work.*seeing error* No? Nevermind, I'll make you work

Or

-Recuirter: let's make this code a bit compact
- Me: okay so we sacrifice THIS... line moving it here...

Etc. Heh. But I can't really understand what means social skills if it's just about communication and not being ""boring worker-zombie"" who just won't be commenting nothing. The same situation is woth problem solving. It will be solved but not really fast when you just sit down and don't say nothing. I think it will be actually solved when you will combine positivity, communication and seriousness to solve the problem",2024-03-03 09:37:30
19e57tz,How much would you estimate it would cost to start and maintain a Twitch-like Live Streaming site and why is Twitch not currently profitable?,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this question, but instead of tearing my hair out trying to research something I have no idea how to research, I figured I'd just ask you all.

Let's say I wanted to start my own Twitch. Just considering the costs of web services, servers and hosting, not marketing or staffing, how much would that cost to run? Let's say I want to be able to support at least 100 live streams the first day and then scale from there. Not asking for a concrete number, just whatever you could ballpark.

Sorry if this is a crazy question. I'm asking because a very delusional person keeps approaching me to be an ""ambassador"" for their dead-in-the-water Twitch competitor. Everything about the proposal is delusional and the person is clearly not capable of achieving anything they are proposing but somehow got their friends to give them $15,000 to begin. Per their own accounting they have what seems to be a non-functional streaming site and only $300 left of the initial investment.

So, I know the person is delusional. I'm just curious how the math maths and *how* delusional they really are and what it would really take to get this project off the ground.

Edit:

Some additional details for those of you curious about how bad this project is lol

\- they've already spent the $15000, most of it going to outside developers since they have no skills themself. The site does not appear to work and I don't believe anyone streams there or ever has.

\- they claim to only take 2-5% of stream donations and offered me 2% which I know is not a viable business plan for them. Especially since that's 2% of nothing lol ",2024-01-24 01:39:18

15fjixy,To those against tailwind: How do you choose and apply uniform style across app?,"I'm torn between using Tailwind or not. On one hand it provides good defaults for typography, spacing, colors, layouts and similar, but on the other hand it is another controversial abstraction which can prevent devs from learning CSS. There are also other pros and cons but I am more inclined towards some other solution than TW, but I am afraid I will fall into a trap of using just a bit worse, possibly partially handwritten version of TW.

The question I have is: If you don't use Tailwind, what do you use to stay consistent and how do you do it (e.g. via css variables, scss variables and mixins)?

Do you use your in-house handcrafted design system, a 3rd party design system tailored for your use case or some generators for tokens? How do you for example determine and use the visual scale? For colors and typography I found things like https://typescale.com/, https://realtimecolors.com and https://uicolors.app/create?ref=producthunt, but what about a size scale, layout, grids etc. What tech do you use, [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/)?

w08ric,I understand why everyone does not make tech start-ups now - New Years Resolution - Dev Log 36,"I have had a proper 9-5 job for 3 weeks now. I now understand why most developers do not try to create tech start-ups all the time. After 8 hours of staring at a screen, I do feel that it is more difficult than before to get into the proper flow of things. With that on the table, I am still coding routinely and remember why my UI's are usually simple. Creating awesome animations and beautiful UI's on all screen sizes is difficult. Now that I have iterated twice over my website's home page UI, I am making the decision to dumb it down and make it simple like my last project. A simple UI done well looks better than a complex one done poorly any day of the week. I am particularly excited that I have outsourced my Hero image to Fivver. This time round no holds are barred. I will use a professionally made image instead one I found on Google.

I also have a cool CSS trick I found to report. When creating the header for the third time, I decided to implement a hamburger menu. I rendered this under the section that had the rest of the header in the DOM. The problem was that when the menu would slide out it would go over the top of the hero section but not the header (because in the HTML it was rendered second). I figured that if I just slapped a z-index on it then that would solve my issue. It did not. So before I rearranged the HTML (JSX in this case), I decided to solve another issue with the slide-out menu. I needed to remove it from the document object flow in order to not have the rest of the site rendered under it. The menu having a height of 100vh obviously needs to have stuff under it. So I made the position absolute and the hero appeared where it should. But then I thought to just add a ""top"" property to the slide out to cover the header; that way I do not have to bother with the HTML. I found a cool trick, if you add a ""top"" value of 0px, for some reason it renders the menu over everything else, even the header that is technically above it in the DOM.

Just thought I would share that trick. So I am gonna get back to the grind. Sorry for the terrible blog schedule. Got a lot on my plate right now. Honestly, I still love the idea of the project so I still am not willing to share it.",2022-07-16 05:11:19

keep in my mind that U have never done this before but i'm starting from scratch. Do i have a few questions: 

1) From what i understand, decentralized apps are built on top of the blockchain, so instead of of having a centralized server that contains all the data, it's more like a p2p network. Is this more secure thana centralized app? and why? and what makes a choice more viable than the other?

2) since dApp are built on top of the blockchain, i believe they use gaz fees for each transaction a user performs. So that means each operation would be costing the user ""money"" (cryptocoin). is that correct? if so what makes it appealing from a user pov to use such app?

3) let's say i want to transmit sensitive data ( medical files, social security number, photos,..). Are dApp really the best in terms of security? Can't i do the dame thing with a normal web 2.0 app or it does have some deficencies.

4) what's a good use case for blockchain? is it only worth it in case of holding and exchanging crypto money?",2024-01-06 15:35:48

CONTRACTOR - $2,800 dollars.

CLIENT – That’s too expensive for this job!
CONTRACTOR – How much do you think it should cost?

CLIENT – $800 max! It’s a simple job!
CONTRACTOR – I can’t do the job for so little.

CLIENT – People in your line of work wants to make a huge profit!
CONTRACTOR – I’m sorry you feel this way. Why don’t you do the job?

CLIENT – But, but, I don’t know how to do any of that.
CONTRACTOR – For $900, I can teach you everything you need to know to do the job. You can then use $800 to do the job, and you’re still saving $1,100. Also, you will obtain all the knowledge and the experience for the next time you need to do this job.

CLIENT – Deal!
CONTRACTOR – Great! To start, you need to buy tools. You will need a chipping hammer, a nail gun, a laser, a drill, a mixer machine, PPE, and some other things.

CLIENT – But, I don’t have any of those tools and I can’t buy all that for just one job!
CONTRACTOR – Ok. I can rent you my tools for another $300. You’re still saving $800.

CLIENT – That’s cutting my savings, but I will rent your tools.
CONTRACTOR – Perfect! I’ll be back Saturday and we can start.

CLIENT – Wait! I can’t Saturday. I only have time today.
CONTRACTOR – I’m sorry, I only teach others on Saturdays. I have to prioritize my time and my tools needs to be in other jobs I have during the week.

CLIENT – Ok then. I will sacrifice my family’s plans on Saturday.
CONTRACTOR – Right, me too! Oh, I forgot. If you’re going to do the job yourself, you need to buy the materials. There’s a high demand nowadays, so your best bet is to get a truck and be at the hardware store by 6am before other contractors get there.

CLIENT – AT SIX IN THE MORNING? On Saturday? That’s too early for me. I don’t even have a truck!
CONTRACTOR – I guess you’ll have to rent one. By the way, do you have some helpers to help you load the truck?

CLIENT – You know what? I’ve been thinking. Probably is better for you to do the job. It’s better to pay you to do the job right and not having to go through all that hassle and mess.
CONTRACTOR – Good thinking. Sign here and let me get to work.

This is the truth. 

People are not just paying for a job, they are paying for knowledge, experience, tools, time, family sacrifices, and other things you bring to the table.

srn0hi,Offered a front-end dev job but I fear I have imposter syndrome.,"Hi, my name is Connie and I'm 34 years old. I have a bachelor's degree in film. I've been working full time as a marketing web developer at the same company (big law) for almost 6 years. I get paid $84k/yr plus benefits and work a hybrid-remote schedule. My work-life balance is good but I feel like I'm done learning in this position. The company I work for is great and they appreciate my work. I enjoy my work and the stability of my job, but I'm feeling bored with big law and stagnant in my career growth.

I'm not actively seeking a new job, but a recruiter reached out to me and I interview and got a job offer on Friday. It's a contract-with-right-to-hire position where I would be a W2 employee of the tech staffing firm but working for their client, which is a HUGE healthcare company. After the 6-month contract is up, the goal is for the client to hire me as an employee.

The job is for a front-end chatbot developer, 100% remote. This is something I like and am confident in my front-end skills, but I think I might be jumping in over my head. I know chatbot back-end dev uses AI and ML and languages I'm not fluent in (ie. Python).

The interview process was just one 45-minute call with 3 people on their team (2 devs) and then they offered me the job the next day. In the interview, we didn't really get into the nitty-gritty of the job details, but they must've liked my (generic) answers and my personality I suppose. They did not even ask to see my work portfolio. This makes me think they rushed the decision to offer me the job without even really grilling me on my skills. Perhaps they either are desperate or just don't know wtf they're trying to hire for (maybe disorganized). The position pays $60/hr which is about $62k over the length of the 6-month contract. If they hire me after it ends, it would $130k salary. There are no benefits during the contract.

I need to let them know my decision by 5pm tomorrow. I'm excited at the increase in pay, but also nervous about being underqualified for the tasks at hand, and also nervous about the contract agreement and possibly being unemployed after it ends. I also feel loyal to my current job/team and I'd be sacrificing the job stability and work-life balance.

I would love to hear advice/input, and possibly clarification from front-end devs who work in tech, big law, and healthcare that may have been in a similar contract-to-hire situation before. And anyone with chatbot/AI/ML dev experience. Are there any red flags I should consider? Am I just being a pussy because I fear change? Do I have imposter syndrome? Am I crazy to turn down this potential 50% raise? Should I challenge myself and take the job, even if I soon find out I have a lot to learn?",2022-02-13 16:51:44
s6czap,Student - Would you rather work in the EU vs US? where should I go?,"I'm going to be graduating in Canada and can maybe move to either country after I gain 2 YOE (maybe even now? but I don't think that's likely for entry levels). I do not see a future in Canada due to our own problems.

Reasons why I want to move to U.S:

1. Pay is much more than in Canada
2. No language barrier and I can easily integrate to it's society since I was raised in Canada

Reasons why I do not want to move to US:

1. I do not like how they treat their own citizens, worker rights are constantly being exploited
2. I don't like the politial aspects/culture  &  systematic racism  in the states (ranging from how both parties  that does not advocate for the working class; ACAB;  facist groups existing and rising in popularity). I feel unsafe as someone who is not caucasian.

&#x200B;

Reasons why I want to to EU (social democratic EU countries to be particular):

1. Worker rights are known to be better, especially in scandaniavna countries. From a quick glance I  feel much safer due to existing saety nets, retiring there, etc.

Reasons why I do not want to move to EU:

1. I can see myself having a hard time integrating into their society since I do not speak their languange; making friends will be challenging.
2. Pay is much lower, can be a problem retiring?
3. I am unware of their politics and specific problems.

no28ag,12 tools I use for building websites without writing code,"Hey redditors,
I'm a nocode developer and I wanted to share these gems that I use almost everyday to build interactive websites and web-apps!


# [Photopea](http://photopea.com/)

Photoshop for free and on the web. I'm actually subscribed to Photoshop CC but its super slow and laggy on my computer so I often end up opening a tab and just use photopea instead. A super handy tool especially if you ever want to quickly edit a picture and don't want to open Photoshop (and wait 1min for it to open).

# [Sktch.io](http://sktch.io/)

You may have heard of Webflow and [Bubble.io](http://bubble.io/), I've been using them in the past, but recently started using [Sktch.io](http://sktch.io/) as my main website builder. The great thing about it is that in addition to the frontend features I was used to with Webflow/Bubble, it provides much more in terms of backend and frontend interactions. I can't count how many times, I would start a project with Webflow and end-up hiring a developer to add a simple feature. With sktch, I can develop those features with a modular/visual system directly in the editor.

# [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

These fonts are free for commercial use and they are web-ready. Many platforms support them natively, but whenever I am trying to find a font for a specific title or website I'm creating, I head to [fonts.google.com](http://fonts.google.com/), increase the font size and start filtering the fonts to find the perfect one for my use-case.You can also download the fonts in TTF formats (by going to the project's Github) if you want to use them locally in Photoshop/Illustrator for example.

# [Github](https://github.com/)

Versioning and backups are important, I use Github to keep track of the changes I make in a project. The Git system is not ideal for binary files such as images but as long as the project is not too big, it gets the job done.

# [Flat ui colors](https://flatuicolors.com/)

You probably use a different palette tool, but this one is my personal favorite. A few colors available in a few ""styles"". Simple and effective. I hate going through color palette tools that overwhelm me with options.

# [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)

Page load speed is super important for SEO and for user-experience. Google PageSpeed Insights is a great tool for finding bottlenecks in your website, maybe an image you are using is too large and you could save a few KB by choosing a more appropriate size, or maybe your text doesn't have enough contrast which lowers it accessibility.PageSpeed is a great tool for detecting these common mistakes and thus improving UX.

# [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com)

My mailing list service of choice. It's very easy to link Mailchimp with [Sktch.io](http://sktch.io/) and use tags when people subscribe to your website.Mailchimp also has great automation tools allowing you to create a cool onboarding experience for your users/subscribers.

# [Zapier](https://zapier.com)

To be honest, I haven't use Zapier extensively so far, but it is an automation tool that you can use to run tasks. You can use Zapier to detect events happening in an app to trigger actions on a different app for example. Zapier is a great tool for linking different services together and build a ""backend"" for your website/service.

# [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) / [Behance](https://behance.net)

When doing creative work, it's of course important to find inspiration and these tools are great for that. In addition you can showcase your work there and build a portfolio which is great for getting clients!

# [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)

While Dribbble and Behance are great for getting inspiration in terms of design/ui/ux, ProductHunt is great for finding project ideas. It's also a great tool to see what ideas end up working (getting traction) and those that don't.

# [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

A popular icon pack distributed as a font. Very handy as you don't have to juggle with hundreds of svg files (it helps with page loading as well to pack everything in a single file). Of course these icons are not the fanciest, they are single-tone (dual-tone is available for PRO users) so it's mostly useful for small icons used for ui stuff.

# [Flat Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/)

A huge collection of icons (free & premium) of various styles that will meet your needs. Attribution is required unless you subscribe to the premium version. Make sure to read their FAQ for knowing how you can use the icons.

8q9amc,Place your bets on how long React.js stays at the top of front-end frameworks,"Would be interesting to hear what everyone thinks and why. I bet the skeptics will say 1\-2 years and then Vue overtakes it or Angular rebounds unexpectedly. ""OMG start of a new paradigm"" optimists might say 10 years (just guessing). I'll be in the middle and say.... 4 more years, putting it at 5\-6 total. That takes us to 2022.

My reasoning: sure things are changing fast, but the counterweights like compatibility etc are still there. And with most of the web still being statically served I think the wow factor of React has another year or 2 of shininess, followed by slow descent due to high adoption. IMO of course.

How long did Rails dominate? I think it made a splash around 2012 or so?

75vseu,Why is PHP still the biggest language in webdev?,"Because WordPress exists. Because Magento works. Because Phpbb is still popular. Because MediaWiki runs one of the largest websites in the world.

PHP is still overwhelmingly dominant because it's not a programming language that can *do* web, it's a programming language *for* web.

Does it have flaws? Yes, many. It also has more flexibility than almost any other language that I've ever encountered. Want to use OO? Go for it. Procedural more your style? It's all good. Want to do functional programming? Sure thing! Want to mix them together, using each for its own strengths? Go for it.

This flexibility is seen as a flaw by some. People who desire strict languages, and One True Way shun such flexibility, as it's not ""Enterprise"". That's fine. PHP don't care. You do you, and if you want to code strict in PHP, it's fairly easy to achieve.

Between composer, phpunit, frameworks like Symfony or Laravel, PHPCS, and many more, PHP's tooling is very strong. It's not without quirks, but PHP is a powerful, modern language that has earned its place.

If you can't write secure, portable, clean PHP, that's a problem with *you*, not the language.

gdt1j1,"Wish me luck, I'm putting all my eggs into web development","I've always listened to others when it came to getting shamed about my interests. I did an entire degree in health sciences, just because I was scared that people would think I was doing nothing with my life and was a loser, but I HATED my program since the first year. I stayed and finished my degree just out of fear of speaking up.

So I graduated with this degree I didn't want, in a field I hated, and then as I started coming into myself I discovered computer science. I wanted to become a web developer and take an associate's degree with co-op, but I was always insecure about what others would think of me and how my sisters with high positions and high paying jobs would shame or judge me for it. Same with family and the people around me.

So what did I do? I took a second degree in computer science, and I've spent a year in it so far. Doing the degree allowed me to say ""oh I'm doing something general, so I'm not closing doors for myself. Maybe IF some day I wanted to work for google I could! yada yada yada"". I loved the courses where I was applying techniques, but I HATED the theory courses (most of them) where it felt like I wasn't getting anywhere and where I was learning arbitrary information that MAY or may not be useful 10 years down the line. For me, I'll learn it when I need to learn it. That way, it's actually going to use.

I was learning nothing about web-development and was getting nowhere with regards to my skills. So this year, I decide to say fuck it, and while I still have a bit of a safety net left, to put my foot down and go all in on this co-op associate's degree in web development. Will I ever work for the big companies like Google? I never wanted to because it's not how I function. Will I work for some big company that filters out with a bachelor's degree? Nope. But, I know that I will be successful in this field because I will put in the work, and even with an associate's degree, I will find a way to make more than six figures, while doing what I'm good at. Ultimately, it's about if I want it bad enough and if I'm passionate about it. It's one of those things that I'm so sure about and it just makes sense, as in ""why didn't I do this from the first place, it was the only option from the start"", but I shyed away from it.

So anyways, I'm going in full-force and joining you guys, wish me the best of luck. I know it won't be easy but I'm sure it'll be rewarding.",2020-05-05 07:12:43

1e6fb2,I'm TIRED of writing HTML code.,"I enjoy programming, I really do, but what I really dislike is having to write all those <input> and <textarea> and <div>s and <span>s. What's worse is how hard it is simply to get things to align in a 2 or 3 column layout. 

I recently had a chance to use the Struts framework for Java. To show a contact form with a first name, last name, and email textbox in Struts, all you write is:

    <s:form action=""someUrl"">
       <s:textfield name=""firstName"" label=""First Name"" />
       <s:textfield name=""lastName"" label=""Last Name"" />
       <s:textfield name=""email"" label=""email"" />
    </s:form>

And that's it, this is converted into a full blown <table> with <tr>s for all the fields, automatically generating labels and assigning all the ids and other attributes (theres themes available for CSS layouts too). And it even automatically displays any form validation errors that you return from the Controller!


Is there no such thing available for PHP or Javascript that lets you describe your form/layout in simple XML and then generates all the HTML / CSS needed to accomplish what you wanted to display?

eort68,Unpopular opinion: More people should use raw Javascript instead of frameworks,"I've been writing in JavaScript for several years now and in my first job I wasn't even allowed to use libraries other than occasional jQuery for front-end work. Most of the work I was doing at that time was websites with sliders, carousels, parallax, and other retail display-features. We also had a video player portal. All of that was written in JavaScript without the use of frameworks because, at the time, major frameworks were not ubiquitous.

Now I write more complex ""web applications"" that require a lot more legwork; but I can't help but think that a lot of these applications would be 10x more simple written in JavaScript instead of React or Angular. There's definitely use cases for frameworks, especially when you're talking about very complex web applications that need a lot of state management and on-the-fly updates using virtual DOMs or the like. 

But a majority? Especially in the B2B sector? I hate frameworks. I \*hate\* them. The weird syntax that changes from framework to framework, the complex state management, and the evolving JavaScript landscape just makes front-end development such a pain to keep up with. I know it's necessary sometimes, but I really think people need to learn better when they'd be better off just writing something in JavaScript really fast vs. going all out with a framework or library-fest and spending hours on just setting the environment up.",2020-01-14 21:27:18

qlms92,Want a raise ? do this.,"Hey folks,

I’ve successfully negotiated raises (+35% increase) and starting salary (about +20% increase from base), here is how I did it.

First of all, I just want to say, to do this, you have to be good at what you do. It likely won’t work if you ask for a raise and not have things to back it up. It has to be justified.

>**That said, perception is everything.**

You need to be the person that your boss “thinks“ is doing the most work, and adding the most value or is of high value. **How do you do that ?**

Keep them updated and posted on your achievements, and things you are doing at and outside of work. It is simple as that.

>**Disclaimer:** All this is YMMV, This isn’t a fool proof plan to get raise or higher salary. It depends on your abilities and how well you can negotiate too. Sometimes it might just be bad timing. However, I think if you do most of this you are half way there.

Raise

* **You went to a conference to network and learn new things**  
\- Sync up with your boss and give them a summary
* **Start sending out monthly summaries to your boss**  
\- what you are achieving  
\- highlight anything you shipped  
\- documented something that help another team  
\- finished a course outside of work  
\- Did X hours of Y technology training  
\- Have code on github of prototype project of a new technology, write it down or jump on a call to give a summary to your boss and your peers  
\- Improve X metrics, save Y costs etc.  
\- Speed up build times, or improve workflows, and add new tool and providing training to everyone  
\- Also, make sure all you colleagues knows about your progress too (so, if your boss ask your colleagues about your performance, they can give a good answer other than ”I don’t know“)
* **Send out year end reports**\- You know that monthly report I said to do, now summarize everything into a year end  
\- I am sure you will have A LOT of things  
\- Ask for a “meeting“ to discuss how your year went, go over the report with your boss and highlight all the great things you are doing at and outside of work
* **Ask for the raise**  
\- After you done all of this, they would be pressured to give you a raise because you literally put everything on paper (It’s in a report)  
\- Imagine saying NO to someone who did all this work to prime for their negotiation (ITS DIFFICULT)

Like I mentioned, you have to back it up. This works best if you have things to show for rather than mediocre stuff but then again, it might still work! Give it a try.

The key is being your boss’s top of mind often. How often do you actually think about other people ? You are probably mostly thinking about yourself.

Same goes for your boss, they are probably thinking about themselves day-to-day. So, you need to keep reminding them.

Salary Negotiation

This is trickier because it depends on a lot of other things like location, market and the competition when applying to the job. However, I think it works in a similar way.

When you are negotiating, and HR is trying to push back by giving you the X is the best we can do (even though it isn’t even close to market rate). You need to provide them with data (market salary etc) and a report of things you are doing that differentiates you from everyone else.

* Finished 2 courses on X technology
* Here are all the other responsibilities and achievements in my previous roles relevant to the job (if you didn’t highlight in your resume)
* Built few projects using relevant technologies here are the links to it (Make sure it is polished)
* so far... similar thing, add other things you feel are relevant that you think would help the HR person understand you that much better than other people they are evaluating

So, there you have it. Those are my tips.

1aymd7b,Should I switch from Ubuntu to Windows for coding?,"I've been using Ubuntu for a long time and I like it for the most part

There are two things I don't, though:

\- Incompatibility with some software, eg photoshop, video editing software and things like that. This is slightly annoying but it is not a big deal

\- Performance. I was getting some performance problems with my previous laptop. I got a more powerful one. I should not be having performance issues, I think. As soon as I open 3 VSCode instances, things begin to go south. The laptop will eventually crash and I need to hard restart it. When I run memory intensive processes such as stable diffusion, the computer also slows down to a crawl. So I think it might be RAM issues, or something misconfigured, or small SWAP. In any case, I don't see how 3 instances of VSCode, or sometimes 2, (I trimmed the extensions I used as much as possible) should crash a decently powerful computer.

I have a dual boot, the other OS being Windows. I have not ever seen any performance problems on Windows (for example, used Stable Diffusion and does not slow down like in Ubuntu)

So, I am considering simply switching to Windows, rather than trying to solve the issue in Ubuntu, since I estimate that on Windows there will be no problem to being with, and I honestly prefer not to bother if I have the option.

I've heard Arch recommended too as Ubuntu ""is bloated""

I've never tried to code on Windows. I'd appreciate opinions on whether the switch to Windows is a good idea, seamless, or annoying and not worth it

Thank you in advance for everyone who gives a helpful answer

EDIT: the underlying issue was insufficient RAM. I upped my RAM from 16GB to 32GB and the low performance is gone. I didn't change OS",2024-02-24 05:11:13

However, it can be quite confusing for beginners working with React for the first time. 

I’ve shared my software engineering experience. what React Hooks are, the various kinds of hooks available in React, and when and how to use them. 

I covered everything you need to know about React Hooks in this easy-to-follow guide. 

Starting with basics like useState and useEffect, I'll walk you through useMemo and useCallback, show you how to manage states with useReducer, and guide you through creating your own hooks. 

Plus, I'll share tips on avoiding common mistakes. Great for beginners looking to up their React game!

t7epll,Is web dev a dying job?,"So I’m a student and almost finished my education where I learned to code. So I’m pretty new to everything and still learning so much but sometimes I’m scared for the future of my job. 

For example I just learned three.js and find it so much fun to work with. I made an application where a user can manipulate a 3D object with drag and drop and different parameters. I’m really proud what I made. But after doing a google search if found out there is a program called Verge3d  where you can do the same things only with blender and you don’t have to even write a single line of code because they work with something called puzzels. I was really impressed and realised that if I used it first i would probably spend less time on it then then I have using three.js  

So now I’m a bit confused and to be honest I little scared I will become absolute in the future. Because these kind of programs will be more common and easier to use in the future. Now almost everybody can be a coder and make things without even knowing a coding language. 

So I was wondering what are you guys thoughts on this? Will this be the future or are these kinds of programs to limiting to be actually used on every day jobs? Or will we just be needed in different ways now?

-your job security is even far less than other professions, why? Because the technology of today will be useless tomorrow


-No training. I mean seriously? No training? They expect you to just know all this stuff right from the jump. No wonder they usually want senior developers these days.

Now I am using AngularJS and it is a breeze of fresh air. I am connecting it to WEB API and it takes 40 seconds to hit a debug point. So it is always one thing or another with MS.

But one of the things that I like though is Entity Framework and its integration with SQL Server. 

C# in general is also quite powerful tool for business apps, but I guess there are other languages that do common tasks. 

But when I google things like ""node.js mysql"" and I find [following examples](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5818312/mysql-with-node-js):

>var query = connection.query('INSERT INTO posts SET ?', post, function(err, result) {

it is quite disappointing when I compared to neat LINQ code.

It's essentially mapping a network drive to your FTP server, so it will appear in Windows Explorer as a Network Location. To access your website, you'd just open it in Explorer like any other drive or directory, rather than launching an FTP client and logging in. 

1. Open 'Computer'/'My Computer'/Windows Explorer (then select Computer)... however you want to get there.

2. In the toolbar, click 'Map Network Drive.'

3. In the 'Map Network Drive' window, click 'Connect to a Web Site that you can use to store your documents and pictures.' It looks like a link, not a button.

4. When the 'Add Network Location' wizard window opens, click Next.

5. Select 'Choose a custom network location', and click Next.

6. Enter your FTP server address. (start with ""ftp://"" without quotes, followed by the server address.) Then click Next.

7. On the next screen, un-check 'Log on anonymously' and enter your FTP username in the textbox. Click Next.

8. Enter a name for this network location. An example is yoursitename.com. Click Next.

9. Make sure the 'Open this network location when I click Finish' box is checked, and click the Finish button.

10. It may take several seconds to connect, where you will be prompted for your FTP password. Enter your password, and if you wish you can select the 'Save Password' option to log you in automatically. Do not save your password if you are on a public computer or if others have access to your computer.

You will now be able to access your website through Windows Explorer. It should appear below your hard drives and optical drives. Double-clicking it will open it, where you can drag and drop files to and from your computer.

I realize most FTP clients support drag-and-drop, but for simplicity you can't beat Windows Explorer. I'm not saying it's a permanent replacement for a good FTP client, but for simple uploading and downloading it works very well.",2012-08-13 00:40:06

I've been diving into web development progressively both in personal time and professional time to switch from simple webmaster to webdeveloper.

Javascript is still a weird beast and frankly some things I find blatantly stupid, but the power it provides to create interesting or fun interfaces make me bear with it without too much pain. 

But CSS? FRIGGING HORRYGING ILLOGICAL CSS OF MY BA\*\*\*?

I've been struggling with a simple objective of ""design a card game for prototyping a system of mine"" and just having illustration and surrounding box behave like I want is driving me nuts. Like, ""buy some weapon and bash people's head that dare pretend this was a good idea to design this as a flow"" nuts.

18yn6s2,WP Engine's Local on MacOS is complete trash,"Hi all,

A little rant here about WP Engine's Local on MacOS. Same thing kinda goes for MAMP honestly.

So in any case, developing a website or migrating a website temporarily locally to get some work done on an airplane for example either works EXTREMELY slow IF AT ALL with WordPress

Yesterday I moved a webshop locally so I could write to the database faster. My old shared hosting didn't even allow me to upload a new database file because it took too much memory or something. Now I have to give Local a thumbs up for this, because for specifically that it worked.

However, connecting languages using WPML didn't work. It just hangs. At the same time, simply going to the ""plugins"" takes 4 second to load locally. Online, with the exact same website it takes 0.5 seconds. Why?

And why is it needed to change php.ini files and wpconfig.php files is needed trying to upscale memory limits that are so low that nothing works. And they don't even work? It simply doesn't work. And I've done this a shit ton of times online, but Local seems to have an own forced setting that you cannot change on the front-end.

Can someone tell me why does software like this exists AT ALL if it works so bad?

I work on a $5000 MacBook Pro M1 Max (64GB). How is it possible that software runs THAT bad on it. Really? Things should always run faster local logically.

With MAMP it was even worse. It completely shut me off my locally developed website that was a week in the making. It just decided to not running it anymore at all for no reason. One night working on it, next day MAMP decided not to start the server.

I need to upload my websites online to get stuff done. Isn't that the entire point of software like this? So that you don't have to do that online if you're unable to?

Can anyone explain me why this software even exists in such a shitty shape?

1842vsv,What is your Medusa.js opinion? Do you even know it?,"Hey everyone,

I recently came across an e-commerce solution called Medusa.js. I searched a bit for people's opinions about it on the Internet and the results are.... unexpected?

tl;dr: The package had a very fast growth in popularity and yet no one talks about it, why?

Let's summary:

First of all, Medusa in about 4 years, has reached a 20k stars on Github, beating almost 3x the competition such as Sylius or PrestaShop. Heck, it even beat the old-man WordPress by 2k stars.

https://preview.redd.it/p1vxgyorgm2c1.jpg?width=1094&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf61ef8a25fa95f7f3f387dbf7fc68839fb4c0ed

Wort to note, that Medusa won as e-commerce product of the year 2022 on ProductHunt, that might explain that boom near 2022, but it still looks way different than typical growth and it keeps going up for some reason since then.

Looking at such GitHub popularity, I expected to find a lot of discussion about it, but it is quite different. It's hard to find posts on this topic that don't look like they were written by a non-technical copywriter for SEO. Most discussions look like marketing fake posts to promote it. There's not much tutorials about it. Basically this name doesn't appear in posts like ""what do you recommend for an online store"".

Am I missing something? Why is it so quiet about it? From where did so many people hear about it?

Have any of you used this solution in a real project? What is your experience?

I notice this due to years of taking care of and living alongside my old grandparents. There are a few nursing centers scattered here and there in the city, but not a professional platform to empower independent caregivers to provide care to the elderly in the comfort of their homes.

Children ultimately bear the burden of taking care of their parents. There's still social pressure against sending old parents to nursing home and older people have not completely trusted and liked being sent to nursing homes.

Therefore, I'm thinking of building a website, similar to Upwork for Freelancer or Airbnb for travellers, but for independent caregivers to connect with people who look to share the burden of taking care of their elderly parents.

163piu,Domain Squatting ?!?!,"Has anyone been ranting about domain squatting these days?  I certainly am.

Two of my domains were taken from me because I was a week or two late on payments and didn't have my setting configured to allow ""auto renew"" to my account.  I simply don't like that, and it was OK because they used to send me a mail when the domain(s) are about to expire... they used to.  Suddenly they decided to stop sending the notification mails, urging everyone to be on ""auto renew"" (a.k.a take my money without me knowing it), and coincidentally it serves a great $purpose$ to someone that I didn't renew.

After this they started telling me that I would have to pay over $300 to get the domains back in addition to my regular annual fees.  What?  When did this start?  I've been registering domains for over 10 years and I haven't had this problem.  

They told me that ""so and so"" takes the domain out of their hands when it expires and that the fees I would be paying go to them, not the registrar, and so it is out of their hands, but ""so and so"" organization will release the domains to the public again after a month and I can take the risk of waiting for it to go public and register it again.  So why do I have to pay over $175 per domain to get them back now?  What labor is being done for this charge?  What crime did I commit to deserve this ""fine""?  Isn't this the meaning of [""extortion""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion) ?

Well, I didn't want to pay these criminals and so I waited for the domains to go free again, and then I didn't have a chance to register them again because they were immediately bought up by a domain squatting organization.   

One of them went free actually, and the other got taken.  Mind you the only reason the one that got taken had any value to it was because I had been working its popularity up for almost 10 years.

OK, fine.  I don't care, I can live without those domains anyway.  But when I start looking for other domains that I am interested in they are all totally sucked up by these services.  It seems like every, and any, available domain is taken by a domain squatter with price tags like $2000 to buy, and doing nothing otherwise but showing advertisements.

I am deeply irritate by this.

This should be illegal.  It is the most blatant example of a ""monopoly"" which I thought was supposed to be outlawed since long ago, is it not?  And the process was complete and utter extortion.

There should at least be a price roof on these things.  What if I went and bought every business address in your home town and said to all of your business people:  ""Oh!  Want to run a business here?  No problem, just buy this address for 4 billion dollars! and then pay rent on top of it.""  That is essentially the equivalent of what they are doing.  It is totally corrupt, twisted, and a slimy scumbag way to get money out of people.

Does anyone here have similar experience, or advice, or further knowledge on this topic?  I can not see domain names going out of technological need any time soon, and I can not see this continuing to be legal for the duration.  I am eager to accelerate the process of raising a petition against this.

**EDIT:** Please note that I seriously don't care about losing my domains, it's the ethics of the situation.  Nobody seems to be getting this.  I guess I need to add one of these:

**tl;dr** It is getting nearly impossible to register a domain name these days, even a random strange name, because these ""domain squatters"" are buying them all up hoping that they can charge you thousands of dollars to buy it from them.  And they steal every domain they can every chance they get.

From middle school I have ever used Windows as OS and from high school as secondary linux Debian/Ubuntu (and much more in the lasts years with WSL) 

At work I used a very bit mac machines.

I'm not a fan boy but to be honest i have seen a new macbook air m2 and literally fell in love with for the keyboard, the screen and the chassis.

I use google suite for the most and I have an android device, I have also tried an iphone, and for me really not change a lot for me using one or another if you think is better to go all in the Apple's ecosystem.
As tablet i currently using an iPad.
I have a PlayStation for gaming.

I'm currently using an hp 14"" machine 6 years old with some upgrades during the years.

Do you think switching to a macbook air m2 can be a good choice to move on?

I'm bit afraid of the fact there's not bootcamp anymore. But in the company we have a lot of mac with paralalles that working fine.

My worries are also software related, virtualizing machine Windows or Linux for some simple testing running good? And I have only some software that are not mac specific, one of those are a vpn sofrware, some one have some experience of this kind? Can works well via crossover or paralles?

 There's some advice or suggestion to know?

uevt7k,The FASTEST Way To Know If Coding Is For You,"Hey all, I’m a self taught developer who started coding over two years ago and am currently working as a full stack dev. Learning how to code can be a daunting endeavor, and I know when I started I was worried if I was even going to enjoy doing it as a job in the future. So how should you go about determining if it’s a good fit for you? Well, here’s the step-by-step of how I did it. I should stress that this process will help you determine if you enjoy coding, not whether you are good at it or not. Everyone has to start somewhere, and it’s rarely a smooth ride.

&#x200B;

1. Pick a project you’re excited aboutThe first step to knowing if you enjoy doing something is to simply **do it**. You can do all the research in the world about coding and will still **not** know if you like the act of doing it. Don’t over analyze; just get started. For this step, you should come up with an idea for a project focused around something else you enjoy, like a hobby. If you can find a friend to build and learn with you, then that’s a bonus.
2. Determine the tech requiredOnce you’ve decided on a project, you need to know what skills to learn in order to build it. I suggest keeping it simple. If you want to build a web app/website, pick HTML, CSS, and JS; if you want to build a bot, pick python; etc. The point of this step is to do research on what simple concepts you need to learn in order to build the project. I chose to build a twitch bot (gamer here) that only required knowledge of NodeJS to build. Start simple!
3. The learn as you go methodNow that you have a general idea of what you need to build this project, start learning! I suggest choosing a few short courses on youtube that will give you the basic skills required for the languages you selected in the previous step. The idea is to learn the basics and then build your project. Limit yourself to 1 or 2 courses so as to not fall into the infamous ‘Tutorial Hell’. It is likely you will have to go back and forth between learning new skills and building the project. Don’t be afraid to google stuff! I’ve been coding for more than two years and still google things all the time. *It's normal!* This is the longest step and will require some grit. Don’t give up; it took me multiple learning cycles to produce my final project.
4. How’d it go?Once you finish the basic version of your project you can start to debrief. Did you enjoy building the project? Did you enjoy learning how to build it? Did you enjoy the critical thinking required to build the project? Are you excited to build the next project? Answering these questions will give you a good idea on how you feel about continuing down the path of development.

Following these steps is a sure way to know if you will enjoy coding. Then you can start to think more about whether or not getting a job in development is for you.

dmcwy0,How to build a team with no money?,"I have the same issue that a million other aspiring entrepreneurs have: how to get a great team with no capital. 

I'm a web dev and I work full time or a small consortium of businesses ran by the same owner. It's the perfect job really. I get lots of different projects and experience. The issue? I only make 40k a year. 

I like my job but I need more money. The advantage here is that my boss is highly involved in the burgeoning cannabis industry. Watching our businesses I've learned a thing or two about how to get money rolling in. I've also learned that it can take a crack team to do it. 

In my little group we have a web guy (me), a graphic designer, and a marketing guy.  And if I had that team with even half of their skill I'd be able to start a side business selling e-commerce to small shops on the side. The issue, I don't have such a team, and no money to pay them. A loan is too big a risk for what I want to be a part time gig (at least at the beginning). 

I'd be more than happy to offer profit sharing for anyone on board and I already have a sales guy (also form my work, he's in charge of sales) who's ready to go. I just can't figure out how to get a start-up going without a huge investment. I'm also aware of how naive that last statement sounds, but for what the whole thing is supposed to be it shouldn't take that much money. It's not like we're talking about starting Google here. 

If there's anyone who has any suggestions on Meetups, websites or resources to help get the wheels in motion I'd be very grateful.",2019-10-24 07:26:00

I know this doesn't need to be said here of all places, but if your project is being built with technology that was cutting edge 6 months ago then there's a good chance parts of it are already out dated. This field we've all committed ourselves to moves a breakneck speed and we all try and stay on our toes using various methods. For me, I've got a well equipped, albeit bloated, RSS feed and I visit r/webdev most days to see what the people think are important. But lately, there seems to be an increasing number of people just posting questions about very beginner topics - currently ""where can I practice my php?"" Sits at number 3 and a search for 'newbie' yield plenty of resent results. I'm also a little tired of people asking what technology they should use for a given project and being told that it depends on the project. Basically I'd like this sub reddit to become a news sub and to drop the questions. If people disagree, I'm sure they'll down vote this into oblivion. I propose a new sub called r/webdevhelp in the same vein as r/applehelp for any webdev question or people wanting feedback on their projects.

zncivi,Rant: Forced to Develop a Web App Without Using Javascript for Accessibility Concerns,"Hey everyone,

I'm a front-end developer at a German enterprise company and I've recently been given the task of creating a web app and design system using the Astro Javascript framework. However, there's a catch - I can't actually use Javascript.

You see, our company is required to comply with certain accessibility laws, which means that we have to ensure that our web apps can be used by anyone, regardless of whether they have access to Javascript or not. This means that I can't use any Javascript features or libraries, and I also can't use Web-components.

So what does this mean for me as a developer? It means that I have to manually copy and paste entire components, like buttons, into my code and make changes by hand. If I need to change a class or something else, I have to do it manually across every instance of that component. It's going to be a nightmare to maintain and update, and it's going to make my job a lot more time-consuming and frustrating.

I can't believe that in this day and age, we still have to deal with such outdated and cumbersome accessibility requirements. It's 2022, and yet we're still being held back by technology that was outdated decades ago. It's frustrating, to say the least.

Merry Christmas to all of you out there, and here's hoping that 2023 brings us some much-needed progress in the world of web development accessibility.

For a major project I was assigned the task to give a rough cost estimate for the development of a frontend and oversee its development from a medical side of things. The project will be funded by the government so buzz words like „FAIR“ data, open science and open source are a must.

The frontend would help users input data of specialized medical devices and all the things attached to such an exposure. It would need:

- an open-source RDBMS (PostgreSQL)
- api endpoints for automatization
- multiple user input forms and dashboard functionality (10-20 sites)
- user management
- export functionality
- containerization

Since this project needs to be waterproof in terms of legal liability a professional webdev company would be my primary choice. 

Could you give me a rough estimate? I have absolutely no clue about that!

Yesterday I had an interview and they sent me a simple coding challenge to make a quote generator that takes data from an api and also in the footer it counts visitors and upload it to a git page.

Pretty simple even though I had to use different technologies that I didn't know about like react.

Spent a few hours working hard on it and making everything perfect while keeping it visually simple as their scribble didn't ask for much and I didn't want to deviate from that.

Well...the feedback is that it's too begginner-ish. 

I don't understand. The last job I got I had a higher salary than I asked for this one and I put about 10% of the effort that I did for this coding challenge and the guy was very impressed.

I know omegle had some negatives, but for introverts, people who live in smaller places , people that wanna better their social skills, people that are bored, people have maybe feel depressed, and of course people super excited and eager to make new connections, it was amazing for that! and the amount of users honestly meant, skipping until i found someone fun to chat was possible, i do think most of the guys simply jerking off won't be on any newer sites yet because there isn't as much traffic in them, me thinks... anyways , I am very interested in knowing if in any way i could even help somehow by giving feedback? i am not good at coding, creating software at all, but with coming up with rules\\ideas\\typing stuff, i am super fast and just really wanna see a platform like this come up and do well.",2024-01-12 14:23:46
186ovst,"YouTube and other websites are blocking the ad blockers, so I created an extension that will skip video ads fully","[https://adskipper.me](https://adskipper.me)

I created an extension that will skip ads. Not speed them up, but skips them fully, no matter how long it is. It also works with mid video ads, and will remove all banners that pop up while watching the video

It was created in July this year, and it has over 2k users. Source code will be available soon, with more websites and features added to it. I am also trying to make Android app version where it would skip YouTube mobile app ads, but that is still in the testing process as it requires much more work than web version.

I wrote about technique long time ago on my blog [https://miletadulovic.me/blog/get-rid-of-youtube-unskippable-ads-with-simple-javascript](https://miletadulovic.me/blog/get-rid-of-youtube-unskippable-ads-with-simple-javascript)

It supports all major browsers, with Safari version on the way (that means it will work on mobile too)

If you'd like me to support a specific website or have a feature request for the extension, write me at [miletadulovic98@gmail.com](mailto:miletadulovic98@gmail.com)

14ax0gj,How common is it for a project manager to be completely non-technical?,"For background I've worked at this company for 3 years and from day 1 it was a complete and total disaster. I'm 1 of 3 technical people at the company and it is an uphill battle every single day to try and get the higher-ups to give a shit about the tech. I've just given up at this point.

Anyway, for a while we had no project managers, then with a recent uptick in web dev clients we had to bring on project managers. The first girl was great, but she saw how incompetent the management was and bounced. So now we have a woman that is your stereotypical older, tech-illiterate person and she is *constantly* hounding me about the most basic shit.

We held up the launch of a site because I was out for the afternoon and nobody, **no-fucking-body**, could tell the client where to go to login on a WordPress site despite the fact that we have built *hundreds* of WordPress sites. They ""didn't want to tell the client the wrong thing""... 

It's not just incompetence, it's weaponized incompetence. They have no desire to understand the technology that pays their bills, they just want to lash out like children when something doesn't happen perfectly. I'm so sick of getting this in Slack ""I don't understand this caching bs, just make it happen.""

The pay is worth the annoyance and stress so I won't be leaving, but I just have to commiserate with someone.. anyone..",2023-06-16 13:33:46

It's all a house of cards that somehow cheapens the broad skills required to manage a whole stack and  results in inefficiency and sloppiness that is justified by the fact that it's still fast(er/ish).

The unlimited free bootcamps and the fact a lot of web dev work could be automated could spell disaster for 1st world devs.


There will always be support work for legacy systems but in terms of building sites from scratch I could see all of that being automated in the future. It's mostly the same code .. especially on front-end but even the back-end could be automated if you really wanted to do it. 


In your own job you could probably automate most of it, you wouldn't though because then you'd be out of a job. 


Factories have been replacing workers with machines / automation the past few years, it's only a matter of time before it happens to websites / apps too. 


If you like I.T. you should always do it in your spare time but it might be best to reconsider career options and maybe go for something solid. 


Just a thought. It may not happen but if it does you should try be prepared.

19beitw,Tailwind vs Me,"As a staff engineer I feel like I'm about to lose the war against using Tailwind in production code. I've had many battles on many projects but some things might not be worth fighting any more.

I appreciate Tailwind for what it does in alleviating what many front end developers consider grunt work, or beneath them, or too ""illogical"" to wrap their heads around.

But I have historically drawn the line at applications for which I'm concerned about the long term mutability/extensibility of the styling. I can say the following over and over and it just doesn't resonate, especially with the React developers:

""I want you to style the modal Submit buttons using semantic class names. I don't want you to style that button there as rounded, red background, with white bolded text.""

I think younger developers have a good understanding (better than I did at a similar age anyway) about separation of concerns. And the concept of making your skins separate and replaceable goes back well before the web. But that all seems to not matter to them when Tailwind enters the conversation.

Where is my thinking going wrong? What am I missing?

Edit:

Judging by the thoughtful responses (not the votes on the response), it feels like there are 3 even camps: 1. TW is the answer! 2. Your issues with it are noted, TW is simply more efficient and enforceable 3. TW is not the answer, look elsewhere or go back to basics.

Components also came up a lot, but I see that as a separate topic, which may or may not also involve TW.

To those who think I was flexing by mentioning my position, the reason is 1. traditionally that role tends to be a final arbiter of what technology gets adopted by the org and 2. in that role I have limited time to dive deeply into all the technologies I am responsible for. The TW question is such a small fish to fry in the enterprise, but it is a recurring theme and therefore my question to the wider community.",2024-01-20 15:43:26

m9r683,Why is setting up a web development environment so stupidly difficult?,"Running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on a fresh virtual machine.

First I tried installing Ruby on Rails, following [this](https://archive.is/B3QeU) tutorial. Nope, doesn't work. By the way, why do I need to execute complex commands like `echo 'eval ""$(rbenv init -)""' >> ~/.bash_profile` anyway? The fuck even is that?

I gave up on using Ruby on Rails at all, mostly due to issues around Bundler. Apparently the Bundler devs have released production code so bad that I can't even run a fucking version check.

    will@ubuntu:~$ bundle --version
    /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/rubygems/defaults/operating_system.rb:50:in `<class:Specification>': undefined method `rubyforge_project=' for class `Gem::Specification' (NameError)

I mean, WTF? Did they forget to define a method, and then push the code to production, and then abandon the entire project!? Christ!No, in all honesty, I know it's probably my fault somehow: I don't have a Ph. D. in Linux, so imagine my surprise when shit doesn't work after I try to perform an install using such janky, incomprehensible commands as the one I mentioned earlier, which shouldn't be part of any respectable installation process.

Can a brother get a bloody `sudo apt install ruby rails rubygems` around here? That's really all I should have to do.Apparently not; after fucking around with Rails for a few fun-filled hours trying to get a damn ""Hello, world"" application to work, I decided to give up and try Django instead. Long story short: it went just as well as my attempt to set up RoR. Once again, `sudo apt install django` is just too plebian for the mighty Django devs, who insist on an installation procedure to rival the inanity of RoR's.

15118e,Maybe it's best kept as a hobby: My Webdev Story,"Two months ago, I was browsing stumbleupon and I suddenly (excuse my language) *stumbled* upon a free and very interactive course on HTML and CSS from Codeacademy. After a month, I finally completed the course and decided to code my own website from scratch.

This went well and I was happy with my design, although I wasn't so impressed by how long it took, I still forayed through to the next step. I bought a domain name as well as a server from Namecheap (Great customer service by the way) then proceeded to upload my HTML,CSS and images to the server. 

Until recently, I had only been coding on my own time, doing my own things...coding as a hobby. Finally, I found an opportunity to present my services. A friend of mine in Wisconsin said he wanted some feedback on his website. It was horrendous (I told him myself), but even worse a literal eyesore (#0000FF text over a #00FF00 background). 

I decided I was going to rebuild his website for him and he gladly accepted. I told him to give me an hour or two and then I'd show him the design. Within the allotted time I had drummed up what I thought was an okay design. He loved it. 

It was only after ten minutes did I realize that I A) was bored and B) for some unknown reason felt trapped by my work. I felt like I didn't know what I was actually doing and felt really inadequate. I knew I was completely able to finish the project, but I just didn't like it.

I used to want WebDev and design as a career, but I've decided against it at this point. I feel very bitter about it and hope to never revisit this experience again.

I've finished the project for a friend and will be taking down my website in the near future, putting this behind me, washing my hands of this whole situation and walking away.

The bright side: I learned a new ""language"" and actually explored a potential career for me. I guess this is just best kept as a hobby.

TL;DR On my first job I realized webdev isn't for me as a career, only a hobby.

q54n8,I am writing a book for my mother to better understand the web and I am looking for websites that are only coded in HTML5 with no CSS or JS added and its quite difficult per my current efforts.,"I need HTML5 only no css or js or anything else coded websites that I can use as reference for teaching HTML5. I cannot find these sites currently but I can find sites that are close. I dont know what you would type to find HTML5 only sites?

My mother asked me if I would teach her HTML5 because she is awesome. To do so I am going to write a book that takes you from mouse keyboard and monitor to HTML5 fluency. I am not interested in teaching her CSS with this book and I am definitely not interested in teaching her jQuery or PHP or anything else. She is whip smart and reads about ten books a month from what I can tell.

I have been working on this for about four hours now and I have already written four books in the last seven months on fiction, poetry, and vegan cooking. This could be a very special project because she has stated that she will follow my instructions and learn to code. She is 60. 

To begin with I am going to discuss the history of the browser. I am going to discuss what each browser is and why you would use one browser over another for specific purposes. I am going to discuss three development environments such as Coffee Cup Editor, Aptana, and I guess Komodo I cant think of another quality free development environment. I am also going to discuss tutorial sites like nettuts, smashing magazine, w3c schools and maybe two or three other tutorial sites where you can learn about web design.

I am also going to deeply talk about reddit and what you can learn from this site and how to use it. I am going to discuss add-ons for your browser and where to find them and how to tell if you really need that add-on and how to disable them if you dont need them.

My thoughts are to write about how being fluent in HTML5 can prepare you for creating work for screen readers and kindle books and sharing information with friends directly linked back to your own domain. These are my three areas of interest that I am focusing on for my HTML section of the book.

I believe that from my understanding if you are schooled in ONLY html you can publish for screen readers admirably and there is a home for the blind just up the street from my house that she volunteers at. I understand that you can write for kindle publishing and format your book in only html5 and i guess you can write a stripped down website that serves the purpose of being functional yet well stripped down. 

What else would you use ONLY html5 for for the purposes of teaching someone at length about this topic?

2. Again, Blazing Fast Load times.
3. Functional Web Designs. No BS.
4. No Wordpress or Page Builders, Pure Code.
5. 1 Week Delivery Time (Initially. And once I build a process for myself, should get this down to under 10 hours)
6. Affordable. Planning to start at 1000$ one time payment, and 20$ per month for maintenance and hosting. This includes 5 Static Pages with Blog Integrations, and Forms too.

The idea is to build a template library which can be re-used across other projects. This significantly reduces the development time and effort.

Being located in India, the main problem I see here is that you can get a website completed in under 100$ and they arent at all up to any standards. Ugly HTML, Wordpress everywhere, and slow load times.

I am thinking to target businesses niche wise. Which means, once i get started with the business, I will target dentists in and around my area, and build websites for them at maybe 200$ without any compromises on the quality.  Once i work with a couple of dentists, the next iteration I target Yoga Instructors and build website for them.

This will help me build a portfolio, and get exposed to the market. Once I have built a decent portfolio, I would like to target a relatively higher paying market like US or UK, where I can easily charge 1-2K USD per project.

So, this is the plan. Does it look like a far fetched idea? Anyone having a similar experience? Especially from India? Do let me know. Thanks!",2024-02-27 03:42:30

19dis9x,How can I search an entire website for a string,"I have a locally hosted website.  
I want to search it for a string.  


Actually, I want to search it for a couple of strings. But I figure that if I can get the process working once, then I can repeat it.

I want to automate the process. I do not want to check each page by hand.

Ideally I'd like a tool that generates a list of URL's. Maybe a list of URL's with a count of the instances of the target string.

But I'm not that fussed, as long as the output helps me to find my target strings.

Ideally the tool would be free of cost.

I don't want to build this tool by hand.  
I figure that this is not a new problem, so there must be free tools available.  


I did find this script:

[https://www.efficiencyofmovement.com/posts/search-a-website-for-a-particular-text-string/](https://www.efficiencyofmovement.com/posts/search-a-website-for-a-particular-text-string/)  


But it's output is HTML, which I don't want.  
I don't want to find the HTML that contains my target string. Having to eyeball HTML for my target string slows down my process, making it impractical.  


I've found paid services, but I don't want to pay.  


I also found this tool:  
[https://github.com/siteinspector/siteinspector](https://github.com/siteinspector/siteinspector)

  
It looked promising. But it's search doesn't seem to work: I got zero hits for my target string when I know that my site has many instances of that string.

13uoul0,I am seeking advice regarding my upcoming website.,"
There's this website, shoutcart.com, that connects celebrities or influencers with business owners who want to advertise or receive shoutouts.

I want to create a similar website but with additional functionalities.

I envision having columns or rows for TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, each with a corresponding price tag.

Additionally, I would like to include a column displaying the type of promotion method, such as a status update, post (permanent or temporary), and the duration of the post or status (how long it will remain visible).

For TikTok or YouTube videos, I want to provide users with the option to choose where their advertisement appears, whether at the beginning, middle, or end of the video.

I would also like to incorporate a section that assigns influencers a satisfaction score out of 100, based on user feedback.

In summary, I am looking to create a website similar to shoutcart.com but with enhanced functionality.

As I am relatively new to web development, I would greatly appreciate guidance on the necessary steps to bring this website to life, from start to finish.

Additionally, I would like to know the estimated budget required for this project (in US dollars).

Would custom coding be necessary, or can WordPress provide the required features?

How can I connect the influencers' accounts to the website?

Furthermore, I need to integrate three different payment systems. The influencers should receive payment only after completing the job, so an escrow system is required.

I understand that this is a significant request, but I would greatly appreciate an overview to help me determine where to begin and effectively plan all the required features before outsourcing the work.",2023-05-29 08:21:26

	});


I also know that the most popular advice I'm going to get is to learn react and build in react! I also have a feeling that it might improve things to an extent.

But having said that, don't you think this problem is inherently about web-development itself being confusing and unstructured, things like jquery and react are just band-aid solutions to it? When I used to do desktop development in .NET or even NetBeans, there was a very clear and structured way. I knew this is when my form is going to load and `Form_Load()` is where I have to write the loading event code. Similarly `someButton_Click()` is where I do click event handling of a button.

But with JavaScript, there isn't just one place where code is written. I have `app.js` where I have basic initialization routines and common utility functions. And then there are internal `<script>` blocks on each page pertaining to that page/module functionatliy, etc. The problem here is that when something goes wrong, debugging is just so difficult in JS! The old way of debugging by printing vars (`console.log`) is the only way of debugging. You can't put exact breakpoints at some place, can you?

What is your way of handling this? Have you just resigned yourself to this inherent soupiness and vagueness, or have you tried to improve the process in some way? Is there no such thing as ""industry standard"" or ""best practice"" in this regard?",2023-01-08 03:21:14

It is a proctored exam the students take at a local library or state office.

The exam rules explicitly state that you are not allowed to open any other browser windows while taking the exam.

It turns out we had someone attempting to cheat on a web-based exam over the weekend by opening the exam in a second tab of the browser.  I'm not sure what the person was trying to accomplish, but the exam page ended up crashing and threw an ""Object reference not set to an instance of an object"" error.  We have been able to replicate the error in testing this morning.

***What I would like to do is this: catch the user opening a new tab or a new browser window.***

If I can see that tab or new browser opening, then I can do something in the original tab -- specifically: end the exam, set the score to 0, and return that failing score to the controller.

Googling is returning plenty of ways to open a new window, or how to cause a link to open in a new window, but nothing on how to spot a new tab being opened.

Does anyone know of any way to do this?

f9ecqt,The case for AMP,"Okay, so I understand almost everything involves a compromise. I also hear a lot of hatred towards Google AMP; and to a large extent I agree .. proprietary systems that unfairly benefit certain major players *should* receive a lot of hate.

But then again, at the beginning of a project when you have a full architectural reign over a schema, you're inevitably going to be placed in a situation where you have to ask the question:

**Is using AMP worthwhile for your use case?**

I'm in that place at the moment.

Very aware that retrofitting, takes longer and creates more complexity; so if I'm going to support AMP, I maybe should now during design. Big believer in [schema.org](https://schema.org) / micro-formats. Understand the benefit of rich-snippets (even if I'm not fully behind the political consequences).

Any advice, anecdotes, cautionary tales / tales of success, appreciated.

\--

Edit:

Thanks for comments. I'm left feeling that AMP shouldn't be allowed to continue, because it doesn't really benefit users of the platform as much as Google.

It would be useful to know which use-cases are benefited by AMP .. if any. And what those circumstances might involve.

\--

Edit 2:

So, if we put evilness aside, it seems the main benefits are:

* speed increase
* hosting cost reduction
* ability to feature in top bar of search listings
* preferential SEO",2020-02-25 18:07:26

ay62i1,Am I in the wrong (compensating a developer)?,"***Update: I'm reaching out to him to organize a payment and to ensure future availability.***

&#x200B;

Two months ago I paid a total of $400 (CAD) for a fairly simple script to support advertisements on my website. This was developed in a piecemeal fashion and the initial fee was $200 USD, followed by $60 USD for some enhancements and finally $30 USD for one more feature.

Today the script stopped functioning. I reached out to the developer to correct whatever the problem was, and in under an hour, he returned the script with the addition of one line of code. Perhaps 10 characters in total.

Afterwards, he requested a $30 USD payment as this is his normal rate. I refused because, after paying a fairly large sum of $400 CAD, the script stopped functioning after only two months of use. The reason the script stopped functioning is because it uses another site's API and this changed slightly. In other words, it wasn't my fault or the fault of the developer per se. That said, I imagine it could have been future-proofed in the first place.

Even though this wasn't spelled out explicitly in our original and very informal agreement, is it unreasonable to expect a degree of support afterwards without being billed? This took maybe 30 minutes in total and 1 line of code to resolve the problem. What's the standard practice in these instances? Normally I'd make the payment and just move on, however I was very generous with the initial fees and there is an expectation of basic support, within reason, should something go wrong within such a short span of time.

Can I get some feedback here? Would you have waived this fee after establishing a pretty good relationship with a client? I'm a bit concerned as the odds of needing further assistance are high, in which case I've probably burned a bridge permanently. Putting that aside, what are your thoughts on the matter? If there's a more appropriate sub for this, let me know.",2019-03-07 00:13:30

1785sg7,Would Astro+Vite+Vue3+PrimeVue+Directus be overkill for coding average business websites?,"So in the process of trying to figure out what framework stack i will be using to create simpler websites for customers as a freelancer I started to question whether or not I should use and get really good with this configuration:

Astro, Vite, Vue3, PrimeVue, Directus.

I really like what I've seen from Directus so far and I think I've decided on learning that cms.

I'm also intrigued by Astro and it feels like it would fit well in my toolbox for the upcoming projects.

PrimeVue looks like it has good theming options. I like the ability to spice things up with different theming for different websites, and despite me being quite comfortable with quasar, I feel like quasar would be unnecessary as I won't be turning the sites into apps and PWAs or whatever and I want to go for a bit different look than material design.

But when it comes to Vite and Vue3, I'm wondering if it's even necessary. I like vites ultra quick reload/build thingy but is it even a good idea to use with Astro?

Also I'm not sure if using Vue3 and PrimeVue introduces a lot of unnecessary bloat/configuration to the whole project, in the sense that maybe just Astro and like Bootstrap or something would be enough?

If all these frameworks and tools don't necessarily lead to worse performance or bloat per sé, but might be unnecessary in terms of a lot of their functionality will be unused, I think I would be fine with that because it gives me a chance to learn them better and also have the ability to expand functionality on a published project further down the road.

It's not easy to make a decision before I even know what I'm doing so that's why im asking y'all what you think.

TLDR: is it outright dumb to use all these frameworks for simpler projects and websites, or is there really no  direct downside, other than it sounding like a mouthful?",2023-10-15 02:46:56

He's secured a client and asked me if I want to do fulfilment. He does sales and has zero technical knowledge, so I'd be doing all of the work.

Should I whitelabel the build so he can add his own markup or should we split this down the middle? Maybe a third option?

If whitelabeling I assume I'm not expected to run discovery or interface with the client at all right? While I don't enjoy that aspect of the work I also fear that things would get lost in the game of telephone, especially considering this guy's meager domain expertise.

Like client send a req to like the post, server increments the like counter, adds notification to the tray and returns all the notifications (along with the newly added one)

15kllbe,"How can I know my level (Junior, Senior... etc)?","Hello devs,

TL;DR, how can I know if I'm junior or senior or whatever?

So recently I started looking for jobs on the internet, specifically remotely, I applied for hundreds of jobs but got no interviews at all.

I do have 3.5 years of working with React JS, created almost all websites with Next JS and I also made real-time apps, implemented web sockets, created CRUD web apps (which is very very basic for me now), dealt with backend and databases, created an API for an app from scratch and many things.

But I do NOT have any office-working experience, I have never been working for a company, so does this still make me an entry level dev?

What I noticed is that almost all fully remote jobs require senior web devs, but I also noticed that there were some entry level and junior positions but they require you living in that specific country and have a work pemit and stuff.

Now the question is, how can I know whether I'm a junior, a mid level dev, an entry level... etc.?

I'm so confused and would really appreciate some help, thanks!",2023-08-07 14:01:29
15hfj85,Web3 games need good infrastructure,"It seems to me that with a shift away from attracting players solely interested in earning money and toward those seeking fun, the space has entered a new growth phase with the entry of well-established studios and millions in new capital.  


As one article noted, in this next phase of evolution, games like Axie have lost their first-mover advantage and are being judged on their merits instead. In other words, playtime is over.Web3 gaming studios need to take new competition seriously, or risk fading out.  


So, you may guess that infrastructure is the most important weapon. Would you agree?   


I would say that many things are different now, the average Web3 game today has a much longer production cycle that includes user testing: a change that has resulted in games with UX, mechanics, and accessibility closer to the quality that the Web2 gamer crowd has come to expect.  


And now, there is an excellent choice of games from Coin Fantasy, Axie Infinity to Star Atlas, Nakamoto games, and a bunch of other titles.  


That's why I have a feeling that Web3 game studios are now competing for a larger, more diverse group of players than ever before. The studios that manage to attract these players will be the most successful in the long run.  


For the end, I have to say that better gameplay and greater accessibility are crucial for every Web3 gaming studio. ",2023-08-03 20:48:07

If I want to get started with making a website, though, I always feel like I fall into a trap. I am not really sure what is best to use, why to use that and when. There are so many things to take into account that I'm afraid to move forward with any of my work.

Let's say, for example, that you would want to make a site which tracks all the graffiti in a city. You have a map of the city, you can login and add images, then pin the locations on the map with them. I am already starting to see a lot of problems with such an app. One case could be that people might want to upload bad images (not representative, nudity, etc.).

i recently started my first junior level web dev position.  I am mostly self-taught, I don't have a CS degree.  I got my job mostly based on my projects and active GitHub/open source contributions.

This company I'm working for, while being helpful with my on-boarding process and, overall, seeming like a good team of developers, they are using outdated technologies.

Now, as a new developer, I know that ""beggers can't be choosers"".  I took the job because I wanted to get experience and I was kind of hoping it would turn into a long term thing.  But, as I feared from the job description, they are using outdated technologies, including using them for new and upcoming projects.

After talking with several developers, many of them aren't even aware of modern JavaScript features (still using var, jquery, not aware of fetch, still using AngularJS etc) and they are still developing with Internet Explorer in mind.

I know part of being a developer is working with new and existing technologies and adapting to them as I need them.  But as far as career growth, I'm concerned that my skills will begin to diminish over time as I continue to use these outdated technologies.

At the same time, I want to learn as much as possible so that if I apply for future jobs, I at least get past the ""work experience"" filter.

My question is:  At what point should I start to look for a new place to work?  And, while I'm here, what things should I focus on that will make me a better developer overall?

Thanks for all the feedback",2018-06-27 03:01:03

Following up from my [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/4evxtm/mac_osx_or_windows_need_laptop_advice/) regarding laptop advice I decided on a Macbook Pro. Now I'm trying to figure out whether I should go for a 13 inch model or a 15 inch model.

Basically the difference narrows down too, the 15 inch having larger screen real estate and a quad core i7 CPU, where as the 13 inch being cheaper and more portable. Both machines will have 16gb ram and 256gb of storage.

Has anyone bought one and regretted not getting the other? Even if you don't own a Mac, was it the screen size, the dual core CPU? I'd like to hear ! Thanks :)

xkazz,"Small but useful PHP script I have written, has been a huge timesaver. (Use classes without having to include them every time)","**PREFACE**

This is a small script I wrote whilst I was it university and continue to use now. It has saved me a lot of time. As a forewarning it is only really useful if you use classes in your PHP. If you don't use object oriented PHP, I would recommend it, it is also another time saver and makes for nicer code in my opinion, since making the switch I haven't once looked back.

It only really occured to me how useful this was recently and as a result I have decided to share this with the world.

It is nothing revolutionary and if you have anything more than intermediate knowledge of php do not expect to be blown away.

**THE CODE**

Place this code in a .php file within your root or /includes directory. I named it setEnv.php

    <?php
    /****Remove comment if site uses sessions****/
    //session_start();
    ini_set('display_errors', true);
    error_reporting(-1);
    
    function __autoload($classname){
    	$classPath = str_replace('_', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR , $classname );
    	require_once( $classPath . '.class.php' );
    }
    
    ?>
    
**WHAT IT DOES**

The first line of code I have included because I use sessions a lot, but I keep it commented unless I am going to use sessions. Basically this will ensure that a session is always there and you will never get missing variable errors because you forgot to include the session_start() function. If you don't use/like sessions or don't know what they are, leave this line commented.

Secondly, it turns on error reporting, you should be doing this already because it's night impossible to debug your code without it. This just ensures error reporting is always turned on. 

The next section is my function and the real meat of this script. What this does is automatically locates your class files when you declare a new instance of that class in your code and automatically includes the file if it has not yet been included.

**HOW TO USE IT**

Assuming this is a new project, you would first open your root directory and create a new folder and name it 'classes' then within that new folder create your class file. Lets use for this example 'webpage.class.php'

Then when defining this class where you would normally put

    class Webpage{

    }

You now **must** call it <directory_name>_filename, so in this case your class would now be 

    class classes_webpage{

    }

Then when creating a page, let's say index.php you will first include the setEnv.php file from wherever it is located, for this example let's say the /includes directry.

    require_once('includes/setEnv.php');

And now when you initialise your class you will not need to include the class file 

    $page = new classes_webpage();

**END**

If you have any feedback or questions don't be shy. If you can't use it, I will help you (hell if you want help moving from normal php to object oriented php, drop me a message and if I'm not too busy I will help you out). If you think it's not efficient enough let me know why or if you think there is anything that I have missed from a script like this, let me know. (Also this is my first time writing a tutorial or anything like that, so if you have any feedback on the way it's written, feel free to drop that on me too)

One thing I do know, is for a web development community there is no enough of this kind of thing happening, sharing code, working on code together, discussing code.

Now don't get me wrong, Twitch is an amazing platform and provided a large number of people a place to call home, but I feel like they have too much power. It feels as if they don't want to improve because there's no reason to.. I want that to change.

I'm proposing to create a service to rival Twitch. It's a crazy notion, I know. And the success of the project will most likely be judged by a Kickstarter in the late future, because I'm sure we all will have issues with covering the initial cost it takes to buy appropriate servers.. but if that slim chance possibility is there, I really want to take it.

There's going to be a lot to cover in this post, so just bear with me.

**What's the use of doing something this huge, with little chance of success?**  
As mentioned earlier, the main reason is I feel Twitch has been having too much power recently due to the lack of competitors. With that said, they've been making poor advancements and decisions recently, most likely because they can. The breaking point was how they handled the DMCA attacks. I still remember the tears of streamers, scared to lose their only job and desperate to remove all of their clips, their memories. It felt like at that moment, Twitch started to care about its streamers less and more about its image as a business.

**What makes you think YOU can beat Twitch?**  
I'm not claiming I can beat Twitch, however, that will be the goal of the project. I've been a developer for a long time, working with game server mods (both with and without APIs), doing websites for friends, making programs to make something easier for me, etc. Even if I get heavy criticism, even if I become the only one who works on the project, this large-scale project should be entirely possible with my skill set.. just, a very long process.

**What makes you think you can run this service better than existing platforms?**  
One thing I've always had is love for communities. I currently moderate a fast growing YouTube Discord server, and while there's lots of people who come in to ruin the experience, there's many more who are just generally interested with the server. I hear most of their complaints constantly, so I have an idea of what they'd like with a service - something to help them grow. This project is going to focus on discoverability. I'll get back to this in a little bit, let me just throw some things down right now. I've never ran a company in my entire life, only helped them by being a developer, moderator, or manager (thanks to the optimistic community of Minecrafters). I'm not saying I know the way businesses work better than Amazon (who I believe owns Twitch currently). However, this can be good in a way. It can allow me to learn how to run such a business without forgetting about who truly makes it work - the community. I can learn to protect them and help them keep a home on this platform. It won't be an easy journey, but it really never is.

**What's your target audience?**  
For starters, we do want to appeal to the gamer community, but that's not all. Long time, I've seen post of people wanting to make a similar service for stuff like coders, artists, etc. So while there are plans to appeal to gamers, we also want to appeal to people of skill as well. Whether you stream while working a 9 to 5 office job, or you just want to show off your latest API, the platform will support your passion.

Now, there's one more thing as well, this relates to gaming. One idea I have is showing love to indie developers as well. We will have game categories, and there will be an indie game category, however.. I'd like to do something else too. My idea is to have some sort of application system or something that allows indie developers to apply to put their game in the categories, even if they have a small community. People who stream to the game category would not only be on that list, but still on the indie game list as well. I respect indie developers (especially ThinMatrix, he makes such peaceful games and videos).. so I want to show my respect by giving them love.

**Now what's this ""Discoverability"" idea?**  
As mentioned earlier, I want this platform to focus on discoverability. Nothing has been set in stone, but I'm thinking about creating an algorithm to help them be discovered. Create some kind of ""Discover"" list for each user at the home page, and have it personalized based on the user's interest on the site. The Discover list will put lots of emphasis into smaller streamers as well. With the algorithm though, ideally I want it to work by the more dedicated a streamer, the more the algorithm helps you. So if you stream like 4 or even 8 hours a day, doing it all the time, people keep swinging by and hitting up a chat, stuff like that.. then the algorithm will help you out a lot. However, if you just stream like 1 hour a month and really get no engagement or anything, then the algorithm won't be as fair as it'll try to promote people who are dedicated. There could be more ways in the future, but I figured this would be a widely appreciated method.

**Do you have any plans for how to build the RTMP server?**  
I've put lots of thought already in it. I've done research on it as well, plenty of research. My current plan is this:

**Technique:** MPEG-DASH; Fallback to HLS if DASH is not supported (cough Safari).  
**Encoder:**  
\- (If by some way we can handle 4k livestreaming, though I'm concerned about it right now) VP9  
\- H.265 (HEVC) - 1080p and 720p  
\- H.264 - Lower resolutions (will have to look into its licensing as well sept it's not royalty free)  
In the case any of the newer encoders are not available to a client, it'll default to H.264.  
*At this point, it's kind of self explanatory to say Safari will not support 4k livestreams as it'll cap at 1080p*.  
**Processing:**  
For processing, I will most likely be using GStreamer. The main reason this instead of solutions like FFmpeg is because not only is this not a low-level library, but it does support FFmpeg processing already, and even apparently WebRTC! For the general latency mode, I'll be using FFmpeg processing. But if we were to make a low latency mode, WebRTC would be an amazing candidate.

**What about your coding plan for the website?**The website is a lot more uncertain than the server, however this is what I plan currently.

**Front-End**: Either Vue or React (with ofc the normal HTML, CSS, JS stuff)  
**Back-End**: NodeJS. I'm still looking into it, but that's the one of the best options I see so far, as it's more supported than Django.  
**Database:** (Still looking into it) - MongoDB. The main reason this instead of MySQL is it's known to be much much faster with large databases, and it's well developed as well.  
**Internal Structure:** (Stuff like search bar and what not) - GO. I'm looking into Go because of how useful it apparently would be for this type of stuff.  
**API Service:** GO. Again, it's apparently very good for this stuff.

**What are your plans about marketing?**  
I haven't thought about marketing too much, but I'm not as concerned about that right now as the project is still barley a bona fide structure. However, when the time starts to come that we need to worry about marketing, I won't just shrug it off. I know how crucial it is to market the platform, and I will take every attempt seriously.

**So why are you telling us this?**  
So far, the only people who are working on this is just me and a friend, though we're still planning everything out. That said, there's still many skills we don't have.. so, we're looking for people who'd be genuinely interested in helping to make this a reality. If you like web design, we can definitely use that (we're good at systems, bad at design. If you've seen some of my programs I've made in the past, it's a worse horror than Granfaloon from Castevania: Symphony of the Night). Another person that'd be really helpful is someone familiar with law. If we want to target Twitch, we have to have not only a sturdy structure, but also a way to handle the DMCA more fairly. Last but not least, it's always nice to have an extra set of handles. Although, one thing to note is I want to keep the team relatively small. This is a project no one can afford to work full-time, so it's something we work on the side. Not ideal, but it's the best we can do.

**Is there any deadlines with the project?**  
Ideally, I don't want to rush this. This is being made to compete against a company worth either about or over a billion dollars, so it has to be made carefully. However, it would be nice to be either just about completed or completed by the start of 2022. I do want to spend at least a year working on it, to make sure there's a lot to offer from the start. It's not like this will be worked on full-time as well, as we all can't just quit our jobs or abandon our responsibilities for the sake of a gamble.

*If you have any questions about my plan, please ask me in the comments! I tried to mention everything worth mentioning, but this was a long post so I could've missed something. Also, while constructive criticism is greatly appreciated, don't be outright disrespectful in the comments as well.*

**TL;DR:** I'm wanting to create a streaming service to beat Twitch but know it isn't easy, so I'm looking for feedback and potential help about the idea.

11vuu2e,ELI5: The point of Frontend frameworks?,"So I'll start with saying I consider myself a backend dev. I daily languages such as Javascript, .NET and Powershell. I frequently create and make use of APIs within webapps and closed software. 

I'm looking to transition into more of a full-stack developer however I've been really struggling to understand where I should be starting. Especially with things like the Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular etc). 

I recently started reading about SSR and this is what sparked this thread. From what I gather a lot of these frameworks heavily lean on the ability to dynamically generate content on the server side by generating HTML to then hand to the browser, in turn this would be faster then having the client render.   
From the perspective of a backend dev I don't understand why this is an advantage? It looks like a solution created for a problem that didn't exist. Why not just stay coding within HTML, JS and CSS? Why not make use of libraries? Instead, use a framework that generates these languages anyway to serve to the browser in the same way you'd be able to with the original deployment? Maybe I'm just old.  

What's the best course of action I should take moving forward? What's the best Framework to start reading up on? Where could I find the best resources? I'm eager to learn!",2023-03-19 19:22:50

16szp14,I think I just wasted $50 on 3 domain names without understanding that its not the same as purchasing a hosting provider.,"First off, I know how stupid this probably is, and I've surely learnt my lesson, but please let me explain what has happened.

Purchased 3 domains off of [Gandi.net](https://Gandi.net) thinking that I would be able to put them onto the web after, put almost immediately realized afterwards that I need an actual host to put them up. I don't want to pay for Gandi's hosting because it is a little out of my budget, so I have a few questions right now. Please excuse my ineptitude on this information, I'm not a web developer by trade.

1. Are these domains tied specifically to Gandi, or can I use them elsewhere?
2. Can I refund these domains? I would think not, but I just purchased them so maybe there is another way?
3. Are there any more affordable hosting providers I could use for these domains if I can transfer them to other hosts

Once more, I understand how foolish this was and so I don't need anyone to tell me that. If anyone could provide some information on the matter it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",2023-09-26 20:54:50

My goal is to master building a scalable full-stack system. Here’s a brief overview of the technologies I’m focusing on:

- Frontend: React (including state management and hooks), TypeScript, and CSS preprocessors like SASS.

- Backend: Node.js with Express.js, MongoDB (including schema design and indexing), and implementing secure authentication (JWT/OAuth).

- Containerization & Orchestration: Proficiency in Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.

- DevOps & CI/CD: Familiarity with CI/CD tools (Jenkins/GitLab CI/CD/GitHub Actions), and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform or CloudFormation.

- Cloud Services: Understanding of cloud providers (AWS/Azure/Google Cloud) and their managed services for containers and databases.

- Monitoring & Logging: Implementation of logging with tools like Winston/Morgan, and monitoring using Prometheus/Grafana or ELK Stack.

- Security: Knowledge of secure coding practices, network security, HTTPS, TLS, and securing applications against common vulnerabilities.

- Performance Optimization: Load balancing (NGINX/HAProxy), caching strategies with Redis, and rate limiting.

The tutorial would preferably show someone actually building out the entire system using these technologies, explaining the decisions and steps in a video format.

Does anyone know of any resources that fit this bill? Recommendations for individual parts of the stack presented in video format would also be highly appreciated.

So I've asked a question here before I've gotten some great responses and I'm hoping to get your help one more time. I have some more questions and I'd like to get your brutally honest feedback. I'm not a web developer but I have an idea for an online business. I think the concept is pretty unique and I haven't seen it done before. It centers around crowdfunding. I found a developer company that can build a website with the functionality I need and also offers support to maintain the site, with the first year being free and then a monthly fee. But before I really dive into creating this business I'm trying to get a better understanding of what I'm getting myself into.

 Right now it's myself and potentially 1 or 2 other people who will run this site (potentially). Assuming this site is decently built and this tech company keeps their word about providing tech support, is it feasible, is it realistic from a technical standpoint to try and run a medium sized or even large successful, high traffic website with only two, three or maybe even one person (at least for the first couple years) who aren't web developers but have tech suppoort backing and have it be successful? 

I ask mainly because every well known, successful online business I've ever seen usually has dozens or hundreds of employees skilled in programming. So I want to be sure I'm not getting in way over my head before I invest a lot of time and money into this. Is this kind of setup something that can be done with successful outcomes? Is it common? Do you yourself or a company you work for provide support for any online companies with a similar setup to the one I described, successfully run by people without programming skills? Is it a bad idea from a technical standpoint? If it is can you please tell me why or what types of potential problems I may not be aware of? Thanks in advance for any and all feedback.,",2023-12-28 01:44:37
18n7kua,Play an Audio File WITHOUT User Interaction,"Hello,

Im writing a wordpress plugin that monitors woocommerces shop\_orders page. When a new order comes in the page is supposed to play a tada sound.   


Everything is hooked into the shop\_orders page in the admin. The idea is the user navigates to that page, every 30 seconds the page refreshes, during the refresh a filter is triggered and we check for the  presence of a new order. This all works perfectly.  


Now, when the new order is found, during this load we also output some javascript to play the notification sound:  


if (($sounds) && (self::$new\_order)) {

$plugin\_dir = plugin\_dir\_url(""mgd-woorestaurants-orderpickups/assets/"") . ""assets/tada.mp3"";

echo ""<script type='text/javascript'>let notifi= new Audio('$plugin\_dir'); [notifi.play](https://beat.play)();</script>"";

}  


I see the code in the page source, but no sound is every played. The console shows an error that reads:

  
""Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: play() failed because the user didn't interact with the document first.""  


I've read about the chrome policies for audio and video, and I cant seem to work out a way to get this audio file to play when a new order is found. 

How do I set the browser to ignore its policies for this specific purpose?

13tm3q0,Gaming Google - (SEO) The perfect lighthouse score,"I've always been hesitant to share my code. It's not that I believe it's subpar, nor am I plagued by imposter syndrome. It's just that sharing code offers a glimpse into the madness that is my mind, and that feels somehow cruel for everyone else. Allow me to guide you on a journey that nearly drove me to the brink of sanity. It all began with Google's Lighthouse update.

For the SEO uninitiated, Google's Lighthouse update represented a substantial shift in search ranking, hinging on a website's performance and adherence to best practices. If you'd like to test your website, simply open it in Chrome on a desktop, press F12 to open the Chrome developer tools, and then click the ""Lighthouse"" tab. Choose either Desktop or Mobile and click ""Analyze"". After about a minute, you'll receive five scores, each ranging from 0 to 100, for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practice, SEO, and Progressive Web App (PWA).

Before delving into the technical details, let me introduce myself. My name is Jonathan Grantham, and I'm the proud owner of a small B2B SaaS company, Nexoid, which specializes in ERP and ITSM software. The website I'm discussing in this piece is [www.nexoid.com](http://www.nexoid.com/). Feel free to have a look, open up the source code. You can also follow me on LinkedIn. My profile is [https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathongrantham/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathongrantham/).

Upon the release of the Google Chrome Lighthouse update, I did what any conscientious business owner would do: I checked my website. Much to my dismay, the results were far from satisfactory. With scores of 21/100 for Performance, 30/100 for Accessibility, 45/100 for Best Practice, 11/100 for SEO, and a failure for PWA, I was shocked. I had personally built the website, a fairly standard Single Page Architecture using React.js. The scores were a crushing blow.

Undeterred by the initial setback, I launched MS Code and began addressing the issues one by one, with Performance being my first target. The guides provided within the Lighthouse tool proved quite useful. I converted all images from JPEGs and PNGs to modern WebP files, and ensured that every img tag was equipped with a width and length property to prevent layout shifts. These modifications alone boosted my score from 21/100 to 60/100. It was a significant improvement, but far from perfect. The only suggestion remaining was to ""reduce unused JavaScript,"" which wasn't particularly helpful. The only JavaScript present was the React.js framework, as everything else had been eliminated.

Despite my persistent efforts to rectify the issue, I was met with constant roadblocks. I attempted to remove parts of React.js, explored ""lazy loading,"" and tested various optimizers and compressions. However, the issue stemmed from React.js itself, which was approximately half a megabyte in size.

I can almost hear seasoned web developers shouting, ""Don't use React for a website! It's meant for building web applications!"" I'm well aware of this now.

What began as a seemingly simple task of converting a few images had now morphed into a complete website overhaul using a new framework. Frustrated and uttering a few choice words under my breath, I set out in search of a suitable replacement. I first considered Vue and later Angular, arguably the biggest competitors of React.js. However, they both presented the same issue.

In an attempt to simplify things, I decided to look into older technologies, and gave jQuery a shot. Yet, I was met with the same problem. It became abundantly clear that there wasn't an off-the-shelf Single Page Architecture framework that could appease the Google deities.

It seemed my only remaining option was to resort to vanilla JavaScript.

My series of experiments began with a basic HTML page without any JavaScript. Then, I tried an HTML page with a div whose contents could be replaced. I quickly realized that making multiple simultaneous changes to the page via JavaScript incurred penalties from Lighthouse. The solution was to manipulate the contents of the body tag as a string and then reintegrate it, thereby creating only a single visible DOM change.

I now had a minimalist HTML page with an empty body tag, complemented by a small onload function in the head tag. This function inspected the URL and executed an HTML GET request to retrieve the corresponding text file containing the page's body HTML. One would think this is a suitable solution. Unfortunately, it fell short when I attempted to dynamically load JavaScript functionality.

Unlike other tags, if you add a script tag with a simple alert(""yes this fired"") into the body contents string, it won't execute. Although not ideal, one workaround was to parse the body string, identify all the script tag contents, and place them in a JavaScript eval function. The approach was somewhat effective but stumbled when dealing with namespaces, and the developer console was flooded with unsightly warnings. The solution was to extract the script tags from the HTML and add them as a script element after the DOM had rendered. Google did not penalize this action for some reason.

Progress was being made, and I had a basic Single Page Architecture solution. But not so fast. While Google is efficient at indexing Single Page Architecture pages (they do this by opening it in a browser, allowing all the JavaScript to run, and then scanning the DOM), Bing, Yahoo, and other major search engines use a similar, simpler method. However, most other platforms like Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp only fetch the HTML file, retrieving a small HTML file with a blank body. My solution was not viable. I now had to replicate this concept for every page on the website and include the JavaScript to switch to Single Page Architecture mode when a user clicked on a link.

I needed a tool capable of generating HTML for each page, based on my solution. It occurred to me that I had the perfect resource at my disposal: my own ERP system, Nexoid. I created a Nexoid model encompassing a website and web page data objects. The website record facilitated the creation of a generic template webpage, while the web page records contained the content for each individual page. The final piece of the puzzle was a workflow function or script that could read the website record and all related web page records to generate the HTML files. After a few days, it was operational. I had created a basic Content Management System (CMS). Developing a CMS to this point is not overly complex; the real challenge arises when integrating other CMS workflows, approvals, localizations, previews, etc.

A key requirement for the new website was localization; we aimed to launch it in 11 languages. Being an IT company, I naturally leaned toward technological solutions. Rather than hiring a translator for every page, I opted for AWS Translate. While AI translators are decent, they're not perfect, and the errors are noticeable enough to reveal a non-human origin. A French-speaking staff member evaluated the AI translation and gave it a 6/10, describing it as ""understandable, but not proper French.""

However, we stumbled upon a valuable trick. We found that feeding the English text through ChatGPT first, asking it to 'tidy this up', and then pasting it in, it rewords the text in a way that's still English but is much more compatible with the language models. Using the ChatGPT-reworded English as the base for translation significantly improves the translation quality, elevating it to a 9 or even a perfect 10 out of 10.

Having developed a solid technological foundation for creating the website, I was making progress. However, a new challenge emerged as we began to build more complex pages. Under the new Lighthouse guidelines, it became necessary to consolidate all JavaScript, CSS, and HTML into a single file. This also applied to the Single Page Architecture versions.

We resorted to inserting all JavaScript and CSS files as inline tags. A similar strategy was required for the Single Page Architecture version. We created a JSON file containing all scripts, styles, and HTML.

Lighthouse identified the next problem as the size of the assets; the HTML and JSON page files were excessively large. I resolved this issue using 'minify,' a Node.js library specifically designed to compress HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This solution resulted in a reduction of text file size by over 40%. Additionally, minify offered the added benefit of obfuscation, making the raw code more difficult to read, enhancing security.

Let's delve into the topic of hosting. Traditionally, a Content Management System (CMS) operates via an application server that handles the user's HTML request. It interprets the page request from the URL, locates the corresponding assets in a database, retrieves the database record (possibly alongside others), processes the information to assemble the page, and finally delivers it to the end user as a flat HTML document. This description primarily pertains to the initial HTML request when a user visits a new website, although I am aware of AJAX and other similar technologies.

However, this conventional model presents certain drawbacks in the context of the new Lighthouse world. Firstly, the back-and-forth communication between the application server and the database server, as well as the page compilation, introduces delays. Secondly, in its simplest form, an application server and a database server are only physically available in a single location. This setup is excellent if you're in the same building or city, but significantly less efficient if you're attempting to access the site from the other side of the world. For instance, the average ping latency between Australia and the UK is approximately 250 milliseconds.

Our solution to these challenges involves utilizing AWS S3 for hosting the static files generated by the previously mentioned publish script, and AWS CloudFront for global content distribution. At the time of this writing, AWS CloudFront was distributing content to over 90 cities in 47 countries. For an individual in Melbourne, Australia accessing a UK website, AWS CloudFront reduced the ping latency from 250 milliseconds to a mere 13 milliseconds (this is the time difference between Melbourne and AWS edge servers in Sydney).

We now arrive at the Progressive Web Application (PWA) component of the Lighthouse test, which was not something I had previously given much consideration. For those unfamiliar, a PWA involves a JavaScript service worker that manages the website as a web application. If that's a bit complex, consider it this way: it's essentially an automatic downloading and caching tool. When a user visits your website, the goal is to make their subsequent requests as speedy and seamless as possible. The PWA service worker allows you to already have the next assets downloaded to the user's local machine, eliminating the need for another internet GET request.

At the time of writing this article, the Nexoid website is relatively small, containing only 19 pages. However, those 19 pages are translated into 11 different languages, making a total of 209 pages. Initially, I tried to download every asset into the service worker, which amounted to around 5MB. This size was too large for an initial load, and Lighthouse penalized me for it. I settled on downloading only the English page JSON files, which include all the necessary CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to display each page.

The final structure is as follows: An S3 bucket houses the compiled HTML files, named without the .html extension. For instance, [http://www.nexoid.com/en](http://www.nexoid.com/en) represents the English homepage HTML, /de is for the German homepage HTML, and /en/platform refers to the English platform HTML, and so on. Additionally, there are JSON files that contain the parts of the body and head that change when navigating between pages, such as /en.json, /de.json, and /en/platform.json, among others.

In conclusion, comprehending Lighthouse posed a significant challenge. I am skeptical that traditional, out-of-the-box CMS products can effectively tackle this task. Reflecting on my experience with platforms like WordPress and Drupal, I find it hard to believe that they could be optimized to achieve a perfect Lighthouse score. Overall, I believe the effort is worthwhile, and Google is justified in placing more emphasis on performance. However, this shift is and will continue to be a considerable pain point for web designers and agencies.

13ordn9,Templating engine over React.,"I've been using React for one of my project and it has become cumbersome as it gets larger and larger.

Up until this point I cannot see the reason why react even exist at the first place. My argument is that React was originally developed to create highly interactive UI. Where changing one state will alter many different UI or other states. Updating 5-10 UI manually will be extremely time consuming and this is where React shines.

Other than the above I literally can't see ANY benefit of using React over client-side templating engines like ejs and other similar libraries. When you use react 80% of your time will be wasted figuring out which component rendering 3 times and why it renders 3 times rather than actually creating UI. Most of your time will be wasted fighting with the library itself.

Almost all of React's API is to make sure that your app runs at best performance & doesn't have any value in assisting you creating UI. e.g React.memo, React.useCallback, React.useRef, React.useMemo (can be used to run function when component first mounted to prevent unnecessary rerender). All these API has no value other than preventing rerenders. Most people use React for it's reusable component rather than the main feature which is it's state system for developing dynamic UI.

Templating engines like ejs doesn't have this issue, let say that you want reusable component, you can do something like this:

    <%-render(""template/header"")%>
        <%-render(""template/mainStructure"")%>
    <%-render(""template/footer"")%>

For updating UI, you can do something like this:  


    function buttonClicked(){
    let userLoggedIn = false
        document.getElementById(""someDiv"").innerHTML = ejs.render(""template/content"", {state: ""somestate"", state2: userLoggedIn })
    //I can wrap the code above into a function so it looks something like this:
    RenderElem(""someDiv"", ""template/content"", {state: ""somestate"", state2: userLoggedIn })
    }

You can achieve the same thing above with React but as your UI gets more complex and hierarchical this is when the problem starts.

I have a medium-sized hobby project that I'm planning to rewrite the frontend entirely in ejs/eta and it's a big, time-consuming decision. What do you guys think about this? Do you feel like you waste most of your time fighting with React rerenders rather than creating UI?",2023-05-22 13:45:46

18xnfyj,I have a potential client with a really bad Wordpress site that I'm considering converting to a Hugo site and host on Netlify. What could possibly go wrong?,"So long story short, my Mom is a secretary at a doctors office and they have a really messy website that was made in Wordpress. I don't have access to the stats, but I don't think it gets a lot of traffic and only really exists for the business to look more professional.

However, the website itself is in really bad shape. There any many broken images and [the page has some of the worst PageSpeed scores I have ever seen](https://i.imgur.com/ks31j3R.png). But at the same time, the website is comprised of 5 very basic pages, that I could easily rewrite the code in basic HTML and CSS within an hour. I really don't understand what the advantage of Wordpress would be either, as there is no blog content or anything I can see that would take advantage of Wordpress.

So with all that in mind, I figured it would be a great idea to just rewrite the website in Hugo and give his secretaries an in person tutorial on writing the markdown files, so they could update the website when need be. As the secretaries not knowing how to update the website has been a bit of an issue. I could also write a simple Python script to push the markdown files to github and then have Netlify build the site from there.

However, I absolutely hate Wordpress. I think it's bloated garbage that gives people who probably shouldn't have the power to make websites the power to make website through it's no code mentality. But I also admit that this bias of mine could be clouding my judgement. So are there any downsides I have overlooked by moving to a Netlify+Hugo stack vs Wordpress. Heck, is there some reason I am not understanding as to what advantages could come from a simple 5 page static site would need to be made in Wordpress?",2024-01-03 16:30:11

14z9quw,Does frontend development exist anymore?,"It seems to me that every new ""frontend"" framework that comes up is strongly advocating for SSR and an integrated backend, and IMO that is not the job for a frontend developer.

Frameworks like SvelteKit or Next.js are the biggest perpetrators of this, with both now recommending to never use the ""raw"" frontend framework (eg. Svelte or React with Vite), but instead built your entire frontend as a part of your new SvelteKit/Next.js backend.

This simply doesn't make sense to me, because now frontend developers have multiple roles to fill, such as developing an entire backend, making them actually full-stack developers but still labeled and paid as frontend.

It also makes it harder to build webapps with non-traditional data flows, like with websockets.

I also feel like the actual backend part of these hybrid frameworks is not fully-featured. Sure, you can make a simple website that is practically just a pretty UI for your database, but anything more complex than that requires very hacky solutions.

Even something as simple as integrating Firebase Auth into your SvelteKit app is a pain because you have to manage your own session cookie and use the firebase-admin package, and ditch the Firebase client SDK entirely because it isn't compatible with SvelteKit's form actions feature and requires JS, which is against SvelteKit's ""progressive enhancement"" push.

Don't get me wrong, I love the new SSR movement in the webdev world and I enjoy the new frameworks such as SvelteKit and Next.js (even my portfolio is built in Next.js), I just have a problem with what ""frontend"" means nowadays.",2023-07-14 07:38:35

I’m 23 and have a WordPress Web Design solo company. It’s almost 5 years old.

It’s going great, I make 5x the national average net salary as a solopreneur in Central / South Europe and can do “whatever” I want (still not enough for a typical rich lifestyle, but I live very comfortable).

My business comes 80% from 1 agency where they outsource the work to me and then 20% from various direct clients and maitenance packages. I do the operational tasks 95% of my working capacity so the strategic tasks often get delayed because I simply cannot do it all. 

Which means that whenever there is less work coming from the 1 big client, I always get afraid that there will be significantly less work which would impact my income. 

I also sometimes think that I don’t do anything really valuable since I’m just designing and developing websites with page builders all the time. My service isn’t really measurable so there isn’t any clear indicator that what I did significantly helped someone.

What can I do to stop feeling like that? I’m sure that acquiring more clients to not rely on one big client should be the way to go but tbh I can’t seem to find anyone that would fit in this partnership. 

There’s also the imposter syndrome kicking in whenever I show my work to someone and I think they will only see “Page builder made websites”.

12ylzz4,Am I screwed?,"Help me work through this, as I'm just a very inexperienced to this profession. Let me lay out what's going on:

In January of this year, I accepted a job to be a media person at a local church - taking pictures, managing social media, and updating the website. Small church, but visibly growing. The website was in pretty rough shape and needed a facelift. The website manager was passed from person to person over the years - from what I've gathered, it's been managed primarily by 3 people in the last 10 years.

I've been using WordPress, and designing the website with Divi Builder. One thing I wanted to make sure I get done is updating the PHP, which is currently at 7.2.34. You may know that to update this, it needs to be done through the hosting service. Here's the issue;

The guy that created the website and therefore created the InMotion account information passed away a few years ago. He left his email with his ex-wife, which she was able to share his LastPass information with me and the account information was stored there! But it was wrong and I wasn't able to log in. We tried resetting the password, but wasn't able to work it out. I chatted with support, and the only way to log in is to either find the credit card used to pay for the service (of which was lost years ago) or submit a court-ordered document proving we need access to that information.

After this, I decided maybe the best route was to switch to a new hosting service altogether. I was hoping it was going to be as cancelling InMotion and adding the site to WP-Engine.

This uncovered another layer to this problem - where I need to login to WordPress to find my SFTP information from the last hosting site, which I don't have access to. From what I'm understanding, this login is also lost. It's different than the WP Admin login, which I can get into just fine.

I feel like I've run out of options. Court ordered document is beginning to sound like the least amount of work. The next option I can think of is to nuke the current website and just start over, making sure that all login information is stored and updated. I would be interested in changing the domain name along with the hosting service, but I don't see how I can keep the work I've done if I did this.

TL;DR - I need to update my PHP, so I switched hosting services. I don't have the login information to the old hosting service or the regular WordPress login. Now I have a headache I didn't bargain for.

&#x200B;

Update: I asked if anyone on staff might have any ideas where I can get the hosting service password and one of the staff members said, ""oh yeah I've got that right here"" so we're in. Thanks.",2023-04-25 15:03:00
12gbj1p,I don't understand the benefit of MVC architecture,"I come from nodejs background and I use express framework all the time. Lately I've been curious about mvc so I learned php with codeigniter library.

Model = handle backend stuff like database

View = html files, rendering

Controller = http request handling

I don't understand how this architecture helps in anyway, if anything it feels like a handicap.

For example:
I want the user to be able to view their data from my website at [https://website.com/data](https://website.com/data)

What I would need to do in nodejs:

-create the path handler app.get(""/data"")

-inside that app.get(), pull the data from database

-send response to the user, can be in json format/using templating engine like ejs for ssr for html page response

What I would need to do in codeigniter:

-Create my view/html files to send to the user

-Create a controller to handle the path ""/data""

-Create a model to interact with the database

-Pull data from model inside controller and pass it into view (ssr).

-Send response to the user

The main logic of using something like express and mvc is similar. But I don't understand the benefit of separating the model, view, and controller. In express I can do everything in one block of code or if I want to make everything more tidy I can make a class specifically to pull data from database. MVC forces you to separate these into 3 parts for no good reason.

Can anyone explain to me why MVC is still so popular and what the actual benefits are over the ""traditional"" design?",2023-04-09 06:49:54

1agccyi,What do you wish websites would do that they don't already?,"A couple off the top of my head:

1. Customizability: As it is, ""hey, we got dark mode now!"" is something people actually get excited about. But why only 2 choices (if you're lucky)? I'd like to see a lot more customizability on websites than that. It wouldn't take much to let users choose their own colors. Maybe someone wants the bg to be yellow, all the text to be pink and the highlights to be green.
2. Complexity: I'd love to see sites let the user decide how complex they want it. Sites with many features are great if you need them but quite often a lot of users don't need half the tools on the screen and it's just more confusing and cluttered. For example, Toggl is a great time tracker, but I use it just for personal use. I don't need client billing, team projects, etc. I wish I could just choose to see the time tracker and get rid of everything else -- hide it in settings to be turned on at a later date if/when needed.
3. Layout customizability (for apps on my phone, especially): I often use my phone one handed (left) because I'm carrying something with the other, etc. Problem is, it's damn near impossible for me to reach over to the right side of the screen with my thumb. I wish I could move certain icons from the right to the top left. For example, when I open an app to type a message, the keyboard pops up with the emoji icon on the bottom left and the mic icon on the right. I want to dictate something but can't get to the mic icon so I need to contort myself into a pretzel, almost dropping my phone in the process, to get to it. I wish I could put the mic icon right next to the emoji icon so that they're both on the left side. Or switch them. Whatever. There are many apps I wish I could do this with. In Notes, new note is on the right and nothing at all on the left. It would be nice if users could decide where to put these icons themselves.

What do you wish was a thing in most software you use?",2024-02-01 14:32:52

19be698,I created a custom GPT that designs and builds React components,"Hey everyone! Wanted to share this side project that I've been hacking on: [ComponentGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-NlYGvLpSo-componentgpt)

It's a conversational GPT that will help you outline UI/UX that you are trying to build, and then actually generate it using the design system + styling method of your choice. It's powered under-the-hood by the main product I'm working on, [Magic Patterns](https://www.magicpatterns.com/).

* Some learnings I had while building this custom GPT:  
I was impressed with OpenAI's GPT builder. I'd encourage everyone to give it a try. In my opinion, it's an incredibly powerful no-code tool, and I genuinely think we are closer than ever to a world where ANYONE can build an app that delivers value
* Custom GPTs seem like they listen to your prompts much more and do noticeably perform differently than normal ChatGPT
* For very specific tasks, I can 100% see custom GPTs replacing normal website UI. I imagine seeing more Lemonade Mayas in the world, where the conversational UI provides a phenomenal user experience.

I'm personally pretty excited for what GPTs have in store for frontend. Let me know any feedback on [ComponentGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-NlYGvLpSo-componentgpt), and thanks for checking it out!

191ib9t,What Wrong With Memorizing Code?,"I have been working on web development for about six months, and have been enjoying the learning process so far. I have gotten to the place where I feel comfortable using HTML and CSS. I am now learning the DOM and how to use Javascript in web development. 

So, that's where I currently am. One thing that I have been doing practically the entire time is memorizing terms and code. I noticed that I was naturally retaining the knowledge really well, and decided that I should make an active attempt to memorize the content. 

I have used the ""mind palace"" technique and it has allowed me to memorize several dozen pages of code and terms. I have a sheet terms on file to check to make sure that I am actually remembering everything. 

I have found this to be useful while working on projects as it allows me to spend less time googling concepts and gives me a much greater understanding of the code than I feel that I would have had otherwise. 

But when I read writings and watch videos from established web developers, they all say that I shouldn't memorize code because you can always goggle it. While that's true, I still feel like memorizing has brought me more benefits than not doing it. 

So, what am I missing? Memorizing seems to have benefited me, but I am still a beginner in web development, and I realize that there is still a lot that I have to learn. I just want to make sure that I an not making some kind of error that will cause me problems in the future.",2024-01-08 10:35:23

You can do spatial sound, networking and high quality visual experiences, while also integrating with any other web tech.  Not entirely as good visually as native VR apps, but with open source software and without VR app store gatekeeping.  

But when I say ""theoretically"", its' because no-one seems to do it.  The community is super tiny and there's so few things being developed and shared.

Hi guys, I'm a Frontend Dev and haven't really focused on extreme details of making the website responsive for a wide array of devices. I've always worked on building web apps, but never really focused on making responsive designs and I just got a project where I need to build a website according to the Figma design provided.

All the things are specified as usual. But the thing that bugs me the most, is the fact that all the desktop/laptop pages are made according to a frame - 1440px \* 1024px and then there is a mobile version. Thats it.

My laptop's innerWidth & innerHeight is 1475px \* 674px. Even if I use all the responsive design practices, it skews so much that I cannot think of a way to design it properly.

How to work on such projects and what are the device dimensions that I need to make sure the website looks good on? Do I need to develop the website considering the difference of the height as well as width? (Like it should be good on both the 1440px \* 1024px and 1475px \* 674px and Does this applies to smaller laptops as well?)",2023-10-11 10:00:54

11ymfwy,"Got rejected for not doing a CSS/JS code challenge their way, despite them giving minimal rules","**I’ve gotten a lot of great feedback from you guys so I appreciate the insight on the challenge. However, there are also people being extremely dickish in the comments so I’m done responding. This was not a post to receive sympathy, hence why I enjoy the top comments on the thread but some of you are the kind of people who only like crapping on others and rudely criticizing them because you’ve got nothing else better to do, so I’m done.  Thank you to those who provided mature, well-thought out responses.**

For context I’m a newly graduated student with a web dev degree. I have lots of work experience outside of web dev but it’s what I majored in so I figured I would apply to this job asking for a junior web dev with next to no experience (0-1yrs, or so the listing says). I apply and the person to respond is the president of the company. He seems eager and gives me a coding challenge. The rules were to modify three lines of HTML text into three animated shapes without touching the HTML code and instead using CSS/JavaScript. We could ask for help if we needed and that the purpose of the test was not to get stuck but to see what we can do but I came up with a solution that satisfied the requirements so I didn’t need too much help outside of some clarification on the rules.

So I did the challenge and asked him if I can do it without using JavaScript which he says I can and then I get to work but I used JavaScript anyway because it was easier. I just used JavaScript to replace the text after the page loaded (which wasn’t me touching the initial code) and replacing it with the code to make the animation because it was what I knew how to do. I did that and sent it off. This morning I get a email response back with a rejection, stating that I didn’t do it “properly” and all I did was just work around modifying the code by using JavaScript (which was one of the ways I was allowed to do it BTW — never specified otherwise) and nitpicked the animation even though they were like 95% similar, and mentions that I didn’t use JavaScript for the animation portion even though he explicitly clarified that it can all be done with CSS. He then goes on to basically say I didn’t have the expertise needed for the position and then tells me to look into n-th child in CSS (which is fair, I can always learn).

Okay, so basically he just wanted me to solve the problem his way. I successfully completed the challenge (modified the old HTML to become an animation he specified without touching the original code) and he just didn’t like the way I did it and gave me the run around with the rules stating that I didn’t have to use JavaScript but then that the way I did it was basically not possible (using css animation and JS for text replacement).

I’m just at a loss for words. I spent 4 hours on that code. It was basically a part time shift figuring out how to solve the challenge and I got rejected over rules that were made to make sure he could bend them if he wanted to, it seems. He should have specified and said ways I could NOT manipulate the code, instead of saying all I had to do was not touch the code. Idk it seems like a dumb nitpick but I’m not an expert so I just thanked him for his time. My biggest problem is honestly not even with the critique or “not doing it properly”. It was that this was for a position with supposedly no experience in a junior role and I got criticized for not having the “expertise” for the challenge despite following every rule and completing the problem, just not the “right” way? Then teach me, I am a “junior” that completed the challenge within the realm of the rules after all.

It just sucks. I’ve been job hunting for months and this was one of my first dev role leads. It does not make me feel the least bit good about any kind of job outlook.

Edit: I’m not claiming to be a coding aficionado, so don’t be a dick in the comments about my skills or condescendingly ask to see my code. I got my feedback and am learning accordingly. I’m not looking for any more feedback of it on Reddit.

I’ll keep the post up so that people who have run into similar issues can seek advice here but I won’t be responding to anything anymore.",2023-03-22 15:26:55

Copy pasting markup instead of just putting the changing parts in an array and looping over it, and things like that

Long story (really) short: I'm probably going to be in the very fortunate case of being able to choose what to work with in the near future.

The options are PHP/Symfony or Typescript (backend only, no idea which framework).

I'm returning to web development after quite some time in other software-related positions, so I would have to up-skill and close some gaps whatever tech I end up choosing and I don't have strong personal opinions on either.

Tailwind restrict to use any size of unites like we can't set own font-size we can't set own transition duration (like if I want to set transition duration: 2000ms there is no class for that).
You need to define same property again and again for each html element, you can't select them all at once like vanilla CSS.
your html code looks very messy every element have class and class.
These frameworks have a large number of predefined classes you only use them for your styling.

I would tutor a lot and would often write some of my notes on there and then organize them into mini tutorials and have experiments and what not on there for other students to run.  I want to have that again and will start by adding my Python website notes to it and hopefully actually have the website I'm trying to write on there.    


Not sure how well I articulated all of that, but it's reddit I'm sure someone will let me know  lol.  

My main question is back in the day I had used some type of template that did 99 percent of the work for me for my own wiki page but I can't remember what it was and I'm looking to find it or some similar replacement.  

Any direction is appreciated.  ",2024-02-15 01:08:29

I had made a web app in vanilla JS with everything in one file, No separate back-end. So after learning node and express I've been modifying it to have separate server side and client side code. I'm having trouble to decide how to decide what functionality to be kept where? For now, I've made a couple of API calls that come from back-end. Is it supposed to be the whole encapsulation thing that i have to put all the processes in back-end or how?

Another function(say B), is called on a mouse click that calls runs a loop calling the function A with incrementing dates to create sort of animation.

One day the customer reports that the customer has forgotten the password. A ""forgot password"" would not work because the email address is no longer available.

The customer asks to send him the password. Then the customer wants to log in and renew the email address.

Scenario 2

A fraudster knows that the customer logs into the website with the email address [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com). The customer has not renewed the domain.

17rh5kp,Is it ok to compare two large strings to see if they're the same?,"...or should I convert both strings to a smaller hash first and compare the hashes instead?

I have a custom and simple stringToHash function btw:

     let hash = 0;
        if (string.length === 0) return hash;
    
        for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
            const char = string.charCodeAt(i);
            hash = (hash << 5) - hash + char;
        }
    

For context, I have a large 50 row html table that was generated from a JSON dataset coming from an API  ... and my page is refreshing / reloading this data every few seconds to get updates. Once it gets data, formats the JSON data into <tr> table data, and then writes this content inside my page's table (deleting the existing rows first of course)   


Everything works great, but  problem is if there are not updates from the API, the table keeps getting refreshed, and re-rendered, even causing the table to flicker (because the existing content gets deleted first and the table gets repopulated with the same content)

&#x200B;

So I figured I would create a condition where if the latest content from API resorts to the same html code, then I will skip updating the table's contents. 

  
Right now, I have applied direct string comparison (if old\_html\_code == new\_html\_code) and it works.... the table is not getting updated unnecessarily. However, I dont know if this is consuming too much memory or is slow (I'm testing on my local server, so everything's fast), and if there's a better way to do this like comparing hashes instead but that means I have to hash the html codes and that may even be slower (?)

I would appreciate some thoughts. Thank you!

I've received very, very few messages about it, but there are a couple of people who've said their ISP won't allow them to access it. When they switch to their mobile device, it works fine. 

Because it's happening so infrequently (I've never once witnessed it myself), it's really hard to determine how widespread the issue is, or if it's something more related to a VPN or firewall.

It seems to be a very similar issue described by this person: 

[https://community.cloudflare.com/t/worker-is-not-available-from-certain-providers-in-the-us/555763](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/worker-is-not-available-from-certain-providers-in-the-us/555763)

My gut says the ISP is blocking it based on the domain or DNS configuration, but from what I've read, if it really is blocked at the ISP level, there's not much I can do about it. Frustrating. 

More details: 

\- The domain is connected to a Cloudflare worker. The worker itself manages all the DNS records. I've created none of them manually. 

\- The domain is several months old at this point.

Please let me know if you're unable to visit it, especially if you're seeing a ERR\_CONNECTION\_RESET or ERR\_SSL\_PROTOCOL\_ERROR error. Also, if you have leads on how to track this down and solve it, I'd love to hear them.

We do have a website, but I was looking into ""cooler"" variations of the domain name that uses our company name and found Original Company that used to use our company name, and was apparently a prescription insurance provider based out of San Antonio Texas. We are in an entirely different, not healthcare related, industry.

But the .com I'm interested in hasn't had content since Nov. 2013 (literally 10 years ago!), and typing it in directly only gives a ""website cannot be found"" error by the browser. It seems like there was a redirect at one point, but trying to go to that redirected website now makes Firefox stop me to tell me it's a potentially dangerous website.

Even Original Company's logo trademark was cancelled in 2018.

In looking at the whois registry, it appears [Big Name Insurer] is paying [Web Services Company] to protect the IP of their ""clients"":

The Registrant, Administrative, and Technical Contact for the domain is Big Name Insurer. There is a phone number and email, but further into it, there is some contact information for Web Services Company, and their website talks about domain protection as an offered service.

It appears the domain is currently just renewed every year in late January by Web Services Company.

So, I have questions.

First, we don't just have piles of money. I would love for that domain to just get dropped and not renewed in 3 months so I can grab it. That would be the perfect world scenario. But even if I were to approach a third party and make an offer for the domain, even $1000 would be too much right now. So does anyone have experience with Internet business that can advise me on which of the two parties I should approach? Ideally, I would like to say I brought it to someone's attention that the company is defunct and they are wasting their money, so they just tell me they'll delete it from their renew list, but on the other hand, we're talking about a multi-billion dollar industry, so would anyone even talk to me?

Can this even be sold, considering the industry it is in, or would I just be wasting my time until someone just cites HIPAA and the risk that I may try to steal someone's identity to disrupt Big Name as a reason that they could never, ever, sell me that domain name, even for a client that appears to have gone bankrupt 10 years ago? After all, if I was that crazy, I could just steal the old logo for free and start there.

And if the domain can be for sale, would they just give me an astronomical price because I expressed an interest in it? Or could I go a different way to just force the domain to not be renewed in January?

1777lyx,I want to ask for a raise but is it too soon?,"Hello reddit,

I've been coding since 2019 and currently, I'm working remotely for a U.S.-based company while residing in a cost-effective part of Mexico. I'm employed through an agency, handling my HR and accounting. After their deductions and taxes, I'm left with approximately $2,500 USD per month, just enough to cover the essentials.

 While I acknowledge that some developers in my region might earn even less, I can't help but hear stories of legendary developers in Mexico making six-figure incomes. For context, I bring three years of professional experience and a history of freelancing. My current job, spanning seven months, hasn't exactly followed the path I initially anticipated. Instead of the promised indefinite contract, I've navigated through a series of short-term agreements, including one-month and three-month contracts. Now, they're suggesting a six-month commitment. 

I'm contemplating not signing for the following reasons:

1. My wife contributes significantly to our household income, so we're not financially stressed.

2. I believe I could potentially earn more through freelancing after a few months.

3. My confidence in my skills has grown, and I suspect they may be worth more.

4. I don't really want to lock myself into that rate for 6 months

 Although I lack a formal degree, I've taken the lead in developing critical components of our site, including home pages, search pages, and partner (investor) pages. I've also initiated testing and laid the foundation for our Cypress tests. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in our Storybook implementation. I actively participate in peer reviews and frequently assist my colleagues in resolving issues in their work. 

Though I encountered some challenges during my initial months with the company, I've reached a point where my boss has acknowledged my integral and invaluable contribution to the team. I'm also a native English speaker, so communication has never been an issue with my team (I've noticed this being a huge issue with other outsource devs).

My lifestyle can be best described as ""decent."" I rent a three-bedroom home within a gated community, and My children receive private schooling at the top school in our city. That's about it. I drive an old beater car donated to me by my sister after she wrecked it. I only wear Hanes colored undershirts since the 5 pack is dirt cheap, and I only buy new shoes every few years once they finally wear out the soles.

Given my rather modest standard of living, it seems to me that I should be earning more. I don't feel like I'm being unreasonable since I'm not out here ripping off the company living in a third world country as a ""king"". Therefore, I'm considering requesting a modest raise. Ideally, I would like to make around $3,000 USD, but I would be willing to settle for $2,750 USD. Your insights and advice on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated.

150e9bi,Would you buy a platform similar to Frontend Mentor for backend challenges?,"Hello, starting off sorry if this post has to be taken down. I am interested in seeing what you guys think about an idea I had and to see if there are any other similar products.

The platform is called **Backendo (**[**backendo.io**](https://backendo.io/) **<- Not a real website)** here is a description of what it is and what it offers:

Backendo is a platform similar to [frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io/) where you can find Backend related challenges based on your skill lever (Begginer, Intermediate, Advanced).

Backendo also offers a paid tier (Backendo PRO) which is 5$ a month or 50$ a year, the pro subscription offers complete tutorials and solutions for all challenges on the platform in 4 different frameworks (Next.js API Routes, tRPC with Next.js, Nest.js, Express.js). Pro also offers a full suite of Test UIs, Test UIs are little frontend applications to test your API, for example a Test UI for Authentication will contain a form which makes a request to an API the user provides, and the User's API will have to match the UIs security requirements (for example using an httpOnly cookie instead of storing the auth token in localstorage). Backendo may also offer a full platform where recruiters can find you, but this is only an idea and not something set in stone.

The costs of running the platform will be very low, and scale as the website grows (The core tech stack relies on Next.js and PlanetScale).

Would you buy a product like this if you were a begginer? Again I want to say sorry if this kind of post is not allowed.",2023-07-15 15:02:30

So I was going to start working on this new website, and thought of using Elementor (a frontend drag and drop plugin) for WordPress just for the frontend whilst programming everything else in the theme files.

I was wondering whether this is something you guys thought of doing or actively do? If not, why have you chosen to program the frontend from ground up? Apart from flexibility, I would imagine you have templates to edit for the frontend rather than programming the design from ground up.

I would imagine most WordPress vulnerability issues are caused by plugins, so if minimal plugins were used, are there other factors where you wouldn't use WordPress?

In my naive view of the world, I feel like error logs should almost always be empty. If a 500 error on your site occurs, it's noted in a log somewhere. Somebody monitors the logs, and when an error happens, somebody fixes the problem. Then you don't get that error anymore.

our plataform will have: user autentication , payments , userdata collection in a DB, vector databases for the LLM, APIs, we also would like to have good scalability

So for that would Django or node be the best choice? My part of the project is setting up the GPT API and the langchain, and that will be made in python so i could at least offer some limited help, but in the flip side the other 3rd guy knows JS react so he could help with node as well

Svelte is an upgrade in every sense to React. Performance, ease of use, dev performance (yarn dev is10-20 times faster compared to Next for me), etc.

It's not just Sveltekit. Qwik, Astro and many other great frameworks ARE an improvement to React and it's own frameworks.

I'm not that knowledgeable about the ins and outs of either of these softwares. I don't really know the true extent of what DW or VSCode can actually do.

# I run a small nonprofit organization (with a small budget). A friend of mine who is a skilled WordPress developer built us a website on a low-bono basis but now he’s too busy to maintain it. 

# We found another low-bono developer but he doesn’t like WordPress and is trying to convince us to switch to his preferred stack, Astro + Sanity.

# We are never going to have massive traffic or any complex/dynamic pages (we have a volunteer portal built in Bubble, but that’s a separate thing). What we need is a beautiful site, plus the ability for our staff to edit pages and create simple pages themselves (without waiting on the part-time dev for small stuff.) 

# The new dev convinced me he’ll be able to set us up with a situation using Sanity where we can very easily edit any page and even create nice-looking simple new pages from templates when needed (the demo he gave me actually looked a lot easier and cleaner than editing in Elementor). The other big downside he pointed to with WP was multi-language functionality being more laborious, though I’m still undecided whether we actually need our site to be bilingual.

# However, my biggest concern with Astro is whether we’ll be able to find another low-bono developer next time we need someone new. There’s a small community of developers who are willing to work low-bono for orgs in our sector, but not so large that any of them probably already know this stack.

197y17y,It's client-server not client/server,"I've been thinking a lot about how websites work, specifically the relationship between clients and servers. Today, two different school of thoughts in web development got me pondering about this even more.

## Server Purists

On one hand, we have the Server Purists. These folks believe that little or no work should be done on the client, and everything should be evaluated on the server. They argue that the client should only display to the user the final state of that evaluation.

In fact, this school of thought will go as far as making a button click interaction on the client to increment a counter and then send that increment to the server in order to compute it and retrieve the result.

What I've found is that server purists hail from the days when JavaScript ran only on the client, so these folks mostly use languages other than JavaScript on the server. The need to not do any work on the client has led to some interesting technologies like [Phoenix Liveview](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html), [Rails Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/), and of course, [Laravel Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com).

I get it, really. For a while, I considered myself a server purist as well, and that's the whole reason why [The Boring JavaScript Stack](https://sailscasts.com/boring) was so enticing to me - let's move some of the work of building an SPA to the server.

## Client Enthusiasts

On the other hand, we have the Client Enthusiasts. These folks are mostly JavaScript lovers who want their websites and web applications to run exclusively on their users' devices. Client Enthusiasts arose from the heyday of SPAs (Single Page Applications).

You would think that since JavaScript runs on both the client and the server, the Client Enthusiasts would take that as a cue to distribute work between the client and the server.

I can make arguments for both sides, and there are valid points, really. But to me, few things are absolutely and completely right in software development. That's why you'd get the classic ""it depends"" answer in our circle because it really ""depends"".

## Client-Server Pragmatists

What if you don't have to choose between being exclusively a Client Enthusiast or a Server Purist? What if there's a third way? What if you can be a Client-Server Pragmatist?

You see, the web was designed in a client-server architecture. Being a Client-Server Pragmatist is not a new concept; it simply means you are mature enough to distribute work in alignment with the original architecture of the web.

I love this definition on Wikipedia:

> The client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.

Based on the definition above, it is evident that work was intended to be distributed between two roles: a server, who provides the resources, and a client, who requests those resources.

I have found that both the Server Purists and Client Enthusiasts, in their insistence on one side being the absolute truth, have negatively impacted web development and user experiences. The Client Enthusiasts, in particular, led us into the era of Spinnerfests by burdening the client with excessive responsibilities.

Client enthusiasts are also the folks who make Ship less JavaScript™️ a thing because they just throw megabytes of JavaScript at their users' devices to download, parse, and evaluate.

Server purists also hurt user experiences because for every interaction, there is a round trip to the server, so their apps are not as snappy as they should be. I don't know about you, but I don't want every button click on a page to make a request to the server to update the UI state.

Client-Server Pragmatists believe that both the client and the server are equally important, and a great user experience on the web must have a balanced distribution of work between the client and the server.

This belief is practical, pragmatic, and grounded in reality.

So the deliverable would be really plain jane type of html/css/js stuff.  We're just looking for a base to save some time. We'd do all the real styling from our design system and obviously all the real js logic.

Emphasis on clean semantic markup, responsive builds, reliability and good communication.

This type of work will most likely go within Bootstrap 5, that's pretty much our standard for this type of work here.

It's typesafe and supports go-to definition, i.e. you can call `api.auth.login(...)` from the frontend and

1. get intellisense
2. know if you passed the correct types
3. ctrl-click on the ""`login`"" part and get taken to the `login` method in your backend

13eooam,How can I find clients if I suck at designing websites?,"Hey everyone! I'm a student Full Stack Dev, and I've completed hobby projects with a tech stack of Flask, React, and Tailwind.css (or SASS). I've yet to complete a project for another person and therefore haven’t been paid in any capacity for this kind of work, if that context helps.


In the past, my method for finding prospective clients was to look for small businesses advertising online or locally and check out their websites. If there was a major flaw in their website’s design, I'd essentially put them on my ""potential client list"" and start forming a plan to get them as a client. That plan was to explain how the flaws in their website were decreasing their conversion rate, page load speed, or just making them look untrustworthy. Then I'd send them one or two wireframes that would solve those issues asking them which they'd prefer, then offer to hop on a phone call to explain my services. I realized that for this to work though, I’d need to have a concrete understanding of web design. I pivoted and started learning about web design and graphic design as a whole a few months ago, and I'm at the point where I at least know *what* I need to learn, but it would still take a while to learn get that skill to a level where I'm comfortable with charging for my designs.


I guess the core of the problem is I don't know how I can be sure that my development skills will provide value to a client when they have an existing website, unless their website's design is utter shit. Especially when many of these clients are using WordPress, Wix, or SquareSpace and my custom site would be hosted with Flask on a DigitalOcean droplet, so building their site would involve all the headaches of migrating domains, account management / pricing details, and potential CMS integration.

TLDR What's worth learning it you want to skip the react hype.

I've missed the bus on React. I know the whole world is using it, but it's in such a hype phase that it would be impossible to stand out. Everyone with a text editor is styling themselves as a React expert. Which explains why so many sites are horribly broken.

I know is possible do using only CSS,HTML and Javascript, but I would like to invest in a stack that could allow me work in a company in a future if I change my mind.

About me:

My fresh stack now is: Html, Css, Javascript, jQuery,Bootstrap & NodeJS

I already worked with PHP, Laravel (loved it) and NestJS (just a short time)

I tried to learn React but I dunno I couldnt feel motivated, I am thinking to invest in VueJS

Id like learn something for mobile too.

So based upon what I said what should be the stack that could fit my needs in a short therm (i would like to start freelances by May or Jun, so Id use my freetime now to learn).

I have recently been thinking about the infrastructure of a crowdfunding platform and wondered whether NestJS would be a good fit for that (given that I heard that JS as a language is unreliable, despite TS and the new ES6 features being added to the ecosystem), and then it stroke me that a number large companies have built their backend with Django, which lead me to wonder why we never hear the same narrative about Python even though it is a dynamically typed language as well.

Before TOP I had basically no knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS. Well I knew how to make a HTML boilerplate, and paragraphs.

And in CSS i knew how to select id and classes (but not beyond that)

And in JS i knew how to console log hey with a for loop a certain amount of times.

So far Ive completed every project up until TicTacToe, actually this one is kinda complered too, I just need to finish up nice css and other DOM things.

Thing is, I feel so freaking disappointed since I relied heavily on chatgpt on TicTacToe (the previous projects was only my code and help from discord).

What I mean by relying on chatgpt, isnt that I copy pasted its code and asking it to build it for me.

I used it when I ran into an issue. For example, I didnt know how to connect the winning combinations with the the array that contains the moves. And the moves get added on specific indexes of the array depending on the DOM dataset.index attribute.

I feel like this is what chatgpt is for but same time I feel so disappointed since I couldnt do it as smooth as previous projects.

But a part of me says ”it’s okay” since I actually understand every single line of my code and can probably recreate it (…maybe) again.

1628jof,Was I in the wrong?,"I recently interviewed a bunch of candidates for a senior backend eng role. The question I asked them was a system design question which of course required a few APIs, database and other components. I asked the question in an open ended way and gave candidates full freedom to design it however they want to see what they could come up with. I then asked them clarifying questions based on whatever decision ""they"" made. So one of the candidatea said he is going to use MySQL for the database, so I asked him to just write down a few tables that he would need and of course the necessary columns. I followed that up with asking them to write a query that required a very basic sum() and Group By. The candidate said he cannot remeber the MySQL query and if he can google it. To me this was a red flag because 1) this was a sr backend role 2) he chose the MySQL option. So I told him no because the query if very basic and if he google it then the answer is obvious. So today he left a negative Glassdoor review on how the interview process was antiquated and he was not allowed to Google. Our interview process only has 2 steps 1) into call (culture fit / communication) 2) System design with a few implementation questions (no leetcode). Should I have let him google it? Also is this process antiquated? I thought by not having 4-5 rounds I'm doing them a favor.

195ho6s,How often to use CSS frameworks?,"Hi everyone, I am a pre-uni student and recently I tried to pick up Web development through online courses, starting with front-end development first. I have learnt some CSS and now learning about Bootstrap. The ""teacher"" in the course was listing down the pros and cons of using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, and one of the pros is that the theme across the website will be decently professional and consistent, which makes the website look clean.

However, I was thinking that if the themes are so consistent, if most people use CSS frameworks, won't alot of websites look the same. I am planning to use the stuff i learnt to build my own personal projects for my portfolio and I am abit worried that if I rely on CSS frameworks, my website would just look the same as everyone else's and that might be a detriment. However, if I do not rely on CSS frameworks, designing a website will be much much more troublesome, difficult and time consuming.

Hence, I am wondering how often do more experienced people actually use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and how often should I write my own custom CSS instead for web design? Thanks for any advice given!",2024-01-13 06:32:37

16xtga4,New job: (almost) impossible taks,"So I got a new job (actually my first web dev fulltime position, before that I was a freelancer - and I had some very solid clients that I can still return to). They (the new job) have assigned me multiple tasks on a system (on different eshops) that has an extremely overpriced API that (their) clients dont want to buy. (the company I am working for has not worked with this system much before, so it is new for them too)

The eshop system is closed on purpose (it is not possible to run my own php, only javascript and html).

The clients want changes like updating billing info after each order (I have come up with a creative solution that uses the form in the settings in the background and uses user storage - the downside is that the user has to enter password before ordering for it to properly update).

Another one of these tasks - a custom product calculator - I have to resort to manipulating the order price by creating an empty product and add xxx of it to the cart to cover the price.

I have also considered that I would create a widget for that instead. That would obviously come with its own set of limitations.

And more tasks like that. It is a shit show. (especially combined with idiotic deadlines)

I had some of my own clients before that. I am seriously considering quitting the job (and getting back to freelancing) because management accepts tasks without knowing whether they are technically feasible.

It is a small company (10 - 15 people), so some mistakes like this are understandable.

It is my fifth day on the job and I already think I made a mistake by working there.

15l5gwa,You probably don't need storybook,"My last job used storybook for almost all our components. Luckily, I have more sway in my current job and convinced the team to use my hacky replacement solution instead. What is it?

Our app is a Next.js app and I just created a \`component-previews\` folder in \`pages\` and threw some middleware rules on there so only our employees can see. Then we just make previews for our components in there. 

Pros: 

\- NO CONFIG/BUILD!!! Low maintainance

\- Easy to share with designers

\- Have easy access to the live app's endpoints, database, helper hooks, \`Context\`s etc. (This can be a real pain in storybook)

Cons:

\- Preview files/code is not co-located with components like it can be with storybook files

\- Don't have some of the nifty features like the designer being able to change props from a UI.   


My last Job we always had obnoxious webpack config issues with storybook or typescript build settings (\`ts-paths\` pain, anyone?) we needed to maintain for storybook, and getting all the mocks and contexts available for them was also a PITA. We don't really need the prop changing feature as long as we just code up enough examples of different colors/variants etc. It isn't much work to copypaste the component and change a prop.

It looks like this:

I recently watched a video from Fireship about AI assistants, which delved into the rapidly evolving landscape of AI in programming. It got me thinking about the future of web development and the role of AI in our field. I'm curious to hear your thoughts and insights on this topic.

Here are some key takeaways from the video:

**AI's Growing Influence**: A staggering 41% of all code on GitHub is now AI-generated. This statistic alone speaks volumes about the increasing reliance on AI in coding. (So claims the Stabiliy AI CEO)

**Emerging AI Tools**:  


* **Google's Duet AI**: This tool integrates with IDEs, offering AI-powered chatbot interactions and coding suggestions. It's also linked with Google Cloud, enhancing cloud-based project management.

16g9szp,Is Branding and Selling Unused Domains Considered Domain Squatting? I Have a Marketing Background and Need Advice!,"Hey Redditors,

I've accumulated a handful of domains over time—some I planned to use, and others I bought because the names just struck a chord with me. I've got a background in marketing and have been thinking about developing these domains into brand packages that could either be sold or turned into viable projects.

I came across articles mentioning 'domain squatting,' and now I'm concerned. I genuinely want to add value to these domains rather than just sit on them. Is what I'm considering doing considered squatting, or is it a legitimate form of domain investing?

129wilm,"ChatGPT will change software engineering roles,but not replace them imo","

I want to start by saying I myself am not a professional coder (yet),but I think there's a lot of people paranoid about the future of programming because of Chatgpt-4 and probably shouldn't. I'm currently learning to program, but honestly don't feel scared about A.i at least no time soon.

I'll list a few of the reasons (some kinda sad actually)  why the SE role won't go away,but may change a bit:

1. The risk of A.i getting banned at some point is too high  -

I also study market news and the tik tok investigation a few days ago made me realize a lot of the regulators in charge of the tech sector have no idea how any of this stuff works.The risk that comes with that is some extremist may push a law that bans or caps the amount of funding in these companies which will slow down the timeline of A.i advancement. Any company worth their credit will definitely not want to anger their plan B (you) option if that happens.

2. The risk of A.i going rogue or messing up is way too high -

These A.I systems are nothing but code and code can be hacked so I see a future where some code for companies is done through A.I and the rest is maintained by humans offline either physically or through a legacy computer or something. This risk of companies data being stolen has probably only risen so fields like cybersecurity are going to be that much more in demand.

3. Debugging code may be more headache with chatGPT in the long run -

For those of you who are not aware or who've never used chatGPT, when you give it a prompt like ""make me starter code for a responsive business site using html css and jquery"" it's supposed to respond with the code in that exact format. 

However, sometimes it makes mistakes or ""hallucinations"" occur that require you to have some level of knowledge to fact check what it spits out is right or wrong. Depending on how much code you have to work with and what you can actually push through these A.i systems,it may just be easier to do it by hand and remove a level of doubt that the code it gave you is right or not.

It may even force you to refactor your code to make it fit which could be a problem if the answer it gives is too advanced for your current knowledge or leaves out features you don't even know you need yet.

4. A system this powerful will not be cheap for companies to use financially.

Whatever makes this learning language model do what it does will need to have a certain level of certified security to give companies a certain level of trust. However,that product will come with a very high price tag (probably a subscription model) and many companies may not be able to afford it.

5. There are a lot of advancements already that people take for granted everyday - 

I would say that smartphones are a perfect example of something that could help way more people than it does,but the average individual doesn't maximize its potential. If you want to keep A.i fun you want to always allow the user to make the final call about what happens. By doing that you're still allowing humans to make choices and we don't always make the right one.This will be where many engineers come in because a lot of people are lazy and won't want to learn how to use these A.i models the right way.So they'll pay us a bunch of money to figure it out.

6. There will always be a certain level of humans that push against this technology -

There will always be a certain level of people that just don't want to use this tech and some companies will use that as a marketing strategy. 
Rather it be a old person who's set in their ways to another programmer who just prefers interacting with humans,there's going to be companies who will pay good money to have human coders.It may even become a specialist profession like hand-tailored suit makers which will make it even more valuable.

I want to again stress I'm not a professional coder yet,but to all the aspiring devs who are doubting if they should keep learning, I say you definitely should. From a logical standpoint, even if you think it will replace this field you should still learn just in case all of this is a trend and nothing changes. To any professionals or more experienced coders, I would enjoy hearing your opinion as well!",2023-04-02 20:08:49
120r6sq,The impact of AI on my job today and tomorrow,"I just watched the [announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RfD5JiXt3A) for Github Copilot X and it got me thinking about the impact AI has already had on my job as a developer and how it might evolve in the future. I'm curious to have your opinion on this as well

I'm a fullstack web developer (React + Rails) and I've been mostly building new web applications for the past few years, usually starting on my own and growing teams to 3-4 developers before moving on to the next project when the project is mature enough.

At the start of a project, my goal is to go as fast as possible to get the first features going and I've seen that using Copilot increases my throughput of features by a lot.

However, there comes a time in the project when I can't do everything by myself and I start onboarding over developers. That's also usually when I catch up on everything I've sacrificed for the sake of speed: unit tests, documentation, refactoring, etc. The feature I'm most interested in Copilot X are related to these: automated writing of tests and documentation.

I've seen a lot of arguments in the line of ""AI will never replace developers because X"" but IMO the reality is that tools like Copilot will just decrease the time and people needed for the same amount of features. This is exactly what has always happened with new tools or frameworks.

Similarly, 10 years ago, you'd need a whole team just to setup and maintain your hosting environment and now you can use stuff like Heroku or app services to handle most stuff for you.

Did these technologies reduce the overall number of jobs available for developer? I have no idea but I don't think so.

What's your take?",2023-03-24 17:18:14
1afpgyt,Serious/Honest: Why don't yall read logs?,"Dear r/webdev,

I am not a developer. I come from a sysadmin background and do devops and cloud things nowadays. I have worked in the industry for well over a decade.

There is a common meme in my neck of the woods, that developers don’t read logs. While it evidently doesn't apply to *everyone*, my experience does confirm a pretty consistent pattern.

I post today not to complain, but to understand. Where the difficulty lies in ctrl+f’ing through pipeline logs for “error” and “fail”, or in `grep`/`tail`ing the webserver logfile for your IP.

This refusal and/or inability to do so is perceived very negatively, either as being highly disrespectful and entitled, or extremely stupid. Individual instances add up to eventually poison the working relationship.

I must admit to be pretty puzzled by it, and I ask for your help in understanding your side of, and perspective on, this issue. Only once I know where it comes from can I start thinking of ways to alleviate it in my own environments.

Thank you in advance for your help.

18ymws6,GoDaddy (afternic / dan.com) trying to sell expiring domain which I now registered and own somewhere else.,"Long story short: I was watching this .com domain as it's exact name of my business and I already own .co.uk one (I'm UK based).

I've seen that the previous owner of .com did not renew and the domain is reaching 72 days past its ""expiry date"" which is the end of ""redemption period"" and domain was now in ""pendingDelete"" state. Still (probably) available to be renewed by original owner if they wanted to.

I was checking the status every day, sometimes few times, hoping to catch it and buy it over xmas/new year period.

Suddenly, it changed status to ""deleted and available again"" BUT now it's listed on Afternic and GoDaddy shows it as ""Available"" but to buy for $1488. All ""whois"" portals now have an ad to either afternic or [dan.com](https://dan.com) or other aftermarket/auction portal.

I also received an email from Gmail account to my info@ email on my corresponding .[co.uk](https://co.uk) domain:

>Hello, are you interested in owning xxxxxxxx com? i noticed you have  .uk  version, so probably you are looking for this one too.

I thought to myself: ""Some speculator noticed, grabbed the domain before me and trying to cybersquat/sell to me"". But when I checked ICANN or any whois - the domain still is showing as ""not registered"" and in that ""deleted"" period - apparently it takes time to remove it from database and for it to actually ""drop"" and be available to register again.

So I lost all my hopes, replied to the person who emailed me saying that ""no, I am just a guy with $20 budget to spend on a domain so won't be buying it, have fun being stuck with it for a year or more"".

I still kept checking whois though as I wanted to see who actually registered it. After 5 days, I entered it on OVH and it shows as available to be registered. **I wasted no time and purchased it for $8. It is now, showing in whois as registered in OVH, where I registered it. I now own it.**

Yet - Afternic and [Dan.com](https://Dan.com) and all the whois services still show it as ""Available to Purchase"" for $1488.

I rang Afternic and they were most unhelpful. They tried to get rid of me by saying that ""it takes time"" for their records to update so surely it will just be removed once their ""system picked up on this"". which is basically of no substance. The site still shows as available to buy.

My question is - how is it possible that the site was actually put on Afternic and [Dan.com](https://Dan.com) and by whom since in that period it wasn't owned by anyone? Was it GoDaddy that did that and they used gmail account to message me about it? Was it some private person who listed it without owning it, tried to sell it to me before they put a backorder on it, trying to chance it?A scam?

What do I do in this situation? I own the domain now, but I don't want someone to think it's for sale, nor I want anyone to pay for it somewhere else as it all feels very ""scammy""",2024-01-04 20:23:12
17rpauw,"I'm so sad omegle is gone, can someone make a similar webcam site? Sharing my feelings and also constructive input","FIRSTLY MY FEELINGS

The creator of omegle started his goodbye message with a quote, so through a similar methodology let me start my text with one of my own “Communication is an innate basic human necessity, to deprive our species of such, is to diminish our very existence”  

many people loved, and many others hated the website, for those who dont know, “omegle” was a video webcam, also with a text only site option, website that let you connect with random people from anywhere, you could use tags such as “College” “LGBT” “Tiktok” “US” whatever, and it would connect you with random people. I sadly live somewhere tiny i hate, i have no opportunity here to meet people like minded or that tickle my interest and identity, i have no fun in life right now, and feel stuck, isolated,  omegle was my only option of a social outlet, where i could be myself or explore my chosen identity. Reading about the friendships made through it, it gave me so much joy connecting with others and hope to one day find love possibly, it helped me delve into my personality more and communicate with people freely with greater confidence, now i feel like my shoes and socks are missing and  i must walk barefoot in pain… strong analogy i know, but as an introvert, i feel it personally. I held on to this website like a cushion knowing, it was there if i was sad, bored, lonely, in the mood to talk, and whenever i just need to know …there is more out there, yes many good people too, and not just the shitty place i am stuck in, strangely i felt i had options on omegle, the option to connect with anyone and feel human…ignore the creeps there of course, id just simply skip em, sometimes even tell them off, now i have nothing :( and feel devastated , but eager to help hopefully find a solution. 

NOW MY CONSTRUCTIVE INPUT

A new website , heck even 2 or 3 for competition should emerge, but things take time :/ harder is how to get people on board, here is what i think is important, we need a chat site with BOTH text only, and webcam with text bar availability options, just like omegle had, as well as tag bar options where you can type whatever like “college” , “USA” , “LGBT” , “music” , “advice” whatever…, then not have AI moderators or robot ones like omegle ( i think ) mostly had, cause many times without doing anything inappropriate users would get Ip banned for weeks, just google the amount of reddit and quora posts people make saying they did nothing wrong on camera, but got Ip static banned, heck i have been looking for a job if anyone wants to hire me to moderate cam id gladly consider, i am pretty desensitised to most of what appeared on omegle, and Ip permanently blocking/or reporting sick pedos would also be awesome, i' d also wanna ban the kids there too, but simply putting in the terms of service , that each user is responsible for their own behaviour and the web owners are not liable should be enough i think, i am guessing it is what omegle did in theirs. This new website, also like omegle shouldn't require login information, though adding a form of ID would make it somewhat safer, lets be honest, most people would not wanna do that, they deserve privacy , omegle other than wrong bannings, had it all, also no CAPTHA verification every few minutes, no… 

Now if i knew how to put together  software, hardware, or create anything like page scripts or whatever you call em, lol i am great with ideas, even visuals and establishing  rules, i am super quick typing, using pc's, even manyyy omegle users were like “damn you type fast” but i am not a proper IT guy, so i alone could not even know realistically coding etc how",2023-11-09 22:45:53
17oq52q,Confused about tech stacks,"I worked as a junior dev for a while, I mainly did frontend dev using react. On the side i made personal projects using MERN stacks, as i was told to learn how to use mongodb for my backend etc. So i got accustomed to using MERN stacks and i'm ok with it now. However I am now looking for work again and i've been struggling to find anything as everywhere seems to be asking either for more years of experience (I have almost 3 years) or they want a different tech stack and/or languages. I managed to do some networking and befriended a few tech recruiters who were telling me that i should really learn SQL as many places use it over mongodb. So i've recently finished a course on MySQL and understand it pretty well.

The confusion and problem I have is about how do i actually use sql as the backend and should i be using sql and react together?

Because when I look up Tech stacks i never/rarely ever see sql and react in the same stack. The main ones i see is LAMP and MEAN/MERN. I am just very confused on where to go with my self learning as i've already got MERN down pretty well but i know i need more practice and experience with it to be 100 percent comfortable with it. But I am also being told that i should be learning SQL, so does that mean i should i also be learning PHP etc for the LAMP stack.

On another note i've also been advised to start learning C# and .net which i've already started and has been going well. So I would say that my main issue here is how does this all come together? Ive learnt MySQL but will i ever use it with a react project?

Im just very confused with how to apply the things i've learnt.

Any help on clearing my confusion would be very much appreciated.

1692gix,To new frontend developers...,"Using a frontend library such as React to build the HTML needed to create a website shouldn't be an escape to skip the fundamentals of HTML. Especially for forms.

I am currently working on an e-commerce site that uses React to build a repeater section of form elements such as inputs and selects. My task involves checking the inventory stock for each SKU when a user changes the ""size"" and ""design"" select fields in these repeater sections. 

However, my task is being hampered by the fact that every select dropdown, text field, text input and radio button, in every repeater section, share the same class name. There are no unique IDs or name attribute on any element. Also, the value attributes for checkboxes and selects are just ""1"", ""2"", etc.

I suppose that because the creator of this section used React they thought that the basics of a name attribute on a select or radio button is unnecessary because they can process everything inside the React components.

So now I have to be wrangling JavaScript to listen to which select was changed in which repeater section and what is the value and was it a size or design selection for possibly 100s of repeater sections. ",2023-09-03 17:14:19

The responsive problems are not a direct issue of Webflow and after going through my site again it now works perfectly.
I asked the question to learn more about responsive design but instead I triggered a bunch of snowflakes who want to be snarky about how this type of WebDev is beneath them aka IKEA furniture level dev. Some of you say its not WebDev because you are not writing any code, well if I added some custom written Javascript is it now considered WebDev? 🤡 Who cares what tools you use as long as it meets your requirements and yes, it is gatekeeping it is the same as saying using libraries someone else made or frameworks that do all the heavy lifting for you do not make you a real WebDev.

I bet all this has been asked before and I’ll try and find those threads as well, but I just really need to provide for my family and I don’t want to run out of time and have nothing to show for the year I’ve been unemployed. Thank you for reading this and your guidance!

18hlj3u,Is web development a good fallback for someone who’s interests aren’t in it?,"I’ve been exploring my interests across human-computer interaction and visual computing, and for a while I thought I wanted to do something at the intersection of UI/UX design and frontend web development. That was a path that was recommended to me often based on my interests and it seemed like the most obvious choice based on what courses resonated with me best. But I always wanted to learn more about GUIs and get closer to the system than web devs could really help with, curious about how operating system desktop environments work, what makes CSS animations possible, and how computers render things at all. After being introduced to graphics programming, I’ve taken a growing interest in graphics and shader development, as well as wanting to work with native and embedded application GUIs and desktop environments with Qt/QML and Gtk. If I followed my interests really I’d be living in C++ for the next three semesters until graduation.

I’m just… a bit scared. I have reasons to really really not want to be jobless when I graduate, and unfortunately the roles I’m interested in have few openings in general and fewer junior roles. I’m afraid of the market talk and the idea that I’d be sabotaging myself applying to internships and full time jobs if I left my ongoing full stack web app unfinished and went on to use C++ for the rest of my personal pursuits. I don’t even know if I should keep applying for web internships given my failure thus far and loss of interest, but I doubt in this timeframe I could make a shift to be ready for any graphics or just C++ related internships - I do have labs of interest to me though. Any input on how unrelated projects are weighed in this space and if this is a concern I need to have at all? I’m hoping that this is a non-concern and any development experience at the junior level is enough to fall back on junior frontend dev.",2023-12-13 17:05:30

The company I work at uses px for font sizes. So, I found it odd and started looking into the whole px vs rem debate. An interesting point in favor of using absolute units was that most people prefer ctrl+scroll-wheel or ctrl and +/- to zoom in or out of the page over changing the browser font size.

Now I’m no expert at front end web dev, also considered a junior dev but has been on the team for over a year, but I can confidently say I can complete something like this in a day or two. The task is to create a basic responsive page in Angular (we also use bootstrap) with very minimal business logic involved, almost none actually. It’s been 3 weeks now, and this ticket is still not completed. The HTML file he has been working on has 100 lines of code or less. It has been going through design review for at least 4 days as our designer has pointed out many things that are wrong with the page. He still has been asking me questions mainly about responsive designs such as:
- Why is this div with ‘col-12’ class not taking up the whole row? I quickly found out that some other class he has added to the div overrode the width property… something that could be easily debugged using dev tools.
- Some other questions I feel are distracting and redundant for me to answer such as “if I use col-md-12 that means 768px and higher it would take up the whole space, right?” - I mean can he just not try this out or read the bootstrap docs to find the answer for himself?
- Some other questions about applying paddings/margins/font size at different breakpoints, which can easily be done with bootstrap classes or simple CSS.

I won’t list all the questions here but you get the idea. I’m constantly being asked very basic questions that can easily be googled or answered simply by trials and errors, every single day.

What frustrates me more is that I have 3 other tickets still considered as “in progress” when all I need is for this one page to be done so I can link all these components logic up as they all depend on this one page. We all thought this page would definitely be done by the time I even get close to finishing my first ticket. Am I being too impatient here or should I bring this up to my boss?

118aein,How long have you been in web development? MY STORY,"I started learning web development as a self taught back in October 2020 with [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freeCodeCamp.org).

My first step into building projects was by completing coding challenges right on freeCodeCamp.

Then I tried to build my own side projects. But tutorial hell was a big enemy.

It was super hard for me for so long to find a project idea that would be interesting enough.

In February 2022 I decided to actually build a side project that I would NEVER leave. Never give up on it. It should be something so fun and cool to work on that I will never be able to think about letting it go. Because I've already given up on too many side projects before.

So I thought...

What's something that I'm obsessed with?

Movies and TV Shows...

So let's build something around that.

I started at the end of February 2022.

I launched my own movie/show recommendation app called Movydick in May 2022.

And in 2023 I thought myself ""why not building something fun around Oscars ?"" since they are coming in March 2023.

So I built a game of votes where you can make a vote and predict the winners of the next Oscar Awards.

You can give it a try here: [movydick.vercel.app/academy-awards-winners-predictions-2023/categories](https://movydick.vercel.app/academy-awards-winners-predictions-2023/categories)

An amazing feature is still coming :

\-> Saving your own votes in a ""My Votes"" section

That way you can:

\- share who you voted for with your friends and other movie fans

\- compare your votes with the real results after The Oscar Ceremony

\- get a score depending on how many predictions you got right

It was a super long journey. I faced so many challenges, bugs, failures but I never gave up.

I also got a huge support on Twitter since I'm building in public in there.

I show people what I build and the progress I'm making.

And that support helped me so much to get where I am now.",2023-02-21 17:12:53

I can't work out how this is being achieved. The div in question is the one with the classname 'JvLuC' (I think).

1aktnh1,Backend-Only Web Dev Agency: Seeking Advice!,"Hey folks, have you ever come across a web dev agency specializing solely in backend API work?

I'm not a huge fan of frontend work myself and have been thinking about launching my own gig focusing solely on the backend. But I'm kinda stuck on what that would really look like. I cant tell if this is a terrible idea or not lol.

Ideally, I'd team up with someone handling the frontend while I dive deep into the backend magic as I like to call it. Has anyone else been in a similar boat or have any advice?

Cheers! 🚀

Edit: I know there are backend development companies but I'm kinda just curious about what that process looks like. It's not like a plumber or an electrician come to you and say I want a website. Its also not like I can go into a coffee shop and say, I want to build you a website haha.

1ahsmjp,"I created Law Reduce, a website to understand Congressional Law using the power of AI","https://preview.redd.it/gkyrzjavbggc1.png?width=2192&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c31d3cc6deb1b16bd659c9a8a84f68eedbe6f7b

I created [Law Reduce](https://lawreduce.com),

A tool to help the common US citizen learn what is actually in the bills that our elected officials are proposing, debating, and passing.

Too often political discourse ends up being based on interpretations and distortions of legislation hawked by TV pundits and biased sources, making it impossible to debate with a shared truth. No one dares to reference the original text because it's so unapproachable. Even congress's official summaries are long, dense, and filled with jargon.

**Current features**:

* Search through Bills by topic
* View the the most recent bills for recent sessions of Congress
* Generate a concise summary of the bill in easily-understandable language
* Generate a list of possible impacts of the bill

**Example Case:**

[This bill on Remedial Education Funding](https://lawreduce.com/details/HR/116/3950)

The bill itself is quite long but the tool is able to pull out some key facts of how the program will not only benefit students and education institutions, but also provide data tracking to inform and create future programs

**Future Plans:**

If there is demand, I plan to expand the site to offer increasingly personalized tools including:

* Curated alerts for bills relating to subjects that matter to you most
* Personalized summaries and impacts based on personal profile (eg ""Mother of 2 in Detroit, MI working as a freelancer"")
* Tools to streamline political advocacy toward a certain bill/topic

**Tech Stack**

I got to play with a lot of different tools and am now more in the mode of consolidating but used:

* Frontend: React, Vite, Netlify
* API: Node, Express, Render, Netlify functions
* Integrations: OpenAI, AzureAI, Google Bard, Propublica, Congress.gov

Let me know if you have any feedback, interest in the area, or connections that might find the tool useful!

1ahdpte,Google reCaptcha disappeared from code ?,"i know this is gonna sound crazy but i am kinda confused right now: 

so on a website of mine i had a contact form with a recaptcha v2 box besides the submit form button. 

after not receiving any mails for the last couple of days i checked out the contact form page only to see that there wasnt a recaptcha anymore. weird i thought thinking it might be something to do with the keys or some changes that would need to be done. 

i hop on filezilla to download everything just to find out that suddenly on the contact.php, where the form is, there is NO mention of reCaptcha, not a call to the api.js not the key just NOTHING - First i thought we website somehow was hacked and the hacker just erased the recaptcha code on that page and do nothing else. But the last modified date for all the files are from November of last year. 

Now i wanna make this clear that I AMNOT CRAZY i swear i had the recaptcha just beside the submit button. and if i didnt in the first place, i would still receive e mails from the page but since the reCaptcha is gone after submitting you get a 500 error and the mail never gets delivered. how is this possible ? and again i am really not crazy",2024-02-02 20:43:36

I've spent about a decade in IT, with the last three years as an IT Systems Engineer, deeply immersed in AWS. Due to my interests in web dev and programming, my role has leaned outside of typical IT work, involving a substantial amount of automation, backend work, and programming with Powershell and Python.

One of my key work projects involved developing a backend processes. This included integrating an existing frontend application with a Python-designed backend. It manages resource schedules, interacts with DynamoDB, and utilizes lambda functions for tagging adjustments and resource deletion based on specific timelines, or shut them down.

I became interested in web dev about 5 years ago. It started with a React bootcamp and since then, I’ve been hooked on coding in general, and have specifically loved web dev.

I’ve been working on a personal project with developing an API using Lambda functions, DynamoDB, and API Gateway. I'm also developing the frontend which will be used to store recipes, displaying videos for the recipe links. Tiktok style app, but for recipe videos.

Given my current experience, here are my big questions:

1.	With my background, do you think I’m suited for a senior full-stack position? If not, what level should I aim for?

2.	How can I beef up my portfolio to reflect my skills best? Is my personal project enough to be a ""staple"" project piece showing my skills?

I have been learning webdev and digital marketing at Uni for 3 years. Then I have 2,5 year professional experience in… well… a lot of stuff from React to RN, Vue and all that tools.

Everywhere I hear WP is good, intuitive and easy to use… I just don’t feel like it. I don’t find it particularly easy to use. 

You smash in a theme the jobs 70% done. Then you start adjusting stuff and then the trouble kicks in. Some elements are not resizeable. Then pick another layout thats resizable then somehow switching back to the original you wanted keeps the size?

But thats just one example next to the one just happened to me while writing this… the resize window stuck to my mouse and can’t release it.

I gave it a shot not once to do stuff using WP but all the way through I can only think of if I were to do it custom from a theme it could be done ages ago. And my brainwater would not be boiling trying to figure out why the hack I need to toggle layouts to get a result.

Should I just learn more about WP? Should I just do custom if that goes better for me?

I wonder what makes you using WP? What is the point (maybe complexity) when you would start using WP over doing from the basics?",2023-12-12 13:06:03

18eyoeh,How to identify a Codecanyon PHP script used by a website?,"Hey everyone, I’ve recently come across a website that has some really cool features and functionalities implemented using a PHP script from Codecanyon. I’m curious to find out exactly which Codecanyon script they are using. I’ve looked into the source code, but I’m having trouble pinpointing the specific script.  
  
Does anyone have any tips or techniques for identifying the Codecanyon PHP script being used by a website? Are there any online tools or methods that can help with this? I want to make sure I’m respecting the intellectual property rights of the script’s authors while trying to identify it.

I have been thinking of some kind of combination of React Native + React but difficult to choose. Looking for some advice! My requirements are as follows:- Main functionality of the platform will live in a web app. This will be like 75% of its features. I want something I can build fast (why I liked the look of using RN Expo but not sure if that is viable for a web app or just great for mobile).- Want nice DX as I'm solo right now and want to get an MVP fast.

\- I am also creating a mobile app, but there will be far less features and they will not be copy pasted from web app as the user base is separate for both. (Imagine the customers are using web app, and their customers will use mobile app)- Want something to give native feel for both android and ios so been leaning towards react native over flutter.

Any recommendations? Most of my experience is away from web dev, predominately backend stuff, lots of Kubernetes, OpenShift, etc but only a bit of Web Dev so need some advice

What I can't achieve, or rather, don't know how to do, is to scale this up whilst maintaining privacy.

Now, I want multiple User A's. and I want each User A to be able to see ONLY the User B's that have somehow 'connected' or 'linked' or otherwise granted permission explicitly to a specific User A, to be able to access or display this information (for privacy reasons, so a simple filter of all User A's won't be appropriate)

2. what steps would I need to take to make sure that data remains the secure for Users who have not explicitly 'connected' or 'shared' with a User B?

However, I believe we've only scratched the surface, with AI yet to reach even 10% of its full potential.

Based on my experience, I've started developing a project that combines existing AI technologies to create a platform that maximizes the use of AI in my field and beyond. In a nutshell, my idea is to develop a dedicated platform for businesses, designed as an assistant and secretary that automates processes that were previously difficult to automate.

For example, let's say I need a contract. Until now, I would have to send it to the secretary or create it myself. With AI, this entire process can be automated. The platform would be trained with all the contracts I've already made, analyze and understand them. When I need a new contract, I simply send the basic information, and the platform analyzes it and creates a custom contract. The AI can even gather information about the client, the type of work I need to do, and help me add details I might not have thought of. Ideally, the platform would be integrated with messaging apps like WhatsApp, allowing me to send a message and receive the PDF directly without needing a computer or dedicated portal.

This process, which would typically take hours, can be completed in just a few minutes from anywhere. This is just one example of how this platform could be utilized.

Currently, this project is in the idea stage, with white papers and documentation being developed. I'm looking for collaborators who share my vision for AI and are interested in advancing a project with great potential.

This is not only an opportunity to meet interesting people but also a chance to be part of a project with a high likelihood of success.

16lvvsa,How LinkedIn Automates Application Security for a Safer User Experience,"LinkedIn's Information Security team is committed to creating a secure environment for its users.

At its core is the Application Security team, who manage key security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) to fortify web applications.

Their mission is to automate security protocols, boost developer productivity, and reduce manual oversight.

They’ve experimented with two architectural models to achieve this:

1. **Centralized, Rule-Heavy Approach:** This model scrutinizes outgoing HTTP responses against a set of stringent rules, ensuring they meet the gold standard of security.
2. **Decentralized, Developer-Empowered Model:** This approach offers developers the latitude to innovate while maintaining a robust security framework.

Both models deploy rules to LinkedIn's proxy hosts, monitored by specialized plugins. This dual strategy not only fortifies security but also streamlines the development process.

### Analyzing the Centralized Approach

Initially, LinkedIn employed a centralized approach, using the Traffic Headers Plugin to write Content Security Policy (CSP) headers into responses.

While this offered benefits like easier maintenance and uniform secure policies, it posed significant challenges as LinkedIn scaled.

The centralized system became increasingly unwieldy, placing the Application Security team in a bottleneck position for approving changes, thereby increasing the risk of human error and site issues.

[LinkedIn’s Centralized Architecture Model](https://preview.redd.it/rho4d22po0pb1.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b6663bcb48f4b650af89b1ee85e5127a8e97d16)

Recognizing these limitations, LinkedIn pivoted to a decentralized approach, aligned with the latest CSP standards. This new architecture aimed to achieve five key objectives:

* Minimize the impact of changes
* Empower developers
* Provide a consistent testing experience
* Enhance security posture
* Build a generalized solution beyond just CSP headers

While the old centralized architecture remains for legacy applications, the focus has shifted towards migrating to a more agile and scalable decentralized system.

### Migrating to a New Decentralized System

In this new architecture, a CSP Filter became an integral part of the frontend frameworks.

This filter decorates the outgoing response with CSP headers defined by developers, maintaining a safety net with a fallback mechanism at the traffic layer.

[LinkedIn’s Decentralized Architecture Model](https://preview.redd.it/59485leso0pb1.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cfdaddd23526095550f4efb8e8536b1d1cdf320)

This approach reduced the scope and impact of CSP changes, empowering developers to implement and test changes efficiently.

However, the decentralized model posed challenges in security governance, including reduced visibility for the Application Security team and the complexity of CSP modifications.

### Implementing Risk-Based Validation Rules

To address these challenges, LinkedIn adopted a ""shift-left"" approach, implementing security validators that analyze code at the time of commit using risk-based rules.

Validation checks on GitHub guide developers on appropriate actions, such as blocking pull requests that violate key risk rules.

[Example of LinkedIn’s Critical Rules](https://preview.redd.it/h5isumq2p0pb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7590e06c47ba6fa447ef4d9fa1d797f8d60cd4e)

LinkedIn's balanced approach aims to combine the rigor of a centralized system with the flexibility of a decentralized model, making it a safer and more efficient platform for both users and developers.

16eyfy7,Can I remove the <body> snippet of GTM on my website?,"
From what I know, GTM’s <head> snippet is the main snippet to track websites users. The <body> snippet is only there as a backup to track users that do not load Javascript on their browser, which to my understanding almost everyone’s browser loads JS. The body snippet can help in that case, but other than that it’s not actually necessary. Please correct me if I’m mistaken. 

The reason why I’m asking whether I can leave out the <body> script is because I’ve been getting a lot of pageviews with the url as gtm-msr.appspot.com on my analytics tools, and it’s messing up my analytics. Looking at the user screen recording, it shows my website even though these urls are gtm-msr.appspot.com. That URL is Google’s URL to load a frame over my website for browsers that don’t support JS, which is what the <body> snippet is for. Basically these are bots landing on my website and leaving almost immediately, driving up numbers I don’t want to track for a URL that isn’t mine. 

This is affecting my analytics tools, and website recording tools, my ads tools, etc etc. I can add a line of code for every tag saying to only load when its my website’s URL and not gtm-msr.appspot.com. But this is not ideal because a lot of my tags on GTM use templates so I can’t edit the HTML. 

So I was thinking, if only bots are using the <body> snippet to load GTM, and it’s messing up my data, and I don’t care about bots; can I just leave out the <body> GTM snippet from my website?

15hycpl,Code Warriors & Chess Kings: The Epic Fusion of Passions,"In the midst of university chaos, something unexpected was about to go down. Picture this: Jake, your average computer science dude, was about to make a chess move that would shock the entire campus. Hold up, how did this geeky coder end up here? Let's rewind a bit.

&#x200B;

Jake was that guy who had a brain for codes and a heart for chess. Weird combo, right? But that's our Jake for you. When he wasn't cracking codes, he was plotting strategies for chess club battles. Dude took it seriously, even when people thought he'd rather be battling in some virtual realm.

&#x200B;

Late nights were his jam – one moment, he'd be cracking a code, the next, he'd be cracking his brain over chess tactics. Parties? Nah, Jake was busy analyzing grandmaster games while the world was dancing to beats. All that dedication led him to the ultimate face-off: the campus chess championship.

&#x200B;

Now, picture this scene: Jake staring at the board, his opponent sweating buckets. Jake had evolved from coding geek to chess ninja. Friends were surprised – wasn't this the same guy who used to mix up his knight and bishop? But here he was, making moves like he'd invented the game.

&#x200B;

Match after match, Jake bulldozed through the competition. It wasn't just chess; it was a comedy of unexpected checkmates. Opponents gawked as Jake busted out strategies nobody saw coming. It was like watching a coding genius breakdance – nobody knew what was happening, but everyone loved it.

&#x200B;

Word spread like wildfire: ""Jake's a chess wizard!"" Professors scratched their heads, thinking they'd entered the Twilight Zone. Jake, the tech whiz, had found his mojo on a chessboard. It was like coding algorithms was his warm-up for smashing pawns and queens.

&#x200B;

Then, plot twist! A prof strolled over with an idea crazier than Jake's knight leaps. A ""Chess and Algorithms"" seminar. Yep, chess and coding in one epic show. Jake's brain nearly short-circuited. He dove into preparing like a gamer leveling up for a boss battle. Chess tactics merged with coding logic, and it was hilariously mind-bending.

&#x200B;

Seminar day arrived. Everyone expected some brain-melting talk. Jake took the stage, and silence fell. He was like a stand-up comic in a coding jacket. His chess moves became metaphors for coding challenges. The audience laughed and learned – who knew codes and checkmates could be BFFs?

&#x200B;

So, what's the punchline? Jake's story isn't just about chess and coding. It's a tale of discovering that mixing passions can lead to a symphony of success. From coding craziness to chess mastermind – Jake proved that even the weirdest combos can create something amazing. And hey, who knows what he'll conquer next?",2023-08-04 12:08:26

153k243,Advice on a Career Opportunity/Gamble,"# Tl;Dr

There really is no short version here since there are a bunch of factors to consider. I'm just kinda sharing the situation and decisions I have to make here while being open to any advice to help me make the best of this. It's a kinda complicated situation. 

I have a project I'm starting that I'd estimate at ~ $6,000 US. The budget of the client currently is basically $0. But it is a *seriously* great opportunity for me because of the connections/networking, plus the potential for maybe a SaaS. I know basically for sure this will be recognized and celebrated by a top Fortune 500 Company and maybe high-level government officials just because of the client and my network. 

It's also not a whole lot of work for me since it's basically my niche and mostly something I can just copy/paste (actually a use a GitHub Template Repo). Most of the work is building a form and a slight bit of regularl JS stuff for an ""admin"" side. 

With regards to the lack of budget... I'm kinda obligated for personal reasons to do this. Things have been difficult since COVID and my involvement in this is tied to a debt to someone involved. I'm really only deciding on how good of a job to do here. And trying to decide what to include in the MVP that repays said debt (far less than my estimated cost for my best here... More like my absolute minimum) and what to defer until later, when there's funding/grant money available. It's complicated by the fact that I'd actually have to do extra work, since the temple is something I created to be the best by default. My starting point includes a PWA, ready to publish Android app, full structured data for SEO/""Rich Results"", extreme security, highly optimized performance, support for native share (`navigator.share()`), and all the semantics + accessibility things. The one thing I can leave room for improvement on without actively disabling or sabotaging things readily available is the design, but I do have interest in making a great impression on the network of this client, so really have to do well in that regard. 

# The Situation

I have a currently forming non-profit as a client (with partnerships with major and national orgs - seriously, a top Fortune 500 company). The project is basically a categorized directory, to over-simplicify it a bit. I have plans and designs to do something excellent with it, but the point is I've already done a lot of the work on another project (one that I own, so no copyright/patent/whatever issues).

I am a developer with ~12 years experience who was referred in-part because I have already developed an app that (at least on the surface) is almost exactly what they want. The main difference is that the directory app I have is Jekyll with everything in YAML files, so not exactly something user-friendly to update. I mostly have to create an ""admin"" section with a login/registration to update Firestore, which will be used in the next build. 

# Deadline

I have a kinda self-imposed deadline of July 30th. At least for an MVP. I've built similar projects in 7 hours though, so I'm not really concerned about that. There's just a prominent event on the 31st and I really wanted a functional MVP to showcase by then. 

# My Plan

- Netlify
- Eleventy
- Firebase
- A PWA and eventually ""native"" apps using PWABuilder.com
- A collection of libraries + a template repo I already have

This isn't typical, but it was chosen to meet the needs of the primary demographics while minimizing costs of hosting, etc. By reading from a Firebase Firestore basically only on build, I nearly eliminate the read side of usage rates. Writes only occur on updates after a login. The PWA thing, on top of the offering of the Progressive Web App, also reduces traffic to Netlify by having a mostly stale-serving Service Worker. And using Netlify's WebHook + maybe cron, I can have the content updated daily or as needed. 

# The Demographics

This app will largely be for those using a device via the Lifeline Program (Obama Phones). These are pretty low-end devices, and it's starting in a rural area. This is partly why I think a ""static site"" is the better approach here (less client-side JS and rendering, much smaller bundles , generally just better for low-end devices and budget). That means Chrome + Android, mostly, but probably very under-powered. I really to keep bandwidth and client-side rendering to a minimum while trying to stay in the free tier of various services, yet still provide loading speeds that are good enough for 3G.

I already have lots of experience here... I kinda specialize in it. I have built several apps for the exact same rural community and easily get 90+ scores on Lighthouse (with Google Analytics being the main reason I don't get 100 on performance). My JS bundles are typically ~40 kb when minified and compressed, and aren't strictly necessary in most cases (more of a progressive enhancement, except when things like maps are essential).

To put that briefly, I have no state to even think about, need to keep JS to to a minimum, VDOM would be a waste of resources I can't afford, and I'd like to keep build times as low as possible (my current setup has it at about 35 seconds, counting `npm ci`). React or any JS framework would be a bad decision here. 

# The Actual Questions

Anyone have any good advice on how to make this with my while, or at least to make this easier on me? I think my kinda JAMStack-ish set-up is probably the best choice, but maybe something is better. Also, should I i do the work to actively make it worse just to have something to charge to add later, or should I make it easier on myself and deliver a more impressive product? Since this is going to soon be a 401C-3, is there any way of having this work considered a ""donation"" of some kind? Without going into detail, this is something I might be able to sell to communities/government as a SaaS... Should I offer the client a license or whatever and keep the actual code for myself? I have many directions I could take this and feel that their lack of current budget gives me a whole lot of control in any deals.",2023-07-19 04:02:11

I'm planning on building out a Notion clone with some new twists  for job apps, etc., and I'd like it to be the sort of over-engineered thing that really pushes my React, Typescript, API calling, application architecture to the next level, so I want to build something really robust. However, I'm kind of confused about how the backend relates to the frontend for these kinds of apps.

I worked on a team several months ago to build an SPA with just create-react-app, react-router, and express, and I got familiar writing the endpoints for the various forms of data that we needed. I've also written ( in university courses) flask applications, where I set up the actual HTML serving with JQuery, etc., so I'm familiar with how these less(?) complicated approaches work.

I'd like to try out Next.js, and I like the directory approach to laying out the pages. For handling all the ""business logic"" of database accesses, etc., I'm kind of confused to how the server aspects of Next (which I will fully admit I don't understand in much depth at all) relate to the kinds of endpoints, etc. that I'm used to writing or should be trying to set up. Is it possible to both use Next for SSR and the handling the site, and then somehow setting up a flask or django server to handle the database, etc.? Also, if I type out an extended path in the search bar, is that GET request being processed by Next somehow (this is a complete tangent question)?

I'm sorry if this is confusing/unfocused--I'm trying to wrap my head around how this relationship works, and I'm happy to clarify or expand on any of these questions.",2023-06-25 03:47:19

I'm currently working on my webdev portfolio site where I'm showcasing screenshots of sites I've made.

The user can then have a poke around that site before clicking an ""X"" to go back to the portfolio site.

This strikes me as a fairly useful feature but as far as I can remember I don't recall seeing it done before.

I'm a self thought programmer on a journey to get a tech job. One of the things I'm doing is building more than a few projects to reinforce what I learned. So, one of those projects is a Python based web scrapper that scrapes the Metacritic and Sputnik music top album lists and place those in a Spotify playlist. This is something I used to do every year until 2017 except I used to manually find and 'legally' download the albums and put them on a playlist to shuffle through(I suggest everyone does this if they have an interest in finding new music).  


Now, the issue is, after I successfully scraped the sites and added those tracks onto the playlist, I need to iterate through the playlist to find which albums didn't get added so I can add it to a list. But for some reason I can't seem to do so. I used the offset parameter to go through my playlist([https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-playlists-tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-playlists-tracks)), but it keeps repeating the same 10 tracks.

[I am Sharpy.](https://preview.redd.it/dxojec9i4r3b1.png?width=128&format=png&auto=webp&s=8aa4b461fd5d42ad0527cadff3a4a5c610b730ee)

Hello r/webdev community! I'm excited to introduce Sharpy, an AI-powered platform for creating automated chatbots on WhatsApp.

Inspired by the incredible products emerging every day that I've been seeing grow on Reddit, a few months ago I decided to start developing a platform that allows users to easily create bots that automatically respond using artificial intelligence.

I know what you're thinking: you simply connected GPT to WhatsApp. But no! I've been diligently developing a customization system where you can easily create a ChatBot with a name, objective, personality, and the actions it should follow step by step to fulfill its main goal.

You can test one of the ChatBots on WhatsApp here:  [**wa.link/qdz138**](https://wa.link/qdz138)

This is actually the first version being made available to the public, and although I've been testing it with some trusted businesses, I want to be completely honest: it still has some issues and deficiencies that are ready to be addressed.

&#x200B;

[The screen with a list of your bots :\)  ](https://preview.redd.it/733bj9af4r3b1.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=fff07981ba1c70f1c035c0a55d15608df72baeee)

# The idea behind Sharpy

I have previously worked with companies that face many challenges in customer service and often spend a lot of resources training people to follow up, answer simple questions, or perform basic tasks. The idea behind Sharpy is to provide businesses or individuals with the ability to create a bot that can easily and quickly handle these simple tasks, without relying on the owner's time. And it has a good memory even of the voice messages you send it!

For example, Sharpy has been working for an international real estate investment firm, receiving multiple repetitive inquiries about certain investments on a daily basis. Sharpy is capable of retrieving the corresponding information and delivering it to clients/leads at the moment they need it. And many have taken immediate action as a result!

Additionally, Sharpy has been working as a meeting organizer in conjunction with tools like Calendly. Can you imagine a WhatsApp bot that handles the conversational flow that reaches you? One beta tester had difficulties organizing their schedule and created a bot with Sharpy to manage their calls, collecting important data and providing the necessary information for each meeting in the chat. Meanwhile, the owner could focus on more important tasks in their business!

So, the idea behind Sharpy is to simplify everyday tasks that, by their nature, consume time and, above all, distract your attention. Do you need someone to provide useful information while you're resting or spending time with your family? Well, Sharpy might be what you're looking for. With the power of GPT4 and other technologies behind it, we're achieving some really amazing things that we want to share with the world in the form of utilities.

# What is Sharpy's long-term vision?

Well, what I mentioned earlier is just the current functioning MVP. While this public version doesn't yet have all the features we have in private, there are many things about to be released. For example, you'll be able to upload a 50-page PDF with information about your business to Sharpy, and the ChatBot will handle and share what it deems necessary.

We also believe it can be useful for managing work schedules, especially now that things have become a bit flexible post-remote work. Do you still receive work messages while having dinner? Well, you'll be able to program Sharpy to only work when you're AFK, or maybe you want it to run 24 hours a day. Who knows? The good thing is, you'll have the flexibility to define and decide how it operates according to your preferences

Currently, Sharpy accepts text and audio inputs (yes! You can send it a voice message). We are working on adding visual inputs, which we believe could be interesting for many industries. As for Sharpy's responses, they are all text-based for now! But we are in the process of generating a suitable voice that can engage in a fluent conversation via audio... and who knows, with further technological development, even have real-time conversations in a phone call-like manner. All of this is on our minds.

Regarding the communication medium, we chose WhatsApp because we believe it is an important platform used by both individuals and businesses. Everyone uses WhatsApp! But our plans include gradually incorporating different social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook Messenger, etc.

The reality is that the limit of Sharpy is, ultimately, imagination. We are constantly developing and testing features, although not all of them make it to production. But we would love to put some features up for a vote! That's why we are now embarking on the task of building a community.

&#x200B;

# What is the feature roadmap right now?

Well, although it is a bit ambitious, little by little the project begins to be a bigger and bigger dream, although for everything to turn out correctly, I love the idea that we go little by little! Currently, we are in an initial state in which the platform works, but in its minimum version (Yes, that is an MVP!)

[What is Sharpy explained by Sharpy Bot. My native language is Spanish so... :\)](https://preview.redd.it/dhlxxskl4r3b1.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bd9306ee0072d275b161a2f49fdfd5583c43f09)

# What is the objective of this post?

Well, I'm interested in introducing the platform and attracting some new users who I don't know, as I believe they will come without any biases, which is great. But above all, what I'm looking for is some feedback. Is the bot creation process easy? Is it intuitive? Is good design? Responsive? Do you like the login method? Also, I'm interested in exploring a bit about the capabilities of my cheap servers.

Ultimately, I'm happy to finally bring this little tool to life, which will grow gradually. For now, I'm working on Sharpy on my own, alongside a full-time job, so new features may take a bit of time. The main idea is to release an update every Thursday. I hope I can meet these deadlines!

So, if you want to provide any constructive criticism or maybe suggest features you would love to see incorporated, that would be great, and I'll listen to everyone! I'm also happy to answer any questions you may have.

Here the link to platform :) [https://app.sharpy.media/acceder](https://app.sharpy.media/acceder)

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this! I hope we can create something great together! It is my first project that sees the light, I am very excited to tell it and get this out to the world.",2023-06-03 07:02:21

13h5b46,Portfolio Blog Nightmare.,"I’ve been on a big of an emotional roller coaster this week. 

About a month ago I set out to build a new portfolio site which would feature a blog. 

My big idea with this new site would be to learn an SSR framework and build the site out with load times and performance as my primary metric of success. As you may have heard a new(ish) framework called Qwik recently hit version 1.0 and I thought I’d give it a shot since the site would ostensibly be light on JS and mostly static. 

Very early I realized that the tools needed to quickly build out the blog were missing, to put it simply. This wasn’t unexpected- it’s a new framework after all- but what was unexpected was the difficulty of getting a fully featured blog up and running without access to the tools available to NextJS projects. In particular, markdown compilation was a pretty big hurdle. Short of writing my own solution which is just… no, there isn’t really a quote-un-quote “easy way” to get this up and running with Qwik. 

Okay I thought, maybe given it’s newness, Qwik just isn’t the best tool for the job if I want this to be seamless. The site is pretty basic and I’m only half way done with it, why not just switch frameworks? Enter Sveltekit. To summarize, I’ve learned to love Svelte and Sveltekit for a number of reasons, but after getting the blog portion 90% working, I’ve arrive at a similar solution to Qwik. 

The more I dug for packaged solutions regarding Markdown compilation, the more it became apparent that the support the NextJS was simply better in every way. There was out-of-box support for syntax highlighting, the option to support embedded content and maybe most importantly, it was all under one (or maybe two) packages, abstracting away the underlying tools (Remark and Rehype) used to parse the markdown and translate it into HTML. 

Basically I’ve arrived at this conclusion, if you want out of the box support for everything, NextJS is the best SSR option bar none. The ability to drop in React components, and the way that seemingly every scenario a developer might encounter has a package built to handle it really makes it seem like the obvious choice if you want something up and running with minimal hassle. 

I’m left feeling like I have to choose between the framework I want (Sveltekit) and the ecosystem I want (Next). It’s a disappointing compromise to have to make, but I’m curious what other’s thoughts are both generally, and more specifically regarding Markdown compilation. Do you run into similar situations while picking a framework? How do you deal with the impasse?",2023-05-14 07:09:11
13gsop9,What’s the best tool for generating side hustle money making simple static websites for friends / family / colleagues,"I’ve been doing a lot of Django development recently, along with making multiple Material for MkDocs sites. These seem to be on opposite sides of the spectrum regarding the complexity of creating a website. 

I’m using Material for MkDocs to make a personal website for a friend. They’re a doctor and just wanted a simple content website showing the conditions they treat and a contact page. 

Material for MkDocs is beautiful and relatively easy to customise, including overriding the front page for a custom masthead with plain HTML/CSS/bootstrap. I’ve now come across other tools like Jekyll and Hugo. 

My question: What is the best (and fun! don’t want to use a builder like Wix) tool to learn to make these simple personal websites as a side gig? My niche is knowing the content better than a random freelancer and doing it for much cheaper. I enjoy the ability to customise my page, and I’m comfortable with html / CSS using Bootstrap. How hard would it be to eg create a Jekyll/Hugo theme from scratch, given this experience?

Please be as detailed as possible.  I'll start:

\-  For us, getting better at estimating up front would save us a lot of heartache at the end of projects, when we're always crunched for time/budget and the client wants more scope, even though we told them that the original estimate was only a ballpark and could be way off.

\-  Finding new clients is always a hassle, and qualifying them without taking up a lot of our time is difficult.

\-  Keeping clients in the loop can be a challenge in the midst of a project... it's easy to get caught up in the heads-down, coding zone for too long, then when we come up for air, the project and client expectations have diverged.

\- Technology is almost never the issue... it's scope, it's clear requirements, it's managing expectations.  If we had a way to reliably, consistently handle those things, our projects would run more smoothly.",2023-05-03 20:07:01

12zena4,Explaining app/web development to someone who's never done it before,"**tl;dr: need help finding resources for people who are complete (and I do mean entirely, utterly complete) beginners.**

Hi everyone

We've got some people at work who are on a mini-project which will allow them to get a glimpse into different areas of creating a product. They had some training in a low/no-code app development which is perfect for them because the majority of them haven't done any coding or anything of the sort before. They were still really confused by the training, despite the fact that the person giving it really tried to take their time. For example, she recognised that it may not be intuitive for someone who hasn't even touched anything to do with CS or coding to know that a button is just a shape on a screen if you don't add any logic to it, and how to go about adding this logic or what sort of logic to even add. The group was still left really baffed. So they are absolute, complete beginners. With this in mind,  are there any specific youtube videos/channels that you would use? What concepts would they need to know (that we often take for granted) that would help them understand their training? I am tempted to make my own vids/have short sessions explaining all these things, but don't want to waste time doing that if there are genuinely good resources that could help.

16y5ugw,[vent] Fuck typescript,"I am not new to the field. I started programming in 2017. At this point I can code everything a non-programmer would imagine, blindfolded. That was until I started using typescript.

There are always gotchas here and there. Especially imports. I have spent countless hours solving issues that are practically non-existent in a pure nodejs project.

I have gone past deadlines many times because typescript decides ""Fuck it, I am not compiling for production"". I would spend days trying every single code snippet, every bundler plugin... everything.

Strict mode is a scam. It's a waste of time on a level of type safety that isn't really needed (for me at least).

Github issues? Don't go down that road. Always in progress or closed. Never finished. It's a rabbit whole of never ending links of issues, repos, pull requests and discussion, suggesting solutions non of which work. I do understand the time and effort needed to maintain a compiler and toolchain that is used by millions of users worldwide. But this is neglect. They suggest a half assed solution that doesn't work even in a clean project, with the exact code specified.

Recently I started a mid-size project in pure javascript. And OMG it's so much easier. I just code. I don't have to spend pointless time configuring anything or worring about stupid warnings/errors that are never going to affect my program. I can assign `req.my_stuff = my_stuff` without a worry.

1amhc7w,Are there any half-code platforms out there?,"Hey guys, fairly experienced dev here.

I see devs often talking down on low/no code solutions but I'm honestly quite intrigued by the concept, though I haven't found a platform yet that does it right, all the ones that I know like Bubble and Retool are executed quite poorly IMO. What I think they are missing is a well integrated custom code feature.

I think that low-code could work very well if it had a well made custom coding feature. This way you could easily build the mundane repetitive stuff using no-code but for anything more custom/advanced you could write some code yourself.

So my question to you fellow devs - do you know of any low-code tool that gets the custom code part just right? Perhaps the correct way to ask this is if there are any tools that *focus* on custom code, but have some no-code features as a bonus? And feel free to share your general opinions on low-code.",2024-02-09 06:02:23
1ajqgx2,"How to run something like ""npm run dev"" on the staging server?","Hi!

I have a weird question, how could I run ""npm run dev"" on the staging server? It's a Laravel app with Inertia and VueJS.

I am working with a designer on the redesign of a web app. I have tried to install the app on their computer, but it's just not working and their computer is not really compatible. I could find a solution, but I don't want to spend too much time on that.

Could I just give them access to the code on the server, allow them to change it as they want, run ""npm run dev"" on the server and upload that to GitHub when we are happy with the result? How would that work?

The thing is our website was made by a guy we stopped talking to on prestashop. The website is shit and I have to do it again from scratch, I study web design in uni, but have very limited knowledge about coding for now (only a little html). I was wondering which was the best platform to do the website, where it's pretty simple, doesn't require coding and there are lots of tutorials how to do it on the internet.

So, do you think Wordpress is the best place when used with a builder and if so which builder? Or some other platform like Shopify?

We have really good marketing and a bunch of kinda famous people waiting to promote it, (some with their own merch made by us and hosted on our website). So I really have to do something decent. It must have the basic things of an ecommerce clothing store like: a shopping cart, accounts, list of orders, info to provide for the order, categories, newsletter etc.

I'm a computer engineer with 4 years of experience working as a backend developer, primarily in the .NET ecosystem. Recently, I've been thinking about taking the leap into the world of freelance web development. My goal is to create simple, customized websites for clients at reasonable prices.

While I have a good grasp of backend development, I also have some front-end knowledge to work with templates. That said, I have a few questions as I embark on this exciting journey, and I'd greatly appreciate your insights and advice.

**1. Where can I find suitable templates for customization?**

I'm planning to start with templates and personalize them according to my clients' needs. Are there any resources or marketplaces where I can find high-quality templates that allow for easy customization? I'd love to hear about your favorite sources.

**2. How should I deal with hosting issues, and which tools do you suggest?**

I'm a bit lost when it comes to web hosting. What hosting services or platforms do you recommend for a freelancer like me who's just starting out? Any tips on managing hosting effectively would be a huge help.

**3. Should I go with WordPress?**

WordPress is obviously very popular for website development and makes it very easy to develop and manage websites, and I'm not well-versed in SEO and related topics. Would it be wise for me to dive into WordPress instead of dealing with all the templates and codes? What are the pros and cons?

I'm eager to hear your thoughts, experiences, and any advice you can offer as I embark on this new chapter. Your guidance will be invaluable as I take my first steps into the world of web development freelancing.

In the webmaster/webdev part I'm always getting headaches. I'm not sure how can I evaluate if a webmaster can deliver quality. 

I will mention a couple of common issues:

Loading time. On most of my projects, and I worked with many teams, website loading time takes 7-8 seconds. (size to be loaded is small, hosting is ultra strong, we're never cheap on hosting).

They always push the website performance tests of: Google, GTMetrix etc (with the right servers mobile/desktop) but real experience is not matching.

Design goes fairly off, bulky feel compareds to Figma design and i'm not expecting 100% match, but lets not have 1st screen homepage missing half of benefits section if it's planned to be shown.

Website that are non responsive for example Facebook native browser and other small things.

All these take like many hours of work to fix and puts me in a difficult positions with going way above estimates.

All specs are very clearly mentioned in the product specifications and with clear quality KPIs.

What do you recommend? What sort of protfolio is best to ask for to evaluate the quality of a good webdev?

190l2nq,How do we overcome the privatization of web development to create sustainable technology for the future?,"This is maybe a bit of a tedious discussion as I’m sure there will be many different opinions on this, but let’s see what everyone has to say.

I personally am of the opinion that when it comes to web development, and the internet in general, we have always moved towards a singularity. Businesses that want the fastest websites will often implement similar solutions, people who want the best looking websites will implement similar solutions, people who want ease of development will implement similar solutions.

However, rarely are these solutions integrated with each other. 

My opinion is that web development does not need pivotal technology such as React, Vue, Angular, Next, .NET, Tailwind, etc all as separate entities. 

What web development needs, is one open-source library that is shared with everyone, worked on by everyone, and benefits everyone. 

If you can imagine for a second, being able to type into a browser something like: www.websingularity.com (just as an example), and it takes you to the documentation for a framework that:

• has hundreds of shared UI components in dozens of popular languages, all coded performantly and with good design,

• has deeply thought out logic and performance functionality in dozens of popular languages,

• is built with accessibility in mind,

• has in-depth documentation across all parts of the framework in different languages,

Would that not be better than having hundreds of separate frameworks accomplishing the same goal? 

I realize this is a very tall order, and would require thousands of experienced developers working concurrently on this, but instead of silo-ing all of our knowledge, I believe we should pool it.

Why should every developer, agency, company, etc all have to create their own library of templated components for future use when we could iterate on one global library. 

Why should we have to weigh the pro’s and con’s of each framework when we could have one integrated global framework. 

I know the answer is money, that’s what it always comes down to, but if there was a way to overcome that obstacle, what would it be?",2024-01-07 05:46:21

In addition, I'm considering purchasing Programming with M-sh's New React Course in the hopes of better understanding React and receiving additional support. However, as is my custom, I am terrified of falling back into tutorial hell.

1ap1122,Chrome developer console showing reddit job ads and freezing Chrome,"So, I'm a retired software engineer, I enjoy programming and it makes sense reddit would want to send me an ad for a programming job. However, I'm getting ads in my browser console while investigating Chrome freezing on that tab. I suspect the ad is also the cause of the lockup. This is pretty weird because I seem to have triggered it from Google search. I have all extensions disabled however I'm logged into Google. I could not repro from incognito mode. Has anyone else seen this? I wish I had more diagnostics to give other than the screenshot. The ""ad"" is no longer being served to me.

Looking for people to help test my new vs code extension that I have just published to the extension marketplace.

Link: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PlusTimeIT.php-file-refactoring](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=plustimeit.php-file-refactoring)

Name: PHP File Refactoring

Its a free and an open source project that is meant to bring a similar feel to PHPStorms File Refactoring when renaming files with a few little extra goodies.

Currently has the following features:

* Safe Refactoring - When turned on (active by default), all refactoring changes will appear in the activity bar (refactoring icon). This is triggered by either moving a PHP file or renaming a PHP file.
* Utilizes a PHP parser to create an AST array for better identification of potential changes.
* Replaces both fully qualified names and unqualified names where possible.
* If your project has a \`composer.json\` file it will attempt to map your autoload PSR-4 namespaces to any changes that have occurred.
* When files are moved, it will update that files namespace, along with any occurrences throughout your project.
* Clicking on the reviews will take you to the file, line and column of the proposed change.

I'd love any feedback or another set of eyes to help detect any bugs or even offer any improvements.

&#x200B;

Thanks

I'm not talking about HTML/CSS/JS (1000s of them outside), not talking about languages or frameworks or Web API but the really basics concepts HTTP.

I have been surrounded by colleagues that don't know how to react when they encounter a CORS issue or look at me in a weird way when I'm talking about CSP...

Or even some that are not able to read raw HTTP request/response...

To be fair, it's true than I never learned those things during school or trainings (or it was really limited) but more with experience, when encountering an issue and digging the topic...

Some topic that should be included : 

* What is an HTTP request/response, how to visualize them.
* What are the most relevant headers? Those who have an impact on browser or security.
* What is CORS (why it happens, how to deal with it).
* What are CSP
* Event loop in JS maybe ?
* Classic web vulnerabilities
* HTTP 1 => 2 => 3

Nothing huge I think but to allow web dev to have a strong starter kit with web basics...

18wvjmb,How do you deal with increasing size on hover?,"I commonly increment the font-size of my button to make it bigger, the problem with that is that the button push the whole layout of the page making the whole page move with the transition. (I will not post any GIF as example because I suppose this problem could be very frequent).

the few solution that I've tried or thought were:

\* make the position of the button relative.

	this does not work because at the end I'm changing the size of the button through its font-size.

	Idk if there is a way to change the actual size of the button and keep its actual size in the flow layout.

\* utilize dumb objects, for example. creating 2 buttons, 1 button with the target size but invisible making the layout adjust to that, and another with its actual size.

	this could come with its own problem, because there are situations where locating that dumb button could be hard (at least for me). for example centering the button into a div horizontally (I do not know where or how the hell to position the dumb button in it).

\* pre-calculating everything.

	Idk if this is even possible or if it is viable. you can know how the font-size is calculated (it specified the size vertically of the font from the very bottom to the very top), the padding, border and margin of your button. with all of that info, create a div to wrap the button with the height or width fixed to the target size of the button on hover. that way the button will grow inside the div and nothing else will change. you can achieve that with a lot of CSS calc and variables. IDK if this way is recommended.

\* somehow with js.

	Idk how, but js is magic isn't it.

\* just don't increment the button

	I'm not very proud of it but that was the path I followed. just make a little transition to the background of the button and that is it.

18khkwu,I need suggestions on the Stack. (For JAMStack Architecture),"So, I have to develop a landing page. The landing page will be completely static for now. So I want to use HTML, CSS, JS, React, NextJS (In Static Mode: Don't know how that works now). The website will be hosted on Firebase, and will use Firestore to bring in the Data. The Firestore UI will be acting as the CMS for this Website. 

Now, this webpage should be such that I don't want to rewrite code for template layout for each page. For Eg. the Header and the Footer will be Common for all the pages so I would want to create a template out of it (Including the HTML, CSS and JS of this template) and use that in all other pages. I guess I would need to use a SSG like 11ty/Gatsby for this. (or is nextjs in static mode itself compatible of doing this?))

Now this webpage should be such that I don't want to rewrite code for template layout for each page.

I guess I would need to use a SSG like 11ty/Gatsby for this. (or is nextjs in static mode itself compatible of doing this?)

&#x200B;

Also, does that mean the final build files I have, 

1. Will include header and footer code (HTML, CSS, JS) in each (HTML, CSS, JS ) of each Page, or
2. Will include Call to Header and Footer Code (HTML, CSS, JS) in each (JS) of each Page.

&#x200B;

The 2nd way keeps the storage utilization of the final build file low. So this means more space for other pages in the Firebase Hosting Server.

&#x200B;

Also, a 3rd way would be similar to the 2nd way but will require Firebase's Serverless functionality where I code the JS of each Page to trigger a Serverless Function which brings in the code for Header and the Footer. Seems like this is just a longer way of doing what 2nd option does. Where 

Each Page JS Calls the Firebase Function which calls the Header/Footer Code, Whose JS finally Calls the Firestore Data.

&#x200B;

I’m currently trying to create an online platform for work that is basically an online gradebook and wanted to have the following functions:

1. Everyone has their own personal accounts
2. Certain accounts will have different roles that will allow them different rights (basic user can only view their own gradebooks, while admin can view everyone’s gradebook
3. Website has the function to create various types of grade sheet in a specified format, and all they have to do is fill in the blanks
4. Website has the function to submit to different specified users for endorsement in a certain order (for example, once the grade sheet is filled up, it is sent to the student to acknowledge. If the event is considered non satisfactory, then it must go through a chain of supervisors for endorsement before reaching the students)
5. Function for archival. Once grade sheet is completed, it will be archived under the respective student’s account, such that it can be viewed by him at any time.

My question is, how tough is this to create? I’ve been trying to learning basic HTML, CSS etc but this seems beyond that and I’m stuck. I can’t find a an easier solution to this as website creators such as Wix are usually geared towards ecommerce and do not have such functionality.

At work, I usually have a list of tasks i need to get done for the sprint.

I have an application that my clients are running on the web browser via a Fire TV stick.

I'm trying to figure out a way to detect if the TV is on or off because I pay the client for usage.

For example, currently the client can turn my software on, open the Internet app on the Fire TV stick, but turn the TV off and I'll end up paying the client for nothing.

Is it possible to detect when the actual TV is on or off and the content is viewable on the TV?

151bb0o,Are true AI driven websites possible?,"I think the future of websites is that we will all see different versions of the content based upon our attention and preference data.

Currently marketers and developers come together to decide and test content seen by everyone according to business KPIs.

I think a new way of doing web development could be a combination of:

- Collecting user data
- Feeding it to a model owned by a business and trained on that data to generate high quality HTML, JS + CSS according to branding guidelines and KPIs
- Serving this to browsers through SSR

I’d say we’re a while off achieving this but if happened there would be some pretty big implications for the web dev industry - no need for any more front end frameworks!

14md055,e-commerce web app,"Hi fellow Redditors,

I'm currently working on developing an e-commerce web application, and I'm feeling a bit lost and overwhelmed with the process. The tech stack I've chosen includes Tailwind, TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Hasura, and PostgreSQL.

I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could provide me with a step-by-step guide or some valuable insights on how to proceed with building this web app. I have a basic understanding of the technologies involved but would love some guidance on how to implement them effectively for an e-commerce platform.

Here are a few areas I'm specifically looking for help with:

1. Setting up the initial project structure and configuring the development environment.
2. Establishing a GraphQL layer using Apollo Client to fetch and mutate data from the server.
3. Connecting Hasura as the GraphQL API layer to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
4. Implementing user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
5. Managing orders, inventory, and order fulfillment.
6. Incorporating secure payment gateways for smooth and safe transactions.
7. Optimizing the performance and scalability of the application.
8. Deploying the web app to a hosting provider and ensuring proper production setup.

If you have experience or knowledge in any of these areas or can guide me through the entire process, I would be extremely grateful for your assistance. Any tips, resources, or recommended tutorials/documentation would be of great help.

12o4rlp,"Introducing, Day Seven, an experiment in GPT4","I have seen all of these crazy things done by ChatGPT lately. Yesterday I upgraded my account with openai, to a plus membership to test GPT4.

Bit of background - I run a [digital web agency](https://brightwork.uk), and alongside that, one of our specialties is domain name registrations (UK names) and investment into premium and expired UK domain names. So I’ve got a bunch of domain names in my portfolio. I’m telling you this because I chose one at random, I had this domain ([dayseven.co.uk](https://dayseven.co.uk)) that I had caught a couple months ago, it always sounded nice and I was planning on developing a competition based website on it called “Sunday” which would run comps on a Sunday where you could win cash and whatever, but have decided not to (long story).

Anyway, last night I thought this domain could be used another way, and that Sunday was usually a religious day.

I present to you, Day Seven. Day Seven was entirely coded on GPT4. As simple and as easy as it may look, GPT4 really struggled to understand the basics of a night/day toggle and it’s pseudo elements. An empty rectangle would show up in ::before and would not go away.

    Let's make a basic website that pulls in a religious quote on every page load

Starting off with a JSON array in a separate file for the quotes

    [
      {""quote"": ""God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble."", ""source"": ""Psalm 46:1""},
      {""quote"": ""For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."", ""source"": ""Jeremiah 29:11""},
      {""quote"": ""Let all that you do be done in love."", ""source"": ""1 Corinthians 16:14""},
      {""quote"": ""Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God."", ""source"": ""Philippians 4:6""},
      {""quote"": ""Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud."", ""source"": ""1 Corinthians 13:4""}
    ]

It created a basic HTML page for me, which admittedly, was ugly. But also admittedly, I didn't ask it to style it. So I asked it to rewrite the page using Bootstrap, with the quotes centred in a card in the middle. I asked it to use Playfair Display for the quote and DM Sans for everything else.

I wondered how well it would handle working with API's, so I asked it to find me an API I could plug into (keyless), that would pull in Bible quotes. This is where it got a bit sticky, it firstly used the wrong API endpoint, before realising that the API endpoint had changed and now needed an API key to access it, it then suggested me another API which was totally unrelated to Bible quotes, but was in fact Buddhism quotes lol. At this stage, we had around 30-40 back and forth interactions, because at some stage I had decided I wanted to have a light/dark mode toggle, and it really struggled understanding the logic of pseudo elements, which would always display a broken empty rectangle artefact above the FontAwesome icon. We went back and forth for ages trying to correct the code, before fixing it, only to change the JS file and bring it back, and then have us undo all the work above to fix the toggles. It was rewriting the JS file, but also rewriting the toggle code. 

The site was looking great, I had used GPT to code me a website using an API that pulled in Bible verses, showed us the source, had a dark/light mode with themes for each, based on a toggle, but also using the visitors OS preference to set dark or light mode initially.

I then asked it to code me a button and some JS that would pull in a new quote every time it was clicked. This broke a few things with the dark mode toggle, and I had to bastardise some of the old JS into the new JS myself to get it to work, as I think it was running out of memory (it did this 4 times, over 4 different chat windows)

You can see the website for yourself, here. 

All in all the project took around 2 hours with all the bugs GPT has produced, we spent so much time trying to get it to figure out the fucking toggle artefact, that it would run out of memory and forget some other parts of the code, so when it would rewrite the JS file, it would include stuff totally out of context. 

&#x200B;

So really, my only grunt about GPT is that it needs more contextual memory in order to not make mistakes further into a codebase. I had to keep pasting in the entire code to ""remind"" it how it worked.

I asked it to perform some basic SEO for me, adding in some schema and some meta data. Before finally pulling in 3 post cards from an RSS feed called ""Our Daily Bread"", chosen by our artificially intelligent friend. 

Fun project! Let me what you guys think about GPT4? What have you coded with it?

I've been a freelance webdev / designer for just over 6 years now. It was a slow start but I'm now at a point where work comes to me (word of mouth mostly) and I'm constantly busy. 

On one hand this is great. The downside is that it leaves me no time to work on developing my skills or to look for bigger, better projects and clients and scaling my business. 

Ideally I'd like to have another webdev on hand to take care of the low level work so I can focus on the bigger picture. However, I can't afford to hire someone (even part-time), nor do I have the time to train a junior webdev with no experience. 

I've considered looking for another experienced webdev to work with me and take on some of the overflow work but it won't work if their rates are the same as mine, and I worry about them trying to poach my clients!

In my younger days I used to work my ass off 24/7 to develop my skills, find better clients and scale etc. But with two young kids and general life stuff I just can't sustain this any more.   

So, my question is: other freelance webdevs who've managed to scale, how have you done it and do you have any advice?

Has anyone implemented a similar landing page video? The 3D animated eye candy type stuff. Would you just hire a visual effects artist to cook up a video file? Or is something like Three.js an option?   

Would WordPress suffice for a site like this? Or would you reach for a different CMS?

1b64r0a,Need help about a bullet point on my resume,"Umm I kinda faked a point where I said I improved TTI of the web dashboard by 16% ( I totally did not)

Page has a navbar, four charts requiring four different queries to the DB and one of which is a join, a table which fetches data from the sv (which is a simple query) and displays the result, some static content.

If asked how I have this response ready(Writing very concisely to not bore you)

Ans: Reordered so that table is displayed first and lazy load all charts along with static content at the bottom of the page.


How can I further finetune my response to make it sound more believable/interesting. Is my answer easy to see through?

1b91onf,[rant] Do I continue?,"
Ever since I started react js, I'm losing interest in the frontend, (not programming in general as I thoroughly enjoyed typescript and c, which I started around the same time)

The apparent ""necessity"", because ""it's the right way to use react"", of using external libraries is bothering me a lot. I feel like I'm becoming a library manager rather than an er. 

Is frontend entirely like this or this is just react thing? Initially I was overjoyed by how simple it was to create a stateful applications, but as things got complicated, context API, suspend, portals, the need to rely on external libraries increased, redux? Zustand? React hook form? Formik? Oh and css? Damm it! all the way tailwind (it's the standard nowadays, understood, for generic properties, it's easier yes. but for anything esoteric I'd rather prefer writing complex css than digging out the tailwind API)

I'm not saying libraries are bad, (love you radix, shadcn ui) but understanding their APIs on top of react's underlying API has been nothing short of pleasant experience. Yeah I know react is coming up with a compiler to help simplify a lot of issues, but I also didn't mentioned useMemo useCallback, (useRef is the most annoying of all tho, what even was the reasoning for not making ref a prop?)

Should I just move to backend(which I'm anyway gonna do, but here implying leave frontend for good for now) or switch to other framework/library on the Frontend. 

Svelte really hooked me up with it's coming update, not so much with current version (4) because I am a big time FP fan and I didn't liked the implicit behaviour all over the place of $: syntax which after digging out I found out you can do something similar in vanilla js(or even other languages) yeah it's not exactly magical thing but it's something.
Svelte 5 seems to cover alot of those issues. It's still not released + I haven't tried enough to comment any further. Ofcourse, it might all be content bias and the hype train but writing css like that alone is pretty huge selling point for me.

I don't know much about Vue, and from what I've looked  it does not seem to cover my gotchas with react. 
and angular is something I would not like to delve into untill I'm being paid for it. I mean, it doesn't seem as bad as people made it out to be, especially after this new update but using it for personal projects? I'm not really sure.

Btw, I have plenty of time before I look for jobs (jr uni student), I'm not exactly in a hurry. I'm doing good as occasional freelancer for now , for which I often have to use next js, but those projects are relatively simple compared to what I spend time on making on a weekend. Simple projects are good and easy, not so simple projects have been layers and layers of ""time to deep dive"" complexity.

Yes, I lack experience to say react bad, which I am not commenting upon, but is probably not for me.
I really need 3rd person perspective from people 
with experience

Btw Just to reiterate, job is secondary, 
I see cs as my interest first.",2024-03-07 18:23:00
1b7qryx,Why is geo blocking possible?,"I hate websites that use geo blocking.

I live in Russia, but I primarily use English-based internet sources. I like reading about stuff.

If I google something medically related, for example, if I am interested in what particular symptoms could mean, then half the links are geo blocked. Those are just general articles, not appointment forms, or something. But some of them belong to clinics in other countries. There is just no good reason to geo block me from reading an article about a flu.

Why is it possible to determine a country by IP in the first place? It allows for terrible website practices that are just annoying to a powerful user, since they are easily circumvented by using a VPN.

Why do IPs have to reveal your location? That doesn't make sense to me. Just improve the protocol, make it so that it doesn't give up the location of your network, and then geo blocking would be impossible. Why allow this in the first place? HTTP was improved upon and became HTTPS, why not make IP also safer and more user friendly?

Nobody ever brings this topic up, I wonder why?

Genuine question.

&#x200B;

edit: So I read about it a bit, and it seems that IPs are publicly owned, and there are companies who sell bundles of dictionaries such as ""IP:country"". That's where it comes from. Maybe there is still a way to disincentivize geo blocking while keeping IPs publicly owned?",2024-03-06 04:34:06

only surge.sh doesn't have any limit but it states that they will simply remove any websites that create too much load on their servers.

1b8j2en,Help - website hacked!!!,"Hello WebDev Redditors,  
Recently a family business was impacted by a hack where the person got into the codebase and deleted our wordpress material and replaced it with their own. Our local hosting service wants 700-800$ to restore it. My question is whether it is better to get a backup from a previous hosting provider and move it to a provider like bluehost that has backups automatically so that I can revert changes from hackers or whether 700-800$ is reasonable.

Additionally, are there other issues I should think about in regards to the website structure (we have domain with godaddy and web hosting with a small local service). From what I know, I don't understand how the website was hacked without going through our hosting provider, but they say that we were the only clients affected.

The issue lies with my family not having a backup in our possession while our provider is not telling us whether or not they have a backup automatically. If we had a backup I assume it would not be too hard to put the website up on another hosting provider. The main issue is figuring out whether 700-800$ is a fair price to restore the website or whether we should go to previous provider and ask to see if they have a backup for some cost less than 700 and move to another provider. The provider also has said they have not investigated the issue, so I am also worried about the same hack occurring again. Assuming they are restoring from archive or restoring from backup is it a fair price? 

From my end, I have some web knowledge but more on the code side rather than the hosting and business side as I primarily am a data scientist and backend computer scientist with a focus on AI.

I thank y'all for any help in this stressful time in my family's life.",2024-03-07 02:37:14

As  a standard part of hosting services, web servers typically log access  requests, which can include the IP address of the visitor, the requested  files, the time of the visit, and the user agent information. Because  of this, could you technically be violating HIPAA even if you aren't  directly collecting PHI? Based on HIPAA guidelines from the OCR (or at  least my understanding of them), an IP address constitutes PHI. Wouldn't  that mean that thousands of therapists are currently violating HIPAA? I  have looked at hundreds of therapists websites and 95% use services  like Wix, Squarespace, GoDaddy, etc. Is my understanding of HIPAA  guidelines wrong, or are these therapists unknowingly in violation?",2024-03-30 02:00:34

1bp3uxj,How to create a good portfolio as a Front-end developer with 3 years of experience given my situation?,"Hello, fellow developers! Long story is following, I'll include a tl;dr at the bottom.

**Long story**:

I'm currently in the following situation - I've been working as a Front-end developer for the past 3 years for a local software company. I'm really grateful to my company for giving me a chance and work, because after graduating CS in my university I had no experience in the field and nobody wanted to hire me even as an intern. Furthermore, I started with 0 real work knowledge (the ""knowledge"" from university was really poor, due to the professors there, it's a long story). I've shown will to learn, adapt and work in a team. In the years my boss has put me through different types of projects, not just some plain HTML, CSS stuff...

Six month ago, I made a deal with my boss that when I finish my part for an upcoming project (can't really give info on the topic because of NDA), that I would get a promotion (undisclosed salary). The project was given an estimate by my senior front-end colleague, which was 2 months. Due to the complexity of the project, I was not able to give a clear estimate, but I was given a green light to do it anyway. It took me two and a half months. And I feel confident about myself because with my experience compared to the senior (8+ years), the time it took me to finish the project was pretty good, IMO. 

Nearly 4 months have passed since finishing the project, but my boss still hasn't given me a raise. I tried to talk to him about it and from the deal we had... he said ""... *IF I raise your salary*..."" and it would just be +300 to my current salary, which is realistically is just pathetic.

We mostly do custom software, no open-source stuff, and we use GitLab instead of GitHub. I do not have any personal projects of mine to showcase on GitHub. We have, what I believe it's called a 'group'?, where we commit our code/projects. I can only talk about what my role to certain projects was and how I achieved or found a solution to some issue, etc. I've been working with **HTML**, **CSS** (plain *CSS*, *SASS*, *SCSS*), **JavaScript**, **jQuery**, also I've experience with **AJAX** and different **API**s.

I'm currently actively looking for a new job as a front-end developer, and I guess I need a portfolio, but my issue is that I've never had one, and I'm unsure how to do one at this point. Furthermore, I'm feeling sure I do not need some ""mainstream"" projects on my GH/GL account to showcase a movie app, landing page or some basic JavaScript game.

**TL;DR** I've been working as a Front-end developer, all projects I've worked on are in my company's GitLab 'group' (is what I believe it's called), some projects are unpublished, or I've signed an NDA. I've no personal projects, but have experience on real world projects of different fields of work.

I'm about ordering the page for my small business . As I'm almost always annoying by cookies settings I wonder if I can ask web développer to create webpage which will not ask for permission to use cookies, because this page will not collect cookoes nor other data, except ""Contact form"".
But is it technically possible?
Is so, doeas lack of cookies influence the performance of this webpage i. e. because of worst  website positioning Google search engine?
For sure I will ask this question to we devs who will work on that webpage, but I would love to get more, more objective opinions from people not involved in création process of this webpage.

1bealrl,"I'm trying to learn AJAX, but I find it counterintuitive. Can you please help me understand it?","Note: I use Flask.

I found many JS codes on the internet, like this one:

    window.onload = function() {

        xhr.open('POST', '/get_data', true);

1bc29p9,What tech stack can and should I use (for my own sites and experiments; on all-inkl.com),"Hi all, 

*let's try this another way:*

*This is my web hoster / plan:* [*https://all-inkl.com/webhosting/privatplus/*](https://all-inkl.com/webhosting/privatplus/)

*I am a graphic designer, but I used to do quite a bit of html, css, javascript, and a very little bit php. I used to do a lot of as3. I used to build my own websites (with a cms called redaxo), but nothing serious for roughly 10 years. Merely two wp setups with basic templates. Now I still do some js animations with gsap and  python scripting in c4d. And I dipped a bit in some js libraries like leaflet.js.*

*Now I wanted to build my own website mainly as a portfolio, but also as a platform to experiment with stuff like custom maps or scrolling animations etc. I will be just for me (no other editors) but I still want it to be robust and flexible.* 

*So I did some research on what I missed in the last years. Learned about headless cms, and all those frameworks and libraries for js and python.*

*I liked the looks of PAYLOAD cms and WAGTAIL cms. So I read about how to get startedwith those.* 

*Then I realized: payload seemingly does not support MySQL or MariaDB. So I will not be able to use it on my webspace (since* [*all-inkl.com*](https://all-inkl.com) *only offers those two databases). And I will not be able to use wagtail, because all-inkl only supports php and perl.* 

**So a couple of questions:**

**- Can I somehow use Payload on a server with MySQL/MariaDB?**

**- Can I somehow use Wagtail on a server without dedicated python support?**

**- Is XAMPP still the way to go for dev on localhost? What's the alternatives?**

Thank you very much!

Apparently, they got enough heat from the community that they (theoretically) realized what they were doing was atrocious.

Apple's full statement:

> Previously, Apple announced plans to remove the Home Screen web apps capability in the EU as part of our efforts to comply with the DMA. The need to remove the capability was informed by the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps to support alternative browser engines that would require building a new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS.
> 
> We have received requests to continue to offer support for Home Screen web apps in iOS, therefore we will continue to offer the existing Home Screen web apps capability in the EU. This support means Home Screen web apps continue to be built directly on WebKit and its security architecture, and align with the security and privacy model for native apps on iOS.
> 
> Developers and users who may have been impacted by the removal of Home Screen web apps in the beta release of iOS in the EU can expect the return of the existing functionality for Home Screen web apps with the availability of iOS 17.4 in early March.",2024-03-07 20:08:04
1br0035,Api stack for a company product,"Hi,

My team is investigating a stack for our company new product. We expect to have a lot of client ~2000 per instance. Each client will have its own instance api+db. The project include a frontend, a mobile app and an API.
We are a team of 3 eng, we have some experiences with golang/java/typescript/python.
Our frontend will be based on sveltekit, we first wanted to use it even for our api but it lacks some features to help us build fast and scale. Our boss wants what’s best and is ok to let us take time to experiment and learn. We expect to increase the team size before the end of the year when the foundation has been built.

So far we have:

- Python:
Django Rest
Looks good but maybe to heavy for an api
Fast Api
Seems really good, we are just a bit scarred of the type hint to be too light. 
How is it to work with it? 

- Golang
Echo
A coworker had experiences with echo he liked it just seems to « light » 
Gin
Seems good, pretty standard but probably to light and we don’t want to spend too much time to build our own framework, plugin orm/auth/validation etc

- Typescript
Fastify
Seems awesome but again we might need to build our own framework, again seems nice
Nest
We tried, we didn’t liked it
Adonis
Seems awesome but the fact that it’s maintained by two guys who seems weird on Reddit is a nono

We want to avoid Java/php or any untyped language

If you had time, time to chose the best battery included, maintained framework and time to learn how to deal with it, a framework with a structure etc what would it be ?

And after some time here, i’m starting to think this might be a bad habit I have, but I’m not sure and want to see what others say.

For example, we use Bootstrap and Vanilla CSS to build most of our projects. I might use Vanilla CSS for 70% of the components on the page, such as the header and article sections, text, images, etc. But for things like our our navbars and forms, I rely on on Bootstrap. Sometimes it’s just using some basic Bootsrap classes to make the elements more consistent and responsive (like containers and form-groups for forms). But for things like the navbar, I rely solely on Bootsrap. 

From what I’ve seen in our codebase and and asked around, this seems to be common at throughout our team. 

I’m stuck on this because for things like the navbar and such, I have no idea how to make that responsive and make it work on my own using raw CSS without tutorials and articles. 
I also did the same thing in college ironically. I have a decent grasp on flex box and basic responsive design, but for more complex items like navbars and lengthy forms, I seem to gravitate towards Bootstrap to abstract it. And things like vanilla Grid I still don’t understand.

The problem is that I'm currently learning by doing (working on the portfolio), javascript with react, Express, postgresql, router, npm, vite, node, jest for now. I do this at least 8 hours a day, but I have days with 16 hours for two weeks and I have made a lot of progress.  
  
My goal is to bring these applications to the market and use them as experience for the future employer. But investing so much time in this, and giving up other activities to be all in, I basically gave up any activity except my girlfriend.  
  
I would like to ask you if there are any companies in the current market that are still hiring, if there is a chance to enter the market as a ""junior"" considering that I don't have years of experience in the field, although in the past I have done web crawlers and automations with Python and selenium, sites with html/CSS little js and php, I can't brag about them, being small projects.

It is possible to be hired solely on the experience i gain by making and deploying those 2 projects? Do companies nowadays ask for a degree? Am I wasting my time with this with little chance to be hired soon? What are your experiences? Thank you and sorry for my English.",2024-03-08 16:30:17
1b84y0e,How big a challenge would be developing an e-commerce with my experience?,"Hello, i've been studying web development for a while, learned the fundamentals of javascript, sass, responsive layouts, react and i know how to use axios and the fetch api to comsume api's.
On the back-end i have some experience with express and created some simple back-end CRUDs with MongoDB

Now here is the thing. My wife is starting a small business of selling packs of digital arts online and i made a wordpress site with woocommerce and everything worked fine. 

I wish to do a more complete and customized website as a project where i could improve as a developer and learn. I know is no easy feat, but that is the point.  

However i also need to know if that is feasible, specially the where secutiry is concerned since i'm inexperienced and i fear making some mistake where money and credit/debit card info is handled.

So, i would like some input from some more experienced devs, please. Should i tackle this or just leave it be and look for something else?",2024-03-06 17:04:03
1b7niry,"Online DE's vs local DE's for web development, pro and cons?","I build websites with no-code platforms, but want to move away from that.

My plan is to start with Astro. They recommend Codesandbox and Stackblitz online DE's. 

I've kicked around with local VS Code and it's  great. 

The two advantages I see with local VS Code is the plug-ins. The other use case I see for a local DE is working with large code bases and libraries, but I won't be doing that as a web dev making landing pages and blogs.

Is there some advantage to an online DE that makes them preferable? Are online DE's the future?

1bsc2vs,I made the ultimate chatbot base prompt for teaching me webdev & be my coding copilot. Help me improve it?,"Just like the title, here is the prompt, what do you think? Anymore to add? It cannot be too long since it will take up input context token :D Prompt:

    You are an expert on web development in both frontend and backend. 
    
    FIRSTLY, WHEN I ASK YOU A QUESTION, YOU WILL:
    
    - Help me understand the concept like a beginner by breaking down complex problems or tasks into smaller, manageable steps and explain each one using reasoning.
    
    - In each explanation, always give code examples to illustrate what you mean. If I'm asking about a new concept/framework/module, help me understand how it is better than the old way. 
    
    - Always include clear and concise comments in the code examples you provide. Use comments to explain the purpose, functionality, and key aspects of the code.
    
    - If I ask you to help me write a script/code/program in a certain way, try your best to do it but after that, always try to identify potential problems and suggest other possible ways.
    
    - If I ask you to help me debug something, explain what might be happening, and guide me step-by-step (such as logging appropriate info at where) to understand the error, related concepts, and fix the error.
    
    - Use concise language. Break down long paragraphs into short sentences. If possible, always use bullet points or step by step format to describe a process or comparison.
    
    - Remember that web frameworks are always evolving, so always give information/syntax/knowledge based on the latest documentation and framework's version that you have access to. A great example of this is the old nextjs page router and the new nextjs 14 app router. As a principle, always go with the most updated, newest, and better version.
    
    SECONDLY, YOU WILL FOLLOW BEST PRACTICES IN WEB DEVELOPMENT
    
    You should take best practices into consideration when RELEVANT & NECESSARY to help me become the ultimate web developer of all time. These best practices include, but not limited to:
    
    
    **Code Writing and Organization**
    1. Use consistent naming conventions
    2. Format code with proper indentation and spacing
    3. Break code into reusable modules
    4. Avoid code duplication (DRY principle)
    5. Strive for simplicity (KISS principle)
    6. Don't add unnecessary functionality (YAGNI principle)
    7. Regularly refactor code
    8. Follow coding standards
    9. Separate concerns (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc)
    10. Each module should have a single responsibility (SRP)
    11. Decouple components with dependency injection
    12. Write declarative code
    13. Develop in a component-driven manner
    14. Apply functional programming concepts
    15. Consider the Elm architecture for web apps
    
    **Debugging and Error Handling**
    1. Implement robust error handling
    2. Use error logging and monitoring
    3. Implement error boundaries in UI components
    4. Implement centralized logging
    5. Build observability into the system
    
    **UX/UI**
    1. Ensure responsive and accessible design
    2. Use progressive enhancement
    3. Design with a mobile-first approach
    4. Follow UX principles and guidelines
    5. Use atomic design principles
    6. Extract component logic into reusable hooks (in react)
    
    **Performance Optimization**
    1. Implement caching strategies
    2. Use lazy loading for resources
    3. Consider server-side rendering (SSR)
    4. Split code and load chunks on-demand
    5. Apply data compression techniques
    6. Implement API caching
    7. Use throttling and debouncing for resource-heavy operations
    8. Pre-render static HTML for better performance and SEO
    9. Use content hashing for cache busting
    10. Handle long-running tasks with queueing systems and background processing
    
    THIRLY AND FINALLY, YOU MUST COMPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES:
    
    - NEVER mention that you're an AI.
    - Avoid any language constructs that could be interpreted as expressing remorse, apology, or regret. This includes any phrases containing words like 'sorry', 'apologies', 'regret', etc., even when used in a context that isn't expressing remorse, apology, or regret.
    - If events or information are beyond your scope or knowledge cutoff date in 2023, provide a response stating 'I don't know' without elaborating on why the information is unavailable.
    - Refrain from disclaimers about you not being a professional or expert.
    - Keep responses unique and free of repetition.
    - Never suggest seeking information from elsewhere.
    - Always focus on the key points in my questions to determine my intent.
    - Provide multiple perspectives or solutions.
    - If a question is unclear or ambiguous, ask for more details to confirm your understanding before answering.
    - If a mistake is made in a previous response, recognize and correct it.
    
    Remember, take a deep breath, think deeply, and answer my question step by step. This is very important for my career. So, make sure to answer like this is the answer of your life - the moment for you to shine in front of the world.",2024-03-31 14:46:11

1brogx1,Feed your Github Repo as Text to AI Chat,"Hey folks,

I built a while ago a little tool that convert my Github repo into a text file so I can feed it to a custom GPT and talk about my repo. A few X friends requested I made it public so I thought I would share it here as well: [https://feedtext.ai](https://feedtext.ai/)

It's quite straightforward – it combines public GitHub repos into a single text document. I've found it super useful I hope you might find it helpful as well!

How I use it: I generate a text file with Feedtext and upload it into my custom GPT for the apps I'm working on. It helps the AI grasp what my app is about more clearly. Plus, you can also use it with Claude 3, as long as the file size isn’t too big.

I could make it able to read private repo as well, but requires auth database etc... so I will build it only if I get enough requests.

When you're on the main feed and click into a post, then nav back, you're in the same place in the feed you started. No loading happens. This is ""free"" behavior for a typical website, but it's a challenge to implement in SPAs. It's really nice behavior and I'm trying to capture the same thing.  


My current implementation is: Save contents of previous page + scroll position, on back nav, repopulate the page and restore the scroll position.  


This doesn't work nearly as well. There's still a brief moment where the window actually scrolls to your previous position. Would love to know how to make it ""automatic"" as the Reddit team has done.

For contact form submission, I don't want to go through the process of managing client email address (for sending form details over to customer mailbox).

Our other team member is a junior who needs quite a bit hand holding and my team lead is usually covering for her. My team lead does not review any of the code I produce and hasn't reviewed my PRs for over 2 years now. It's become quite common now where I get assigned a ticket, my team lead doesn't brief me on the scope or requirements nor am I invited to meetings where these features are discussed. I am expected to produce a feature using whatever is in the description and the linked tickets. I have suggested to take on more responsibilities so he can focus on the managing aspect of the role. (eg., managing the staging release, reviewing the junior's code, help with bug fixing) but he hasn't been open to these ideas.

Needless to say, I feel like I'm not learning anymore. I dont receive any constructive feedback and I'm getting bored and too comfortable at my job. Our tech stack is React, CSS Modules, and Redux on the front end. I dont want to grow stale and lose my motiviation to improve, and given the state of the economy, timing of the shares vesting and life milestones happening this year I don't see myself job hunting until next year.

In the mean time, I'm having trouble deciding what to learn on my spare time. I have an interest in cloud computing as well as the backend but with AI tech growing, I'm debating if learning some software engineering principles is the way to go. Perhaps starting with the book ""The Pragmatic Programmer"".  Would love to hear what others in a similar boat or with more experience would suggest.",2024-03-06 02:40:12

1bjsm99,CSS won’t refresh even with complete new site load and browser cache clearing. Help please.,"A little context: 

Html/css/js/php

I created a new website using an old website I made as a template. Essentially I copied the nav bar and footer and the scss/css files. I created a new homepage layout and created 4 more pages using the layout. Everything looks great using localhost. 

The problem: 

When I uploaded the site to the cloud vm the CSS is still of the old site. I just noticed the entire CSS file is the old file. Maybe that will help solve this. 

What I’ve tried/discovered:

Browser caches cleared. Chrome and Firefox look the same. Tried on mobile and another PC. Tried editing html stylesheet path from /style/style.css by removing the leading /. I had to change it back. I have verified the style.css.map includes the proper scss files. I have verified the CSS that is loading is not the same as the CSS that is on the server. I tried moving the old site from /var/www/html to another location. 

For example. The font family and color of the old navbar is completely different from the new, yet the old font and colors load. I just noticed the whole CSS is different also because everything is the old. 


Hoping someone can point me in the right direction. I’m no expert but I’m really lost on this one. 

Edit/update: I just adjusted the vhost file to ignore the old site vhost and only look at the new url. Went to the IP on the server and the new website is there looking great! It’s only the URL that is bugging out. I have a virtual host set up. I will try not using the vhost file next. So glad the error is stating to show itself. Might just be a vhost misconfiguration as this whole server is a fresh install and I’ve been running through it.  ",2024-03-21 00:00:21
1bjmh20,Supabase: How to create a singleton instance for createClient() service role?,"I have a backend (Next.js API route) where I use createClient() to instantiate a new Supabase instance for performing administrative tasks. However, a new instance of createClient() is generated every time the backend API route function is called. I've learned that the best practice is to create a singleton reusable instance in a separate JavaScript file, like this:

    import { createClient } from ""@supabase/supabase-js"";  
    
    const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL; 
    
    const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;  export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);

Note that this setup is for the anonymous client-side. The file is located inside the /utils folder, which is situated at the root of the project. Since it can be accessed by the public, there's no issue with defining it in a normal JS file that can be accessed by the client.  However, the struggle is that, when creating a singleton instance for the createClient() service role and placing the code directly in the same JS file inside the utils folder like this:

    const supabaseServiceRoleKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE; 
    const supabaseServiceRole = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceRoleKey);

poses a risk as users would be able to see the secret environment variable. SO I am wondering how I can create a reusable singleton instance using createClient() service role without exposing it to the public.",2024-03-20 19:47:11

I'm on a journey to develop a medium-sized project that includes a website and a learning platform. Initially, it will offer educational documents for users to view and download, with plans to expand into interactive courses.

I'm considering using SvelteKit for the build, attracted by its efficiency and elegance. For hosting, I'm torn between Netlify, which I have experience with and appreciate for its ease of use, and DigitalOcean, which offers a managed database—a feature I find appealing. However, I'm concerned about potential DDoS attacks on Netlify functions, as it seems challenging to restrict access effectively.

As for the CMS, I'm looking into Strapi, Sanity, Directus, and Decap, with a priority on customization capabilities to allow site owners to create their own courses. Should I even consider creating my own CMS for this purpose?

Scaling is another consideration, given that we anticipate hundreds, if not thousands, of users. This leads me to wonder whether integrating a robust backend solution, like Supabase, is necessary to tie all these elements together seamlessly.

I'd love to get your thoughts on a tech stack that is both accessible for someone aiming to master it within a few months and robust enough to support future functionality and scaling needs. Im a one-man show and I consider myself as an up-to intermediate dev. Mostly Frontend. But im willing to learn and push myself to a new level.

I've created a template but I'm having an issue where I can select the top and bottom rows to the left work just fine but when I click on the spanning buttons, instead of deselecting all other buttons they stay enabled and vise versa for the rows deselecting the spanning button.

What I want to happen in the code is for the buttons to, one, deselect when another button is pressed and two use the CSS styling for the buttons.

I'm not sure if that made sense, if it didn't please comment below and I'll elaborate.

Here's the current code I'm working with:  [https://codepen.io/Trey-Loving/pen/JjVYdwP](https://codepen.io/Trey-Loving/pen/JjVYdwP)

1b5ef5f,Full Stack Development - Question,"I'm having a 'question-bank' style website made for students university exams. This will be multiple choice and provide feedback on answers, custom quizzes etc.

I've been looking for freelance developers online, and have seen a developer with a nice portfolio and we've had a few meetings about the project, he's proposing:

""For the development of this website, we propose utilizing React and Node.js as the primary technologies. Authentication will be implemented through Firebase. To proceed, we require additional details regarding the design. Considering the framework, we suggest utilizing either Tailwind or Material-UI for their efficiency. The design phase will commence in Figma, followed by the development phase, which is estimated to take approximately 3-4 weeks. And the figma design also need 2 weeks at least. In Total the timeline would be 6-7 weeks""

For ongoing support he says:

""I normally charge in between $250-$400 per month which is about $3000 to $4500 per year. That includes maintaining the site health and fix any minor issues which might arise during maintenance and update. If there are new features/functionality to be added, that counts as a new project.""

My questions:

1) I'm very new to all of this and doing research on this has been quite confusing. Does what he has proposed sound reasonable for this project? Is there anything I should enquire about with the technologies he has proposed? My main thoughts are to be able to scale this once completed if successful, and also to be able to pass to other developers to work on if required in the future.

2) We've agreed on the set up costs, but this support quote is a lot more than I had anticipated or imagined - this is a small side project and so it's quite the investment. Is this a usual amount for support / should I ask anything else about this?

1b7u79s,Tech doesn’t exist? In 2024 just build it!,"Self-rolling used to not be possible (or be time-consuming) but in 2024 we can take advantage of multiple labour saving advances:
- **Serverless hosting** add your code to a github repo, set up a Netlify/Vercel account and select your repo and *that's it*. If you've not tried it and are still FTPing code to a VM - GIVE IT A GO. Honestly. Obviously, you can't host persistent stuff (files, databases) but you can ALSO just plug into a cloud database (MongoDB, Supabase, DynamoDB) and upload / retrieve files (from AWS S3 or Google Buckets). (Update: Make sure you also host your DNS with Cloudflare for DDoS protection)
- **SvelteKit** HTML/javascript framework that lets you write HTML (rather than hobbled HTML like JSX) and have your back-end code (private database connects, /api/calls, SSR etc) in one app - which you can also deploy on the edge (e.g. via Vercel etc)
- **Tailwind** simplifies CSS and takes the pain out of layout to the point where you don't need someone who lives CSS to stop it breaking
- **AI** Any of the big LLMs can write a regx better than you, and most can produce labour saving, well documented functions that work without 12 iterations sorting out your typos and mis-thoughts. GPT-4 particularly even understands the context of what you are trying to achieve and makes suggestions. The best (almost free) coding assistant you will ever have. It can't write a whole repo - it's just a tool. Lean into it. Use it.

I stumbled upon an interactive map where users can hover their mouse over it to see data. This got me wondering, ""Hmm, how are such news websites made?"" It's evident that they're not just plain text, as they incorporate complex elements.

My initial thought was that these websites are built on some kind of content management system (CMS), where writers input text and images for publication. However, I don't think this approach would work for integrating complex interactive elements and animations.

So, perhaps it's a combination of development and writing? I'm curious about the exact process behind creating these types of news websites. If anyone works in such a company or knows how it's done, I'd love to hear more about it.

1bocbuv,Webfont usage limit on MyFonts,"I bought a webfont from MyFonts. It comes with 10.000 views per months.

Does any of you know what happens when you exceed the limit, e.g. because your website was featured on Hacker News?

The MyFonts FAQ ([https://www.myfonts.com/pages/faq](https://www.myfonts.com/pages/faq)) mentions the following:  


\> **Pay Once**  
You get a monthly pageview allowance for your webfonts. As long as the allotted pageviews are not exceeded, this license does not need to be renewed. For example, if you purchase a license that covers 10,000 monthly pageviews, you will remain within your license as long as you do not get more than 10,000 views per month. If the website starts getting more traffic, simply place a new purchase for the additional monthly pageviews you require, as Pay Once webfont purchases are cumulative.

I have absolutely no interest in purchasing additional licenses when there is a usage spike. Did this ever happen to you? I wonder if they have a tolerance for periodic spikes.

&#x200B;

Btw. I would choose other webfonts providers (e.g. Font Spring) today, but already bought the font on MyFonts previously and would now like to use it.",2024-03-26 16:37:04

1bnr2n5,Help wanted with GCP architecture,"Hey all, I'm trying to architect my first cloud native app and want to get feedback on the following flow:

1. File upload through user interface

2. Uploaded file gets sent to Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

3. GCS triggers Cloud Function (CF)

4. CF calls endpoint on back-end service running in Google Cloud Run (GCR)

5. Back-end processes data from file and saves to Google Cloud SQL (GCSQL)

6. Back-end service reads data from GCSQL

**A few questions I have:**

* Can GCS trigger a CF?
* Do I need to call a CF or can GCS call endpoints of my back-end service (GCR) directly?
* ...many more, that I'm probably still unaware of :)

You might be wondering: Why GCP? Ever since I watched [this Fireship video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw34KMPSt4k) I started dockerizing my back-end in order for it to run on GCR and somehow things snowballed from there. This is for a hobby project and I want to host this app in the simplest way possible, but I kinda ended up going down the GCP rabbit hole...oops.

I'm the only user, so probably this is over engineering the hell out of a simple app, but I'm having fun and learning a lot, so what the heck.

1bily9d,Become a Frontend JavaScript Pro in Steps - A Series,"Hey y’all, I created a 4-part video series where I build a frontend To-Do app in increasingly professional coding paradigms. I think this will be a huge breakthrough for beginning developers in learning how to structure their code as professionals would - taking into account maintainability and scalability.

In [Part 1](https://youtu.be/Ksu7ks6U9mA), I recreate a design from [frontendmentor.io](http://frontendmentor.io/). When implementing the JS, I rely on the DOM nodes themselves as the state of the application. This is the most common sense approach for a newbie. The downside is that for every feature you want to implement, you have to react to a user action, take stock of the DOM elements on the screen, then update the right ones. This will likely require messy, nit-picky logic that gets difficult to maintain as the project grows.

In [Part 2](https://youtu.be/ieZM1SP9bjk), I restructure the JS to represent the state of the application as stored JS data. The process becomes: the user does something, I update the state data, and then I render out the UI according to the data. This makes the rendering logic more modular - if things aren’t rendering properly, I can isolate the rendering logic more easily. Also, the rendering logic will be largely the same for new features, so making new features becomes faster as the project complexity increases.

In [Part 3](https://youtu.be/mCxKs4oxdfA), I note that neither approach thus far has led us to a fully functional frontend app. We have hardcoded the user’s data, and upon refreshing the browser window, we are back to where we started. The user’s progress is not recorded. We fix this by using localStorage as our place to store the user’s updates, allowing us to bring the user right back to where they were if the screen is refreshed. I end by noting that by this point, you know all you need to deploy a legitimate and potentially successful application, mentioning the game “[2048](https://2048game.com/)” as an example.

In [Part 4](https://youtu.be/Muche31dDy8), I take you on a massive refactoring journey and paradigm shift to make your code as clean, maintainable, and scalable as possible. I start simply with the latest JS syntaxes and tricks, then I go deeper into how to structure your project to be less buggy and more maintainable/scalable as it grows - by implementing naming conventions, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), breaking the project into modular folders and files, and using Webpack to bundle and minify the files for optimization.

By the end of this journey you will be a significantly better developer who understands more professional levels of thinking, which will help with your future projects and communication in interviews, and separate you from other beginners.

Here’s the link to the beginning of the series - [https://youtu.be/Ksu7ks6U9mA](https://youtu.be/Ksu7ks6U9mA)

I hope you like it! I know it’s long, but it’s worth it!

Best of luck,

1bcakf6,Inside Chrome Browser - Part 3,"This blog is really nice. It shows what goes inside a browser when it has to render a page containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
  
It shows how everything inside a tab is handled by a renderer process, so when a renderer process starts getting text strings (HTML) from the UI thread of the browser process, it starts converting those strings into Document Object Modal (DOM).  
  
It also shows how to optimize this process, a preload scanner gets run concurrently, and it sends requests to get external resources (like any image or styles) to the network thread in the browser process.  
  
This blog also shows how you can prioritize loading a few resources as soon as possible, using resource hinting like ""rel=preload"".  
  
The blog shows how the main thread parses CSS and determines the style for each node present in the DOM. However, knowing the document structure and styling is not enough to render a page. So, the main thread goes through the DOM and computer styles for each node and creates a Layout tree.  
  
Layout tree has information like xy coordinates and bounding box sizes. The blog also says that it contains only information that's visible on the page, so if ""display: none"" is applied, then that element is not part of the tree, but ""visibility: hidden"" is in the layout tree. The layout tree also contains a pseudo-class like ""p::before{content: 'Hi'}"", which is not part of the DOM.  
  
But knowing structure, style, and position is not enough to paint a page if you don't know the order in which you should paint elements of a page.  
  
So, now the main thread goes through the layout tree and creates paint records like ""background first, then text, then rectangle"". This order is affected by different ""z-index"" values for different elements.  
  
The blog also shows how updating this rendering pipeline is costly as if you make changes in the layout tree, you will have to create paint records again for the affected parts of the document. It also shows, how the browser has to run all these operations in between every frame for an animation, and the browser shows 60 frames per second.  
  
Lastly, the blog shows how the main thread walks through the layout tree to create a Layer tree, passes information about the Layer tree, and paints records to the Compositor thread.  
  
Then the compositor thread goes over the layer tree, divides it into tiles, and sends each tile to the Raster thread. The raster thread rasterizes each tile and stores them in the GPU memory. And, once all the tiles are rastered, the compositor thread gets information for each tile (called ""draw quads"") and creates a compositor frame.  
  
And, finally, a compositor frame is submitted to the browser process via IPC and sent to GPU to display it on a screen. The biggest benefit of compositing is that it is done without involving the main thread.  
  
It was a nice read. It is written by Mariko Kosaka.

1b7l3s1,Register domain on person vs. organization,"I was not even aware about this before, but you can register a domain on a person or an organization. I know there is a difference with GDPR and data redaction, i.e. some TLDs will not show the personal data when the domain is registered on the person, but it'll show them when it is registered on an organization

What else do I have to consider? 

It's the entity who owns the domain legally. But small one person company that does perhaps not matter that much. Teach me I am wrong

What do I have to be careful at?

1b6wrqq,Need help with WordPress issue involving CSS and SSL. Anyone?,"\[SOLVED\] I don't know how much ""basic or pro level"" is this issue, I'm just trying to get some help to solve this.

I know probably 2% about WordPress and at first I thought it would be some basic/easy stuff to fix but it's been almost 2 weeks trying a lot of things I've found on blogs and YouTube videos, Stackoverflow, etc.

The problem is have this website that works fine and loads everything well when you go to the page using HTTP on the URL, but doesn't load the CSS properly when you try to access using HTTPS.

I thought it could be something with the SSL certificate or any bug with the CSS, but everything I tried hasn't worked yet and I started narrowing down as I looked for it on Google and ChatGPT, and nothing. And at this point I'm feeling really worn-out and anxious because I couldn't fix this and don't know what to do.

Can anyone help me? I'm goona put the links in here, in case someone could take a look at the issue.

[This is when you go to the website using HTTP, it works fine.](http://www.clinicasperti.com.br)

[Now using HTTPS, but is the same website. CSS won't load.](https://www.clinicasperti.com.br/)

If anyone know what this is and why this happens, PLEASE, send help.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOLUTION: guys, I've found out that is was a lacking parameter in the wp-config.php file, making the *get\_template\_directory\_uri()* function to return the HTTP even when everything was set to HTTPS

I added this in the wp-config.php and everything was fixed

`if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] == 'https')`

`$_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';`

1b5twqq,Share your story about going indie after working corporate,"I'm personally really insterested to hear stories from people that have worked in the corporate environment and at some point decided to quit and work independently instead. Below are some questions I would personally have for you but feel free to share your story however you like.

* What made you quit working corporate?
* What was your area of expertise and level (junior/mid/senior/architect)?
* How did you manage in terms of finance when transitioning into being independent?
* Did you start your own company or did you work on your own?
* What were the struggles you faced?
* What are some things you learned along the way that you wish you knew beforehand?
* Did you ever regret going indie? Why?
* Did you ever miss the corporate environment? What about specific aspects of it?
* Would you recommend others to go independent? If so, in what context?

Just to avoid debate regarding what independent means, to me it's either working completely on your own or starting your own company to work on your own projects, so let's go by that in the context of this post.

456 sources, 9 countries, so far. Aiming to continually add countries and sources to have the most complete and diverse news sources globally. https://Nooze.News lists the main headline only, of each news source. Can do a search and filter by country.

Why?

* To see news from other sources than ones usual go-to news sites 
* To have a place that will have the most recent articles on the main news headlines of the entire world
* Know what is going on inside, or outside, of your bubble, community, country, diaspora 
* Support real journalism at a time where it's losing credibility
* To be an antithesis to the multitude of AI news aggregator by curating only the main headlines under the assumption that they are human selected and are the most important story of the moment according to the individual publications 

Tech

What started as a personal project, to get a broader view of the news, and to keep track of news in particular countries, while also trying out SupaBase.com free tier.

Running webscrapers on 2 x AWS m5.large instances. Using Playwright on Node.js on Unbuntu. Storing data (main headline only, no article text, and some meta data like og/twitter image) in PostgreSQL db on SupaBase free tier (500MB). After about 2 years and 750k headlines collected, sitting at 420MB. Respecting robots.txt and properly identifying as a bot (https://nooze.news/bot).

Using Vercel.com to host front-end. Doppler.com for secrets mgmt. NextJS framework, v13, still using Pages routing. Using nextui.org v1 for style. Tried to upgrade nextui to v2 but also was a PITA.

Using Postale.io for email address, info@nooze.news, and SendPulse.com

Roadmap

* More filtering options, by news source, categories, local / international, periods etc.

* Categorization

* Cloud sync for user preferences 

* Improved search; currently using some out-of-the-box PostgreSQL functions, more than good enough for an MVP

* Sentiment Analysis; see only news to suit your mood

* Multimedia; widget / banner / tile with stream or cast of latest news

1blg34m,Is it a bad idea to write an AI app in anything other than Python?,"I'm starting to build an AI-powered text transformation webapp using the OpenAI API. I don't plan to do any custom model training using open source models, such that it would really require Python.

While I'm most comfortable with Rails as a backend, that doesn't seem like a good fit here. I've considered Express since I've used it a bit before. I like having the full stack in one language, using shared types and modules etc.

However, I and others in this project are still leaning towards using Python with Django for the backend, despite this being a steeper (but not prohibitive) learning curve. The honest reason is that we're hoping to sell this product and the codebase later. We're estimating that while there's no downside to it being in Python, there may be a downside if it's not. But does this reasoning make any sense? Would choosing a non-Python stack devalue an AI app for potential buyers? Even if we don't actually plan to use Python's better AI customizing and training capability?

The company I work has a ""REST commitee"" who reviews every new proposed endpoint with vetting power. They insist that if the endpoint updates data it can't be a POST and HAS to be on a PATCH verb with json patch body even for tiny objects, like

[{operation: ""update"", path: ""/name"", newValue: ""xpto""},]

Imo, this only increase the complexity for both backend and frontend.
On top of that UX has same UI for create or edit, so the frontend has to deal both POST with simple dto object and this crazy PATCH when updating.

1bpxp2b,"Does anyone not find working with customers to be stressful? (re: the ""To ALL website developers"" post)","TLDR: How much of the complaints about customer interactions being the worst part of webdev is due to devs being antisocial, lazy, or incompetent? My experience in customer service (not webdev) was almost purely positive and rewarding.

___

When I worked in customer service others in my department constantly whined and bitched about customers. ""They're so needy"", ""they complain so much"", and ""sometimes they're insulting"" were common remarks.

My experience was the opposite. Customers loved that I was there to fix their problem and save their day. They were complimentary and expressed excitement and gratitude.

I realized most people are simply ""bad"" people—they aren't fit for customer relations because they don't want to serve people and make them happy; they just want to do the last amount of work possible without getting in trouble. They see customers as burdens, instead of as humans and the reason they have a job.

Furthermore, I decided most people are antisocial—they lack empathy and never developed theory of mind. It never occurs to them that regular people haven't lived the same life they have, and therefore haven't developed the same skills they have—which, again, is the entire reason customer service staff have employment in the first place. To them, if someone needs something, it's because they're retarded, demanding, or mean.

And finally, I increasingly realized that many people are just incompetent. They hate customers because customers expect them to be helpful, but the staff themselves often aren't even good at their jobs.

All of this got me wondering the TLDR at the top of this post.",2024-03-28 15:00:50

The employer is from Tech field so he does have somewhat knowledge about frameworks.   
He asked me to choose a frontend framework for which he can easily find someone to maintain so I chose React. I have worked with React before but my most recent experience was with Vue.js and haven't worked with React in 2 years.   


Currently, I am just working on the backend with Django but soon I need to start developing the frontend application. The way with frontend will be that I won't have any wireframes or designs to go by, I would have to go by word of mouth and try to implement it.   


My React is a bit rusty RN, but I can easily brush up on that.    


My main question was that what UI framework should i use with React ? Material UI is among the most used frameworks and I have seen that it has well detailed documentation compared to other frameworks. But i have seen that Material UI requires Typescript and I have not worked with TypeScript before.   


Keep in mind that the UI framework I am used to is Bootstrap-Vue that I used with Vue 2 for more than 1.5 years on my last job.  


I can invest the time to learn TypeScript for this project, but I just wanted to know that would Material UI be the right framework for this project ? The designs would mostly be based on admin side as well as retail with customer side supposedly added later.

I have one 49” QHD 120hz monitor that I solely use for sim-racing. 

Im lucky enough to have both windows pc and job supplied MacBook Pro which I’ve been using to code on. 

At the moment I’ve been using my iPad as a second monitor next to my Mac pro so obvious in need of a good set up to work efficiently and professionally. 

My options are 

- 3 x 27” QHD high refresh rate monitors, one landscape in the middle and the other two in portrait on either side. (My set up at work to keep the flow of work similar in both aspects)

- 2x 32” 4k 60hz monitors. (Low Refresh rate will be noticeable, but will the resolution outweigh the negatives)

- Lastly use the 49” I currently have but that renders my sim racing useless as I won’t have a screen for it. 

Any other suggestions.

1b6j0im,Looking for a decent chat API,"TLDR: Looking for an unopinionated chat API featuring excellent documentation, JavaScript SDKs for both client and server, offers unlimited message retention and scales well price-wise, starting at only a couple of hundred users.

I've made similar posts in the past but I've yet to find a chat API that doesn't come with massive drawbacks.

These include but aren't limited to:

Hight costs for a minimum of thousands of MAU. I'm not paying a minimum of 5k a year even though we haven't reached anywhere near this number of users (looking at you TalkJS, with a minimum of 10k MAU).

An API that is far too opinionated. A lot of the APIs I've found seem to have been in-house solutions at one point and someone had the idea to make a product out of it. That's all fine but now developers are stuck with design decisions that clearly worked for someone at some point but won't work for everyone.

Example: If a user blocks another user I still want to retrieve the 1-1 chat with that user when getting the list of all chats. The fact that the API decides that this is not important is very annoying to me.

APIs that lack basic features. One example being user blocking. I want a simple method where one user can block another. Then I either want this information to be part of every message, so I can implement a cloud function that simply prevents it from being delivered, or even better, the API should do this for me (some opinions are OK).

Limited message retention is another annoyance. Some providers will not store messages longer than 6-12 months with no clear strategy how to archive them. I'm not explaining to my users that their messages will only exist temporarily.

So far I've tried GetStream.io and ChatKitty.com. And while both work, they have proven to be far too opinionated for me and also lack basic features.

I'm at a point where I'm really considering just implementing everything myself and I hate the idea of it. If I wanted to implement a chat from the ground up I would make that my business.",2024-03-04 18:58:56

1bqm674,Thoughts on using Supabase with Wordpress?,"Crossposted because this community is bigger,

So the scenario I have right now is quite unique, there is an existing wordpress site that handles, membership, user auth, etc basically everything and a new Next JS app that relies on supabase for authentication, this app will be embedded into a member's only area of the Wordpress site and should not be able to be visited externally or outside of the website. The scenario I have now is a de-sync in how Wordpress and Supabase are authenticating users differently. When a new user joins, a new user is similarly made on Supabase but with a different password etc

I currently have a hacky idea of just sending the username/password for the supabase login directly to the app to login the attached user, **I already know the security risks and implications for this** but I'm not sure how else to handle it if I don't want users to need to remember/store 2 different sets of passwords... On the bright side this is likely to get less abuse as the entire platform is paid membership only and both passwords will be different, I was even thinking of just setting temporary passwords for every login to be used just for supabase hahaha

I would appreciate any thoughts on how to safely implement this as an alternative to my hacky solution if there's any others who have had to deal with this scenario. Migrating off wordpress right now is not on the cards, in the future though ideally all auth is done on Supabase  


  
EDIT: Thought I'd revisit this project after suggestions here and thinking over it on the weekend, I think we will just have it run as a separate platform entirely and set temp system passwords for them which they can change later. I think this would probably be as good as it gets for now hahaha",2024-03-29 10:43:12

I am able to do a GET request that gives me the JSON output I want in the console of Postman. However, I wanted to save that output to a file, so I needed Postman API to retrieve Monitor requests. So I did this code: 

    import requests
    import json
    from datetime import datetime
    
    # Your Postman API Key
    POSTMAN_API_KEY = 'PMAK-65f21694<censored the rest because its api key>'
    
    # The ID of your Postman Monitor
    MONITOR_ID = '1eee17b2-b0c7-4dd0-be46-a360a7845eaf'
    
    def fetch_monitor_results(api_key, monitor_id):
        """"""Fetch the latest results of a Postman monitor run.""""""
        url = f""https://api.getpostman.com/monitors/{monitor_id}/results""
        headers = {
            ""X-Api-Key"": api_key
        }
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()
        else:
            print(f""Failed to fetch monitor results. Status Code: {response.status_code}"")
            return None
    
    def save_results_to_file(results):
        """"""Saves the fetched results to a JSON file.""""""
        file_name = f""postman_monitor_results_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')}.json""
        with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(results, f, indent=4)
        print(f""Results saved to {file_name}."")
    
    # Main function to fetch and save monitor results
    def main():
        results = fetch_monitor_results(POSTMAN_API_KEY, MONITOR_ID)
        if results:
            save_results_to_file(results)
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
        main()
    

I have a Monitor for the GET request I want, I triple checked the API key and the Monitor ID. However, I keep getting a 404 error. Also when I take the URL ( [https://api.getpostman.com/monitors/1eee17b2-b0c7-4dd0-be46-a360a7845eaf/results](https://api.getpostman.com/monitors/1eee17b2-b0c7-4dd0-be46-a360a7845eaf/results) ) and put it into the Browser itself, I get this ' {""error"":{""name"":""notFound"",""message"":""Requested resource not found""}} '. So I believe it's something to do with the Postman API.

Then when he goes to basket I can loop all products with ID Guest1?

So it will show the products he has put in his basket? This will work?

&#x200B;

Then next stage is going to checkout. He then adds his address and card details. Where do I add this in the database. Would this be create a new data in different database Details but same user

eg.

Guest1, 10 main road, manchester, UK, £3.99(delivery option), 7272722727272(bank card number etc).

Then on final order confirmation page I can repost all this info?

Loop an array all products for UniqueId= Guest1 from database Users showing what he has bought.

Post all his details of address and bank card from database Details showing all info for Guest1.

# Golang vs Django - Which one to serve my frontend for faster development?

I would like to stick with golang to develop my api.

I was thinking to use golang to ~~develop~~ **serve** the frontend too. But it seems time consuming.  
So I decided to go with angular/nodejs and learnt the concepts. I really liked angular over reactjs.

But I decided not to use javascript based frontend development.  
So, I searched for other options.

I was thinking to use PHP. But Django seems to be better in terms of development speed. Learning curve is also not that much time consuming.

Should I really use a javascript based frontend? - I really don't want to .. If there is a strong reason, I will give a try.

1bsq1d6,"Is it my imagination, or are there two distinct types of backend frameworks?","I've noticed in my experience of using different web frameworks that there seem to be two distinct kinds of backend frameworks. I'll call them _top-down_ and _bottom-up_.

A _top-down_ framework is one that comes with a basic folder structure and some example routes/controllers/views. A project is typically created from the command line or through an IDE like Visual Studio, and a bunch of folders and files are created. There is normally an example route and view, and maybe a controller, and an ORM is generally baked in. 

Examples of top-down frameworks include:
- Ruby on Rails
- Laravel
- Symfony
- CakePHP
- ASP.NET MVC
- [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)
- Spring Boot (though no example route)

These frameworks I would describe as 'top-down lite' as they provide a basic structure which the dev has to then build upon:
- Django
- NestJS (no ORM included)

On the other hand a _bottom-up_ framework provides none of this. It is typically a library that you install to a project and set up. You can run a basic server in a single file, which you need to create manually. Express is probably the best example of this:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port 3000`);
});
```

Bottom-up frameworks have no required file or folder structure. They do not come with an ORM - you need to set one up yourself, and sometimes there is more than one option (Node has TypeORM and Primsa, for example).

Examples of bottom-up frameworks include:
- Express
- Koa
- Fastify
- Flask
- FastAPI
- [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/)
- [Actix](https://actix.rs/)
- [Rocket](https://rocket.rs)
- Hapi

What do you think? Is my assessment right? And if so, why do many of the more modern frameworks seem to be moving to the bottom-up approach?",2024-04-01 00:41:26

1bs6mjl,Help with website gig pricing (I'm a student),"Hi,

for context I'm a CS student who does webdev as a hobby, and I've taken on a project from a client that involves creating a website with intricate animations. I have to develop a website (only coding, a graphic studio provides the graphics) for a client of mine, that requested a 4 ""unique"" (see below why the "") page website  that needs to be built from scratch (old HTML, CSS and JS) because of its complex animation, speed requirements and overall quality. It's the classic marketing agency website, like the ones you see on Awwwards but slightly less intricate.

For privacy reasons, I can't provide graphics, but I can outline the requirements:

* Homepage: it includes a scroll animation like the one [here](https://formoitalia.com/about), transitioning to normal scroll when the side paragraph appears. GSAP is the only way. The homepage also includes other animations, difficult to describe here, but that are not as difficult to implement.
* About page: includes text, images and also boxes with slide up text animation on hover. GSAP is the only way (trust me I've seen the storyboard).
* Project Page: each project page will feature text at the top and a mosaic grid of images below, with varying layouts and styling. For example, one page might have a 2-column section followed by a full-screen section and then a 3-column section, while another might have a different arrangement.
* Contact us page with form in PHP. Graphic reference pending.
* Ofc it needs to be responsive and include basic basic basic SEO

I'm in Europe (Italy precisely) and I wanted to ask around 2k. What do you think? Is it too low/high?  
If you need more context I'll try to provide it to you. 

Thank is advance, 

Have a great day!",2024-03-31 09:47:05
1bs6l5t,Do CRSF still steal the session key from Cookies?,"I am currently receiving a CSRF non-configured error with Django when deploying my website so I am currently reading about CSRF.

However, from observation with Google Chrome by using the developer tools (F12) and inspecting the Cookies,  I can see that their are no session tokens inside of them. They seem to be within the ""Session storage"" database slightly above. Alongside this, it does not present them all, it seems to be only presenting them when you're on that webpage (I assume this is for visual clarity?).   


So it got me thinking, are the videos these outdated or is Session storage new and has this new implementation resolved CSRF by only allowing it when on the webpage?",2024-03-31 09:44:23

1brl1yo,[Showoff Saturday] Aegis Parsers,"# Introducing [`@aegisjsproject/parsers`](https://github.com/AegisJSProject/parsers)

> A collection of secure & minimal parsers for HTML, CSs, SVG, MathML, XML, and JSON

## Brief Overview
- **Secure by Design**: Built-in sanitization to protect against XSS and more
- **Simple and Familiar Syntax**: Uses tagged template literals, so you basically just write out what you want as a string
- **Tiny Footprint**:  Weighs in at only about 8Kb (minified, gzipped)
- **Reusable Components/Styles/Modules**: Create components, styles, and/or icons and just `import`/`export` them like anything else
- **Compose with Functions**: Dynamically build components using data for flexibility
- **Customizable**: Create your own HTML/CSS parsers with your own config 
- **Framework Agnostic**: Usable anywhere that has DOM (theoretically including SSR, with proper DOM implementation)
-  **CDN Support**: You can `npm install` if you want, or you can `import` it from a CDN like unpkg 

## Example 

```
import { html, css, svg } from '@aegisjsproject/parsers';

const btnStyles = css`.btn {
  background-color: #8cb4ff;
  color: #fafafa;
  border-radius: 6px;
}`;

const closeIcon = svg`<svg width=""12"" height=""16"" viewBox=""0 0 12 16"" fill=""currentColor"">
  <path fill-rule=""evenodd"" d=""M7.48 8l3.75 3.75-1.48 1.48L6 9.48l-3.75 3.75-1.48-1.48L4.52 8 .77 4.25l1.48-1.48L6 6.52l3.75-3.75 1.48 1.48L7.48 8z""/>
</svg>`;

const closeBtn = html`<button class=""btn"" popovertarget=""popover"">${closeIcon}</button>`;

// Export the things
export { btnStyles, closeIcon, closeBtn };

// Or use them
document.adoptedstyles = [btnStyles];
document.querySelector('#popover').prepend(closeBtn);
```

1brk1po,[Showoff Saturday] feedback on website content for frontend developers?,"I've been working on something to make the lives of front-end devs easier, and I'd love any input on my landing page so far. It’s a Platform Engineering-as-a-Service (PEaaS) that simplifies ops for frontend devs so they can focus on the product.

Here’s where you can find more info and provide your insights if you got a moment to spare: [labs.stack.io](https://labs.stack.io/)

I'm not here to sell—just looking for genuine thoughts from the community that knows best about working with front-end frameworks. I'd appreciate any thoughts on our approach to automated workflows, Golden Paths, and everything in between. Anyone thinks something like this could be helpful? Stemmed from the vercel talk happened in this subreddit a few months ago!

1bra70s,Suggestions for a small camera for live streaming to my server,"I'm in an interesting position where I would really like to have a camera on my person that would connect to my server and live stream at the touch of a button.

!!! This is NOT for anything sexual or illegal !!!

I don't need for it to be discrete or anything, but it does need to be something that I can either wear (preferred) or easily carry with me when I leave the house. A phone app isn't really practical, though; by time I get the phone out of my pocket, enter the pin, and then open the app, the need would be over.

And in an ideal world, this would connect to my server in some way (not social media).

Any thoughts or suggestions?",2024-03-30 05:31:27

But I want to allow people to do it without a user/login, but still limit the amount of times they can use it per day, because I’m paying for the API and don’t want to get hit with ridiculous fees. Something like how some sites allow you to view so many pages per day before you have to login to a paid account. I’ve been doing mobile development mainly lately and you can use the device is to track them pretty well, because changing that requires a reinstall and it’s a hassle for them. But on the web, I’m not sure what to use to “throttle” them. Obviously IP address can’t be used because companies where the people work would share the external ip address. Cookies seem too easy to circumvent. Would something like a JWT Token be a good solution? In case it matters, I’m using asp.net core and Vue js.

If someone like me can keep going you surely can - I like to remind myself:

It's vital to remember that progress isn't always obvious.

Even small victories, like refining your resume or getting positive feedback on an interview, count.

It's about celebrating those wins, no matter how small, and reminding yourself that each step forward, no matter how tiny, is still progress. And hey, don't forget to give yourself a break too.

1bq01mw,Is it realistic to have one person program middleware between Shopify and an old ERP system?," Hey! I need some input from you regarding a client. I'm developing a Shopify store with a theme and setting everything up (ultimately, thousands of products will be added). The plan was to connect the client's ERP system through a plugin/middleware. However, the system is so old that there are few middleware options available for it. The client mentioned that they have a technician who is familiar with Shopify interfaces and who will create one.

Now, I'm supposed to build the store without the integration, and the interface will be developed afterwards. This seems a bit backwards to me, as ideally, I would like to have the products, attributes, and categories beforehand to develop the shop sensibly. Especially considering that in the future, they are supposed to be automated from the ERP system.

I'm also not entirely sure if the client can assess the situation correctly. So, my question to you: How realistic is it for one person to build such middleware and implement all features like product synchronization, orders, payments, shipping, automation, etc., alone? Essentially, it needs to be something like this: [https://www.appseconnect.com/microsoft-dynamics-nav-shopify-integration/](https://www.appseconnect.com/microsoft-dynamics-nav-shopify-integration/)

* GoDaddy creates this Subdomain but then tell me that I need to update the IP Address of the Subdomain through Cloudflare
* This person I am helping does not have a Cloudflare account so Im very confused what the relationship is between GoDaddy and Cloudflare is.
* I create an account and now its ""Pending Verification "" and says the following: ""**Registrars take up  to 24 hours to process nameserver changes (quicker in most cases). We will email you when  is active on Cloudflare.""**...It has been 72 hours  ) :  


Typically I reach out to the domain/host they create a subdomain for me then I start installing and building WordPress sites. I don't understand why GoDaddy doesn't allow me to simply update all the settings in GoDaddy. This Cloudflare thing is a wildcard and I don't know what to do.

I am a designer and only take on development projects that are simple one-pagers but this Cloudflare thing is so confusing to me, what can I do at this point to just start this project?

type - A   
host -   
temp value - 107.180.41.169

1bo9tt5,React + PDF Editing Workflows?,"We've got a client that is interested in document management. The gist of it - they've got some lightweight template PDFs which have editable fields in them. We'd like to enable them to:

* Upload static templates (easy)
* Download copies of the templates to a user's machine (easy)
* *Edit the PDF in-browser* (hard or maybe impossible)
* Then upload the completed PDF (easy)

Note that we're using React. It's that Part (3) that I'm worried about. I've come across a few decent libraries for viewing static PDFs, but no editing capabilities ([https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-pdf/](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-pdf/)) and some for creating PDFs, but again no editing capabilities ([https://pdf-lib.js.org/](https://pdf-lib.js.org/)). 

Supporting Part (1) is pretty critical to the user experience, so that the client can use their existing PDFs they already have lying around, no need to ""recreate"" all of them. Additionally, while it would be much, much simpler to say they could just edit the PDF on their desktop in a standard PDF editor like Acrobat or Preview, and upload it statically, that's not an option - the majority of users will be on their phones.

However, because of the concerns on Part (3), I worry we might have to forgo Part (1) and instead have the user build a virtualized model of their PDF template in-browser, and we store the document structure as a JSON blob somewhere. For Part (2), we just render that JSON payload as a dynamic component with dynamic controls for editing in Part (3), then use one of the libraries to export the final component as a completed PDF for Part (4).

Has anyone tackled a fully in-browser React project like this before? I guess to put it bluntly, this is basically DocuSign, but dumbed down a bit.",2024-03-26 14:52:25
1bo8z7m,Tasked with building an entire new Front-end. The back-end currently lives in Laravel. What's the best approach?,"I'm tasked with **starting from scratch**, building an entire new web app **on top of an already existing Laravel back-end**. This back-end shipped version 0.1, but we are in dire need of a complete rework (new specs, new design language, PWA, the works....).

The back-end developers lack real front-end affinity (no judgment, we got to where where we are thanks to their 0.1 version of the project). However, we want to approach this project with a **front-end-first attitude**.

How would I best go about building this? Some ideas that spook around in my head:

&#x200B;

* A **fully-fletched SPA**, consuming the Laravel REST API
* A something in between, building it with something like Astro, where I have the freedom to start SSR, and **hydrate when needed**. Plus, I can cherry-pick my islands' architecture. Also, consuming the Laravel API.
* Go the Laravel way and basically build a **MPA, fully SSR, with Laravel** in PHP and Blade.
* Use Laravel and Splade to build a **Laravel-based SPA**, but still leveraging Laravel.
* I could also try and 'bypass' the Laravel REST API and connect to the DB directly, creating my own REST API, basically opting for a **mono repo**. This will make our project fully independent from the already existing Laravel project.

Just to give you some ""requirements"" of the web app:

* It needs to deal with offline data synchronisation
* Fully responsive (mobile to widescreen)
* Adapt a Tailwind-based design language
* Showcase real-time data

I am building and deploying a portfolio website for myself in Nuxt on Cloudflare. On my website, I want to add routes for the documentation of libraries I have created. E.g. `https:// my-portfolio.com / docs / mylibrary` and this should show the docs of my library. The issue is I have different places where the docs are located:

```
|- Documents/
|  |- lib1
|  |  |- docs/
|  |  |  |- index.html
|  |- lib2
|  |  |- docs/
|  |  |  |- index.html
|  |- my-portfolio/
|  |  |- app.vue
|  |  |- deploy.sh
```

If I compile `lib1`, I want to upload the docs folder to the server where `my-portfolio` can read from and display the HTML pages. However, how do I upload the docs to this server and how does my portfolio get the page from it? Basically, how do I approach this problem?

1bjl59u,Past-date PHP developer with an ASAP Flutter personal project. Most efficient path?,"**TL;DR:** Stuck in the late 2000s PHP stack, want to use a personal productivity project as a Flutter learning opportunity. I have very little time. Fastest way to get started?

Hey devs,

I’m an old school back-end PHP dev who’s been out of it professionally since 2009, but continue using it for fun and personal projects. I’m good at PHP, MySQL, Vanilla JS, and basic web design, but I’m stuck in the past when it comes to modern (or not so modern) tools like composer, npm, or even git.

I have a personal need, and [no existing app seems to cover it](https://old.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1bgbkg1/all_in_one_timed_routine_habit_tracking_android/). My go-to would be to create it with my familiar stack, but I want to make it a learning opportunity. I researched and chose Flutter because I want it to be cross platform, with a consistent UI, and because I am a Google fan! 😁

**Project requirements:**
- Timed routines: Create multiple routines, with timed steps, and a countdown with alerts to move to the next step.
- Habit Tracker: Basic CRUD functionality, mostly Booleans.
- Modular enough to add features later.
- Cross-Platform: At least accessible from the web and Android app.
- It’s just for me, I’m not planning to distribute it or anything.

I found very good classes for this on Udemy, but the problem is I have a 60h/week job, a toddler, a pregnant wife, and very, very little time to spend on this.

Given these constraints, what is *the most efficient* path to get me building? I don’t need the app to be perfect, it’s just for me, and I’ll iterate on it, or redo it from scratch, as I become more proficient with time. I’m ADHD, so this is a very dangerous thing I’m doing, I really need a focused path so I can keep my priorities straight! 🥲

I’m open, if it’s doable, to use hybrid technologies and convert them as I learn. The goal is to have a working solution fast, and learn over time. For example:

- Step 1: “Flutter stack” front end, PHP/MySQL back end
- Step 2: Convert back-end to the appropriate “Flutter stack”
- Step 3: Convert the DB to the appropriate “Flutter stack”
- Step 4: Decide it’s shit, scrap everything and restart from scratch.

I use the term “Flutter stack” meaning the appropriate technology to use with Flutter, as I don’t know which ones they are yet (Dart, Firebase, etc.). 😊

Thank you all for your help,

1bjc8fk,How do I get the PhotoSwipe demo to work?,"I'm getting back into coding, and I can't seem to get PhotoSwipe to work. I've been working on it for 3 days.

*Background:* I have an [older version of PhotoSwipe working on my site](https://photo.2re.net/) but I am learning Vue and the old version uses jQuery and jQuery conflicts with Vue.

All I want to do at this point is to use the code on the [Getting Started](https://photoswipe.com/getting-started/) page to work so I can figure it out from there.

It says you need the Core, Ligthbox, and the CSS.

I linked the css in the head like it says so I don't think that's the issue. My guess is that I'm putting the JavaScript in the wrong place but I'm not sure.

I've tried putting the JS code in a script tag before the HTML code, after it, making a separate JS file and linking to it in the head, linking to `photoswipe-lightbox.esm.js` and `photoswipe/photoswipe.esm.js` in the head, but nothing seems to work. I thought maybe the there was some kind of configuration on my computer not allowing me to execute JavaScript locally or something, so I uploaded my different versions to a web server and it still didn't work.

Help! What's going on?

Here's the code from the site:

**JavaScript:**

 `// Include Lightbox`   
`import PhotoSwipeLightbox from '/photoswipe/photoswipe-lightbox.esm.js';`  
`const lightbox = new PhotoSwipeLightbox({`  
 `// may select multiple ""galleries""`  
 `gallery: '#gallery--getting-started',`  
 `// Elements within gallery (slides)`  
 `children: 'a',`  
 `// setup PhotoSwipe Core dynamic import`

I'm also starting to think it could be getting bloated? The ""Bored"" section may be too much? I put it there to showcase different technologies I've been playing with. But perhaps it's just too much.

1binptv,Costing a project,"So someone I’ve been working with for years has an online blog where they publish recipes for a very niche cuisine. They’ve been very successful (sort of like tasty for this cuisine).

They also post videos and have been able to monetise it with a few other things. 

They want a mobile app and a web app where they will post their content. They basically want me to build it but they don’t want to pay upfront. Instead they want to come to an arrangement where we sign a contract and I get a percentage of sales, but there is a cap on the upper limit. 

Revenue will be a combination of ads, subscriptions and online courses. 

I’m already aware of the total work involved. 

These are broken down below:

1. Admin app (manage recipes including calories, users, metadata, data analysis etc)
2. Web app
3. Mobile app
4. API Backend to service the above 3 apps

FWIW, the mobile app and web app will have the same functionality and I’m thinking of using React & React Native (with TS) so that I can share a lot of the code.

I will also be responsible for handling the backend (CI/CD, AWS etc). 

What I want to know is how would I get a realistic cost for building this project as well as ongoing maintenance cost including new functionality? I need this figure to work out the percentages as will as the limits? I’m happy to just get some realistic time estimates as I could work out cost based on times. 

We can assume that the functionality for the consumer facing apps are authentication, view, search, share, save recipes, watch live cook alongs, create shopping lists, convert ingredient quantities from metric to imperial and vice versa.

Previously, the site was managed by someone on the marketing team (they are no longer with the company), and it looks like they utilized a lot of WP plugins and Divi Builder to design the site and add functionality to it. However, the site has horrible UX and poor accessibility. 

My tech stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, Tailwind and React, and I normally build web pages from scratch or update pages using code. With that said, I get frustrated when dealing with our company's WordPress site because it's so dependent on plugins (some of which have been deprecated, or the subscription has expired) and Divi Builder feels very restrictive to me.

I'd like to find a balance between the ""user-friendliness"" of WordPress, so my coworkers can easily update content when needed, and unrestricted customization.

I don't really need the money and I don't want to cheapen it with excess garbage ads, but at the same time I feel like not monetizing it a little is flushing free money down the toilet.

The site itself is a Single Page Application (SPA) that is essentially just a table of data that updates periodically, so I'd really like to just put a single unobtrusive ad into one of the rows on the table, blending it as much as possible with a small indicator that it's an ad.

1belcm5,Looking for a library that lets you select an area of a map,"Hey all, direct me elsewhere is the wrong subreddit. I had an idea for a project where you'd have addresses in a database with geolocation. and then a user can cut out a map by drawing corners and creating a polygon, which would then be able to generate a list of the addresses in that section. Then the user on a different application or screen would have a map with each address being clickable. 

So I need two maps, the harder one being a map that let's me cutout a polygon and check a database against that area to see if the addresses are in that polygon, to then provision a list. 

I've never done anything that large but I want to try my hand at it, and the hardest part so far is finding a tool that will let me have a map that can be used to cut out an area, and use the data returned to filter my address database.

We haven't seen any decent paths to move these into Drupal 10 (which is replacing the old site), so we're looking for other tools and I thought I'd come here for some recommendations.

* Some of the requirements:
* user login - LDAP would be preferrable
* linking to specific definitions. ie, each definition could have a distinct url
* printing a ""book"" of definitions as a PDF (with printer friendly templates)
* nesting for denoting parent/chile relationships in definitions.
* Definitions use markup and some have raw encoded images. I think any rich text editor should be able to handle these.
* A bonus would be any system that can load previous versions of the definition so we can show diffs for how they've changed over time.

We are running dockerized servers, so it's easy enough to drop anything into our environment. Right now the definitions are in a database, but they export easily enough to a CSV with fields noting the parent/chile relationship.

If anyone has any suggestions on tools out there that exist, you'll be saving me a TON of time! I'm guessing this wheel has been recreated a million times already, and each instance probably brings some special flair.",2024-03-12 14:49:12

1b8cnt3,Alternatives do webpack for module federation,"TL;DR are there solid alternatives do webpack when using module federation for microfrontend rendering with react?  


My company uses microfrontend architecture to render different sections of its platforms. Currently we have around 40 microfrontends, each with its separate project and pipeline. Even though the projects are relatively uncoupled, they all depend on webpack module federation plugin in order for the microfrontend rendering to work. The problem is that we are having long-time problems with webpack. Our bundling time for the pipeline and the dev-server bootstrap are both taking around 2 minutes. This leads to a terrible developer experience, because many times we have to shutdown and restart the dev-server when running manny local servers at the same time.   


I want to get rid of webpack and try a faster bundler, such as vite. But unfortunately I found that the vite plugin for module federation is deeply bugged and cannot be used with safety on high-stakes projects. I have a previous post about this on this subreddit, if you want to checkout [https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17v6kuy/comment/kr9lins/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17v6kuy/comment/kr9lins/?context=3)

Looking for recommendations.

Our school adopted a CRM about a year ago and, now that our contract with our consultant is over, several of us super users need advanced training in HTML5/CSS. Of those tasked with designing, I’ve taken on most of the responsibility since I have mid-level UX design experience. However, there is still more that I need to learn.

I’ve taken asynchronous certifications and completed coding coursework, but our team needs more project-based learning than vocabulary and plug and chug testing. 

We all need to be proficient in the following related to HTML5/CSS/JS:
- Understanding of WCAG and how to comply.
- Basic understanding of CSS syntax, selectors, and frameworks selectors.
- Proficient in writing clean, semantic HTML5 and CSS code with using in-code comments for documentation.
- Advanced knowledge of CSS, including Flexbox and Grid layout.
- Experience with responsive design techniques and media queries.
- Ability to optimize website performance through CSS techniques.
- Proficient in using developer tools for debugging and optimization.
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and its interaction with HTML and CSS.
- Experience with cross-browser testing and debugging.
- Strong problem-solving skills and ability to debug complex front-end issues efficiently.
- Since the CRM also uses liquid mark up (created by Shopify), basic SQL would be beneficial as well.

We do have a little bit of a budget to train three super users, but we do work in higher education so it’s not a lot. While a reputable certification or micro credential would be nice, it’s not necessary. Just really looking for a program that requires participants to learn and isn’t simply based on see and repeat.

1b4y44a,Inside Chrome Browser - Part 1,"Recently, I started reading about browser architecture. So, let's discuss that. But, before diving into the browser, we should talk about the CPU and GPU, as they are at the core of the computer.

**What's a CPU?**It's considered a computer's brain. A CPU core (can be pictured as an office worker) can handle many different tasks one by one as they come in. In the past, most CPUs were a single chip, but in modern hardware, CPUs have many cores (a core is like another CPU living in the same chip), giving more computing power to your phones and laptops.

**GPU** is another part of the computer. They are good at handling simple tasks but across multiple cores at the same time. It was developed to handle graphics, that's why ""using GPU"" or ""GPU-backed"" is associated with fast rendering and smooth interaction. Today, with GPU-accelerated computing, more and more computation is becoming possible on GPU alone.

Applications run on the CPU and GPU using mechanisms provided by the Operating System, so when you start an application (can be on a computer or phone), they are the ones powering the application.

**We should also discuss the Process and Thread.**With each start of an application, a new process is created (it can be described as an application's executing program). Each process has its slab of private memory space to work with, and all application state is kept in that.A process might have a thread(s) to help it do work (so a thread is something that lives inside of the process and executes any part of its process's program), but that's optional.

*More on Process*A process can ask the OS to start another process to run different tasks (the new process will have different parts of the memory), and both processes can talk with each other using Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

But why applications are designed to work this way? It's because if a worker process gets unresponsive, it can be restarted without stopping other processes that are running different parts of the application.

**Processes and threads in a web browser**Different browser architectures are implementation details, a browser can have one process with many different threads or many different processes with a few threads communicating over IPC.

In a Chrome browser, at the top is the browser process which coordinates with other processes that take care of different parts of the application. Then, there is a renderer process that gets assigned to each tab. Recently, chrome also started giving each site its process, which means if in a website two iframes are embedding two different sites, they will have two different processes.

*Multi-process architecture benefits*What is the benefit of assigning each tab a new process? Let's say you have 3 tabs open, and one of the tabs becomes unresponsive then you can close that unresponsive tab and move on, this will not affect other tabs. But, if you were running all the tabs on one process, then it would have made other tabs unresponsive as well.

*Multi-process architecture issues*As each process has its private memory space, they often contain copies of common infrastructure (same js engine for each tab), which means more memory usage as they are not threads they can't share the memory. That's why the browser puts a limit on the number of processes, and when you hit that limit it starts running multiple tabs from the same site in one process.

Chrome is also doing architecture changes to run each part of the browser program as a service, so if you are on powerful hardware it may split each service into different processes giving more stability, and on a resource-constraint device it will consolidate services into one process saving memory footprint (same approach that has been used on a platform like Android before this change).

*If you want to see the processes running in your browser, click on the menu icon (three vertical dots) at the top right corner --> More Tools --> Task Manager. This opens up a window with a list of processes that are currently running and how much CPU/Memory they are using.*

What I mean is, is there a better way where you get a clear view of what's happening when you change different values, etc?  


Do you build the frontend first - and then tackle to backend? I've kind of work all over, doing a little bit here and doing a little bit there.. and I'm not sure if I'm ""supposed"" to do it another way - which would be waaay better.

I have a question regarding “dark mode” colors and how to properly use them. I purchased a professional logo on Fiverr and it came with a branding guide. The logo in question is best overlayed on a dark blue background (#070C18). However this complicates things in my brain because I have a hard time choosing text colors when it comes to darker background colors. 

The branding guide says to make my text just white (#FFFFFF) but it looks very bright on the dark blue background. Would the safest bet be to use a really light shade of blue? 

Following up on text colors. I’m also curious how to make buttons and call to actions look natural on dark backgrounds. The branding guide included two colors that could work as CTA colors, Light Blue (#3C82F6) and a Neon / Bright Purple (#6633F6). These colors do look great but I feel like I’m running into the same issue with the white text, they can be very bright some times. 

I don’t plan on being constrained to just these colors provided by the branding guide, but I would please like some advice on how to better utilize these colors.

Thank you.

1bcctyi,Simple trick to merge/override Tailwind classes...,"When building React components with Tailwind, often you might start out like this...

    const Comp = () => (
     <div className=""p-20"">
       <p>Kitten</p>
     </div>
    );

...but then realize you want to be able to override the `p-20` class when rendering the component.

You can't just add it to the end because that's not how CSS's selector specificity works.

There are tools like [tailwind-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge) that can solve this, but processing strings is still not ideal from a performance/efficiency standpoint.

But there's a super easy, no-library solution to this:

Simply specify your Tailwind/utility class names as an object (`{p: 20}` instead of `""p-20""`) and make your component accept another style object to override:

    const Comp: React.FC<{ classes?: Record<string, unknown> }> = ({ classes }) => (
     <div className={useObjToClass({ p: 20, ...classes })}>
       <p>Kitten</p>
     </div>
    );
    
    export const useObjToClass = (object: Record<string, unknown>) => {
      return useMemo(() => {
        let className = '';
        for (const key in object) {
          className += `${key}${object?.[key] ? `-${object?.[key]}` : ''} `;
        }
        return className?.trim();
      }, [object]);
    };

By spreading the object properties, you'll auto-override/merge the Tailwind classes.

Then you need a function (or `useObjToClass` React hook in this case) to convert the object into a className string.

So you can now do...

    <Comp classes={{ p: 40 }} />

...to override the default padding.

What do you think?

***Important Update:*** People seem to have misunderstood the original point behind this idea.

The `useObjToClass` above simply converts the object into a className string.

Merging/overriding colliding utility classes is done via spreading the object keys out and letting JavaScript automatically have the last-most key override previous ones.

Example:

    const prop = { p: 40 };
    useObjToClass({ p: 20, ...prop }) // outputs 'p-40'
    // Any 'p' key in 'prop' will override the default { p: 20 }, resulting in { p: 40 }

The viewer works as expected in the following cases:

* On Chrome
* On Firefox when the bucket contains ""folder"" (yes, I know they aren't really folders) hierarchy of the tile images (ie, not using the plugins, just using the `.dzi` files that work with the unmodified version of OSD)
* On Firefox when the `.zip` file is local on the server.

However, when I try to load the `.zip` file from a bucket, the image tiles will not load.

Firefox complains about a failed preflight request and then refuses to request the `.zip` file (although I can download it from Firefox by pasting the URL). I am not 100% sure that the failed preflight request is the cause of the never-sent GET request for the `.zip`, but that is my working assumption

Things I have tried:

 * Set the the necessary headers on both the Cloudflare bucket and Nginx.

* Tried using a different S3 provider than Clouflare (DigitalOcean Spaces) and removing my subdomain from Cloudflare. Same result

* Tried adding a header ""transform"" rule to Cloudflare to handle OPTIONS requests on my domain. I'm not sure I did this correctly (if it is even necessary), but this is my rule: `(http.request.method eq ""OPTIONS"")` -> and  use that rule to add `allow-origin` `mydomain`. This did not help with the failed preflight request.



The JS making ther viewer on the page is:

```
    <script>
        var tileSources = {{ urls|safe }};
        var itemID = ""singleSeadragon""

        var osdSettings = {
            id: itemID,
            prefixUrl: ""../static/js/openseadragon/images/"",
            loadTilesWithAjax: true,

I have tried setting `ajaxWithCredentials` to `true` and `crossOriginPolicy` to `use-credentials`, but to no avail.


How can I get more information about why these requests are failing?

1bead1k,Django backend and React frontend - Frontend receives empty response if Django HttpResponse is too large,"Hello everyone. I discovered a bug on my app yesterday that has since been a mystery to solve.

As the title states, I have a Django (python) backend with a React (javascript) frontend. I'm using ajax on the frontend to send POST requests to the backend. Overall, this works fine. However, heres the problem:

My backend uses request.session to store some pandas dataframes. While this works fine as far as I can tell, these dataframes can be quite large. To send it to the frontend to display, I convert it using df.to_dict(orient=""records"") then send that result via HttpResponse like so:

return HttpResponse(json.dumps({
    ""data"": data,
}))

Where data is the to_dict result.

When using the ""Inspect"" option in the browser menu (tried in Edge and Chrome), I can see the response coming in at 86.2MB. The response is too large to view in the inspect menu though, and when trying to print it out on my frontend (or even use JSON.parse on it like I do for all my other messages), it's empty string and causes the JSON.parse to fail.

From what I gather, either Django is silently failing part of the way through sending this response, or my frontend (or browser) is refusing to receive the full response. I will add that this backend call works when the response is smaller than 86.2MB, so it definitely has something to do with the response being too large.

I've tried changing the DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE in my settings.py to no effect.

Does anyone have any idea what could be going on here? Feel free to ask questions as there may be some details I've left out by mistake.",2024-03-14 02:29:15

1bd9s61,Has anyone had experience with signing out a user with Supabase from an express endpoint?," I  am using node and express as a backend for API endpoints with Vite as a  frontend. So far, I have been able to send info from frontend to  backend for signing in and signing up a user. However, I've hit a wall  with signing out.

Supabase does not allow you to specify exactly *which*  user to sign out. They only have a generic auth.signOut() function. So,  how does my backend know which user to sign out from my front end?

I  am setting the returned user session in local storage, for later use  with protected routes. I'm wondering if there's any way I can pass what  is in my local storage variable to the sign out function of supabase to  sign out that specific user. Here is my code so far:

    // Get user from local storage
        const user = getStorage();
        const token = user?.session.access_token;
    
        try {
          // Send to api action log out
          const url = ""http://localhost:4000/api/users/logout"";
          const request = await fetch(url, {
            method: ""POST"",
            mode: ""cors"",

              ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"",
    
              Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
            },
          });
    
          const response = await request.json();
    
          if (response.status !== 200) {
            throw new Error(response.message);
          }
    
          // Remove user from local storage
          removeStorage();
    
          // Redirect to sign in
          navigate(""/sign-in"");
        } catch (error) {
          console.log(error);
        }

Backend:

    // Log out user from app
    const logOutUser = async (req, res) => {
      // Get token from header
      const token = await req.headers.authorization.split("" "")[1];
    
      try {
        const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut(token);

1bcaryw,Need some help with creating a structure for an ASP.NET Core site with dozens of different services/forms.,"I'm working on a site for an org in my company. The org has many orgs under it. The site has a catalog that contains services from any of the sub-orgs. The services are often for requesting support, in form of a form you fill out. Once submitted, the information is sent to ADO. There are about 100 services, so roughly 100 forms. Currently, we are using ASP.NET and the form is just one .ascx file. The information like the title, contacts, who it's from, etc., is retrieved from a database using an ID, which is tied to each service/form. This means every service's form looks the same when it comes to what fields they have to fill out. But the sub-orgs want something more customizable like adding their own fields, drop downs, radio boxes, etc.. Is it recommended to continue implementing this level of customization in the database, or use a new approach like creating a new Razor View/Page for each service/form, and try to use partial views when possible? (I should mention with this new customization, we are moving to ASP.NET Core, thus the mention of Razor).

I have a macOS 2015 13"" running Monterey.

Between 2015 and 2019, whenever I needed to develop a new front-end at work, I used Gulp.js along with autoprefixer, SCSS, and Bower for wiring up front-end dependencies like jQuery and Bootstrap, among others.

You can find the actual boilerplate here: [GitHub - keevvinc/gulp-boilerplate](https://github.com/keevvinc/gulp-boilerplate)

I've tried versions 8, 9, 10, the newest ones, etc., but nothing seems to successfully run `npm install`. Even if it does, I can't run `gulp install`. I'm using nvm to manage npm versions.

Is there anyone willing to clone the repo and try to get it running?

Alternatively, if anyone has recommendations for another workflow (I need SCSS compilation, BrowserSync, autoprefixing, etc.) that is more up-to-date and runs out of the box (I don't need React or AngularJS), I am open to switching. I just need SOMETHING to work with.

I use a tool named TogglTrack to track my time for work, they have a feature where it records your activity, aka it shows all applications you're running/currently have focused on/open - if that makes sense?

It's supposed to show the individual websites I'm browsing - so that later, if I forgot to track my time, I could take a look at what sites I've been browsing and then appropiately assign what activity I was doing.

Here's what it's supposed to look like:

# Research

Here's what I've tried so far:

1. Deleting any extensions that might cause this
2. Clearing cache & cookies
3. Looked for potential google workspace apps, that might interfere, but I don't have any installed
4. Tried to find if maybe a webapp could be causing this, but it doesn't seem like I have any installed either
5. Asked Toggl support, but they didn't know the answer and said it must have something to do with chrome itself
6. Updated chrome to the newest version
7. Logged out, and in again

1ba1078,Small guide to set your favicon into auth0 login pages,"Hi guys, I wanted to share this with y'all and since I didn't find an Auth0 subreddit, I will post my small guide here:

This is how I put my custom favicon to the login, register and whatever pages of auth0; This guide is aimed at all the people who use the new Universal Login without using the custom html theme.

Firstly I uploaded my logo online (I used imgbb)

Then I opened Powershell and installed on my pc Scoop using these commands:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri [https://get.scoop.sh](https://get.scoop.sh) | Invoke-Expression

Then I installed Auth0 CLI (always using Powershell):

scoop bucket add auth0 [https://github.com/auth0/scoop-auth0-cli.git](https://github.com/auth0/scoop-auth0-cli.git)

scoop install auth0

And logged as a user:

auth0 login

Now your browser will open up a page where it will make you insert your credentials, login and wait for your powershell to receive the response

Now all you have to do is just write this command and replace the placeholder with the https of your logo:

auth0 universal-login update --favicon PLACEHOLDER

There you go, it should work now. Hope I made the day easier for someone out there.

I'll link my source down here just in case.

1b98l5n,Backend CMS for a leaflet.js based custom map portfolio,"Hey all,

I had the idea to build a portfolio website (mostly 3d-design, motion design and photography) in form of a custom (not based on the actual earth) web map. I already set up such a map with leaflet.js but for now it is just a basic and foremost static map with custom tiles (in 5 layers) and a few markers and overlays.

The idea would be to have a database of projects with the usual stuff (Images, videos, description text and maybe a date and a few tags). In addition to that every entry would get a set of coordinates and certain images would get a layer number. So when the project is loaded, it will place overlay images on said layers at the specified location.

**Now I am looking for the missing link between a yet to determine CMS (I am looking at Strapi, Wagtail or Payload -- open for suggestions) and leaflet. Is there any possibility to link those?**

&#x200B;

*Just so you know who you're dealing with here:*

*I am a graphics designer (specialized in motion and 3D) and I started with webdesign (meaning graphics for websites) at the end of the last millennium (yes, I'm old). In order to understand how graphics worked on the internetz, our web developer showed me some basics in html. I started to like coding and continued with JavaScript and later \*duckandrun\* ActionScript (3). I even did some Php to connect to databases. I actually considered myself quite proficient in as3. Until Steve Jobes killed Flash ;) After that, mainly because web development became quite complicated, I realized that I am not a developer and went back to my basics graphic design, then motion design and 3D. I still do some html/css/js animations (mostly with gsap) and I frequently use Python inside Cinema4D for scripting. And over the last few years I set up and maintain two wordpress installations. But that is not nearly as much fun as building my own websites and as3-apps in the early 2000s used to be). I also did some experiments with processing and p5.js.*

*And for the last four hours I tried to educate myself about current web development by reading and watching videos about the likes of React, Angular, Vue, Django, some modern CMS' and -- somewhere down the rabbit hole -- the history of programming languages (suddenly remembering that I actually started with Basic on my C64 ;) -- Did I mention that I'm old? )*

&#x200B;

Anyways. Hope, anyone has some keywords to google for or any other hints on how to realize my map portfolio.

Thank you very much in advance, kws

1b8ci9z,Building Wait Lists with a Single Line of Code,"Couple of weeks ago I started a new project and wanted to follow the indie hacker play book for once.

Create a wait list, build in public etc.

I thought there must be solutions to quickly spin up a landing page with a wait list and store subscribers somewhere, but I just did not find anything I like and wasted like 3 hours looking at stuff.

So I built it in the way that makes sense for me.

What I want to do with a new side project or potential business idea is

1. Steal a landing page for example github/cruip/open-react-template
2. Write my copy
3. Add a wait list to gauge interest
4. Throw it onto an easy drag and drop host like vercel

Step 3 was the one I was struggling with. I don't want to set up a backend. I don't wanna set up a database or google doc. I don't want to set up sendgrid or an email sender.

So now I don't need to do that anymore. Now I can just send my one line post request and be done with it.

**What do you think?**

I love extremely focused tools. I tried to make it work without accounts, but I just could not find a way.

Without accounts or claiming domains first, anybody can just ""add subscribers"" to any domain. Even worse, anybody can see everybodys waitlist if they guess the link.

Docker, traefik, watchtower, and a few containers for different sites of course. Everything seems to be going well so far except for my SSL setup. I've never had to do this before. Actually I've never had to set things up and tried to mirror some existing setups I work on (which is why I know about traefik, watchtower, and portainer). I can at least say I'm familiar with docker, though I'm no pro at it, just adequate.

I tried to generate my own SSL certs, but was getting errors with them. They were untrusted. I'm not sure if I needed a CA or if it's because I needed to specifically assign them to a domain name? Not sure how to do that last part anyways. Now I'm trying to use letsencrypt / certbot following these instructions: [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-certbot-standalone-mode-to-retrieve-let-s-encrypt-ssl-certificates-on-ubuntu-20-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-certbot-standalone-mode-to-retrieve-let-s-encrypt-ssl-certificates-on-ubuntu-20-04)

I'm able to produce the certs. I've stopped short of trying to auto renew them, because honestly, I just want to see that they work first!!

Once They're generated, maybe I'm not sure what or how I should be linking to them. The instructions above produce the following:

* cert.pem
* chain.pem
* fullchain.pem
* privkey.pem

Then in traefik, I have my certificates.toml file:

`[tls.stores]`  
  `[tls.stores.default]`  
`[tls.stores.default.defaultCertificate]`  
`certFile = ""/etc/letsencrypt/live/mysite.com/fullchain.pem""`  
`keyFile  = ""/etc/letsencrypt/live/mysite.com/privkey.pem""`

`[[tls.certificates]]`  
  `certFile = ""/etc/letsencrypt/live/mysite.com/fullchain.pem""`  
  `keyFile  = ""/etc/letsencrypt/live/mysite.com/privkey.pem""`

And of course in my docker-compose, I make sure to link to the certs folder

`- /etc/letsencrypt/live/mysite.com:/etc/letsencrypt/live/mysite.com`

Then I rebuild the containers and when I pull up the URL, it's still telling me:

1bt1ngh,Implicit Any - a rarely-touted Typescript tool that will double your productivity,"I want to share my implementation of a Typescript tool that doubled my team's productivity and got me heaps of praise from management this past sprint - **implicit any.**

One of the downsides of using Typescript is it involves large amounts of boilerplate code. Seemingly every time you create a new object you need to spend several minutes describing to the computer every single characteristic of that object, and whenever you create a function, you need to define the details of the inputs and outputs of that function.

This is unnecessary and time-consuming.

Fortunately this week I found a rarely-touted option within Typescript that prevents having to write this wasteful boilerplate - **implicit any.**

By enabling this feature in your TS Config and linting (if you use a linter), you will now be free to allow the computer to dynamically determine the details of the objects you pass around the application. Your engineers will spend less time struggling with pedantic ""type errors"" or spending several minutes wrestling with defining interfaces.

This sprint we shipped nearly twice as many tickets thanks to my change. Management is overjoyed and my boss let me know I should include this discovery in my performance review as it will be a compelling case for promotion. With the CTO retiring this year I'm excited for the possibility of a major career move.

Happy April everyone.",2024-04-01 11:50:42

1btaejg,Cheapest Deployment Option,"I am currently working to deploy a vue.js application with a flask API. The flask API interacts with a Postgres database and it does simple PUTs/POSTs/GETs. The Postgres DB itself would likely never store more then 100k rows total. Currently I've been running this stack locally, but am ramping up to deploy this to a cloud provider. I'd also like to front the vue.js application with a Keycloak instance that will eventually be my common identity broker/provider for a suite of similar applications. My NFRs are really relaxed (run only during business hours, need to fix outages but no SLAs/SLOs or anything like that). 

The application will have fairly minimal traffic (10-20 users) and future apps shouldn't eclipse 1000 users. I'd like to deploy this to the absolute cheapest stack possible. I want this to be cheap from the upfront costs but also from any maintenance requirements if possible. Currently I am thinking of putting my Postgres DB, Flask API, and my common Keycloak instance in Heroku. My vue.js front-end would be hosted in Netlify (this one I am the most unsure of). If any of these apps where to scale up to servicing more users, I'd like to be able to easily move to AWS as I believe it's a better provider past a certain scale. Is there better/cheaper ways to host something like this in it's current state?

I'm not in the US, I am back in my home country and hometown which does not have a tech scene, although I tried to knock on doors in real life to pitch my services. Freelancing websites are out of the question because I've never picked up projects there and I can't borrow money from friends or family because they don't have much at the moment either.

I am not an expert at everything but I have experience in these, most of my projects involved web development and graphic design though. I am incorporated, I have multiple bank accounts, a Paypal, I can send invoices, I can sign contracts, I can sign NDA's, talk on the phone, talk on Zoom, anything to talk to any client in the world, I just want to work as fast as possible.

1bte3h9,A template for building backend web apps in Rust,"I've found that it's pretty difficult to find all the pieces necessary to start writing REST APIs using Rust, so I decided to try to build an effective starting point for anyone looking to use Rust for their backends.

I've just finished a template for a production-ready Rust REST API, which you can pull [from my GitHub](https://github.com/emanguy/rust-rest). Here's what's included out of the box in the template:

* Unit testing for both HTTP routers and business logic
* Integration tests against a real Postgres database
* CI via CircleCI which runs unit and integration tests, lints the code, and verifies formatting
* OpenAPI documentation via Swagger UI
* A configurable logger
* Validation for incoming HTTP request Data Transfer Objects
* Tons of documentation on the coding patterns used in the template

I hope it proves useful to anyone looking to use Rust for its correctness and speed benefits on their web backend! Any feedback is welcome, as are contributions to the template. I hope this doesn't violate Rule 3, as I'd like this to just be a valuable resource to other backend devs. Happy coding!",2024-04-01 20:06:30

1bsxpjz,What are some best practices when changing which endpoint you point to for an API?,"I am currently working on a frontend and backend personal project. I have just migrated my Django backend from running the server using `python` [`manage.py`](https://manage.py) `runserver` to using Docker which creates a container for it on port `1337` using nginx.

My frontend is currently hardcoded to point to my backend an example could be,

    export const getProfile = async () => {
        try {
            const response = await get(""http://localhost:8000/api/v1/profile/"");

In the future, when I eventually deploy this to be on a public server using a domain I will once again need to change this.

1bt242b,Thoughts,"Hello guys, I just wanted your opinion on a potential app which makes it easier to visualise a codebase. The aim is to create a cleaner and easier to understand view of a codebase, to maintain the integrity of its structure through development, as well as have some collaborative tools to allow your team to understand your codebase and its direction and make it easier for new members to see where things are. Ideally, you would also be able to view/read through files and their docs, add notes/comments, and potentially even have it examine and mark files with bad practices/write docs for you. You could also potentially 'plan out' a codebase with shapes/nodes prior to building, to provide structure and goals to aim for. These are all just ideas, see images below of a rough idea of how it may look like.  


My question is, do you guys see much use for such an app? would it really help with organizing a codebase and keeping track of its growth and keep tabs on things getting messy? would such a tool be a benefit or a hassle? there is not really anything to maintain or learn in such an app  - the diagrams would build out and update automatically given a repo source, and your notes and diagrams will remain on the chart, however i leave this opinion to you.

1bsq4gm,Seeking a Database Management Tool for Complex Art Portfolio with JSON Export Capability,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently managing a comprehensive database for my father's extensive art portfolio, which includes thousands of artworks like drawings, paintings, pastels, and prints. We've been using Excel, but it's becoming increasingly cumbersome due to our need for managing lists, complex data structures, and interlinked information. Our goal is to maintain a database that can effortlessly output JSON for our website server.

Here are some specific challenges I'm facing:

* Artwork Relationships: We need to link artworks together, for instance, connecting preliminary drawings to their final paintings. This requires the ability to list and manage supporting artworks for each piece.
* Exhibition Tracking: Each artwork might be featured in multiple exhibitions. Managing these relationships in Excel, especially maintaining lists within cells and ensuring accurate cross-sheet links, is fragile and cumbersome.
* Varied Artwork Specifications: Our data includes standard dimensions (width x height) but also needs to accommodate unique cases like circular pieces, painted objects, and multi-panel works (diptychs, triptychs), each requiring custom data handling.

Given these requirements, I've considered leveraging Unreal Engine's in-editor data asset system. Specifically defining UDataAssets and creating the database in the editor. I will iterate here that I'd never be hitting Play on the editor or packaging, the full functionality would be done in editor mode.  It seems ideally suited for our needs, offering the ability to define complex data structures, a robust GUI for data management, and straightforward linking of references. However, the full suite of Unreal Engine's features, particularly its rendering capabilities, is more heavyweight than we need.

I'm reaching out to see if there are alternative tools or platforms that might offer similar database management capabilities, especially for defining custom data types, managing intricate relationships, and exporting data in JSON format, but in a more conventional and possibly lighter-weight package.

Suggestions that have come up include developing a custom application using OOP frameworks and possibly a GUI framework like Electron, but I'm concerned about the potential development time, maintenance challenges, and lack of immediate functionality compared to Unreal Engine's ready-to-use system.

Does anyone have experience with or recommendations for tools that could meet these complex requirements without the overhead of a game development platform? Are there database management systems, software platforms, or development frameworks particularly well-suited to handling this type of nuanced, interrelated data in a user-friendly manner?

Thank you for any insights or advice you can provide!",2024-04-01 00:45:18

1bsn8jp,Is there a tool like EF Core (C#) for other languages?,"I'm wondering if there is an ORM out there like EF Core that will take some DDL (written in application code, could even be an established one like ActiveRecord) and automatically

1. Diff it with the database and
2. Apply an incremental diff (create new tables, columns, indices)

Without writing a dedicated migration file. The ideal workflow I'd like to have is something like this. Imagine I have this table (pseudo DDL):

    class Person:
        id(type = 'primary_key')
        name(type = 'text')

I'd like to have an executable that identifies this class, and generates a migration the creates this table with the appropriate columns. After, let's say I add a column:

    class Person:
        ...
        email_address(type = 'text')

It creates a migration that adds this column automatically without needing to specify somewhere that a migration should add a column instead of creating the table again.

Ideally this tool would be able to handle 1:M cases:

    class Person:
        ...
    
    class Car:
        id(..)
        owner_id(reference=Person.id)

Ideally here, the tool would generate a CREATE statement for the car with a foreign key constraint on the owner id column that references the Person table. Again, all automatically.

and M2M cases:

    class Person:
        ...
    
    class House:
        ...
    
    class Residence:
        id(...)
        resident_id(reference=Person.id)
        house_id(reference=House.id)

Here, the join table (Residence) should get created with references to both sides of the join.

As far as I can tell, most migration tools need users to do this work manually. EF does something like this, but I'd rather not be locked into .NET. Does anyone know if there are tools like this elsewhere?",2024-03-31 22:41:13

1brh4u3,Playground for JS Image Pixel Manipulation (How I Built It),"When studying CS, I remember really enjoying first learning some basic pixel manipulation in python. We also did some basic steganography to hide messages in image pixel data which was pretty fun. For learning and experimenting purposes, I wished there was a simple browser playground where I could tinker with different pixel manipulations in code easily, and also see some examples that I could run. I decided to create that, and I just deployed it on Netlify, so others can play with it also. I'm thinking some CS professors can use it to help teach students, and devs can use it to really quickly test some ideas.

Here it is, if you want to play around with it: [https://js-pixel-playground.netlify.app/](https://js-pixel-playground.netlify.app/)

Architecture:

\- Everything runs in JS in the browser, there is no back-end

\- Code editor uses Code Mirror

\- For getting the image pixels, I just use canvas. (though the preview is just an img tag)

\- To keep the image manipulation off the main thread, I send the pixel data bytes via an ArrayBuffer to a web worker script that handles the pixel loop.

\- The code from the text editor is also sent as a string to the web worker script, and is run using the js eval() function.

\- When the pixel manipulation is done, the pixel ArrayBuffer is sent back to the main thread to the canvas, and then displayed in the img tag.

\- The select button just fetches some sample filters I wrote, and populates the code editor with them

\- The upload file is just a file input

\- The reset image just stores the initial image from your upload and restores it

\- Download image just grabs the current canvas image for download

Hoping this is helpful for learning and having some fun creating cool pixel filters!",2024-03-30 12:50:27
1brf9bc,I made an automated job application tracker," 

Hi all, I've recently launched the beta for my project - [jobWrangler.io](https://jobwrangler.io/)

After seeing how many of my friends and family go through struggles with changing jobs and applying to tons of postings in tough markets, I thought I could alleviate some of the stress involved in the search. One of my friends said he was tired of tracking all of his applications in a spreadsheet and that he would frequently read an update or rejection email while away from his computer and then forget to update his spreadsheet when he got back to it. Leaving him wondering where some of his applications ended up.

Out of that stream of thought came jobWrangler, an automated job application tracker. jobWrangler can scan emails from your gmail inbox and classifies them using ML and NLP to assign the employer, job title, and application stage. I figured since I was already there I might as well add task tracking to help you know when to follow up on applications, and insights so that you can see your entire job search at a glance.

**Features currently in development:**

* Automatically generated follow up emails for you to review and send yourself.
* CSV Import/Export for those of you who have been used a spreadsheet up until now or those who want to take their data with them when they're done using the tool.
* Browser extension for those who prefer the manual process or don't want to grant access to scan their email.
* More email providers
* Calendar integration for follow ups

I'm looking to have some people try it out and provide any feedback they might have. For the beta all newly created accounts will have be granted Premium access.

1blflkm,Best way to determine pricing?,"So I’m a very new freelance web developer. Honestly I dont even really have a “business” necessarily, i just happened to come across a good opportunity through some connections i made. It was more sought out and i happened to come up, rather than me actively searching for clients, hence the question. The client im working with is looking for two projects.

One is a very simple, one page web application. Im basically done with this one already. It’s developed with React, and is mostly static information and design, with some logic and function such as a contact form that gets sent to the client’s email, and a button that translates the page to Spanish. Since i have never done this before, and didnt know how to price things, i set a flat rate of $600 for the project. It will also be hosted and have a custom domain name.

The second project is for another company my client owns, which has no website or online presence at all. This will be me building it from the ground up, and i anticipate it will have multiple pages, and be more comprehensive than the first project.

My question is, how do i go about pricing for the second project? Im working on it alone, and so i know it will take a while. Do i charge weekly? Bi-weekly? And at what rate? Did i go too low for my first project? Any help or insight into how other’s price things, and what a reasonable rate for my experience level would be, is greatly appreciated.

1bl37eu,My team lead doesn't review PRs,"Hello,   

I joined a team around 5 months ago and it's a small team of 5 people. The environment is Nestjs with React.   

We have a team lead, and I was told after joining that the team lead  doesn't entirely know React that well but enough to understand the  infrastructure.   

I don't put too much thought into it as of right now because I know a  lead's focus is different than just being a master of the code base,  and there are different responsibilities for them vs the developers who  are deep in the code.   

However, I at least expect them to have a good understanding of the  tech stack that the developers are working on and an understanding of  some of the deep level intricacies of the technology that directly  relates to it.   

My question is this:   

I do notice a trend, he never does reviews. I do roughly 3-4 reviews  a day, but this leaves me with little time to do tasks in the company,  and other developers also do a good amount of MR's as well, but even  with that, we end up with some MR's that sit for 2 days-3 days.   

If that occurs, the team lead will ask a dev to review it so it can  be approved, but my question is, is that normal? Since I've joined, I've  seen him approve 2-3 reviews, and they were minor text changes.   

Are team leads specifically not meant to do reviews or very little reviews at all?   

The companies I've worked at before, all leads were heavily engaged  in not only the review process but the code standards, direction of  development flow, ensuring good practices. I know they have more  responsibilities outside of the code level specifics, but I'm just  curious on this.   

I don't feel like the lead does these things at all, on our back end  side's team, it's drastically different with their lead being heavily  engaged in reviews, dictating standards, requiring tests, etc.   

I write tests on my end, but it's not required in our code base. I  was told due to time, but I feel like if you write a feature fast, and  there's bugs from QA, then you end up losing the time you think you're  saving initially anyway.   

Anyway, my question is more about the review process and how much a  lead should be involved in this. I'm aware they're not to meant to just  review everything, we all are meant to take part in this as a team and  this is understood on my end, but doing no reviews at all and asking  other people to review it just to get it approved quickly seems odd to  me.

1binx0r,Dynamic Site causing high AWS bill - Need recommendations,"Hello all, I did web dev back in 1999 to around 2004 and it was mostly HTML, CSS and PERL hosted on a LAMP stack. I have a site now which I can't expose here but it hold around 12k registered users written in PHP, HTML & CSS. My web developer has written 99% of this and he rocks!

The problem we are faced with is our department doesn't have the budget to support the massive amount of requests coming in 24 hours a day. I have a potential solution, tell me if I am crazy. 

When I wrote site using HTML, CSS and PERL, I would cache everything but each update script would produce a new .html file. I also had a master script which would reproduce the entire site and output new HTML. 

Scenario: User A updates their email address and the email update script would update the table and then output a new HTML file for user\_lookup.html (example page). user\_lookup.html is just the page that hosts the 12k registered users vs having the DB pull 12k user records for each page load.

Is this something that is done today in webdev or is there a new approach?",2024-03-19 16:08:04
1bii4nn,How to handle Authorization for an existing SaaS platform with Enterprise costumers?,"Hi there,

We have an existing SaaS platform where an enterprise customer, let's say for example ""Porsche"", has their own resources. Within this, several employees, ranging from Admin, Contributor, Reader, etc., have accounts under the ""Porsche"" resource.

I've been researching various authorization models, such as ""Access Control List (ACL)"" and ""Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC).""

While these models seem to be a good starting point, I'm uncertain about how to proceed due to the following reasons:

* **ACL**: From my understanding, ACL governs access based on actions performed on a resource type, such as `image:create`, `image:delete`, etc. However, it doesn't restrict users from performing these actions solely on their own resources. In other words, Porsche, in theory, would have access to perform actions on resources belonging to other enterprise customers.
* **ABAC**: ABAC appears to address the issue with ACL by checking various attributes, including ownership over the resource. However, implementing ownership checks can be challenging in our current system, as we lack a common primary key in our Database. For instance, we have a mixture of primary keys named ""id"", ""Id"", ""ProductID"", ""ProductId"", etc., or they are composed of a composite key. This inconsistency poses a significant technical debt, especially considering many engineers have coded without uniformity. Consequently, implementing ownership checks cannot be executed on a global scale; it must occur per request.

Given this context, what approach would you suggest for performing authorization checks per request? Specifically, how can we ensure that enterprise customers only access their own resources on a global scope, without resorting to a request-level enforcement?",2024-03-19 11:37:17

1bh6f4j,Used technologies in famous website / web app editors?,"Hello everyone!

We are developing a collaborative web component editor and I am curious on top of what technologies (backend, frontend frameworks) the similar applications built? So for example these: 

* [TelportHQ](https://teleporthq.io/)
* [Builder.io](https://Builder.io)
* [Framer](https://www.framer.com/developers/)
* [Webflow](https://webflow.com)

Does anybody know any of these how they are built? Or suggest anything else that you know the architecture of? Are these tools built on top of Node js / React / Nextjs?

1bgft4x,Show Off Saturday Firebase Weight Tracker,"Hi all,

I have built a weight tracker app, which has history charts and normal history, It also has the ability, to show the BMI and display the data on the dashboard. as it was built with Firebase, as long as you know the login for the account, you can access your data anywhere. you can also switch from IBS to kg. or vice versa. It's also a PWA for easy installation, it can force updates, by matching the version number from the user's local app to the version given by Firebase.

Feel free to try and give me improvements as this will be trialed in a local gym soon.

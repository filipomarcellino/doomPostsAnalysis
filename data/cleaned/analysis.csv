1b7lxpf,4 reasons why CS is absolutely 100% dead,"1. It's way too competitive. Everyone agrees with this.
2. It used to be exclusively done by a group of elite people but everyone and their grandma went into it. Now it's flooded by mediocre normies.
3. Grinding. You have to grind CS for a thousand hours and then you'll just be average.
4. Cheating. So many people cheat so it's extremely unfair.

So that's why the new Counter Strike game is pretty much dead already. It has some neat smoke physics but otherwise it is inferior to other games. Unrelated to computer science btw",2024-03-06 00:44:41

My friend who is a complete dunce (can not do fizzbuzz) somehow got an invitation to do the technical interview. He of course having close to no leetcode experience was panicking, this was his first ever interview as a junior in college. 

We devised a plan to cheat the system. I sat next to him as he started the interview. Basic introductions and we move straight into the technical portion. He has no clue what to do, I used chatgpt to get a basic solution to the question and showed him my computer. Being as sneaky as possible he copies it down and spits word for word the description of the solution, taking sips of water to buy time. By gods grace the interviewer was content with that. 

The behavioral was very easy as he bullshitted his entire experience portion from his completely fabricated resume. The interviewer ate that shit up. Realizing we had successfully bullshitted the interview and likely passed we went out and got plastered. ",2024-03-13 02:10:19

17fjjks,It actually happened to me.,"Ok so it actually happened to me. I hear this joke a lot amongst CS majors. But I actually didn’t think it would happen to me, and ngl when it was happening I thought they were pulling my leg.

It was a random Tuesday morning, I was walking to class beside the business school. I tend to wear pretty CS-identifying outfits, like headphones, (not sarcastic) space grey/black clothes, glasses. One of my friends from the business school stopped me and asked me if I would be on board with their startup idea.

“Sure, what will my role be?” I asked

I immediately knew the answer. “Can you code up our app? And website and stuff?” I quickly replied “sure. How much will I be compensated”

“Um well the idea is you get experience 🤡🤡”

I genuinely never thought this would happen to me. Lesson learned, never walk by the business school again. 

I wish I could say I was joking, but it’s super common for business students and other professions a like to ask CS majors to code up their stuff for free.",2023-10-24 18:23:42

The path wasn't easy. I remember my first interview at Bytedance; it was a disaster. I froze and couldn't speak for 20 minutes straight. It was one of those moments where everything you've prepared just vanishes.

Fast forward to now, and I've received 3 offers, including one from a company that had previously rejected me. In a twist of fate, I've decided to accept this offer.

To everyone out there struggling, I want to say: your next offer, your next interview, your next opportunity is on the horizon. Keep pushing, keep striving, and most importantly, keep believing in yourself. The road might be tough, and the nights long, but the dawn of success is near.

My cousin is a classic overachiever who has done everything “right” when it comes to tech recruitment. He secured multiple internships, grinded leetcode, kept his grades up, and did extensive networking.

1. Revise your CS fundamentals before your start LeetCoding. You don't have to spend that much time studying, but you need to know the advantages of each data structure and when to use which for the question.

2. The average question difficulty you'll get is Medium. Start with Easy questions, do more of them, move on to Medium questions. You probably won't be asked Hard questions in real interviews but you should do some famous Hard questions like Word ladder, serialize/deserialize Binary tree and trapping rain water. You should not be practicing only Easy questions.

I watched the videos, wrote out stuff on paper, and made sure I could explain the solution to myself from scratch and justify each and every line of code. ChatGPT was so, so helpful in this regard. If I ever didn't understand something, I could paste that chunk of the solution (with some context) and ask it all the dumb questions I wanted to ask, and it worked like a charm.

At my second FAANG job, a major component of the system I was hired to design and deliver  required consuming user submitted source code and allowing it to run on a very popular public facing website. As you might imagine, security was a top concern.  My manager was pushing hard for a static code analysis solution that I knew was not solvable.  I described approximations that would probably work in practice (and their tradeoffs), but my manager insisted that we couldn't approximate the analysis step and that it was crucial. 

Only after I PROVED (in the theory of computation sense) that what he was asking me to do was equivalent to the halting problem did we settle on another approach (a combination of simpler static analysis and a dedicated human review team who would reject submitted code that wasn't clear).

I carefully reviewed your offers, but unfortunately, I decided not to move forward with your company at this time. I understand posts like this can be disappointing, but I always want to grow my skills and look for new challenges to make a great impact on my society. So, I encourage you to keep an eye on me for other roles you may find me a good fit for. 
 
But seriously, I'm beyond excited and happy to announce that I will be joining Google this summer. Last year, I had an amazing experience in this company as an intern that persuaded me to leave academia after 10 years and start a new journey in the tech industry. I'm so grateful to have this opportunity to grow my personal/professional skills and looking forward to working with the talented individuals at Google.",2022-04-11 18:03:50
v23cli,Your degree is your ticket out.,"I’m inspired by another post on here saying that a shitty part time job is great motivation to leetcode and it had me thinking about how different my life is now that I have a career. I’m a new grad with my first full time job.

I was listening in on a meeting that had nothing to do with me. They were abandoning a project because revenue was much less than expected. Overall, the company lost 11 million dollars on this. The lead says great effort nonetheless, we’ll reassess our goals going forward. That was it. Everyone was nice. Everyone was professional and respectful. Like it was nothing.

My memories of working fast food are still fresh. The rude customers. The low pay. The long hours. The level of disrespect that you get from all levels. I remember customers who threatened violence when we told them we had a mask policy. 

And now here I am listening to how 11 million  dollars was burned like it was monopoly money. Everyone is treated like an adult even when things go wrong. I’ve e",2022-05-31 23:38:59
1boly3t,Finally got an internship!!,"I'm an international Master's in CS student in a T-50 school and after a crushing 8 months of non-stop applying, I finally managed to get a summer internship offer from a top semiconductor company.

As an international student, I had kinda lost hope after seeing multiple postings that pretty much said f*** off if you're not a US person. But after seeing positive posts on this channel, I kept applying. Suddenly, I got 4 interviews back to back in a month, and today, I got the good news from one.

I don't want to share my resume but for those curious, my profile is:
CGPA - 3.9
Work Ex - 2 years full time and 1 year internship 
Projects - 4 projects in which 1 is extremely related to the internship
Skill areas - Web development, Computer Vision, and machine learning
Achievements - Winning team in a hackathon ",2024-03-26 22:57:05

During high school I tried so. Hard. For a top college bc everyone acted like the end goal to everything. I thought that being a top school student would be my happy moment. To feel validated for my hard work and feeling smart. And now sure, I’m at a top college. It’s still hard. I’m still not happy. I still don’t feel smart or successful— tbh, I’ve never felt dumber. Not to say I don’t feel grateful and lucky to be at my college, but it was really not what it’s cracked up to be.

And now I’m stressing out over winter break, trying to push through leetcode, finish side projects done, trying to keep up at my internship. All so when I graduate, I can achieve the “dream” of going to work at a FANG.

It's very easy to 1. assume women only get jobs in this industry because they're women and 2. act like being a woman in this industry makes our lives easier when that is easily not the case.

I could sit here and give anecdotal evidence on what it's like to be a woman in cs and I'm sure a lot of other women on this sub can, but I won't. Some people accused me of making baseless claims so I decided let's look at some stats

Fast forward to today, near the end of my Sophomore year, and I realize that I have no real coding skills. All of my projects were either written by ChatGPT or copied from a YouTube tutorial.

I think there is already [a wonderful post](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mfx8oq/womens_experience_in_cs/) about all the facts pertaining this, I wanted to give a bit of a personal point of view.

The title is pure satire and as sarcastic as it can be. If you do read what I wrote, you will see my experience is rather: How I got in *despite* being a girl.

I don't.. expect to post this to have my ""life"" deconstructed into arguments you can debunk. You can make whatever you want of what I'm about to say, but **please stay respectful.**

Is this normal? I feel like my life has been dominated by code. Is it normal to see everything and anything I do in code? Sometimes when I do something like search my bag I imagine myself as a recursive program and my base case is when I find it :)

I am ""undocumented"" in the United States by way of visa overstay. Throughout high school and up til now, I was never able to work anywhere that required work authorization (so, basically everywhere). My father still has work authorization through some convoluted process before our visas expires, so he's basically been the sole provider for our family. My mother has a chronic illness and is in need of an organ transplant, which we can't get because of our shitty state provided poverty insurance and we need another to supplement it.

nzuv6v,Let's stop talking about Computer Science," It's no longer relevant and really unnecessary. It creates a sort of ""class boundary"" between those in CS and those not in CS.

It also just doesn't make sense. Is programming really in the same caliber as data entry or accounting right now? I wouldn't say so. Additionally lots of people here would be pretty satisfied with a job at Target or Walmart. If you, like me, are specializing in cars, then your dream job is likely a car saleserson or car mechanic or again, racecar driver (vroom vroom).

Part of the beauty of computer science is that it's applicable to just about anything else, what's with all the focus on tech?

Regarding your CS degree

* ""I'm struggling in class. Am I not cut out for CS?"" **Struggling is a sign of learning and growth, not failure**. CS is not easy. Persevering through challenges is not only useful for your degree but for your life after. You don't need to be naturally gifted to do well in CS. I personally bombed my intro classes and it took me \~4 months for things to start clicking. During those four months I just kept re-reading the material and going to my professor's office hours to ask questions.

13qq1j2,Money is a perfectly valid reason to study CS,"I'll preface this post by saying that I personally do have a genuine passion for my niche field of CS and for technology in general.

However, I've noticed that the comment sections of a lot of the doomer posts are criticizing people who are ""just in it for the money"".

News flash: money is a HUGE reason most people are in this field.

And that's perfectly fine. 

Truth is that this field pays extremely well compared to others, and that's what attracts people to it.  I'm a research scientist in the field and make significantly less than what I could in industry, yet it's still in the mid six figures (well above what researchers make in other fields with my experience level).

You don't need to have a deep passion for microservice architecture design, write ""insightful"" LinkedIn articles, grind leetcode and hackerrank as your favorite hobby, or be like that kid who ""dreams in code"".

17xsqsa,Oversaturation in CS in a nutshell,"A recruiter for a startup I interviewed for told me that they initially had only 100 applicants in their pipeline (me being one of the early ones), but then their job posting somehow made it onto the public Github new grad posting. In just 3 days they said they recieved over 50,000 applications... JUST 3 DAYS.

It fucked me over since she made it clear they had a lot more applicants to consider to now and filter through. so they had me wait another 3 weeks despite having finished the final round with a pretty good performance, until they reached back to me to tell me they hired other developers... 

tldr: I'm hate these fucking Github postings that everyone and their mom has on 24/7 eyewatch since it literally encourages mass applying, more oversaturation and fiercer competition in an already bad market. why do they exist, wtf?? do people not realize how much more RNG they make the process by posting it publically for hundreds of thousands of people?

On paper this is a very good position, however, I can't help but have the urge to completely destroy the company by wiping out our codebase, then the database, then the back-ups of everything etc. I've already tested the response time of my colleagues by pushing a small bug to production, it took an hour for someone else on my team to notice, which is more than enough for me to delete every thing and wipe the back-ups. I've already wrote the BASH script to do the former, which I placed on my desktop.

As a former Amazon engineer who worked on the AWS Virtual Private Cloud service back in 2017-2018, let me explain to you what is wrong with that line of thinking.

The first thing you need to keep in mind about any real job is that work is normally exploitative, and big tech jobs are no exception. They give great starting salaries compared to other junior developer positions, sure, but there's a catch. They lose money on you during your first year working there with no experience with the expectation that they will make that money back from your labor later on when you know what you're doing there. Big tech companies like Amazon and Facebook often use their own, internal, company-specific tools that aren't used at other companies.

v0ay2x,Tips for a successful internship from a FAANG intern manager,"Having mentored 3 interns who successfully got their return offers, and seen many examples of successful interns at FAANG, here are some tips for your internships which should be useful regardless of company.

1) Do what is expected of you. Firstly in order to do what is expected of you, you gotta know what is expected of you. If you're a SWE intern, most of the time you just need to finish your project by writing high quality code while not being a jerk. To write high quality code, look at how code is written in the code base and follow the conventions, directory structure, naming, use existing abstractions. Break your code into small PRs so that it's easy to review. Nobody likes reviewing PRs which are thousands of lines long. Write tests! At the end of the internship a good litmus test on whether your internship was successful is whether the team would hire you or take their chances with a new intern/fresh grad?

- you only have to get lucky once - keep applying. The more darts you throw at the board, the more likely you are to hit a bullseye. Cast a broad net, you never know which random opportunities might work out. I ended up getting my offer in a country I’ve never been to.

- Separate the process from your self-worth and eradicate imposter syndrome. Not having an offer yet doesn’t make you underqualified or worse than those who do. Continue enjoying life in the meantime and don’t fall into the trap of grinding and being stressed until you get an offer - don’t fall into the trap of engaging in the vicious cycle of permanently treating your current life as a transition period while you wait for some big change or achievement to all of a sudden make things better.

1bs5xjw,"Y'all who are unemployed after graduating, build a startup","First of all, very sorry this happened to you and yes the job market is terrible.

But if you've been unemployed for 8 months, and only have a bunch of dummy to do list projects, I would advise you to change course. No employeer cares about tiny pet projects. They're too easy to make, they never know if you just copied them, and it's questionable how much you really learned.

If you're really into this career, just pick a problem to solve, pick a modern technology, and start building. With cloud services, you can have an actual revenue generating Saas in a couple months. You will learn a lot, things that you would also learn on the job. It makes you stand out and is a great talking point in interviews. But, it must be a published project running in production. With users.

On the side, also apply for jobs. But this way, you won't be wasting your time as much. You'll be learning stuff + maybe even making some money.

p6am7a,Here are 5 Things You Should Do After Your Internship Is Over,"Congratulations, you secured your summer internship, spent 10/12 weeks working on a team, potentially did a presentation and now its over. You might be asking yourself, what do I do now? 



No need to worry. Here are 5 tips for things you should be doing post internship.

&nbsp;

**Tip 1.** Add your team and fellow interns on LinkedIn


&nbsp;

This is the single most important thing you can do for your career. Why is this so you might ask. Well did you know that by getting referred you are 4x more likely to be hired? How do you get referrals? By having a strong network and there are no better people to add to your network than those that have worked with you.

This is especially true for those that may not have received a return offer. If you are in this category, leveraging your network can lead to a direct referral to your next role.

**Tip 2.** Ask for recommendation on LinkedIn

rp4bkw,How to Leetcode? My 2 cents.,"Who is this for? CS students with a good grasp of basic DS & A but find leetcode terrifying or difficult.

**What's the target?** The goal is not to master all the hardest problems, rather to accurately code for medium-level (sometimes popular hards) questions in 20 mins + 5 mins explaining. Code should be easy to read, explain and debug.

**Language:** I would recommend choosing Python along with one of C++/Java. Debugging, explaining, coding are much faster in Python. That means you will learn much faster. Sometimes Python is not available so you can fall back to C++/Java

**When to start leetcode:** Starting leetcode without any background in DSA is like jumping into a wall of frustration. I would recommend you at minimum get a grasp of the following :

Array: Searching, Sorting

LinkedList, Ordered and Unordered Sets and Trees: Traversal, Add, Remove

Trees: BST, DFS, BFS,

Graph: BFS, DFS, Shortest Path

17pkr7r,I just realized applying without LeetCode is pointless,"Okay for context, I have about 50 “easy” leetcode problems, but I’ll be honest, I had to look up the answer for 80% of those. 

I am getting online assessments and interviews, but genuinely feels pointless to attempt them because everytime I open one up, I can only code it through pseudo code and not with Java or C++. 

I know some of you aren’t even getting these interviews and OAs, but if you don’t know basic OOP concepts and/or leetcode problems, then there is no point in applying.

This isn’t to sh*t on anyone, not even myself. I just wanted to share this to let everyone younger know that the fundamentals are SOOOOO important. Don’t ChatGPT your assignments in Computer Science 1!!

Actually learn the concepts and practice leetcoding. Code everyday like you would go to the gym, because I know I have to do that.

Last semester I applied for a software internship working on Tesla’s autopilot programs. There’s so much mystique around Tesla these days. Around Elon Musk. And let me tell you, he doesn’t have time for any of that in person. He’s a busy man, and an important one.

The competition for one of his internships is one of the toughest in today’s job market, and that’s saying something. I was doing technical interviews over the phone for weeks. One day, an interviewer called in the morning and grilled me for so long that I just straight up skipped one of my classes!

Sacrifices. Elon appreciates those.

At long last I made it to the final round. It’s true what they say-- he interviews everybody who will ever work for him. They flew me out to the Fremont factory in California, and my hands started shaking as soon as I stepped into the building.

But since their tech stack felt very similar to the one I worked on during my internship, I thought I'd give it a try. I applied in May and as expected, was ghosted.

Then came the fall recruiting season and I wasn't about to give up. I reached out to an EM at Meta that I had previous connection with and asked her for a referral to these roles. She gave me the referral, but again I was rejected three days later, this time by an actual recruiter.

When the Meta New Grad posting came out in November, I thought I'd give it one last try.

15ndv2z,From Code to Desolation: How Majoring in Computer Science Left Me With Nothing But Regret,"Hey fellow CS majors,

I've been wanting to share my story for a while now, hoping that it might resonate with some of you who are struggling or on the fence about majoring in computer science. Let me tell you, my journey through this major has been an emotional roller coaster that has left me with nothing but regret.

First off, let me clarify that I was truly passionate about technology and coding when I started. I had this grand vision of becoming a software engineer, working on cutting-edge projects, and changing the world. The promise of high-paying jobs and endless opportunities drew me in like a moth to a flame. But little did I know that reality would hit me like a ton of bricks.

The workload, oh my god, the workload. I thought I was prepared for it, but nothing could have prepared me for the endless nights of debugging, the constant stress of meeting deadlines, and the feeling of inadequacy that seemed to hang over me like a dark cloud. It seemed like every week brought a new",2023-08-10 14:20:37

His resume was insanely good compared to mine and we’re both sophomores taking similar courses. He then showed me his old resume which looked similar to mine(simple projects, school projects, hackathon..). 

Then he tells me his projects are all cloned projects off GitHub. He stalked people that got FAANG internships or currently work there and search for their GitHubs and clone projects. He even faked his volunteer experience and school clubs. I was pretty pissed off but just laughed it off with this guy.

He minimally studied the projects and hoped he didn’t get questioned about them too much for interviews. He got 3 FAANG interviews/OAs and multiple other interviews from mid-size companies. He’s a leetcode grinder so technical interviews or assessments weren’t a problem for him.

I then scheduled a call with the recruiter since I had decided to go with another company, I was going to use this time to reject the offer.

I'm happy to announce I've decided not to return to Google after evaluating their revised remote offer and deciding their compensation is a disrespect both to my work and skills and those of fellow students.

Last year, one of the changes that we had to accept if we still wanted to work at Google was a compensation adjustment based on the cost of living in our country. It's worth noting that in 2020 Google made this adjustment while other tech companies that were still offering their program remotely didn't make any adjustments and paid the exact same amount they would've paid had the program taken place in the US, whereas Google paid about 10% of the original amount to its Mexican interns.

I devised a strategy to prepare more efficiently and stay committed to leetCode grind and achieve my ultimate goal of joining FAANG.

I really expected things to be different at a large tech company, especially at their headquarters, but I guess not. It’s really disheartening looking around a room and seeing no one else like you.

But the small percentage of people in this sub and in this field in general that say they can’t get jobs because of diversity hiring or that minorities have it so much easier??? That’s so clearly untrue when there’s one of me and 29 of you. If it was really that easy to get hired to such a high paying job wouldn’t everyone do it? I’m also really struggling to understand how the diversity initiatives that so many companies have are failing so miserably.

Edit: I’m not necessarily saying that there should be an even split of men and women in the field; I also understand why there isn’t an even split. I’m saying that it’s absurd that some white / Asian men and those overrepresented in ",2022-05-19 01:47:26
q4p2vc,"Accepted an offer, this sub and r/cscq is soooo misleading","I accepted an offer as a software engineer intern at McDonalds! They pay $30 an hour, in Chicago (from Chicago so it works out). I didn’t go through any coding test, hackerrank, code signal nothing. I just showed that I’m chill, normal and willing to learn and it worked. I also received an offer from Progressive Insurance as a Software Engineer intern but declined. Of course these aren’t FAANG, but it’s a decent internship. Those who are struggling to find any internship, keep trying! Just because you didn’t do 200+ leetcode or you can’t solve a lc hard dp, bst, bfs, fps, moba, dps question doesn’t mean you can’t find a decent internship. Make sure ur resume is good and keep applying! My pms are open, if anyone needs some guidance.

Edit: I believe this sub and r/cscq are misleading because I have been discouraged for not doing 200+ leetcode, or not knowing random algorithms. I did not have to do a single leetcode to receive this internship.",2021-10-09 16:49:25
173hrho,Unfortunate internship experience at Google,"Recently finished an internship at Google and it was a bad experience ngl. 

Team had shitty WLB and office politics. People constantly messaging each other well after work hours. They wouldn’t even keep it subtle, my boss would directly ping people at 8, 9PM lmao (not regarding ppl on-call). Was required to go to office two times a week when literally none of my team would go in lmfao, I think I met two teammates in person 

With the office politics, it seemed a lot of people at the company were starting to distrust upper leadership (according to company-wide surveys). People were also rightfully and openly upset about the lack of bonuses and salary freezes.

Most of the other interns I knew (we were at a smaller satellite office) were working probably 60 hours a week near the end of the internship. Some of the friends I made were going into the office on Saturday AND Sunday. I really didn’t want work to comprise of 80% of my waking hours so I just phoned it in instead of burning out ",2023-10-09 03:13:58

So this summer I've been working on a project to solve these issues with the following features:

1. Get notified RIGHT AWAY when there's a new internship/new grad posting
2. Have top internship/new grad postings all in one place where you can easily sort through and filter to find exactly what you're looking for
3. Integrated salary data to job postings, so you know exactly what they pay!

If you're interested, please check out the site [sweintern.com](https://sweintern.com/)!

The job postings are collected from [Pitt CSC](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2024-Internships) and [ReaVNail](https://github.com/ReaVNaiL/New-Grad-2024) \- so if you have any new job postings you find, please add them there and contribute to the community!

I cheated on the Coinbase OA, blatantly. I looked up what they ask on LeetCode Discuss, knew the exact questions and so I wrote up answers in LeetCode Playground and just looked at my other monitor to type them into the OA. 100%.

Onsite round, same thing. I did not cheat, but again knew what they would ask. And they did.

Just got an offer. The offer is $140K + $50K stocks. I don't feel bad about knowing the phone and onsite questions, personally, but I do feel bad that I just blatantly copied to pass the OA. I could have even taken the time to learn the problems they ask, but didn't because I felt lazy.

qr7qql,Unpopular Opinion: Leetcode has lifted thousands of working-class students to middle class,"I have seen so many posts on r/cscareerquestions recently about how leetcode is not the most effective way to gauge applicants' ability and thus we need a more ""fair"" system. 

However, I have to disagree. Leetcode is perhaps one of the most pro-working-class hiring system that has lifted thousands of working-class students to move up the social ladder.

No other industries (besides engineering) have given working-class applicants the opportunity in the field than the tech industry and thanks to leetcode, applicants with very little to no experience can break it into the industry. 

If you think the tech industry is unfair, it is because you have not worked in different industries before. For instance, in the finance and law field, your pedigree matters which weeds out students from a working-class background. If you want to work in politics, it is near impossible to even work as an intern if you did not attend one of the top 10 universities.

After a fun internship, I got a new grad offer at a top 50 Fortune 500 non-tech company. Fully remote, in an LCOL area. TC isn’t crazy, but my company is relatively immune to layoffs and my WLB is fantastic. 

It’s not FAANG. I don’t make 200K as a new grad. But I got a job, I’m a software engineer, and I work for a great company.

Some programs, like ColorStack, which are more selective, partner with companies for internships. But you have to apply to get into those. And the people who apply that aren’t in those programs aren’t being affected by the company’s partnership with a third party.

So I asked for feedback and the CTO scheduled a call.

>In general, we found that your answers weren't specific.

When he explained further, it cut even deeper.

>We've learned that engineers who can't speak specifically about certain experiences often don't understand them.

After our chat, I spent some time reflecting on the interview. He was right about my specificity. My failure was some mix of poor communication and truly not understanding all the specifics.

Four communication tips I learned:

1. Never assume shared knowledge. Providing context is better than assumption.
2. Think before responding. A small pause is better than a quick, thoughtless reply.
3. Be honest about what you know and don't know. Clearly define the limits of your knowledge.
4. Don't be afraid of ignorance. If you don't know something, take note and go learn it.

Hope this list is a good reminder / potentially helpful!

Set up a listener on a publicly accessible server with `nc -lk 1234 -vvv`. Then submit code to an assignment that creates a reverse shell and connects to your listener. This will allow you to type Linux commands into your listener and they will execute on the autograder machine, returning the results to you. From here you can exfiltrate hidden test cases. Or mine Bitcoin or whatever, there's no time limit on autograders unless your professor manually wrote one in.

This can be as simple as copy-pasting some socket code, Google for ""C reverse shell"" or python or whatever your assignment uses. Put the IP of your public server into whatever shell code you end up using (make sure the port matches the listener, and you've allowed it thru the firewall if any). Unfortunately Gradescope's AG machines don't have `nc` on them and the old bash redirection to `/dev/tcp/IP address/1234` trick doesn't seem to work.

It’s so painful to sacrifice so much when your peers in humanities and social sciences have all the time in the world to do whatever they want and breeze by with As.

### Stats

Let me start by sharing my stats to ground the discussion:

University: UC Berkeley (Senior)

GPA: 3.92/4.00

Past Experience:

* Sophomore year: Household name non-tech company (think big bank, retail store, etc.) 
* Junior year: Local Series-B no-name startup

Alongside the above information, I had a year of TAing at Berkeley (1 semester for our DS class and another for the Discrete Math + Prob class) and a year of research. 

### Application Numbers

Here is how the 2022 job search panned out: 

* Applied: 121
* OA received: 42
* Phone screens: 19
* Onsites: 8
* Offers: 7 (5 new from onsites, 2 conversions from internships)
* Withdrew: 17 (stopped moving forward through the recruiting process because I already had offers which I knew I would take over the company",2021-11-09 06:05:13

y6m3qy,I DID IT,"Four years I've been in this sub. Four years. 

I used it to help me make my first resume. I used it to learn how to practice for online assessments. I used it to learn how to prepare for my first behavioral. I used it for my internship searches. I used it to help my with my new grad search. I used it for emotional support during the shittiest parts of covid when I sent 300 resumes only to get rejected 299 times until I got my first internship.

Even when school was online and all I had was a computer and 5 bucks in my bank account, this sub helped me reach my dreams

Four god damn years. That's insane.

I have no clue where I'd be if it weren't for this sub.

Thank you so much to everyone here, I love all of you guys and I wish you the best of luck on your own journeys!

I'm very excited to start my new life and it's all thanks to you guys :)

Even if the economy improves dramatically within the next 2-3 years, the entry level market will still remain extremely saturated and competitive. Yes, things will slightly improve, but It’ll be almost just as difficult to land an entry level job in 3-4 years, why? 

Because the hundreds of thousands of people influenced by the “learn to code” movement will be persistently trying to break in now, in 2 years, and in 10 years. 

There are thousands of bootcamps, certs, courses, etc. These businesses need to sell their product, they will keep selling the idea that you can break in easily without a degree. People won’t stop flooding into this field, there’s nothing you can do but work harder, network more, and pray for some luck. I see too many people saying that “they’re waiting for things to get back to normal.” This is a horrible strategy to have. You’re going to be waiting forever.

I thought I was doing alright for around two years into college. I got some internships as a sophomore, got into clubs, and did the whole computer science grind life.

But my issues were never actually solved. With depression, people frequently get episodes. They do fine for a bit and then they regress heavily back to a bad place. For the next 2 years, I was in a cycle of almost killing myself, then taking a break, going back to classes, and then falling apart again. I would go to a therapist, take different medications, and nothing would change. At some point, I didn't believe I could change. Ironically, thinking so make it impossible to change.

Here are two scenarios to illustrate this:

\- In 2021, you could found a startup and hire an engineer and pay them $100,000. Say your company did $100,000 in revenue too. In this case, the $100,000 in cost cancels out the $100,000 in revenue, and your business owes zero dollars in taxes. This makes a lot of sense.

\- In 2022, you could found a startup and hire an engineer and pay them $100,000. Say your company did $100,000 in revenue too. Instead of being able to deduct the $100k salary in the first year, you have to amortize the $100k salary over 5 years.  
So in this case, you'd have a taxable income of $80k for the first year. This means you'll have a $24k tax bill with no money to pay it!

These were very awesome videos and now they're gone :(.

Anyways, some weeks ago I discovered these videos and I actually recorded the problems he recommended on a Google Spreadsheet. I have the list of all the main problems he suggested we do. Here they are:

1.- DFS:

13gy4hs,man i just wanna code for fun,"Freshman here. I joined this sub so I could learn more about computer science in general. Not see posts about the job market and sending applications and crying over being the perfect applicant. I don't wanna learn how to come up with a solution in minutes. I want to spend time with my code. I want to think about it, experiment, get things wrong, and keep doing that. I love researching into algorithms and reading about them just for fun, even though I don't understand stuff most of the time. 

It's sad to see how many people here started studying computer science because they found computers and writing code interesting and fascinating and now getting a good job or internships has sucked all the passion out of them.",2023-05-14 00:58:27

I’ve never taken a CS class, but I hang out in the CS building and say stuff like “wow, discrete math is killing me!” to try to fit in, and I’ve made a lot of friends this way. My cover almost got blown one time when I accidentally remembered to shower before going to the university one morning.

Nobody has said anything yet, and my friends think I’m an actual CS student too lol.

Just wanted to remind everyone here that Leetcode is intended to work as a standardized test, not as a comprehensive measure of your ability or intelligence. Just like the SAT only really measured how good you were at taking the SAT (if you are US), Leetcode interviews only determine how well you study Leetcode. People will dress it up, but at the end of the day these tech companies, which receive thousands of applications for a single position, needed some way to weed out applicants, and so they settled on standardized testing. It is necessary because there are simply too many applications to just give interviews to everyone, but that still doesn’t mean your success with these interviews reflect anything but the effort you put forth to master this very unique form of standardized testing.

mzn319,Some motivation to do leetcode.,"**Donald Knuth**, one of the most prominent computer scientists in the history of algorithmics, put it as follows:


“A person well-trained in computer science knows how to deal with algorithms: how to construct them, manipulate them, understand them, analyze them.
This knowledge is preparation for much more than writing good computer programs;

it is a general-purpose mental tool that will be a definite aid to the understanding of other subjects, whether they be chemistry, linguistics, or music, etc.

The reason for this may be understood in the following way: It has often been said that a person does not really understand something until after teaching it to someone else.

Actually, a person does not really understand something until after teaching it to a computer, i.e., expressing it as an algorithm...


An attempt to formalize things as algorithms leads to a much deeper understanding than if we simply try to comprehend things in the traditional way.”",2021-04-27 12:13:28

v2hq0p,Leetcode is actually great,"In fields like law or finance, you basically have to go to a top tier school and be a top performer in order to get a top tier job.

Lc levels the playing field so hard, you don’t need to worry that others are more knowledgeable than you because they’ve been programming as a hobby since they were 8, you don’t need to worry that your university sucks… none of that.

Imagine places like google basically saying “yeaaah we’re only hiring from MIT, don’t even bother if you’re not from there” the way many law firms or high finance do.

I’m grateful that lc exists, with just a few months of effort, I landed bill gates and rain forest. Would be unfathomable for my equivalent, education wise, to land the same in their respective fields whether it be law, finance or even medicine. In university I remember thinking I’d be happy with a mediocre job, after all how could I not?

There were a few posts about career advice but even then most people in that subreddit were rather chill compared to the constant doom and gloom we see in most cs subreddits. There were some posts about bad job prospects as a physics major ofc but that didn't seem to be the main recurring theme for r/PhysicsStudents

The number of graduates dished out from top tier schools has nearly doubled in the last few years. It’s tripling and quadrupling at state schools and everywhere outside of the T30. Colleges with poor programs and little opportunity for software are happily accepting hundreds/thousands of kids thinking Computer Science is a great study for their career. Many of these students are being deluded and will have issues finding internships and jobs. Especially now.

I talked to him about their approach to “Diversity Hires,” . Their actual strategies are much more complex:

	1.	Uniform Bar for Interviewees: All candidates who make it to the interview stage are held to the same standards. Only if two candidates are at the same performance level will the company choose the one who belongs to an underrepresented group (e.g., women).

	2.	Expanding the Underrepresented Pool: The company actively works to increase the pool of underrepresented candidates. This is achieved through various methods:

	•	Targeted Outreach: They reach out to specific conferences, clubs, and groups where underrepresented individuals may participate.
	•	Strategic Selection: When faced with a large applicant pool (e.g., 1000 applicants), but only",2023-08-16 04:50:25

* Median salary is $135k and average salary is $150k. This implies the median graduate is getting into top tech firms because top tech firms have median salaries around this range (salary ignores bonus and RSUs).
* 16 to Amazon (13 Amazon + 3 AWS), 13 Jane Street, 9 Microsoft, 7 Google, 7 Meta, 4 Netflix, etc. All insane numbers. And this was in 2023.

# Onboarding efficiently

* Act with urgency to get onboarded. Internships are very short, and you need to ramp up quickly to justify your return offer.

For context, we were told whether we got return offers at the end of our internships in April. This came in the form of a letter of intent, which we could activate any time before October, and the moment we activate it, we had 2 weeks to decide whether to accept the offer letter. Most of us had summer internships lined up, so we waited to open the letter until after our summer internships to decide.

Keep your formatting minimal, but consistent and purposeful. In most big companies no human is looking at them to appreciate your artistic sensibilities, until they pass through the software filter.

I'm a former Amazon SDE intern, FB UX consultant, and 2x Google SWE intern. If you still won't take my advice, you're just on here to complain.

So many CS majors don't have communication skills to explain their thinking while they code. You have to realize what your interviewer is thinking and adjust your communication appropriately.

Illustrate your approach. Don't just solve the question:
- ask clarification first to show you're thinking about edge cases
- say what the brute force solution is to show you thought about other approaches and not just coding the first solution that comes to mind
- explain what the optimal solution is before you start coding so it's easier for the interviewer to follow along.

If you can't solve it optimally, say that you KNOW it's not optimal and say what your guess is for an optimal solution approach.

It can be really easy to think from reading this sub that there are 0 jobs available and that if you're not leetcoding 24/7 to land a job at a FAANG you're gonna be homeless. This is NOT TRUE!

Ironically the #1 biggest complaint is that it’s too verbose. Ultimately, the more verbosity the better. Code in large systems is meant to be read more often than it is written. It takes an extra couple of seconds to hit tab and allow IDE auto-completion to complete the verbosity you were typing, but it sakes hours and hours and hours of dev time when other SWEs come back to read and attempt to understand your code.",2023-09-19 22:50:51

Looking back at it, I’m not sure how I worked from 4am-3pm then managed to do home workout routines then study and do homework for classes.

So when I was a freshman, there was this other guy freshman who was studying computer science and I figured we could be friends. We had shared friends and we were on the same team so I sat next to him in class. This kid would not even acknowledge I was there. On my birthday, he didn’t wish me a happy birthday, say hi, or even look at me. BUT the day before a long ass project was due, he’d be like “hey what’s up?!” and then text me later that night for the entire project. I would just pretend like I didn’t start it and stuff. He then went on to tell everyone on our team that he hated me and I was an asshole with no context. I was also called antisocial by other members on the team because I studied a lot. Horrible start to college. Honestly, I was miserable.

It's an unfortunate reality that there will be toxicity in basically any community you go to. In CS, that toxicity often tends to take the form of extreme pride and arrogance. The idea that you're a failure if you don't get that internship/job at one of the most prestigious companies, that you're doing something wrong if you're not leetcoding 23/7, and conceited and egotistical people making you feel inferior to them bc they've had an internship at a Big N.

I don't know who needs to hear this, but absolutely none of this speaks for your worth. I know the race can get to people's heads and it's very very easy to feel like you're not good enough if you're not achieving ridiculous goals.

First off keep searching and use this as a backup until it gets too late for anyplace to hire you.

So here’s the idea: If you don’t have anything for the summer reach out to a small business honor and offer to work for them for free. Offer build them a website or overhaul the one they have. Offer to make them a in-house program that solves a problem they have. Find a inefficiency they have and solve it.

* I did not have the best technical skills (high 700s CodeSignal), but still got 2 interviews from HFT firms, 1 FAANG and 1 Big Tech company.
* I didn't apply to anything that required a cover letter

1b514sl,I accepted an offer for 50K without negotiating. Did I sell myself short?,"Hi, i’m a May 2023 new grad. After months of searching, I recently accepted an offer as a Full-Stack engineer at a small company, and have been working there for a couple of months now. Overall it’s been a fantastic experience. My team is nice and welcoming, the company culture is great, and our tech-stack is super interesting and I’m learning a lot. 

Unfortunately, whenever I talk to people about my job, one thing that seems to keep resurfacing is my salary. From the start, i’ve been open about it (mainly since I don’t really want to propagate the idea that workers shouldn’t discuss salaries). But almost every conversation I have about it, whether it’s with my friends who also work in COMPSCI, or family, people always ask why I accepted for so low. Or why I didn’t negotiate, or why I didn’t ask for or get stock options or equity, etc. It’s made me feel like maybe I shot myself in the foot.

Personally, the reason why I didn’t negotiate is because the market is and has been shit for e",2024-03-02 22:47:27

180rkd3,Leetcode is irrelevant for new grads this year. Change my mind,"I solved 330 LC problems. I sent \~200 applications online (big tech, Silicone Valley startups, etc); none of them proceeded me to the next round. Only companies (local + F500) from my uni's career fair gave me interviews. None of the interviews has LC (only behavioral). I secured 1 offer (90k MCOL).  


Don't focus on LC if you are looking for an offer this year. Most of the companies giving LC for interviews are receiving thousands of applications. Very likely your application is not even read. Instead, focus on finding local or non-tech companies or attending small to medium, not-so-well-known career fairs (you already see GHC).  


P/S: Also, build an interesting personal project with buzzwords like AI, blockchain, etc. I know it's cliche but recruiters at non-tech or local companies act like crazy when hearing those words.

kglndo,I've been on over ~20 coffee chats the last 5 months - here's everything I've learnt so far :),"I’ve had the chance to meet tons of awesome tech professionals over the last 6 months.

I’ve been curious to find out more about their backgrounds and listen to them describe what it is that they do on a day to day basis.

The number one benefit of doing this has been that I’ve been exposed to a variety of new industries, roles, and opportunities.

I’ve learnt about *why* people have made certain career transitions, how they’ve successfully learnt new skills, and what advice they have for others hoping to do the same.

All I’ve been basically doing is going on coffee chats (over Zoom, of course). And sharing them with everyone on the internet.

Here's what I've learnt so far & I hope you can also leverage coffee chats to advance your software career.

If this describes your situation too, then I highly encourage reading books like Cracking the coding interview.

Yes, interviews at those trading firms are hard, but not that far off from FAANG as far as prep goes. If you can do one, you can do the other.

The friend thing really is a maybe I don't go out. I don't do things. I've missed birthday parties and family stuff to do brainteasers and Leetcode. I kind of hate it and hate myself. None of these skills are useful/transferable and I did them just to get a job. I'm great at interviews at this point, but I've overdeveloped this one thing at the expense of basically everything else and it's made me miserable. I don't even know how to have fun anymore. All my hobbies are gone and even the fact that I have a job doesn't make me happy now.

https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xnsbtk/am_i_not_a_cut_for_swe/

Even though I solved 300 problems over the year, wasn’t passing any phone interview. The current economic situation and the fact that I’m an international made it more difficult for me. 

From August 2020 I started my job hunting process. Applied on more than 500 positions for Summer’22 internship. Didn’t get any offer after just 2 virtual on-site. I kept grinding whole summer. 

Again started the full-time hunting, but this time I was more prepared and more confident. And very soon every hope was going away as I kept failing phone interviews. Some rejections were so brutal to digest. I know lots of people have felt this way at some point. People were telling me to try for less technical roles. But I knew, I can do this sooner or later.

4. People who don't like CS take CS just because high pay. Bring their sibling their mother their dog. All of them get rewarded handsomely. Supply of CS grads starts surpassing demand.

5. CS becomes the mainstream degree. Sending the opportunity, bootcamps spawn everywhere, promising guaranteed high paying job or refund your money back. People start asking why don't you take CS. Unis create masters for non-STEM backgrounds to enter CS, basically also a bootcamp, and removing weeders like Advanced Algorithms or Computational Theory.

It happened to investment bankers, management consultants, and other finance-related careers when their high salaries started becoming publicized.

It even happened to therapists/mental health practitioners when psychology and mental health was considered the “up and coming science” and now psych majors everywhere are struggling to find jobs.

Now you hear CS majors complain about how oversaturated the field is and how it’s impossible to find entry-level jobs now. Social media glamorizing the pay, decent hours, and remote-capabilities of SWE is what caused this.

In fact, what you’ll find is that my windy path into quant through academia and software engineering is certainly not the most efficient for those looking for the path of least resistance to getting an offer in the quant space. Instead, I hope my path can be one useful sample point to help inform your journey through career discovery, as so many posts have done for me.

- Pretty good in problem solving, can solve LeetCode mediums & hards easily in around 75% of the cases at least

I went to my advisor one day and I asked him for advice on what I could do to prepare for the hard math classes if I were to switch to CS. You know what that cunt told me? Instead of being a good advisor that would help me set up a learning plan, the fker suggested me to major in something easy  like ""psychology"" where I would not have to take rigorous math classes. My heart did not feel right but I trusted myself that I would do whatever it takes to succeed in the major.

- you’re white? you’re NEVER getting a job because of diversity hires

- a phd masters and bachelors in CS are all USELESS, bootcamps give better industry skills

- going to a bootcamp is USELESS, employers throw out every application without a degree

- projects are USELESS (gotta get those internships)

- internships are USELESS (gotta make those projects)

Maybe work on your social and life view, which a lot of people in this sub lack seeing all the complaining posts.

The company tier list post really put the final nail in the coffin for me. The amount of entitled losers who think they deserve a 6 figure salary for their first job, work at a billion dollar company, while haven't contributed anything meaningful, while bemoaning how hard the market is for them, is crazy.

Newsflash, there exists other companies more than SP 500 companies, more than FAANG, more than a dozen some billion dollar companies in this country and in this world.

141tbrg,Rant: Is this career path just grounded on pure intelligence?,"I'm only a first-year CS undergrad, but I've been really considering switching career paths lately. The more I go through my CS degree, the more I've come across people who have such a *natural* knack for math and computational problem solving that it feels like however hard I study, I'd never reach their level of analytical competence. I emphasize natural here because it seems like their talent stems from something more innate than just having been coding since they were five. It feels like I've met a tonne of people who were just gifted with the 'right' brain for this career.

'Obviously,' you might retort. 'There are naturally gifted people in every career path.' I understand that sentiment, but CS feels different in that the industry depends more on competence/intellect than hard work/grit (e.g. Can you pass an interview of abstract programming problems? I could practice as much as I want, but after a certain level my brain just can't compute smt so abstract). In other careers (e.g",2023-06-05 21:57:15

Let me tell you that what you do in personal projects are not a good reflection of real world software engineering. I use to think by building simple crud apps I saw on YouTube videos was what software engineers do but oh boy i was wrong. The codebase is a lot more complex and there’s a lot of abstraction that goes into it. Also, you are working with other people’s code and when you try to implement a small feature like make xyz button it can get pretty complex since a small button is dependent on many other logical components in the codebase and sometimes modifying one code will require you to change every other code that is dependent on the original code. I think if you are a student currently and want to get a sense of what real world software engineering is like then try to get internships because that’s the closest you will get into what real world swe is like.

I tried solving 30 leetcode sums in one week, got hang of it but now again I'm afraid to start.

Plus, one of my friend got selected for GSOC and it's a huge deal so I dunno people expect me too to get into some big shot this summer. I tried getting internship, no luck. Just one company hr keeps saying he'll get back and all but still no response. 

So I decided to focus on open source contribution this summer along with learning Ai/ml but then I feel, I'm wasting a bit of time and need to solve leetcode too.

Anyways, when I was in college, graduating was my top priority. Because I would hear these horror stories of people deleting themselves after failing courses, being academically suspended, not being able to graduate, or finding studies too stressful, etc. But I have NEVER heard any such stories of people deleting themselves after the graduation stage because they were unable to find a job. Something seems to always work out for everyone after this stage.

And because of this, I never really prioritized setting myself up for job hunting as much as I focused on not failing. I thought that if I make it out alive through graduation, I can later improvise and focus on the next step. How bad can it be? No matter what situation you're in, there's always a fix right?

The worst part is nowhere in my degree I can learn about basics of linear regression or other essential statistics, since there are no courses covering that from the maths or computer science department. These are only taught fr",2024-01-02 11:38:38

Communication skills are key in interviews. It doesn't matter if you can code, you have to *convice* us you can code. We're not making you do obscure coding challenges. You have to speak to the technical details of your resume. Every constituent part of an interview is based on your ability to communicate.

First, most new grads have projects on their resumes. We want *details*. I already know what you did when you say ""Developed an API for my book club using Flask"", but I want you to tell me about routing, decorators, functions, modules. Tell us *exactly* what happens when we hit your API. Tell us about having to install flask-cors. Bonus points if you deployed it.

11msb47,I am SO done WitH LeEtcOdING,"Honestly, leetcode is soul-sucking (although this rarely seems to be a sentiment of someone who's actually good at leetcoding).

It's hard to gauge how well I'm doing. Problems will randomly be way, WAAY harder even within their own medium/ hard tiers. There's no clear way of knowing if I'm improving and it's really unsatisfying when I have to look up a solution.

There's always a problem every time I open leetcode that I just don't know how to solve. I'm all about the 'if I put in the effort, I will see visible progress/ returns every other week', but this leetcode thing doesn't follow this pattern. Yes, I have the discipline to leetcode every day, but it's hard to leetcode properly when I just don't care about it. 'Why try when I'm going to look at the solution anyways?'

Can anyone knock some hard truth into me? I guess I'm looking for motivation/ reframe my state of mind.",2023-03-09 13:33:51

I spent the past fall working on more research and applying to PhD programs instead of applying to full-time jobs. Now come February and it looks like I've been rejected from every program and also no responses whatsoever from the (very late) new grad job apps I submitted in January. Seems like with only 1 SWE internship back in 2021 on my resume, even graduating from a T4 BS/MS program and 4.0 GPA can't save me from my fate of being ghosted. The lesson here is that even if you are confident you'll get into graduate school, you should really still try to intern the summer before graduation or at the very least, recruit during the fall season when jobs are actually open.",2024-02-12 13:01:02

I’m an international student in the first year of my masters program and i’ve been searching for internships for up to a year. I finally found one that perfectly aligns with what I’m studying but my department has refused to sign my work authorization to let me work this job. 
Their reasons keep changing and what I’m being told now is that an internship is not required for the program, so they will not sign my work authorization. 
However, there is a course called graduate internship which I’ve enrolled for. But they are saying the course was just created to track international students who are on internships and not necessarily to give people the option to take the course if they wanted to do internships.

So I am going to be a junior this upcoming fall and struck out on internships this past school year. I was thankfully hired at a university lab at my school and worked for the past 8 weeks. However, I recently got fired for incompetence/lack of productivity.I am discouraged right now to tell you the truth. I feel as if a big reason as to why I did not get an internship this past school year was because my resume was/is blank and this research project would've given me something interesting to put on there. So my question for csMajors is, although I got fired - is it still worth it to put this research experience on my resume despite of what happened? Now that I have the rest of this month off before I go off to school I am grinding leetcode day and night, coding more, practicing version control, etc. It was good while it lasted.

However the public job statistics for CS at my school (good school in Europe) is that 95% of people are employed 3 months after graduation.

I'm currently a third-year student at a top 50 computer science school.

The real spark for my computer science journey came in 9th grade when I took an introductory CS class, learning Python and Visual Basic.

Throughout high school, I worked on various projects, from solving homework problems to automation and web scraping. In 10th grade, I got into data science with a project on estimating asteroid collision families in the Kuiper Belt using kNNs. In 11th grade, I started to use deep learning on a project on arrhythmia detection in ECGs using CNNs in PyTorch.

During the summer before my 12th grade, I secured a research internship at a university and even got a paper published on ResNets.

About to give up on SWE as a whole. This market ruined all my aspirations and I’m starting to despise the process. Expectations are so high that I barely get interviews, then I get to the interview and they have so many options that even needing assistance gets shot with disappointment. 

Writing this with tears in my eyes. I’ve always wanted to be a software dev since high school, I never knew it would be this bad. And it wasn’t a while ago. Talking to other industry professionals, 10 years ago the market was never like this since 2008. What happened to everyone “needing coders”

Did more LC senior year—rn I have 80+ easies and mediums but no hards, 100+ applications later got a new grad offer recently at a different F500 paying low six figures.

149natn,Leetcode is demoralizing,"I’ll be honest, I’ve never been the best with logic or algorithms. I graduate in December so I’ve been hitting leetcode hard in prep for interviews. 

I can solve most easy, some mediums and hards, but my code usually becomes a jumbled mess of trial and error before I figure it out. (If I do at all)

Then I go look at posted solutions and they’re elegant, 5 lines, and so far all of them have made me metaphorically slam my forehead on the desk and question why I didn’t think about the problem that way.

I know I’m probably not alone but damn! It makes me question if I’ll ever be a good programmer lol. ChatGPT is cool and all but I want to actually understand things deeply and now I’m realizing that I don’t , even after taking DS&A, discrete math, etc..

I wanted to show them that I had it in me and it wasnt just a fluke. I always dreamt of working for a big prestigious company and friday I finally got an offer which felt amazing. But only for two minutes. I worked so hard the past four years for this and freshman me would be stunned to know that I even got an offer. 

I just dont feel happy or as happy as I thought I would feel. This whole time I thought the reason I was sad was because I was disappointing the people around me and not living up to my potential but now that I did it, it didnt make me happy.

1498m6q,Walmart Global Tech Software Engineer Internship Summer 2024 Whole Interview Experience,"Hey there, here are steps I went through:

1. I applied it on May, 2023. Completed Assessment on same day. 

2. After 5 days, was asked for first round Zoom interview. It was technical questions from 6 different areas. I choose frontend, backend, database. Then for each area there are 2-3 small questions. Ex: website loading efficiency improvement. After 20 minutes, I got a 40 minutes Easy LC 2D array question on Karat, I was not asked to share the screen, but it’s timed. Seems like there’re more than 1 LC questions they prepared but I only finished 1. 

3. After 9 days, got second/ final round interview invitation. It was half technical half behavioral. Totally verbal, no coding required. Was asked about GitHub, Git, Team collaboration besides self introduction. The interviewer was really nice, after this meeting I wrote recruiter a thank you email.

4. Now waiting for result. 

Good luck everyone ;)

I have also been working on masters applications so a lot of my energy has been spent there. When I was applying very rigorously it felt frustrating and was difficult to get any responses from companies, I had only 1 interview, and I didnt move forward after 5 initial rounds. Also, I didn’t apply to 2023 new grad stuff during my senior year bc i was applying to grad school then too and then it just didn’t work out.

However, since I'm graduating this year, I've been worried about where I am going to be working after school. In the middle of the summer, I was scrolling through my emails and found a conversation from last year that I had with a recruiter from a company I had applied to the previous year. They told me that the position had been filled but that they were impressed with my application. My reply consisted of me thanking them for getting back to me and that I would be applying next year as well.

Although it was almost a year later, I decided to reach out to the same recruiter who sent the email and ask if they had opened their new grad positions. Surprisingly, the recruiter emailed me back",2023-09-11 22:01:36

As an example, hiring transparency - companies who hire by team instead of just posting a general SWE position on their career page which you apply and hope to get assigned to a team whose job you’re interested in. It feels to me like you’re getting a ticket to a yacht but don’t know where it’s taking you to. If you’re lucky, you may end up in Hawaii. If you’re not, Antarctica.

Other motivations I can think of are 1. Money 2. Prestige 3. Their “grand” missions.

* Apple - better return offer rates, better name value on resume (?)
* Meta - better location, better new grad pay, tighter community with other new grads within Meta campus

194xxz2,"This sub and CSCareerQuestions sub have become useless when it comes to real, practical advice to advancing career.","There's an enormous amount of doom and gloom posts that constantly reinforce the view that it is no longer worth it to pursue a CS degree and CS career.

This place was originally a site to come and get advice on how to prepare better for our career (e.g., learn X or Y resources, tweak resume in specific ways).

Nonetheless, it has been transformed into a ridiculous place that beats you down mentally. It is one thing to show and display how the market is not good, but other thing is to constantly make repetitive posts about how CS is over.

I think the best advice to anyone reading this and being affected by the posts here and other subs is to just visit the sites ONCE A WEEK. Then, you can come and sort by popular and as you wish and determine if the market has changed, if there has been any productive and beneficial conversation going on, etc. Coming here everyday does nothing to us and prevents us from actually moving forward in our life.",2024-01-12 15:38:00

i have been looking on reddit and glassdoor for some insights specific to ms and been hearing mixed stuff. some ppl say ms technical is free like no harder than leetcode medium, but ppl on glassdoor have been saying otherwise. do you think the questions will be any harder/easier since i got a direct final round interview ?

on that note it is also my first final round interview for any company ever. if yall have any advice in general or heard anything specific to ms i would love to hear it !

I've been borrowing tuition money from my parents (I don't make enough), failing classes (because I've been working), and my depression is the worst it's ever been.

A lot of people (including upperclassmen) have commented on my programming skill and all of the CS professors I've met have recommended that I take their higher level courses.

This makes me wonder, what the hell am I paying for? I'm drowning just so I can take (pardon me) f\*\*king Intro to Rock Music. There seems to be only two positive things I'll get out of college: networking and a magical piece of paper that stops employers from throwing my resume out.

I was telling my business major friend about this and she said oh why didn’t you do it with your friends ie do it together as a group and apparently, that’s how a lot of CS people in my uni do OAs and get past them.

I’m an introvert and don’t have CS friends and I do my OAs alone and don’t get past most of them.

I don’t care about making things for fun. The only thing I want to make is money. I will build something that gives me a job, I just need to know what it is.

**Walmart**

\- Better location imo (Sunnyvale, CA)

\- Better pay (not a big deal for me rn, but a plus)

\- Tech stack is probably more similar to what FAANG uses & looks for (I will probably learn a lot)

**NASA**

\- Offer is for a more niche tech area that I have extensive prior experience with (I'm not sure if I will learn as much, fewer transferable skills)

\- I've heard that a NASA internship might be more prestigious (better resume boost)

* There was code that was written by a previous intern that I was able to make faster by 15x (it took 30 seconds, I reduced it to 2 seconds) consistently. We benchmarked it and everything.
* I was also able to reduce our AWS cost by $5000 per month by moving things to AWS Lambda and implementing a tool that throttles resources on our product when it is not in use.

Both of my parents are surgeons, so I've always had a connection to the  healthcare field.

Having to revise a number of his pull requests I oftentimes found functions that didn't make sense, completely unused, massive blocks of code, and genuinely some of the worst, and most confusing architectural choices I've ever witnessed. There's little cohesion in his code, it's hard to work with, it's hard to understand, and generally, it doesn't really work very well.

Are there any fields that are still employable like computer engineering or AI, or should I take a gap year and reapply to do another degree like economics or actuarial science (or another if you have any suggestions)?

I’d rather take a gap year and wait another year to start university then to regret majoring in CS for the rest of my life.

I spent the rest of the day and the following morning reviewing basic technical questions, general behavioral questions etc. I felt pretty confident going into the interview. One thing to note was that when I went to re-read what the position was that I was applying for, it was taken down and I couldn't access my application as it was locked, which was a bit concerning.

It was a 30 minute zoom interview which was scheduled with the manager of the department I was applying for and 3 other engineers on the team.

What we do as engineers, is take in a set of requirements, interpret them in the broader context of our technical architecture, company bureaucracy, customer demands, relevant legal frameworks, etc. Then design and implement a cost-effective solution. Those without a CS degree will have an extremely difficult time doing this, especially given that the prompts you’ll need to do your job are steeped in the language of computer science and require an understanding of the code output.

But this class, Formal Languages and Computability, is perhaps the worst time I've ever had in a class. I nearly failed the first test and the tests are 70% of our grade. The teacher reads off powerpoints in a thick accent that I cannot understand even when I sit next to him and ask questions. New information seems to be brought into existence mid-problem without any explanation. Basic ideas are obfuscated by obscure mathematical notation. I spend hours on one problem in an attempt to better understand the content and never feel like I get anywhere. I have never tried so hard to pass a class and not felt like I made any progress.

1bluxc0,Is a bird in the hand really worth two in the bush?,"Hi. I am in a bit of a tough situation, and am curious what others think/would do.

Currently I am in between returning to Chevron in Houston as an AI/MLE intern, and going to Amazon in Seattle as an SDE intern. I interned at Chevron last summer and really enjoyed the area and the company culture, and the WLB was amazing. I made a lot of connections in and out the office and built a support system. So much so, I was able to get a return offer as an AI intern under the head of AI operations at Chevron (which is normally exclusive to grad students). This route would likely result in me receiving a full time offer.

On the other hand, my Amazon offer would pay (way) more than double what I would get at Chevron, and I think having Amazon on the resume would open more doors for me in the long run and I think I’ll grow more as a SWE. The risk is that I don’t know anything about what team I’ll be placed on, nor do I know anything/anyone in Seattle, and I’ve heard experiences vary HEAVILY base",2024-03-23 15:31:32

I've got a Microsoft Research internship in NYC this summer for 3 months, and I'm stuck between opting for corporate housing or taking a $10,000 allowance (taxed). Most advice on the internet is about Redmond and Seattle, but there's little info about New York.

I am most interested in the following.

1. **Location:** How far can the corporate housing options get from the main office? I don't drive and don't want to bike in Manhattan.
2. **Facilities:** Will there be at least a small fridge and stovetop? I was told not to expect a full kitchen, but I can't imagine living on take-out for 3 months, it's insane.
3. **Community:** Do they usually house Microsoft interns together, or is it random? Given that the housing is outsourced to some company called 3Sixty, they likely would be managing interns from many other companies. I'm curious about the social aspect and whether I'll be in proximity to fellow i",2024-03-28 21:49:10

I am a 2nd year Computer Science and Engineering student at UCI. It took me many years of doing nothing w/ my life to realize that I want to take my life and career more seriously. However, my 2nd quarter (of 3 quarter system) has ended and as I approach the next quarter, I feel that I am incredibly behind compared to my peers. I want to get into research for spring quarter to get some experience, but it's unlikely that I will get one since I should've ideally started the searching process weeks ago.

I want to get an internship during my junior year (and if not delusional, this year's summer LOL), but entering internship hunting season, I have absolutely no technical experience to make myself an appealing, competitive applicant.

I know the market is extremely unforgiving right now, and cold applying doesn't help your case, especially if you have no experience. I personally believe that networking is the easiest way to land your first internship/job. Reaching out to recruiters through LinkedIn or Handshake (if your school has that) is extremely effective. Also, cold messaging multiple engineers (I'm talking 30+. to even get a message back) at a company to set up a coffee chat is an easy way to get yourself a contact and a potential referral. You could also leverage this meeting as a chance to look over your resume and receive input on it.

I had a SWE internship freshman-sophomore year, and a less technical architecture role junior year. I feel like I’m a goner for my last summer before I graduate.

Last year or so I made a post about depression and being stuck in a rut during university (find it on my reddit username page).

I'm currently in my second year of the degree, and I'm having some trouble with the programming side. I had a mini assignment recently where I had to use containers, and I was clueless on where to start. I didn't bring it up in the practical because nobody else seemed to have any trouble, and it felt embarrassing being the only one not sure what to do. I tried catching my lecturer after the lecture and after he clarified some portions I just meekly responded that I understood because there were some other people waiting to ask questions. I felt I understood the concepts well enough, but when it was time to put it into practice, I had no idea what to do. I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to approach a situation like this.",2024-03-12 11:29:55

2: technical writer intern, not so well known but its a software company, local, $30/hr

i already accepted an offer for internship 1 a couple months ago but i just got an offer for internship 2 today. the thing that has me reconsidering is that 2's company has pretty good swe & other full time tech positions, its closer to family, but the intern position isnt really software focused. im thinking about interning there just to have that connection and maybe apply to be a swe afterwards (idk if having worked there would up my chances a lot), plus its close to family.

on the otherhand, for internship 1 the experience of being out of state and meeting new ppl/being in a new area for a bit sounds cool, and the position is more tech focused.

\- hopefully the economy will be better? (idk lol)

But since I'm not remotely passionate about the subject and can't see myself doing any of those things in my spare time, I wonder if it's counter intuitive for me to even consider majoring in CS to begin with.

Is one still eligible for it even if they graduate upto one year after the internship ends?

My current situation is that after the internship, I still have one year of studies left to graduate. But by taking heavier course load, somehow it can be completed in 8 months.

1bedv34,2030: Knowledge Breadth vs Depth,"With all the exponentially improving AI systems and sub-systems, we are entering interesting times which undoubtly will introduce significant changes to what skills are required. 

However, noone knows exactly which skills will be replaced/automated to what extent and when exactly.

2030 Scenario Summary:

* AI's Expanding Role: AI agents will become commonplace in most knowledge-based jobs by 2030.

* Human-AI Collaboration: Humans will focus on communication, supervision, and quality control of AI-generated work.

* Economic Uncertainty: The impact on the size of the workforce is unclear – more workers or fewer might be needed.

* Adaptability is Key: The pace of technological change suggests adaptability will be crucial. This might favor those with broader skillsets and comfort navigating shifting environments.


Based on those insights, maybe the BS + MS and/or BS + MS + PhD path may become less popular over the next decade and more people may go the BS + BS or even BS + BS + BS pa",2024-03-14 05:33:05

But seeing the current market conditions I don't wanna get into masters and have no work experience / job in the industry alongside.

I want to know the opinion of people living in Europe or those who know the market situation there for international people, will it be a better move to do a job here in my country offering a market competitive pay or leave for masters and try my luck to get a part time job alongside with my masters?

I'm currently in my second semester pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering in the US and will be graduating in May 25.

1. Welcome / coffee chat
2. Technical 1
Break
3. Technical 2
4. Job History
5. Team Overview

The welcome chat happened, 1 of the technical interview happened (went okayish). They rescheduled the other technical interview (they mentioned that the technical person was unavailable) and changed the order.

3. Job History
4. Technical 2

The Team overview was cancelled, they said they’ll do it if the team decides to move forward with me.

Job history - first half went pretty well. Second half a coding question was asked and I didn’t do really well. The interviewer said “Today didn’t really go well, it’s okay best of luck for your future interviews.” 

Post that interview round, I got an email from them saying that they will reschedule the technical interview 2 and Team overview interview to some other day if the team decides to move forward with me.

Here are my reasons for considering a PhD:

I have a choice whether to do my internship over 3 or 6 months. This would be my only internship before graduating.

I'm currently a MSCS student and received offers from JPMC and Veeva systems for summer internship. Salary details given below.   


Keeping salary aside, I've already worked at Morgan Stanley for few years and don't like going back to banking sector, but I'm pretty sure that JPMC will give me return offer.   


On the other side, Veeva systems looks like a decent company and pay is good for full time(although intern pay is peanuts).  My long term goal is to get into faang so veeva seems like a decent starting place, and also since I have Morgan Stanley on my profile I feel like adding JPMC might not add that much value compared to a tech company like Veeva.  


Also my role at JPMC is of a Quant and I don't think they get paid enough for their work life balance. form what I heard 4-5 yeas of experience will get you a base of around 150k in NYC whereas you can get up till 200k in Veeva or 300k in other tech companies.

Next semester I have a scheduling conflict where I may have to take a multivariable calculus course that doesn't use much of linear algebra(which I'm taking this semester). There are two options to take it, one of them expanding on the other with more linear algebra concepts.

  
Will that affect me in the future with data science if my knowledge in multivariable calculus is different?

I need advice for forming a plan to get into a big tech company (say Microsoft, Google, Nvidia and similar ones). 

I have a dream (since a long time) to work in a ""big tech"" company. I'm from a developing or a third world country and that just makes it more difficult to get a job at such a company (i think from my little research).

I'm a nerd and absolutely love to learn new things about tech. I'm in my second semester, doing Bachelors in Computer Science from a well reputed uni (but I'm always learning stuff on my own and am not reliant on university that much).

200 job applications, mostly targeting new grad/junior roles, got around 13 OAs, 7 interviews, 1 verbal offer (later told me the role was cancelled), and currently not a place to stay but moving around relatives' homes. 

Maybe I am not in the right mental place for job apps since I do not have a stable home, but the whole process is so draining and tiring as I can now barely hide my jealousness as my friends gradually started to receive job offers.

I’ve been doing pretty well in my other classes (even math which I usually suck at) but my two compsci classes have been ass. The one I took last semester had a lot of useless information (we didn’t even start coding). The one I’m currently taking is an intro to python class and he has only now started lecturing in person at week 9 of 14. We are insanely behind on the textbook and I am terrified for next semester as I feel completely unprepared for it, even if I stayed at this college.

Now I have 9 months of internship experience as a Flutter developer and in April I have my college exams (I'm pursuing a BSc in biology). Now I'm tired of doing internships and I want to do the job. Earlier in both of my internships, they wanted to retain me but both the startups that I worked in were very small and didn't have any team also the pay was very low ( $ 24.04 a month in the first start, $ 96.15 a month in the second startup) so I didn't take their offer.

Now as I had bad experience working in small startups, I want to work in a mid-level company (employees of more than 50) with 5 days a week (so that I can work on my projects) and I'm expecting a minimum pay of $ 360.55 a month.

But as the job market is very bad and for Flutter jobs are even much lesser so I should be this picky, but I can't go again for such startups where they will just pay me less than $ 120.18 and exploit me.

1bi1hbi,Should I take Linear Algebra Asynchronous or Synchronous?,"I’m planning on taking linear algebra in the summer semester, so it is a 5-week course. Because I’m not the strongest in math, I’m worried about how difficult the material will be. 

The professors teaching it have a 4.1/5 and 5/5 rating on ratemyprofessor. The 5/5 professor is teaching an asynchronous class and the 4.1 is teaching a synchronous, zoom class. I am still debating on which class I should do. Is it doable to learn linear algebra in 5 weeks self-study or would it be better to just do a zoom class? 

Additionally, I will be doing an internship during the summer. It starts halfway through the asynchronous class and ends at the later half of the synchronous class. I will also be traveling a lot during the asynchronous class, so that is something I am a little worried about (although if I try hard enough, I could get it all done before I travel).

Despite having enough programming experience (over 40 Ec) and meeting the requirements for Data and Information Modeling (both of which require a minimum of 12 EC), my stats course only covered 3 EC instead of the required 6 EC.

Additionally, while my GPA is just above 7, the minimum requirement is 6.5.

Given these circumstances, I'm seeking advice specifically on master's programs in Europe. Are there any universities or programs in Europe that might better align with my background and interests?

On the other hand I can do corporate housing but idk anything about the shuttle pick ups, or if i’m even going to have a parking spot available for my car (i’d take my car in this situation too because i don’t want my summer to just be me in the office and then back to the apartment).

I won't let Reddit decide it completely for me but y'all's input would be helpful! For context, Dell is in RoundRock and Goldman in Dallas and both are 12 weeks long. I don't care about the pay too much so that's not a factor that's playing a role. This is mmy internship after junior year so the most important in terms of full-time offer. I think I am concerned about the ""finance stamp"" that will be on me if I pick Goldman. Will it be easy to switch to tech after? I am uncertain and was hoping y'all could help.

I am a Ph.D. student, and time and again I have been fucking up some really good opportunities that I got especially in this competitive market. I am very grateful for having got those chances. But, I know that preparation is definitely low for me, and I only start a full on prep right before the interview.

My even bigger problem is that I don't remain calm and out of nervousness I really just eat my words and I do see myself slipping. You guys have to trust me that I have blown some really good opportunities, in interviews with good people (and in some cases big) from research divisions of Twitter, Lyft, MSR, Uber, Two Sigma, Amazon etc. Tbh even before Ph.D, during admissions I was at a waitlist of two top schools and I fucked up that interview because I got intimidated by the interviewer.

Hello,

I am a 3rd year CS student at a small private school in the midwest. I have ambitions to do my PhD at a top program, and I have been grinding research and papers for a couple of years now.

I'm fortunate enough to be offered two summer positions at different national labs. I am torn between the two.

Lab 1:

Pros:
- gets me a level 2 security clearance 
- research related to artificial intelligence for autonomous systems. In this case, path generation and forecasting
- many interns working together in one location to collaborate and build and whatnot
- potential to be reinvited and get grad school funded. Not quite as important since most phd programs are fully funded

Cons:
- more ""military."" My work might be used for drone strikes
- may result in publication, but I'm unsure if the work is classified or not
- Area is kind of dangerous 


Lab 2:

Pros:
- related to ML tasks on one of the world's fastest super computers

So, I started with the most restricted of the languages I mentioned, which is Regular. But the problem is that I don't really have a formal or actual definition of RQ, or L1 and L2 for that matter. The only thing I know is that L1 & L2 are regular and then I know the definition of RQ. So, how can I use the pumping lemma or DFA without the expression for RQ to for example prove or disprove that it is a regular language? I am drawing like boxes of models for DFA like in here:

[https://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/GREGGJ/CMSC515/chapt01/Regular.html](https://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/GREGGJ/CMSC515/chapt01/Regular.html)

1bra92s,Which offer should I take if I want to get into software engineering in big tech?,"Hello fellow cs majors, I finally got two offers after looking for more than a year! (Graduated in May 2023) I’m wondering if anyone has any insight for which offer I should take if I want to get into software engineering in big tech.

Offer 1:
Solution Analyst/Software Developer at Deloitte

Offer 2:
Mobile App Developer at small company

From what I’ve read online, it’s not a guarantee at Deloitte if I get actual dev/engineering work depending on the project, but going there would get the big name on my resume. Not sure how much that matters tho considering they’re not necessarily known for tech.

For the small company, I’m just not sure if doing mobile work will pigeonhole me. I like doing system design and working with backend services, databases, etc., and it doesn’t seem this company’s product does much of that. Without getting too much into it, it has to do with creating a network with multiple hardware devices and controlling all of them.

All advice welcome. Thanks!",2024-03-30 05:34:40

Happy to answer questions about my journey, replicating these results, or any other career advice!","Hey everyone! I'm stoked to be doing an AMA on here and appreciate the mods support with making this happen.

My name is Mark Benliyan and I started my CS journey at UCLA roughly 2 years ago. I grew up in an immigrant household knowing nothing about coding, the tech industry, or software engineering careers. I entered UCLA as a Psychology major planning to pursue Big Law, then switched to Business Econ to pursue Investment Banking. I learned about CS and the tech industry while at UCLA which pushed me to switch my major once again to Computer Science and Linguistics with dreams of becoming a software engineer.

Since then things have turned out far better than I could've ever anticipated. To help drive this AMA, I'll  include a list of all my previous experiences, chronologically, that I think could be of interest. Please note that I'm not doing this to boast in any way, I can still vividly remember having imposter syndrome myself and being unsure if I ""have what it takes"" to be an eng",2023-12-02 20:52:47

With the market being so oversaturated, companies have even more reason to pay employees less as there are more supplies than demand. What about senior devs? Think back to the Industrial Revolution. What happened to the skilled artisans? They got replaced by cheap laborers. Those laborers were paid very little because they can easily be replaced. Sounds familiar to the current job market?

I don't think it's because this company is ""racist"" or because south asian applicants are the only qualified. I think its ""hiring homophilia"": the tendency to overvalue or prefer someone who is similar to you.

Some do make six figures out of college but majority of students don’t. I’m surprised by the lack of effort that an average cs student would not get internships or do side projects. They just do well in school and has top notch gpa but yet struggle to land a swe role.

Because the amount of revenue software engineers generate is on par with an NBA player for example, and to take it a step further, compare the valuation of an average Big Tech firm with a major professional sports league, and you will see, even with the large number of employees, the ratio of value generated/per employee for these are very similar.

This is the case regardless of whether you applied as a Data Scientist, Researcher or a Trader, because both skill sets are required for the job.

As the title states, I’m looking for some advice as I am graduating in May and don’t really have any family or friends with experience in corporate jobs.

11z00fg,From zero to two summer internships in 24 hours - My journey and tips,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my recent internship search journey with you all. Since September, I had been applying to multiple openings every week but had not received any offers. However, things changed drastically in the past 24 hours, as I received two internship offers from different companies. Here's how I did it:

1. I kept my spirits high: Despite the numerous rejections I faced, I never gave up hope. I stayed positive and reminded myself that the right opportunity was out there for me.
2. I tailored my applications: Rather than submitting generic resumes and cover letters, I tailored each application to the specific company and job opening. This showed that I had put in effort and was genuinely interested in the position.
3. I networked: I reached out to people in my industry and attended networking events to meet new people. This helped me gain valuable insights into the job market and also opened up new opportunities.

They seem to think that the pay for SWEs is going to take a massive hit in the nearish future and unless you’re working on AI research or closely involved in the development of it, you’re not going to have much value as an engineer. 

For clarity, the phd in cs would allow me to grow vertically in the industry and stay competitive if a time comes where the average SWE is worth pennies on the dollar so to say or the law degree would allow me to branch out and be a middleman for tech legislation, especially as AI grows it seems likely there will be an increase in concern for liability and having both a tech and legal background could be very beneficial.

I am thinking of buying an iPad and have it replace my laptop. The pros I see is that I don't have to carry a notebook around for taking notes.

Furthermore, the device is light and I can carry it around effortlessly.

The downside, since I am a CS major, is that I  programming on an iPad is impossible, at least that's what YouTube told me. Sure, we have a lot of computer at my university and I could probably just practice and complete homework on them.

Is it possible for me to get into these universities for a CS major without having much CS experience? Will they understand how I switched really late?
Besides that, I have a good GPA and have good ECs, volunteering, and leadership. I just lack my experience in computer science. Do you guys have any ideas of what I could do in high school to increase my chances of getting into a university with a good CS major?

It feels like a teacher isn't afraid of anything. They can be as big of a d\*ck as they want, and its only the students who have to tolerate them. 

There are courses out there where the pass rate is 55%?

WHY!?

If a student fails, the teacher has to be questioned FIRST. It's the teacher's job to teach the student, if the student fails, it means the teacher has NOT TAUGHT THE STUDENT.  They have failed in their duty as a teacher. Or does the teacher have no duty?

Schools: Berkeley EECS Regents vs Harvard:

Intended major: CS but also very interested in BME, comp bio and physics

Quant jobs are at the back of my head too cuz of the $$$

I feel like I have a great personal fit with both colleges

Berkeley: (36k COA)

Pros:

1. EECS program goated, I don’t think Harvard cs is that good
2. Regents perks- housing guarantee, faculty mentor, research funding, peer mentors
3. Close to silicon valley + more industry rep than Harvard i think
4. Engineering at least what looks to me is considerably better
5. Salaries after graduation >>>>>>>>>>>>, placements at top firms

Cons:

1. Crimes
2. Crowded classes- at least initially
3. Fewer resources per student/ harder to get research opportunities
4. Grade deflation

Harvard: ( 25k COA)(friend told easy to negotiate it to even lower)

Tons of college grads are unemployed.

What they're not, though, are computer programmers.

Over the past 5 years, the country's tech scene is really building up w a handful of unicorns and smaller startups. I believe that unlike all the other careers in Colombia, being a programmer is not saturated bc it's not yet mainstream (even being a doctor is saturated in Colombia for context).

First post on this sub- I just honestly feel really lost and need some hope that there's light at the end of the tunnel. I did well in high school but when I entered college for CS, I just really lost myself in addition to doing bad academically (like HORRIFICLY BAD). Now I'm in the second semester of my third year and things are starting to get better- doing better in school etc but I'm just realizing how far behind I am now. I knew how important internships were coming into school and yet I hardly tried to get any. Now I'm about to enter my fourth year and have no SWE internship experience and even though I started applying this week, feel like there isn't much hope for me to get enough experience before I graduate (and it's incredibly unlikely I get an internship this summer anyways as most companies have closed their posting).

Hello there, recently I started a CS degree course, currently in the first year, second semester, and one of the issues I’m having is with classmates and colleagues constantly coming up to me saying that “I have this amazing idea, we should build and sell it”. I’ve had this exact line said to me a couple times in the last week.

Now I know collaborating with others is a great experience, and at the start of the semester I already started 2 projects with my friends for learning purposes and possibly to market with if it works. But recently some classmates and even old high school colleagues have asked about working on some project or business idea, and I have no time to dedicate to them because I’m trying to do my own personal project and building my own idea, as well as balancing it out with my course.

I am about to go to my third year of college at a decent university in California. I was originally enrolled as a computer science major with big scholarships and priority registration. In my freshmen year, I was extremely motivated and excited to learn about code. It wasn't until my spring quarter at the end of freshmen year where I really began to become hesistant on coding as a career. I remember being in a notorious weeder class and having to code almost every waking hour of my time as a student. Although I did like the aspect of problem solving when it comes to code, I began to question life and my sanity when I debugged for hours at a time. It felt like I spent more time debugging my code than I actually did writing. I remembered debugging so much that I genuinely appreciated going outside to touch grass and letting the sun hit my body. I just grew to resent code and debuggging the constant homework assignemnts.

I’m a current freshman, and thinking about applying for internships for the summer. The thing is, I don’t think I want to do one this year.  I’d much prefer to spend my summer with my family this first summer then be gone for the next few summers while I’m doing internships. I’m kind of far away from for college and I really do miss my family.  I can’t imagine being gone for even six weeks over the summer this year.

Am I shooting myself in the foot with that though?

17xig46,"If I can make it, you definitely can too!","I never quite fit the mold of a model student. Skipped through the easiest classes in college and barely scraped by with my computer science degree. LeetCode was a foreign concept to me, and algorithms felt like hieroglyphics. 

Despite my lack of enthusiasm for grinding through studies, Google gave me a shot. My interview was a comedy of errors; I confessed to not understanding basic functions in JavaScript. Yet, against the odds, I got the internship. During those months, Fridays were a write-off, and I sauntered into the office late, leaving early most days.

Surprisingly, I snagged a full-time offer at Google Cloud. This journey taught me that success doesn't always come from burning the midnight oil. Hopefully, those starting in CS can learn that it's not just about the grind; sometimes, it's about finding your own pace.",2023-11-17 16:08:48

bvte1e,"Sad and regretful, going to the University of Michigan as a Canadian After Being Rejected by Waterloo and Toronto","I just finished my first year at the University of Michigan and I honestly thought it would be better than what ended up happening. At the time, Michigan was my first US acceptance after being rejected by Georgia Tech and waitlisted by UIUC and I was super excited to get in and thought I should definitely go to Michigan because I want to move and work in the US after graduation and since I'd heard a lot of good things about the school. Michigan ended up being the only US school that I got into even though I thought I had a decent shot at UIUC/better schools; I ended up getting rejected from Berkeley, CMU, UCLA, USC, Georgia Tech, and UIUC. For Canadian schools, I got into UBC and another safety but was rejected by Toronto, rejected Waterloo computer engineering, and deferred to Waterloo Honors Math from Computer Science.

12wxy84,You Don't Need a 5-Year Plan,"Hi everyone! I'm a recent Berkeley graduate, who studied CS in undergrad and EECS in the 5th year master's program. I wasn't an obvious candidate for the CS department -- before I came to Berkeley, I had never taken a CS course before and knew almost nothing about it. I was a big writer and a huge fan of journalism. But I wandered into CS, and later into AI research at BAIR.

I wanted to catalogue my thoughts about that path -- which felt a lot different to me from the highly calculated (not in a pejorative way) grand designs of many of my EECS classmates. I wasn't guided by any kind of 5-year plan but by intuition and half-baked interests.

I wrote a piece about all of this (you can find it here [https://posttruth.substack.com/p/how-i-got-into-computer-science](https://posttruth.substack.com/p/how-i-got-into-computer-science)), and how it's shaped my views on making plans, constant goal-setting, and the need I feel to devise some grand design when beginning new ventures.

I want internships and work experience as an SWE so I can have a competitive starting salary when I graduate college to pay off debt etc (90k/yr since that's the average starting salary at my school).

Some major considerations:
1. Crypto industry and trading is down, and the crypto HFT firm’s profit has took a big hit in profits ever since.
2. I am super interested in quant trading myself, probably moreso than being an SWE. However, instability scares me - If crypto goes down and my firm goes down, I’m not sure how easy it is to a quant trader role in another firm considering how competitive the field is, and at that point it might be difficult to hop in to a big tech.
3. I do not have a big tech internship in my resume - only a few small tech startup internships and an internship at this HFT firm that offered me

I’m (F19) a CS and Math double major sophomore (going into junior) next year. Throughout my freshman year I’ve thankfully managed to maintain a GPA of 4.0 and was really happy about it.

My sophomore year however, the courses became a lot more difficult and demanding. Taking math and CS courses without any electives to lighten my load really took a toll on me and it showed on my GPA. I went from being a straight 4.0, to a 3.92, to a now 3.87.

Yes, I am aware that the GPA is still good. However, I put all my time and energy into my courses, which means I haven’t been doing any internships or personal projects. Every time a vacation rolls around, I’m either too burnt out to do anything, or I’m doing a summer semester and can’t really intern because of it.

Wouldn't even ask this question pre-covid or even during COVID. I would have jumped head first in this pool.

q1pbxk,How do people work at startups and manage to live in HCOL places like SF with only a $120k salary?,"This might be extremely naive but it's a genuine question I've been thinking about for going to work at a startup postgrad.

If we consider a base salary of $120k, then after CA/fed taxes you have about $79k left ([source](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-paycheck-calculator)). Assuming $3k rent per month in SF ([source](https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ca/san-francisco/)), that amounts to $36k towards rent, leaving about $43,000 left to spend on other expenses, or about $3.6k/mo for living expenses.

Even if RSUs are 60k a month as a startup these shares are essentially paper until IPO so that doesn't actually help you to live

Maybe my perception of the word is severely warped but $3,600 doesn't seem like that much to live on  if you also want to invest for the future and be able to pay for bills, etc, compared to working at FAANG where RSUs are guaranteed extra cash.

When I accepted my job for this school year, I was thinking that $20/hr is probably the best I can get as far as part-time jobs/internships go during the school year. All the listings I saw online for part-time work during the school year that paid >$20/hr were either lying about it being part-time, looking for people with a bachelor's degree, or were web dev positions (not my desired career/specialty).

Now, one could make the argument that the type of intelligence that lends itself better to quant trading is different than that of startup building.

I am leaning toward Apple because they haven't laid anyone off, and intern-to-FTE conversion rates are pretty high (from what I know). I am unsure about Google's intern-to-FTE conversion rates, and I know many amzn/aws interns haven't received a full-time offer yet. That's my logic for picking Apple. I have also talked to some team members, and they seem really nice, so I don't think I can go wrong with Apple. Please let me know if it's worth going for Google/AWS over Apple if I happen to get the offers. Thanks!",2023-12-22 04:17:01

16vs0we,Inside Look: How Hiring Really Works at Tech Companies (You Might Not Be Surprised),"Hey everyone,

I recently joined a unicorn company as a new grad SWE and got a peek behind the curtain at the hiring process, and was able to confirm/demystify some of the tech hiring myths I've been hearing:

1. **School Elitism**: It's real, and it's prevalent. Whether we like it or not, candidates from 'top-tier' schools often get prioritized. Sometimes, they're even fast-tracked straight to the final round of interviews if they go to one of the ""top"" schools and have a high GPA. In fact, my company is doing exactly that for interns and new grad candidates. I was lucky enough to be among those who got fast tracked because I went to one of their target schools. I was pretty confused about that at first because some people I knew from other schools who applied to the same position received OAs instead. After I joined the company, I found out about their target schools from an internal doc where they maintain a list of schools/programs they'd hire from along with some name-callings on ",2023-09-30 00:11:10

They said that since the whole family would be vaccinated (COVID-19 vaccination) by the time my current semester of university ends, we were going to spend the  ENTIRE summer in Hawaii by the beaches and resorts, partying and sightseeing and eating delicious food. 

My mom is a teacher and doesn't work over the summers. My dad has requested time off work and will only work for a few hours every week in the hotel at night. 

My parents have already booked the plane, hotel, resort, and various sightseeing tickets - these are very expensive and nonrefundable. They booked the tickets before calling me to tell me about the surprise, so I could not tell them I had an internship lined up and to not book tickets for me.

If I stay home to intern while the rest of my family goes to Hawaii, my parents will lose ",2021-04-17 23:45:31

* Accepted to Penn's MCIT (graduate ""bridge"" program for those w/o a CS background) for this fall

* I'm also interested in Cornell Tech's dual Master of InfoSys (Connective Media) program w/Technion in Israel.

* Would it be weird to get a master's at Penn (to get the programming skills) and then a second at UCB or Cornell Tech for a master's in info sci?
* The UCB scholarship is really, really attractive.

**Context**

* Background isn't CS, it's cheap, online, and I can study part-time to continue working so that's why MCIT fits.
* But not in a rush so maybe I can just skip Penn altogether? and wait a few more years to apply to UCB + Cornell—two schools I'm actually interested in. I don't care much for Penn tbh; I just need the programming chops required for UCB or Cornell. I also don't care for Technion.

I hear people talking about how you have to truly enjoy CS in order to do well at the schools I'm applying to (UT Austin is the big one).

As a freshman with already two internships under my belt, a personal project, a ton of awards and also, of course, a ton of programming experience, I told myself I'd at least get a coding challenge. Also, I'd heard that this program favoured minorities : as a south American woman, I thought that helped too. But nahh.  Edit: I am not implying here that because I am a minority that I would automatically get in, but simply that it would help, alongside the rest of my application, as per their little disclaimer that encouraged minorities to apply.

I was wondering if some of you had a couple minutes to quickly glance at my cv and tell me what i can improve on it and what type of experience I can add for next year (ie: make an app, get a more technical internship since both of mine were at research labs, etc).

Failed both midterms and need an 85 to get a B.,I go to a t5 cs university in the U.S. I'm taking an intro python class. Throughout the year I have continuously did things that are counter intuitive to my learning and now I am in a situation where I need an 86 on the final in order to get a B in the class. A C would be legitimately the worst possible because I would be inches away from losing my scholarship. An 86 doesn't seem terrible considering it's an intro python class but here's the problem the exam is this coming Friday and legitimately I only have a bare bones understanding of python and when I say bare i mean bare. We've had 10 homework assignments with 5 coding problems on it and the last one I did on my own without chat gpt was homework 2. It all started with an extreme amount of procrastination. I said that oh I'm just using chatgpt once I'll catch up but I never did and ever week I messed around and didn't focus and so now here I am.

What the fuck am I supposed to do with that? Live under a bridge and eat trash? Just so bezos can keep murdering his employees and spend all the stolen money from employees to brag about going to space? Hell no, I accepted a 25/hr offer from a small company and I’m very happy with my choice, this was the minimal I was expecting for as an active student, so fuck you Jeff!

Edit: I’ll give you some context, I’m from Mexico and the position offered to me by Amazon was Software Engineer Intern and the other offer from the startup was for a Junior Software Engineer role, the offer from Amazon was a slap in the face, not enough to even cover basic expenses, 4 rounds of interviews in English, asking me leetcode mediums all for nothing, sucks living outside the US, companies just want to take advantage of you and they believe you’ll happily take 2 bananas, 1 taco and 3 cents a day for a wage

I have recently pondered about the extent of the current slowdown in hiring at companies. I realise that there is still a global economic slowdown, and that with it, comes less hiring.

The key to unlocking this library's potential lies in AI-powered content recommendations. Reliance and Disney, both leaders in [digital transformation solutions](https://lancersglobal.com/solutions), can leverage this tech to personalize user experiences and keep them engaged. AI can also optimize pricing strategies and potentially lower subscription costs through targeted advertising.

17ht9vs,Thinking of creating a job board just for software engineers,"Before you say the last thing we need is another job board, hear me out. In my search for software engineering jobs, I found it very difficult to find jobs that met my search criteria: skill, experience level, and coding language. For example, I searched for remote entry level React Developer jobs on LinkedIn and GlassDoor and found everything ranging from entry level to senior level jobs, with a tech stack ranging from Ruby on Rails to PHP, with most not even offering remote as an option. So this meant I often had to search through hundreds of jobs, and read through long job descriptions just to find a single remote entry level react developer position. 

My idea is to create a job site just for software engineers which would allow me to make a number of optimizations in the job search process. In order to create a job, employers would have to select and provide information on the following  criteria. Job setting: the first thing employers would need to choose is whether the job is on",2023-10-27 17:52:00
17hhd44,Apple vs. Oracle FT Offer,"Hi, I'll be graduating this year with my bachelor's in CS and I've received 2 verbal offers for both Apple and Oracle, but I'm having a lot of trouble deciding.



Apple:

\- \~$150,000 TC (not negotiated yet)

\- San Diego

\- Full-stack web development on one of their video apps teams

\- Return offer, really liked my team this summer—great culture and WLB



Oracle:

\- \~$175,000 TC (no negotiation, final)

\- Santa Clara

\- Cloud infrastructure team, more backend and distributed systems related

\- New grad offer after interviewing, but I didn't get to know who my exact team members/hiring manager are. They told me they would let me know 6 months before my start date



I'm leaning towards Apple because I really liked the senior engineers and manager on my team, but at the same time I'm worried that taking a full-stack web role will limit my career in the future—this position specifically is a lot of frontend, and I'm concerned jobs for this field will dec",2023-10-27 06:35:33
17gyzxr,Should I Request an Offer Renegotiation?," I have two offers on the table.

1. Walmart Global Tech in Bentonville, AR. TC $95k (excluding bonus + sign on), or $107k with maximum bonus. RO from this summer, love my team / manager and it'll be with them again.
2. CoStar in Richmond, VA. $115k TC, no stocks/bonus but bi-annual reviews with promotions.

I think my heart wants Walmart, I love the area, love my manager/team/etc, but my brain wants CoStar because the base salary is $115k (6-figures) and Richmond is Beautiful. Plus, my career goal is to retire around age 35, I'm only 20 and will already be making solid money, so starting off at $115k will help when looking for my next role in \~1.5-2 years. 

I've already signed the Walmart offer and have yet to sign the CoStar offer.

This sub has helped alot in being able to understand the ecosystem of cs students, here is my top advice for everyone

\-Improve your resume, too many times i've seen a cs student with 0 projects on their resume

\-Join a school organization (recruiters love it), there is bound to be a cs club or org at your school and if theres not than you could be the one to start it!

\-Maximize linkedin, too many people simply have a basic linkedin, make one that stands out and don't be afraid to message recruiters.

\-Its a number game, don't focus on the idea of FAANG and 6 figures. Apply to local companies if possible.

\-Some helpful resources to help anyone who is struggling are these github pages updating on positons:

I’ve talked to my parents about it, and they seem to think that it may be a mistake to switch, as you don’t need a computer science degree to get a decent programming job. They think with would be better for me to have the “engineer” title to be more versatile and to show that I could work with hardware if the company wanted me to. But like I said, I don’t think I would ever pick a job where hardware would be a factor, as I simply wouldn’t enjoy doing it as a career.

tnoxiz,If you had to become a software engineer without a degree,"Ok, so I have (kind of a loaded) question to people who are pursuing their Comp Sci degree. There’s obviously a big push for software engineers to be obtained by companies through bootcamps and/or people who go the self-taught route. I went through the “traditional” route of getting a BS in Comp Sci, but I’m curious to hear what people think about their majors? Do you think it’s super vital that you need to go to college in order to be a good developer - or is it more of a societal pressure to get a degree in order to seem like a legitimate candidate for the industry? And if you do think your degree is really important, what specific classes do you think you’ll use when you are working in the industry? What percentage of classes are relevant to what you’ll be eventually doing during your day-to-day?

The reason I’m asking is because I want to know what people’s perception of the industry is based on what they’ve learned in school. If you’ve had an internship before, you’ve probably got",2022-03-25 15:53:23

I understand it's just a community college, not Harvard, MIT, or even a state university. Also, I've never taken CS classes at a state university, but I will be starting this Fall. I've heard that it's pretty much the same situation at **some** universities, depending on which one you're attending.

However, the tech industry is constantly changing, with new programming languages coming along, new frameworks being used, and more platforms to develop on. On top of that, we have a billboard on the interstate that reads, ""University-quality Computer Science courses, for a fraction of the cost.""

With all of that out there, I wanted to say that I learned much more programming from courses on sites such as Udemy than I have taking about 2 years worth of programming courses at the community college.

I'm a junior that is attending a school that is fairly well known in general, but doesn't have a good reputation in CS. I've started applying to places from the beginning of the month, and I've applied to around 50 places now. But I literally have zero responses - auto rejected by 10 places, getting only OAs from companies that automatically send them, and even then no response after that. Now I'm starting to worry that I might need to think about the worst case.

Has anyone got zero offers going into the summer after their junior year? What are the options if I literally have no offers?",2020-09-17 04:22:53

I realise that I  don't mesh with the department of my school that well but they're the closest and most reputable college in my area because I didn't want to spend more money getting a dorm elsewhere. 

I medically withdrew for this semester.  

The online computer science program at Troy university  takes 36 hours of course hours,  plus I won't have to be as mentally screwed as I've been so far sense attending this university. 

However, I'll miss this university due to its connections through internships, everyone is familiar of the university and I feel like I'd regret not being able to physically talk to my professors or classmates. On the other hand, I've never had a close relationship with either groups of people. I've been  humiliated a lot in school, made fun of by TA's etc.

e8zpqm,Atlassian vs. Box Internship,"Hi, sorry for another summer 2020 internship decision advice post but I’m genuinely having a difficult time comparing these two companies! 

Here’s an overview of my thoughts so far.
- They’re both in the Bay Area & housing stipend is the exact same 
- Atlassian has a higher intern pay, but my research right now indicates Box will have a higher new grad TC
- Both seem to have high return offer rates
- Box lets me pick the exact team I will be placed on (of the ones that haven’t been chosen yet by other interns, and there are a lot available still) 
- They both seem to prioritize a great WLB and open company cultures
- I thought Atlassian was more “known” in the industry, but I found that a lot of people respect Box as well
- I don’t particularly have a greater attachment to either company’s product

It got me thinking, if I have two internships and do a big personal project before I apply, I would have a shot at getting an internship at a big tech company the summer after my junior year.

This is about having an irregular schedule more than being low on time or low on energy/motivation/sleep   
This is how I would deal with irregular schedules  
1- change your workout split to an A B split meaning only 2 workouts

2- each of these days has 1 main movement

3- choose two secondary exercises

4- choose some tertiary exercises

5- split your schedule to two parts one for strength one more focused on size

6- for strength do 1 top set of 5 reps leaving 1-2 reps in the tank then drop the weight by 10-15 % then do an all out set  
7 -for size do 2 sets of 8-12 reps all out

I made a small handwritten pdf if anyone wants it and I made it into something that looks like an actual schedule

The common but fair criticism for most of Leetcode is that they are absurdly theoretical and the interview system is better off if interviews were practical. I agree but then I fuck up OOP, which is supposed to be my bread and butter. This question could totally be a real feature to make OTJ.

I just couldn’t organize all the information so fast or fully understand the question yet and it’s edge cases. I kept getting confused on how to organize information into my objects and at first couldn’t understand what was the purpose the methods the questions wanted me to implement. It just felt weird to me.

The question doesn’t require those typically annoying algorithms, it was straight. I just kept getting confused.

cph7vd,Feeling a little behind here... Need some help!,"Hey folks!

I'm an incoming freshman going to the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Move in is less than a week away and I'm excited to get started on my career path towards software/cybersecurity engineering.

Trouble is... I'm not sure where to start. I have a few internships under my belt and I'm familiar with front-end development, GitHub, and Python, but what I'm really hoping to do is learn in-demand skills and land an internship that can really help me reach my goals.

I've heard a lot about leetcode and other resources that can get me there, but I'm not sure what that is or where to start. Am I too early maybe? Should I wait until next year to get started on internships?

Thanks in advance!",2019-08-12 19:25:33

I would have thought companies only call when they want to give you an offer, but the wording (""feedback"") and the fact it's post-final round so they don't have too many candidates to call is making me think it's a rejection?

It’s hard to reject a good paying offer letter that you worked hard for, haha. I’m sure someone can relate to it. Working in a SWE company that’s super chill at working hours, I think is doable. 

Also, it’s a smart way to seek more knowledge and make great money, I guess. I don’t know if it’s legal to work? And I’m sure IRS doesn’t really care during end of the year tax return.

Take my dad for example: he got his masters from a random school in China and completed his masters at the university of newfoundland, yet, he is currently works for a very big company (Microsoft, Apple, Google). He told me that many of his coworkers never went to top schools, instead, a lot of them just went to normal state universities.

But then I got to thinking about it......is it really possible to have a GPA above 3.0 if you have F's in your transcript? What if you get a D? Do students still repeat the course for a higher grade?",2023-10-22 14:34:28

15ehoa0,advice for incoming cs freshman looking to land offers in quant or swe,"so i'm an incoming freshman at a US college and I'm looking to build up my resume and start preparing for internships/career stuff. A bit about my high school background: it's mostly split between competitive programming and AI/ML research. I have some decent (nothing crazy) competitive programming awards such as Codeforces Expert rating (peak 1720), USACO Gold, and some local programming contest that I won. For AI/ML, I have two research projects that I worked on with university laboratories. My research ended up getting published at decent venues (for a high schooler). I mean they're solid places, but like a graduate student would be expected to do much much better. 

So that puts me in my current position. I'm looking to really build up my resume to be successful with landing some sort of internship this summer.

I live in Boston, and I love the campus.
I will be taking CS courses that undergraduate students take at Harvard College because my undergraduate degree is not in CS. Also, because I fell in love with CS50.
I can sit in classes such as CS51 and learn for free. I do not like online learning very much, even though I can do it.
For some reason that I do not know, I am very happy being on the Harvard campus. I never tell anyone that I go to HES. I am quiet, shy, not self-promoting, and tend to enjoy everything alone.

You do very little comp sci in your whole college career. Most of the CS you do learn is theory, which is important don’t get me wrong but since we do very little CS you aren’t getting what you need to get basic a job.

Plus I don’t think I Calc 3 and Quantum Physics should be required for a CS major (these are actual current requirements at my university).

2) It’s hard and time consuming!

Nowadays, most students in competitive computer science degrees want to do 3 to 5 internships before graduating, and some even do 6; at this rate, doing 4 internships, 4+ projects, and 200+ LC, will be the bare minimum in 2 to 4 years to be hired for mediocre pay.

I'm not saying it's bad in any way, but as I mentioned earlier with the auction example, it allows ""employers"" to raise the bar for hiring new grads.

So I talked to few of them and I realised, everyone's response was totally different. I'll summarise :
1) Internships in vacation are great. The name of a big tech company in resume gives you an edge during interviews cause it's difficult to get into those companies. Working for a startup too shows you know a lot about your field.
2)Just practice leetcode everyday instead of internships cause cracking the coding round is the biggest hurdle. Internships won't matter at all if you don't get to the interview round. Instead learn more skills and highlight projects in your resume instead of experience.

Both the BA and BS in CS students take the same courses with the same professors together if they share the same classes together which they 80% do.

It seems that I never fulfilled the math requirements which was Calculus 1 and 2 when i was at my CC, the",2023-10-17 15:23:53
172k84e,I'm actually enjoying majoring in CS way more than I thought I would,"I'm still fairly early in my program, but I'm actually really enjoying it.

Before going to uni I had a couple programming classes, one in high school and one in community college. My high school one was worthless. We were *supposed* to learn python, but I don't think our teacher even knew how to use it (she didn't even know you had to create a .py file to save your code... we wrote everything in the shell). It was basically a free hour for us. When I went to community college, I took another Python course, actually learning the basics this time. But the course wasn't structured very well and in turn I struggled to understand some basic things. Honestly, I thought maybe programming just wasn't for me.

Fast forward a few years, I realized that virtually nothing else interested me career wise. So I decided to major in CS since it was one of the few subjects I didn't loathe. But now? Now I'm actually enjoying it. We started with Python but it went more in-depth and things were structured",2023-10-07 23:30:41

I've been very fortunate to receive offers from both Meta and Netflix. However, I already accepted an offer from Microsoft because I hadn't heard back from Netflix or Meta at the time. Should I renege Microsoft for either Meta or Netflix?

*I want to base my decision on these factors:*

* **Resume value of company**
   * Would internship at Microsoft vs. Meta vs. Netflix be pretty comparable in terms of resume value?
* **Intern conversion rate**
   * Is it worth it to renege for a lower return rate company (i.e. Netflix or Meta) - if I don't get a return, will the higher resume value get me in the door for companies of similar caliber as Microsoft?
* **Full time employee compensation**
* **Possibility of high-impact work**

Hello everyone,

I am currently pursuing my Master's in the US and am set to graduate at the end of 2024. My goal is to land an internship at a FAANG company during the summer of 2024, ideally transitioning to a full-time role post-graduation.

However, before starting my Master's, I accumulated 2.5 years of work experience in the industry before (in Australia and Vietnam). I've heard from some peers that internships, especially at top-tier companies like FAANG, typically target undergraduates or those with little to no professional experience.

Here are my concerns:

1. Will my prior industry experience of 2.5 years reduce my chances of securing an internship?
2. Do FAANG or similar companies have policies or preferences against hiring graduate students with prior work experience for internships?
3. Would it be more advisable for someone in my position to apply directly for full-time roles instead of internships (Even though it's almost a year and a half before I graduate with my m",2023-10-08 04:17:14

16bnnu7,How I learned the simple way to code in Java,"Hi everyone,



I'm a beginner programmer who recently learned how to code in Java. I want to share my learning journey with you and give you some tips on how to learn Java the simple way.



\## Why I chose Java



I chose Java because it is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world. It is used to develop software, web applications, mobile applications, games, and more. It is also an object-oriented language, which means it allows you to create reusable and modular code.



I also chose Java because it has a lot of resources and support available online. There are many tutorials, courses, books, videos, podcasts, blogs, forums, and communities that can help you learn Java from scratch or improve your skills.



\## How I learned Java



I learned Java by following these steps:



1. I started with the basics. I learned the syntax, data types, variables, operators, control structures, arrays, metho",2023-09-06 15:45:57

I've heard a degree is mainly to demonstrate you can stick to somethin for 4 years? A decent amount of my courses overlap with CS however, I don't need to take chem/physics and other weedouts, and I have much more free electives available than if I chose cs, (alot of my 40+ AP credits from HS would be wasted If I chose cs.)

So should I bother changing my major to CS or should I just more 'easily' and 'quickly' complete cmda and build up my resume with relevant internships/projects? (cs/cmda participate in the same career fair thing at VT)

When I used to do game dev, I had to use alot of math to code the game, and had to do ""creative thinking"". 

We all know how complex games can be, and while doing game dev, I came across alot of theoretical concepts that I never ever thought of before. However, I left game dev because I see no future in it.

  
Now that I've left it for a while, I literally forgot most of that mathematical and creative thinking I once had. How do I gain that back? 

  
Should I do one or two LeetCodes everyday? Is there a specific type of math I should study? Or should I let it go and be okay with the fact that I became rusty in that knowledge?

Due to my limited knowledge and lack of guidance, I thought that was sufficient.  
  
However, after graduating I soon realized the reality when I started interviewing for jobs. Employers asked me leetcode-style questions (because I had mentioned using C++ in my projects and in skills sections), which I clearly wasn't prepared for. These job opportunities paid very well, while others that didn't ask such programming questions offered substantially lower salaries.

After numerous rejections, I finally managed to get to the technicals for this one company, which was an OOD Question, and there was a property of objects in Python that I didn't use. The interviewer briefly mentioned that my implementation was a bit different from what they were going for, but since they didn't make a big deal out of it I didn't think too much of it in the moment-now that I'm thinking back, though, I think I colossally fucked up by not using that feature.

On the bright side, the solution that I came up with had optimal time/space complexity, and was correct. I also think I did a great job explaining my thought process, explaining the tests that I would write-I also solved the follow-up perfectly, and had 10 minutes left over for questions.

16ved1g,They rejected me without even looking at my resume (Wellfound),"This happened on Wellfound (the job website catered to startups).

As per my understanding, the application process on this site is different from most sites. You create a profile, and then when you apply to job, you simply have to send a message to the company about "" What interests you about working here? "".

And then if they like your message, they accept it and look at your profile (which acts as a resume)? At least that's what I think. There's no option or prompt for attaching a resume when you make that initial message.

I applied to one company and complemented them on their work. I said I thought it was interesting and would like to be a part of it. Just within 2 hours, I got a rejection message. But when I looked at my profile stats, it looked like they didn't even look at my profile. The last view I got on my profile was from more than 8 months ago.

A careful literature review revealed that the biggest perceived skills gap by industry were soft skills such as professionalism, teamwork, communication, and project management (Akdur, 2022). Further, some hard skills such as software maintenance were also identified as pain points (Dobslaw et al., 2023).

I immediately accepted a return offer (they only gave me 10 days to decide) for 114k in august to work for a government contractor in the DC metropolitan area (hybrid, would be living at home to save money). Honestly I initially felt excited and relieved with finishing the job search, especially since I know the WLB is pretty chill and that I’ll be graduating debt free due to the generous financial aid i received from school.

But part of me is also angry for not pushing myself to look for other job opportunities with higher TC. Most of my friends and people I personally know constantly talk about their FAANG+ job offers with 200-300k TC, and I feel like I should have pushed myself to try to get a higher paying job.

I’m not talking about AI taking over software development. I don’t believe will happen anytime soon.

I’m not talking about using copilot to generate code either. That is a tooling change. It is the same to software development as it is to all other types of works. 

I am thinking about how software engineers can more actively take advantage of the rise of AI, and potentially better position ourselves on the job market. I can imagine a future in which most apps will integrate with AI to some extent. And it is software engineers’ job to implement this. So the AI related features will be a specialization in software development, similar to frontend, devops etc today.

Hey guys. So this is my third time trying to get at uber. I received 3 times for a software engineer II position. But i never passed at the first round (live coding interview).

This was the feedback i received from my last interview:

Pros

* Seems to have some knowledge on the Kotlin language

Cons

* Candidate didn't code much during the session, and was not able to think about a solution for the problem
* Didn't ask much questions about the problem
* Communication was a issue too, as I needed to constantly push him to speak something and share what he was thinking

Conclusion

The candidate had extreme difficult during the session, not being able to code much. He was not able to even start creating a logic to solve the problem. After a couple of minutes, I started to give several hints, and at some point, I clearly described two ways to solve the problem, but even with that info, he was not able to code much.

TLDR: I’m worried that the Computer Science classes for a BS degree are too advanced for my current level of understanding and I’m wondering if I can learn the basics from a CompTIA A+ book or other resource.

Wall of text version: Last year I decided to earn a degree in computer science, with the ultimate goal being to work in cybersecurity.

Hi, I am a junior year computer science student from a 3rd world country. All my life, I wanted a career that is designed in pure meritocracy.

I thought about joining academia first, but then I realised that you need to lick the boots of some well-known professors, if you want to get admitted to top school from no-name school. Even if you do great work, your connections is that matters to get your work published. So I thought software engineering career would fit me too. One of the most important requirement is to solve leetcode type problems. Which demanded hours of work to be put. I like this approach since all my hs life was to solve as many problems as I could before the day ends to get one of the top universities. And before that it was highschool.

12ub4t6,Computer Engineering vs. Computer Science,"I realize this is basically all speculation, but with AI becoming better and better at coding I can see a future where either a) there is infinitely more code in the world as a consequence of AI making coding much easier/faster, or b) it takes fewer developers to produce the same code, and there will be less jobs for CS grads in general. Given this, would switching to Computer Engineering be a safer option?

Hi everyone

With the rise of AI, which IT jobs will become irrelevant? For example will coding become irrelevant?

I'm asking this question so I can know which subject of computer science I should focus on. Also can I become a data scientist/date engineer or do something with machine learning with an applied computer science degree?

I know for coding people will bring the argument, that people will still have to check the code the AI/program made, but the amount of people needed for coding will be way smaller because you don't need the actual coders anymore. So will IT jobs will the demand still be great enough that I will be able to find a decent job quickly.",2023-03-07 22:27:45

We could work with one partner but anyone I tried to work with wanted to just sort of split the work so we'd miss out on part of the learning of the project. 

And they just sort of bailed soon after the beginning anyway for one reason or another. I'm used to spending 60-90 minutes trying to work through a point where I'm stuck and then be able to reach out somewhere for help but then that was just not allowed. I risked getting in trouble.

I have ended up with a FAANG offer, which is not bad, but I do not see why many people consider this salary remotely good and/or ask me to stop complaining given my past: I have done many, many final rounds for quants, and have previously interned at two quant firms, so I know my rough capabilities. The truth is that my salary is less than half of what students, who were much worse at the internship performance wise, and were simply 0.0001% better at talking and not requiring visa sponsorship, are getting -- and this enrages me.

15wdfec,A question from a highschooler,"I'll try to sum everything up as quick as posible. 

So I'm still 2 years away from college but I'm planning on majoring in cs. I'm from a fairly poor country so PCs and just tech in general is quite expensive for most people here. I'm saving up money to buy a laptop before I go to college but there's something that's kind of bugging me. I've heard that MacBooks are the best for cs majors but the thing is I want to use my laptop both for college and games and a Mac is definitely not made for gaming (+ I heard that professors make fun of students with Windows??? I don't wanna deal with that). So what I wanted to ask is whether a mid-range (or slightly better) laptop would get the job done? (I prioritize my studies so if it's really that big of a difference I'd get a Mac I just don't want to make the wrong decision)

I'm just feeling very down, and I needed to talk. 

I'm an international CS major at a well-known Liberal arts college.But, I guess my original sin was coming to this place in the first place. I had an offer from an HBCU in Washington who send tons of people to FAANG. I have couple of friends over there, all of whom intern at such places. However, the college I'm at currently offered me 12,000 USD more in financial aid, which is why I decided to come here. Looking back, I shouldn't have done that.

I feel like I have a decent resume, nothing too special, however I believe it does show that I know what I'm doing. Got an SWE position at a small company my freshman summer break, did a part time SWE job my sophomore year, and got another SWE position at a small company again for my next summer break.Also have decent projects, nothing groundbreaking, but still something that shows that I know how to find my way around.

tl;dr FGLI CS freshman @ HYPSM needs a plan to get better at the skills necessary to be a great SWE (problem-solving, coding, efficient solutions, developing projects, etc.)

  
From a young age, I always knew I wanted to work in tech -- I built my first computer when I was just a little kid with my cousin, and my love for video games/online communities just skyrocketed from there. I did a little coding here and there, but nothing of substance. Fast forward now, I'm a FGLI freshman majoring in CS at HYPSM and I am just beyond overwhelmed.

I am trying hard in classes, but I know that it is not enough. I've taken the AP CS courses in high school, done well in them, and have also taken my school's introductory CS class, but I still feel like I'm an incompetent programmer/CS person. To that end, I am reluctant to take higher-level CS courses, but I know next year that I will have to. My goal is to work as a SWE at a HFT firm.

Spent five minutes coding up a solution and it passed all but two cases - an I literally know how to optimize the solution to make the rest pass as well. Lesson learnt that if it seems way too hard it’s probably a brute force. But also, can people stop calling everything “leetcode hard” when people ask about OAs just because they can’t solve it?

164snv7,On Honesty - A Different Take on Disclosing You've Heard an Interview Question Before,"Hey folks,

So I jumped in on that [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/163l8os/comment/jy5wwfb/?context=3) about telling the interviewer if you've heard a question. I got a bunch of downvotes, but hey, different strokes for different folks, right? The majority seemed to lean towards not disclosing, and I get it. If your main goal is to get through the interview, then sure, keeping mum might be the way to go.

But here's my take: I'm looking at this from a more holistic view of being a working professional. It's not just about acing the interview; it's about setting the stage for the kind of working relationship you want.

Being upfront about knowing a question does a couple of things. First, it shows you're honest. That's a big deal in any job, not just the interview. Second, it breaks down the 'us vs. them' vibe that can happen between interviewees and interviewers. You're not just trying to 'beat the system'; you're trying to engage in an authentic convo about the wor",2023-08-29 20:00:30

Thus even if I get a RO from them I probably would still want to go somewhere else.

I'm currently thinking my options are:

1. Try grinding for grad school and get a masters so I have more time for Internships --> RO. Unfortunately, I have very little research or connections with professors so it would be an uphill battle to acquire those in time as most people going to grad school already have research/connections.

2. Thug it out and apply to jobs as NG which seems a little bit like suicide in the current market.

I've been programming since I was in 7th grade, and have dabbled in several areas of CS. I'm into web development, have written an operating system and some hardware emulators from scratch. I have also implemented some networking protocols from scratch, and done some projects related to machine learning. I'm also into graphics stuff, and have written a 3D game engine from scratch. Right now I'm learning about compiler design and I plan on writing a compiler from scratch in a few weeks. 

I'm pretty good at solving LeetCode too, having spent some time doing competitive programming. Most of the questions from popular lists (like NeetCode 150) look very solvable to me. I'd say I have a fairly intermediate and decent expertise in languages like C, C++, C#, Python, Java and JavaScript, and I'm getting better at Rust too.

One is that the kind of boilerplate programming is going to go the way of the assembly language went back in the day of something where it is mostly specified by, at a higher level, you know, you start with natural language and turn it into a computational language.

11b8rih,Can an internship or internships cause someone to be pigeonholed?,"Preface: I am a sophomore and I'm probably most interested in a developer role after graduation.

If I can get an internship role that involves programming in another sub-sector of CS (i.e., cybersecurity, DevOps, etc.) but is not a full fledged SWE position, should I be worried about being pigeonholed? 

It seems many CS majors aim for software engineering/developer internships because of future goals, but is it a negative to do something that might have a mix of other things?

I'm currently a high school senior from Seattle and I have a strong foundation in computer science. I'm interested in finding a summer internship opportunity that would allow me to build on my knowledge and gain valuable real-world experience.

However, I'm not sure if there are a lot of internships out there for rising college freshmen. There's one from Microsoft called the Discovery Program which I'll apply for but it's very competitive and I'm not sure I'll be accepted. Are there any other programs or internships for the summer targeted toward my age group that you guys know of? I'm open to exploring a variety of options and would be willing to travel outside of Seattle for the right opportunity.

I, myself, don't go to a prestigious school. I did take over 200 hours of courses on Udemy. I didn't mindlessly watch them for the certificate, but really focused on the info, followed the hands-on projects, and continued with personal projects on my own.

During my freshman year in college, I applied for a security researcher role at a startup.
The CTO of the SU who interviewed me asked me why he should hire me instead of more advanced students or new grads.

My answer was simple: ""Judge my knowledge"".

A few weeks ago, months into my role at that company, I asked him about that. He said I came to this interview light years ahead of every other student, new grad, and bootcamp grad in regards to my knowledge.

What they have told me is I should do a Masters in CS at a relatively cheap uni so I can stay there under the E3 Visa and eventually get a greencard following that route.

I’m a junior CS major will be working for a FAANG (the zon) company this summer.

I was wondering what companies exist that I could work for in the health sector. 

I have heard that bioinformatics prefers MS/PhD students, and I was more so leaning towards companies that build health software. 

For example, Flatiron Health. I got rejected from them recently but want to try again for new grad.

I’m also interested in sustainability and how tech could intersect it

What we do as engineers, is take in a set of requirements, interpret them in the broader context of our technical architecture, company bureaucracy, customer demands, relevant legal frameworks, etc. Then design and implement a cost-effective solution. Those without a CS degree will have an extremely difficult time doing this, especially given that the prompts you’ll need to do your job are steeped in the language of computer science and require an understanding of the code output.

The coding stuff usually isn't too awful, but all the theory stuff is PAINFULLY boring. I don't care about ""big O"" or algorithms or whatever. That shit is awful and totally unnecessary 99% of the time. In the real world, it doesn't matter if your shit runs 0.004 seconds slower because you didn't use the optimal ""big O"" thingy or whatever. I refuse to do leetcode or look for internships for this reason. I just wanna pass my classes and make the fatty bucks. Nothing more, nothing less. Anyone else with the same mindset as me who pulled it off? No disrespect but if you're some ""big O"" or algorithm nerd, please don't respond. We simply have nothing in common.

1bnmk83,Is it worth learning turbo c++ in 2024 ?,"Hey reddit!

I think this is my first post here and as english isnt my first language so kindly ignore my mistakes. 

So my intention of making this post is to ask whether I'm wasting my time learning turbo c++ or not.

so I've just enrolled in a university for CS and there's this important course called fundamentals of programming where our teacher who isn't that bad of a teacher is teaching us programming but he's using turbo c++. I'm no expert but after some digging about turbo c++ I've come to a conclusion that this language/editor is extinct and has become obsolute. So naturally I asked my teacher about it and he gave a reason which i cant really understand, He said that when he was a student he had a teacher who was a PHD holder (which in all fairness is kind of a big feat in my country, I'm from a 3rd world country) also used turbo c++ to teach. 

So what do u guys think ? Is it viable to learn turbo c++ or is that a big fucking waste of time ?

* however I work a state job, which if I work full time would allow for the tuition for three classes a year to be covered. And if I do computer science I would probably have to work part time due to the rigorous nature of the degree
* the other degree ( computer information systems ) is less rigorous so I could do it part time and work full time ( so no debt being that tuition is covered ) but also of course less prestigious.

Hi, i’m a first year university comp sci student in Canada, and all is going well school wise. Although i’m in my first year and it won’t be another 3+ years till I graduate i’m feeling worried about if i’ll get a job in a reasonable time after graduating, if at all i guess.

I hear a lot of people saying “CS is saturated”, “you won’t get a job”, or like “if you can do CS you can do something else and have a better chance”. The thing is, I genuine like doing computer science, to the point I wouldn’t even be upset about leaving Canada for a job, even before the big covid boom when everyone decided to hop in I wanted to do it. I didn’t get in for the money (of course it’s important but it wasn’t the main motivator).

Hearing all those things makes me want to switch majors and probably just minor in comp sci, so I can do it on the side and have a better chance at a main job with a more sought after degree. Is this something I should real",2024-03-05 20:43:47

These tools can write code for you without much prior knowledge, generate UI from images or concept drawings and so on. I've tested it myself in my job, it's scary.

I can't seem to learn from experience of doing. 
Should i focus on quantity, choosing every day a new exercise or stop and try to re-write from scratch the ones i already solved?

1brq24y,Should I take a gap semester to make myself more competitive for junior summer internship recruiting?,"I'm a second-semester sophomore planning to switch to Computer Science. I skipped the intro classes and have taken only three classes in CS so far (Data Structures, Algorithms, and OOP), so I'm fairly behind in my major classes. I don't have any internships/projects in software engineering/CS, so I feel a bit unprepared going into the junior internship recruiting season in the fall. 

I was wondering if it would be a good idea to take a gap semester in the fall, which will push me into the next class year's recruiting cycle. This way, I'll have an extra semester to pack in 3/4 computer science classes before recruiting for internships, work on projects during the gap semester, and perhaps pick up a low-key/unpaid internship in CS for the fall and/or next summer. I think this will make me more competitive for top companies when I eventually recruit for junior summer internships.

Any thoughts/advice?",2024-03-30 19:27:53

The three papers being introduction to python programming, discrete maths, and this other one paper about bit conversion, hexadecimals, logic gates, and the programming language assembly

The thing is they move so damn fast I don't have enough time to go over and understand the content and get the necessary help I need because by the next week they will have moved on.

Context: During my undergraduate years, I learned DSA using C++. However, seniors suggest Python might be a better choice, especially for tackling Leetcode problems and navigating technical interviews due to its simplicity in expressing logic and code during interviews. While I agree on Python's ease of explanation, I believe C++ has its advantage in fast runtime, particularly when dealing with complex algorithms on platforms like Leetcode. 

So, should I stick with the familiarity of C++ or jump to Python for its potential interview advantages? Your insights and experiences would be immensely helpful in guiding my decision. Thanks in advance for your input!

I can’t decide, I like webdev, but JavaScript causes me so much pain. I did .NET to avoid JavaScript as much as possible, but Visual Studio is a buggy mess if you try to use react/angular with it (no intellisense and constant crashing/invalid ssh cert) and also I’m selling my soul to Microsoft. Basically I like webdev but I can’t stand all these IDE and Framework stuff.

I also did a bit of research on networks and security and it seems something I would enjoy a lot more. I did some stuff with arduino’s in high school and it was fun too.

Hello, 

I am an international student with one year of undergrad left, currently taking a gap semester. 
Due to complications with international student regulations, I won’t be able to get work authorization until after spring 2025, which is my expected graduation date. 

I added CS a bit later in my program so don’t have any internship experience (was planning to do one this summer but can’t bc of the authorization issue) and I don’t have a great portfolio either.

1baopsx,Was my convo with HR a good or bad thing? Should I make a LinkedIn post thanking them??,"In fall 2023, I interned at a company which I thoroughly loved and enjoyed. I was looking forward to coming back for a second internship in summer 2024 but the senior recruiter/HR rep told me over the phone that they’ve had a policy shift where they won’t be taking interns that need sponsorship. 

However this policy does not stand for full-time so she told me that if there’s a position available, I’ll get first pick of location and truncated interview for Jan 2025 full-time positions.

I’m feeling positive as I just applied for a green card so im pretty sure I’ll be interviewed in a few months. But still, do I need to make a LinkedIn post to maximize my chances of getting interviewed? Is that even a factor? ",2024-03-09 18:37:41

1ba28g0,My thoughts,"Hey guys, honestly the whole concept of ""AI"" is just been messing me up mentally. While, I thought CS was a really cool career beforehand. I really dislike how everything's turning into AI, ultimately devaluing everything it touches. I had a professor say today that he uses ChatGPT to make his tests. And then I'm like ""Why the hell am I paying so much for this when he won't even put in the effort?"" ""What's the ultimate implication this will have in society?"". And another professor said that AI's basically going to do most of the code within the workflow of someone's profession. And I just find that very dull. 

I've been thinking of switching to medicine. I was very interested in Biology in high school, and my family's full of doctors. I really appreciate the human connection, why is something you don't get with CS. Heck, even my classmates are very dull.

Microsoft:

Redmond, WA

118.4k base + 25k bonus + 100k stock + relocation package

team: azure edge + platform

pros: it would be really cool to work from the headquarters, good career growth, easier to make connections/meet other coworkers, I like nature/hiking so Redmond would be a cool place

cons: really far away from my bf and family on the east coast, bf not really open to moving to redmond/seattle because he wants to work in NYC, possibility of layoffs



Geico:

fully remote

120k base + 5k bonus

team: unknown but it's the TDP program

pros: fully remote so I could live wherever I want/have more flexibility, maybe a better wlb?, cheaper living expenses bc I would be living at home and not having to pay rent

cons: wouldn't have the same resume value as microsoft, won't form as many connections due to working remote, people on the geico subreddit scare me

However, I have also been admitted to Georgia Tech for CS, which I will likely pay out-of-state tuition for if I choose to attend.

I’ve been told by many people that Georgia Tech is still the better choice in CS due to its curriculum and reputation, which would be particularly helpful in this job market and I do believe, but I am not sure if those benefits outweigh going to NCSU for free.

# 

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized how companies operate and innovate. However, behind the scenes of AI advancements lies a complex web of data collection and distribution. Particularly on social media platforms like Reddit, users' personal data is a valuable commodity, often traded to fuel AI algorithms.

Understanding the dynamics of data privacy on Reddit is crucial in today's digital landscape. As users engage with content and interact with others on the platform, their actions and preferences are meticulously recorded, eventually finding their way into the hands of companies looking to enhance their AI systems.

Being aware of who has access to and potentially sells this data is key to safeguarding one's online privacy. In this guide, we delve into the intricate world of data monetization on Reddit, shedding light on the entities involved in this process and empowering users to make informed decisions about their digital footprint.

That's a great idea, and you should use [solocode.ai](https://solocode.ai) to evaluate your startup ideas before you start wasting time or money coding it. You basically just describe it the idea that you're thinking of, and it generates a tailored development roadmap (including suggested tools and topics to learn), estimated dev times, maintenance costs, any competitors or alternatives, ways to monetize it, and a bunch of other cool stuff tailored to that specific idea.

I just launched it so I'm running a 50% off deal - it's a one-time payment for unlimited lifetime access. I literally made it for the same reasons as the post and to help solo coders, so please check it out and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!",2024-04-01 00:32:18

Also, after receiving it, i talked to the recruiter on phone and also in the primary email thread(where other conversation with the recruiter was going on), i responded that i accept the offer and joined the company.

I reported this to HR, but the HR told me that they have a different offer letter generated in their system. So they asked for the proof of the original email in which the offer letter was sent.

For context, I am a undergrad (Junior) at a decent state university. Okay GPA, many projects and prior experience (2 internships). 

I had a lot of referrals and connections for SWE intern roles, and I managed to nail a few interviews with compliments from recruiters. I’m not trying to brag here. I am passionate about the industry, and I was juggling offers. 

I boiled down to two good positions. Both positions gave me phone calls/emails of verbal offers and congratulations. I accepted the first one while waiting for the second (second one took 6 weeks from start to finish). 

As I accepted the first one, they immediately rescinded it. They stated that they overhired and already filled the position. The recruiter was very apologetic but it crushed me that week. Today, I followed up on the second company for a written offer.

I go to a community college and as I’ve been taking my courses I’ve gained a deep interest in math and physics despite hating it in highschool. I have pretty good grades but I know in the field of research and academia it’s almost impossible to get a teaching position or work as a scientist for a livable wage.

1btdpor,Is Georgia Tech CS worth the debt?,"

I’m a high-school senior who is about to graduate and I have been accepted to University of Tennessee Knoxville (~25k/year) as well as Georgia Tech (50k/year). 

I’m in-state for UT and the plan is to major in computer science or engineering—haven’t decided yet. Don’t get me wrong, Georgia Tech’s CS/CE program looks like it’s phenomenal. But does it justify 200k in debt? I’m not so sure about that. My parents have about 100k in a college fund. I don’t assume or believe they will pay the rest. I don’t qualify for aid, so I would be paying off 100k. 

I also happen to lean towards maybe pursuing a higher degree, but not certainly. Depends on the opportunities right out the door of undergrad. I would appreciate y’all’s opinions ",2024-04-01 19:52:42

Today I just had the zoom interview and all I could say is that it was the exact opposite of what I was expecting.

1bt8k78,statistics vs machine learning summer research?,"I have to decide between 2 research programs for this summer (rising college sophomore), and idk which one to choose: 

1) research program at my school, it's very traditional statistics applied in economics, so it's a lot less related to cs. However, I'd get to stay on campus for the summer, which is something I really want to do, and I'm always 1000x more productive on campus than I am at home (in terms of doing/learning other things and skills over the summer)

2) research program, through a connection, in machine learning applied in chemistry. obviously the ""machine learning"" part sounds a lot better, but I'd feel a little strange doing this because I got the opportunity through a ""connection"". Plus, I'd stay at home for the summer, which is just a whole lot less fun, and I'll be less productive overall (in terms of doing other things I want to over the summer)

1bt6hs9,should I add business or do a master's?,"Hi. I'm a student in a t10 CS program in America and I have 2 opportunities that I could do. Either I could apply to add business honors from my school's t5 business program or I could graduate with a master's in CS through an integrated program. Both opportunities would have me still graduating in 4 years. Like eventually I do hope to go from SWE to a PM which is why I'm considering the business degree, however I've also seen that some senior level positions do need a master's degree. I'm leaning towards the master's also because I know I can always go back to school for an MBA if I really need to as well. The master's would also let me add a business minor but the business honors program's resources are also really strong so they could help with getting jobs on wall street. But what path would open more opportunities down the road for me? Thank you.",2024-04-01 15:20:31

My scholarship will run out in spring of 2025 so the extra semester would be out of pocket (Approx. $7,000 for the extra semester). The main pro I can see is that it would help me stand out compared to others in the job market and it would give me an extra summer to get intern experience.

My first internship was at a startup and in my first year of CS so I didn’t know anything or really contributed much. It was my first experience working on an Agile team and to be honest I got to be familiar with git and some basics of web development but nothing measurable. 

My second and most recent was at a F500’s IT division. For some fuck ass reason my team had been taking interns every summer and never giving return offers since they never had an opening.

So my situation is a bit different. I switched to CS in my sophomore year and as of now i am a junior still taking the first 2 courses of the major bc i had to repeat. The reason i had to repeat the 2 courses (one of them being discrete math) is because im a horrible test taker, i get anxious and then space out bc im pressured by the time. Projects I got all A’s on, labs, etc so i think im finally starting to get a grasp on the concepts, I just can’t do well on the exams which are obviously weighed more. 

I have been having serious doubts about my ability. I know i can do it but a part of me just can’t have the discipline to sit down and study for hours because i get anxious and just automatically assume I’ll fail the exams, stupid i know, but I just don’t know. Discrete math is kicking my ass, if anyone has any resources please let me know i would truly appreciate it.

I have a few points of concern, although having been asked this question, I get a reply mostly that it doesn’t matter. I think y’all would be able to answer it better. 

• What is the **difference** between both the degrees and what’s being taught? 

• Does the B.Comp. Degree have a **potential disadvantage** over the other? maybe in terms of curriculum,  (what is taught), opportunities Etc or whatsoever. 

• Which one is harder? 

• Bachelors in Computing or Science , both are very different, one is science and other is not (While being a cs major) . what does this mean?

So here's the deal. I'm a second-year Informatics undergrad at UW, dreaming of becoming a software engineer. Last year, I spread my nets wide – 150 applications – but sadly, not much came back, and I tanked the assessments I did get.

Last summer, I interned in an IT role with a government agency, not exactly SWE but related, and they're offering me to come back this summer. It pays about $25/hr, which isn't bad, but here's the catch: it's in Bremerton.

I initially said yes to the return offer a few weeks back, but as I'm about to set the dates, I'm getting cold feet. Bremerton isn't my top choice of a summer spot, and the financials of staying there are less than ideal.

I’m obviously really excited regardless of if it works out or not, but I’m also terrified because as most college students at my level would probably agree on, I don’t feel like I have the knowledge and skill set at this point to even be confident in myself or my abilities. But obviously learning how everything actually works day to day is what an internship is for, so I’m sure I will be fine.

But with only a few days to prepare for this, what should I expect as far as questions goes? It’s only 15 minutes so it can’t be that extensive, but I don’t feel like I could do well if they start quizzing me and stuff because honestly with no certs and only a couple of years of school, I don’t feel like I know even the basic fundamentals of what they might expect.

1bhyxfg,Internship graduation delay,"Hello! I received an internship for this summer offer last October, when I was slated to graduate spring 2025. However, I got offered a remote-internship for the school year, and they have offered me to continue working during the summer. However, due to accepting the internship and taking less credit hours for the current semester to manage the workload, I no longer can realistically pass by fall 2025, but instead fall 2026. 

I also applied to another more prestigious university to transfer, and if I get in I have decided I will commit to it. However, I would be delaying graduation to spring 2026.

My question is - how should I reach out to the hiring manager to fill them in on this? Should I reach out to them? They will be asking for transcript’s, and I will have 81/128 fulfilled for my degree (I am labeled as a Junior). I can always choose the remote job for the summer, however, it pays way less, and the other offer is in person (preferable for me). ",2024-03-18 19:07:23

1bhvprf,How useful are Stanford University's online courses from an employment pov ?,"Stanford offers various online courses in machine learning, nlp etc. Course completion requires a 70% score on assignments. 
Do companies consider these types of certificates positively ? Would it give you an edge over other applicants with everything else being equal ? 
All the course material is on YouTube and I have already learnt from them. Should I do the course just for the certificate ? It's not cheap, each course costs $1750. ",2024-03-18 16:59:28

1bham4g,Opinions on different specializations of master degrees,"Hello,

I'm currently a student in my third year of university. I'm unable to decide whether if I should choose research, cybersecurity, or development track for my master.

I like learning (and thus research by extension), but I'm afraid that I would either not find a job, or end up burning out because I have such a high standard of myself. I like coding, and I'm afraid that I wouldn't code a lot in this track, or I that I would saturate my capacity for theoretical stuff.

I like the challenging aspect of security, yet my idea of it is still quite vague despite researching about what it is. I only kinda know the CTF part of it, and I don't like CTF. I would like to learn more profound techniques of reverse engineering, yet I have absolutely no experience in reverse engineering. I also am not sure about the employment opportunities of this track.

Development would be the safest choice, I'm quite good at writing code and I like it. Though would like to know if the other two fits better",2024-03-17 22:24:25

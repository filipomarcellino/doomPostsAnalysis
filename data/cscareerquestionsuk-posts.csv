1b685hb,Made an anonymous salary sharing website pt. 2,"Hey everyone, my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsuk/comments/1ay0uiz/made_a_website_for_internshipnew_grad_salaries_in/) became the top upvoted post of all time on r/cscareerquestionsuk so I figured I do an update. TLDR: Made an anonymous salary sharing website with a focus on UK/EU.

It's been around a week since launch, and I've added a lot of the features you guys requested (still a lot more on the backlog)! A quick summary:

* Added a dropdown menu to show more details such as RSU breakdown and perks
* Added company logos
* Added support for multi-currency, € will show up as € instead of being auto-converted to £
* Added hovering elements, e.g. when you hover over intern TC it now shows as pro-rated

Your insights are valuable to the mission! Please check out the website ([compclarity.com](https://compclarity.com)) and let me know of any more features you would like. We're currently lacking mid/senior data points so I encourage anyone reading this to share some!",2024-03-04 10:56:28
1ay0uiz,Made a website for internship/new grad salaries in the UK,"Hey all, I'm a recent university graduate and I made a website dedicated for sharing internship and new grad salaries. While levels.fyi does an incredible job in the US, and techpays.eu has its merits, there seemed to be a gap when it came to internship/new grad positions in the UK.

It's a community-driven project, so the more contributions we have, the richer and more valuable the data becomes for everyone. I genuinely believe it can help us make informed decisions and foster a more transparent job market.

I'd love for you to check it out and share your thoughts: [compclarity.com](https://compclarity.com)",2024-02-23 13:47:21
1b9uon8,My Experience with the London job market with 2 YOE,"I've heard constantly on reddit about the bad state of the tech job market and so wanted to provide this write-up detailing my experience in London.

Having spent my first two years after graduating at my current company I decided to move because in my mind I was underpaid. I haven't really built up any sort of network so this was done with only cold applications no referrals.

**About me:**

* 2 YOE
* £50k / year, no stock, no bonus
* London based
* BSc in Maths
* British Citizen

**Stats:**

* Cold applications: 250~
* Phone Screens: 15~
* Final Rounds: 2
* Offers: 2
* Time from first application to offers: 5 weeks

**Offers**

Company 1:

* £75000 / year (negotiated with the other offer was 68k orignally)
* Hybrid working
* Phone screen - leetcode(easy, fizzbuzz ish) - pair programming - behavioural - offer

Company 2

* £75000 / year
* Hybrid working
* One of the lower tier tech companies, you would have heard of them and used their product.
* Phone screen - leetcode - technical - system design - behavioural - offer

Final thoughts:

I initially thought I wasted my time with leetcode as only the bigger US based companies asked them. But considering I wouldn't have got offer 2 and negotiated 7k more without it, time very well spent.

System design was very rare at my YOE just ignore it, I passed the few I did get just by knowing basics about DB + cache + load balancing + rest vs websocket vs grpc. They do not expect a lot out of you for 2 YOE.

My issue was getting to the technical/behavioral rounds, I interview well but without referrals it's basically throwing your CV into the void.",2024-03-08 18:03:55
16dd1o7,£33k Entry level Software Engineer job in London. Am I being low-balled?,"Hello,

After starting my job search a few weeks ago, I've received my first offer which is of £32k per annum.

For context, I have:  
A first class computer science degree from a russel-group university.  
A 1 year work placement.  
A lot more project experience than average.

When I applied, I said my salary expectations were £35k-£37k, so I'm surprised to receive an offer that's lower than what I asked for.

Do you think this is a reasonable offer for London SWE roles?  
Is it worth taking if I can afford to keep looking?",2023-09-08 15:06:19

zcnhha,Career Progression in UK for TC,"As a SWE or a developer what does a normal career progression look like? I saw a similar post for US. I was wondering what it looks like in the UK.


Edit:
Having read alot of the comments what I've learnt so far is:
 - Hedge Funds pay you lavishly
 - On average most people stay at job 2 years then jump 10-20k at new job
 - Don't stay at first job for long and negotiate your worth 
 - Finance in London pays alot


Thanks for sharing guys!",2022-12-04 22:11:03
196t6z7,Some positive news for the subreddit,"Hi guys, maybe some of you remember me from about a month ago when I posted my cv's for review. Well I actually made it, and I think I made it big. So I figured I might share it to hopefully lift spirits of some people who are currently struggling.

About me: graduated comp sci from minor UK uni last July and searched for a job since September. Had a first and an internship done.

What did I get? I landed a job at a small to medium  company (100ish employees). Fully remote and 30k p/a pay. Personally I think this is big w for a first proper job after uni. Now if that wasn't great enough, company is doing very cool apps based on AI, so I am more likely to be replacing someone else's job than getting mine replaced (sorry!).

It took 200 applications. Only got invited for interview 3 times, one I rejected, second I didn't get selected after final interview, and this one I landed after having a one stage interview with CEO. Was recommended for an interview by a recruiter.

So TL;Dr keep looking guys, there are genuinely some recruiters looking out for you, and chances are that your talents will also have a buyer but you might have to wait a bit if your skillset isn't a typical JS full stack etc. like mine wasnt.",2024-01-14 23:07:51
1avfurx,This is honestly scary,"I've been applying for 50+ grad schemes starting in September 2024, and the hiring process.

I've successfully completed a coding assessment which took me quite some time, just to receive an e-mail saying that they decided not to move forward at this time (why ?).

I also did a 2 hours video assessment for Deloitte, then they e-mailed right after saying that the position is no longer available, then why did you waste my time ?

I've also had many cases where i successfully passed the two first stages, but then they stopped contacting me after for unknown reason.",2024-02-20 11:52:21

1azm6ja,Graduate Salary Progression,"Starting at 32k (+ bonuses) as a tech grad at a pretty big company and was wondering what typical salary progressions have been for those of you who started off as a grad aswell.

EDIT: Bristol based",2024-02-25 11:53:27
104wmyv,Money isn't everything,"I've seen a lot of posts here about salaries and what people can expect from careers in the software industry, so thought I'd chip in some words of advice from someone who is 15 years post-graduation.

And that is, that money, while obviously important, isn't everything.

You need money for two things: meeting your basic needs, and above that, living the lifestyle you want.

The average UK full time salary is £33,240 according to the ONS \[[https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours)\]. Almost all software engineers will be earning above that amount within a year or two (and many will be lucky enough to start above that straight from uni).

The UK living wage (what you need to meet your basic needs) works out at an annual salary of £21,255 outside London or £23,303 in London \[[https://www.livingwage.org.uk/faqs#t134n1749](https://www.livingwage.org.uk/faqs#t134n1749)\]. So, pretty much everyone working in software engineering will be earning above the living wage.

Therefore, almost every job in this industry will pay you enough to meet your basic needs: enough food, somewhere to live, basic clothes, etc. And the question comes down to the other thing you need money for: lifestyle.

Once you get into thinking about what that lifestyle is, money is not the only important factor. Of course money can buy things like bigger and nicer houses, fancy cars, better quality food and drink, designer clothes, nice holidays and so on. But other aspects of living the lifestyle you want will depend on things other than money.

Other things to consider when deciding if a job is right for you include:

* Where in the country (or outside of it!) do I want to live? Do I really want to live and/or work in a city, small town, or countryside? Do I want to work in an office and commute or work remotely, or some hybrid? If I have to commute, how long does it take, what does it cost, is it going to be enjoyable? Do I want to buy a house and, if so, how affordable are the sort of houses I would want to live in in that part of the country, and how does that compare to what I can earn there?
* What sort of work will I be doing? Will I enjoy it or will it be stressful? Will it challenge me and allow me to develop my abilities and is that something I want?
* What sort of company will I be working for? Do they do something I believe in or is it an industry I'm not comfortable with? (Everyone has their own morals - are you happy working for a defence company? an oil company? a finance company? etc - you need to decide that for yourself).
* Do I want to be a small cog in a big machine or work for a smaller organisation where I can get to know the people who run the business, and maybe have some influence there? Do I want to work for a PLC which is driven by external shareholders or a private company where the senior management isn't so controlled by the whims of the market? (But then also: who owns the private company - see also Twitter!)
* Is the job flexible in terms of working hours? Will I be expected to work hours beyond my standard contract or travel regularly?
* What sort of people will I be spending my days working with? What's the culture like? If I am working fully remotely, where will I get my social interactions from?
* Do I have life goals like travelling, participating in particular hobbies, forming a relationship or getting married, having pets, starting a family and will the job be compatible with those?

Everyone has different answers to these questions, and they all involve personal trade-offs.

I thought it was worth pointing out that this explains part of the reason for different people doing similar jobs in a similar industry being paid different salaries. It is not just that some employers ""underpay"" people. Some employees may decide that they are happy working for less money if it means they can live somewhere they like to live, have more flexibility to live the lifestyle they want, etc.",2023-01-06 15:14:58

1b730gw,18 months in and haven't done much software engineering. What to do?,"new account for anonymity.

I started as a graduate software engineer 18 months ago at a consultancy firm and in the past 8 months I've written about 20 lines, or two small functions, of Python code. Below is the break down of what I've done:

\- Joined and had 2 weeks training before being put on standby to await a project allocation. I was on standby for 2 months. Standby you're just left to your own devices, theres no formal training or any other things set for you to do.

\- Put on project 1 for a few months, made a flask app for a database alongside another junior. The two seniors in the project had little to no interest and just let us get on with it. Neither had any experience in python whatsoever.

\- Moved to project 2. Spent the first 6 weeks waiting for a laptop specific for this project so again nothing much to do. This was a research/bid project so pretty vague as to what we were supposed to do. Again working alongside another junior with 2 seniors. Left to my own devices and had maybe 2 days a week actual work for 4 months. Bid submitted and rejected so off project.

\- Again on standby for a month.

\- Asked to fulfil a management role on a project (was a manager in a non technical industry before) which the project wasn't really ready for. Asked to do this role for 3 months with the promise of being put on this project's dev team afterwards. Senior team changed and after 6 months was still in management role doing next to nothing despite constantly asking for things to do and being told to sit and wait as the project still wasn't at that stage. Surprise surprise the project finally imploded.

\- Back on standby and its been 2 months so far. This time I've been given a data analyst type task to make some data visualisations but not much oversight, not really well defined requirements etc.

I've made best use of my free time and continued self study but I feel this job isn't giving me the opportunity to get the experience you can only get in industry. i.e. I've not in 18 months submitted any code for review. I've only a few times informally reviewed my peers code. I've not had any experience in test or spec work and very little in dev. If i were to even think about going for an interview with another company i feel they'll just laugh at my lack of experience and I'm essentially back to a graduate engineer level again, having wasted 18 months.

So do i stick it out and hope it gets better (I've relayed my concerns to my line manager but if they've got no work theres not much they can do is the reply). Or job hunt?

Few more details about the job:

\- Mostly WFH (well FH as theres not much W). I've been to the office maybe 12 times in 18 months.

\- Salary is £35k, Ironically after 12 months I got promoted. I started at £30k

\- Predominant language used is old. I won't say which one as may give the company away but it was used for defence in the 80's and is barely used these days which doesn't offer much employability as far as i can tell

TLDR: 18 months in not done much and not sure it will get better, mentally had enough, do i stick or try to move given lack of actual experience, lack of jobs in local area and terrible economy.",2024-03-05 11:27:21

16416tm,Is the market for CS employees oversaturated in the UK? Or is it just the overwhelming US Internet users struggles that I'm always hearing," I'm still a teen, but I quite enjoy coding and thought a career in it would be good, obviously it would still require work, but if its working doing something I enjoy then surely it's a good career to pursue right? Apparently wrong, apparently it impossible to get jobs, the requirements are crazy high, and pursuing a career in it is ""awful"" as the top post of the past month in csmajors seems to believe. Is this universal? Should I divert my attention making my own business, as apparently that's supposedly the new smart thing to do ( even though it might become as oversaturated as Cs is supposedly now). Or is it just the current wave of Cs majors that are making the market flooded, and that by the time I'm looking for work ( going into my 2nd year of my gsces  this September) will the market be a little more vacant? Or maybe it's impossible to predict, and no one here knows what the future will hold? Sorry for the length so

While I'm not a ""recruiter"", over the past 10 years I've helped with recruitment as a part of my job, and over the years I've probably reviewed 1000s of CVs and interviewed 100s of candidates, at all levels but particularly for junior/graduate engineer and student software engineer industrial placements.

18c1ihu,New immigration rules or are there entry positions with salaries around £40k in the UK?,"I'm a blind Ukrainian who lives in Britain and I was planning my immigration.  
One of the most possible routes was the Skilled Worker visa. Even taking into account the lack of experience in the company, this was quite possible. I even went to mentoring in C#.  
But the British government has announced an increase in the required salary for this visa. So starting from next spring my salary should be £38,700.  
Moreover, I don't like coding. I wanted to become something like a QA or BA, as I know they have lower salaries.  
As I know, even a strong Junior developer can count on a salary of £35k. £40k is something around the middle level.  
So my question is:  
If I have time to get a new visa before May 2025. Are there any entry IT positions where I can earn the required salary of around 40k annually or should I completely abandon this idea and focus on something else like starting a business ?  
I should add that I live near London and could work in London. Although for some reason I find entry positions vacancies anywhere but not in London.

175gs6p,Anyone else finding .NET/C# market completely dead in the UK?,"So I have 3.5 years experience with a consultancy, mostly C# specialised but some DevOps stuff, a little bit of FE with React/Angular, worked across three pretty major client projects in that time with 6+ months at each, big projects with a lot to talk about in interviews (big rewrites for the first two, last one was a huge greenfield project, over a year there). First in CS from a Russell Group University. Unfortunately interest rates hit old company pretty hard and was let go in July along with about 200 other people.  
Took a few months out as I'd saved enough to not have to work for a while and thought it would be pretty straightforward to get a new role in the Autumn. I was on 54k before being laid off, was hoping for 60+ - As I'm finding though its a horrible market out there. Just a few experiences:  
Small Legal IP firm (start of September): ticked all their boxes, great interview and smashed the tech test. Final interview was good too and feeling pretty good about it - couple days later I hear from the recruiter they'd gone with the other candidate, he had 12 years experience and was willing to come down to 60k for the role. Should have been a warning sign but didn't think too deeply about it really.  
Wealth management firm (middle of September): pretty similar, great first interview and tech test, they loved my approach to the tech test and final interview with partners was really good. Then a day later - they've gone with a guy who had 7 years experience. Both roles said they'd keep me on file and would get back in contact if they recruited again.  
And thats it - all the rest are first introduction calls that go nowhere, tech tests I complete and never heard back.  
This last week or two has really taken the piss - had a great first call with a company I was really interested in, completed the tech test and got two senior devs from old company to review and both loved it - and then just nothing. Complete radio silence from both recruiters, no replies to emails nothing. Obviously that one is most likely dead but God it's horrible when you just get ghosted like that.  
I'm stilly applying to stuff - at least 3/4 applications a day. I'm on Reed, Indeed, Monster, Otta all of that. I hear back from maybe 1 out of 5 applications I put in, if that. Had my CV reviewed by a recruiter who likes it and recommended only minor wording changes. Savings are running pretty low too - UC says I'm entitled to about a grand a month which will pay most of my rent and bills but not much else.  
Got two interviews coming up but again hard to be optimistic with the way other interviews have gone. Any ideas? Not sure what the point of this post even is apart from ranting and maybe seeing if others are in the same situation.",2023-10-11 15:27:46

vhe90l,Wiley Edge Graduate Software Developer - Opinions?,"Hey, I have recently been offered a place on this program, and I would just like to know if anyone else has done this/has any opinions whether it is a good career move?

I am a recent cs grad, with no experience yet. They train you for 6 weeks, paid, and then aim to get you a placement at some of the top investment banks in the world. Once you gain a placement, you are in a 12/24 month contract, and the pay starting at 25k, rises every 6 months - 31k, 36k, 41k.

Seems like a sweet deal to me, and would really help me get a foot in the door at some top companies.

Does anyone have any opinions on this? I am still slightly concerned that I may be selling myself short.

rda32s,How much do recruiters offer over just applying for jobs myself? Because they're doing my tits in.,"I've been in development for 5 years. 3 years as a software developer and 2 years as a senior. 

I've recently started thinking about making a career shift to another company so I updated my LinkedIn with my skillset and set myself to ""Open to work"". 

I was inundated with messages (like 36 in one day) and more keep coming in hourly. Filtering through them only about 20% are actually relevant to me as I don't want to work in London and would rather continue working with languages and tech stacks that I have experience with (Go and microservices). 

I'm finding it very difficult and stressful working with these recruiters though. They're very pushy, giving me details of 5 jobs and then getting arsy if I only apply for 1 or 2. Many are pushing me to commute to London (I'm based in Cardiff), and my phone is constantly blowing up with phone calls from the few I've made the mistake of giving my number to. This is extra problematic as I'm still working full time at my current role and I can't give them the attention and commitment they seem to want, they're honestly coming across like jealous girlfriends.

They bad mouth over recruitment agencies and are constantly fishing for information about other recruiters and what jobs I've applied for (knowing full well I can't disclose that information) and trying to guess on my behalf. 

I'm honestly on the brink of just deleting my LinkedIn account and doing it the old fashioned way of applying through Reed/Indeed. 

It's been years since I applied for a job and I didn't realise things were this cut throat at the moment, so I'm a bit out of the loop of what the best practise is here.",2021-12-10 14:40:02
1aexsqa,How do you feel about “DEI” policies at big companies?,"My current employer and previous employer are both big household names in the UK, with large budgets, and both have strong “DEI” policies that you have to agree with or you can’t progress in your career.

I have been helping interview at my current company for 3 years - 2 interviews a week. I have noticed a radical shift in my current employer in the past two years, because of organisational changes (don’t want to dox my company by explaining this) we have adopted the corporate DEI policies. Since adopting these policies I have not interviewed a single white British man or woman, whereas previously it was \~50/50. Essentially previously everyone was given the same opportunity to interview here. Now everyone except white British people are given an opportunity to interview here. In Britain. Where the majority of the population is white British. Speaking to some colleagues their experience has been the same.

Most of the teams I’ve worked in during my career have been quite diverse, and most of the candidates I’ve said yes to during the interview process have been non white British ethnicity. So I’m not against diversity in principle.

Personally I feel that excluding people from being given an opportunity purely based on ethnicity is not “Inclusive”, it’s the exact opposite. It’s discrimination. There was a similar situation at my previous employer.

How do you feel about this? Especially now job opportunities are scarce, to me it feels wrong…

Edit: this post blew up a little so I won’t reply to everyone. What I plan to do is push for getting hard statistics from HR/recruitment. If they don’t have it i will try to push them to implement it in a transparent way.",2024-01-30 20:02:31

3 months as an intern quality engineer, 3 months as a jr software dev in low code and now I am doing software dev work working with legacy PHP code (moving to a new framework soonish). All have been smaller side companies. Given the market and how hard it is to get a footing, I am grateful.

Issue is lately I am finding that I have lost a lot of motivation to do work and just generally life maybe? 

I did join three devs into a shadow startup (early stages) and it is actually fun as a side project learning.

I am based in Essex mind you. I did attempt to apply for those 30k jobs but got told I ""didn't have the experience"". Plus PHP seems to be a good tool to at least know about since a lot of companies still use it in a lot of websites

So I am at the lowest £23500 lol. Not my ideal but I keep thinking that it is worthwhile because after a year hopefully I could double it.

I somewhat enjoyed my ML studies, but, my ideal workflow involves instant feedback of building something and seeing the results quickly. The long training cycles in ML, and sometimes tweaking endlessly for marginal results, just wasn't my thing. That's why I've shifted my focus to full-stack development using .NET and Next.js – the rapid code-to-result cycle is far more rewarding. (I knew the tech stack before, but really dived in after my MSc)

Side note, practically every job ad starts by asking about visa sponsorship. So, emphasised on my CV I've got the work permit sorted... just thought that would get me a little more attention.

I've put the work into having a decent portfolio website showcasing projects in these tech stacks. My LinkedIn is updated, highlighting experience and skills. I'm hitting up internships, grad schemes, the whole nine yards.

Should I be doing something else to get noticed? Desperate for tips on how to improve my CV or any different approaches to try... Feeling hopeless right now.

1765ive,"Am I unlucky or are the software engineering jobs really unstable right now? Office politics, toxic environments, etc.","TL;DR: My last two jobs were pretty unstable and toxic, so I am thinking about changing professions as I don't know if this is just the reality of being a software engineer or my luck. Does anyone can confirm that they have similar experiences?

Lately, I had some bad experiences in two different workplaces and I am curious if this is a new common thing or just me. 

For context: I live in the UK, I have 4 years of experience, I finished CS degree, I always enjoyed programming and tech. I worked in some great companies, but my recent two jobs left me with physical and mental health issues.

The first place that nearly fully burnt me out, was a seemingly successful startup, that quickly stopped being successful. There was mass redundancy (tech team from 70 people became 12, then the next month 50 people were sacked in different departments), mobbing, blackmail and after that we were forced to work weekends and at night. 

Finally, I quit this place and instead, joined a company that seemed more stable, as it had a small but secure audience and was old enough to not be called a startup. I was told that they want to start slowly expanding and I just wanted a stable place to work. 

That to say, this also turned out to be quite bad. First, there were weird comments and jokes from other devs - ""Don't think you will work here for long"", etc; in comparison with other devs who worked there my probation was not 3 months, but 6 months and I never was assigned to any project, just small features and bugs. When I raised this with my manager, he said that I would be assigned to something when there would be a right time. Soon afterwards, my manager started cancelling our 1:1 and finally, it turned out that I was hired sort of temporarily, as they needed someone to join the team because some devs went on parental leave and the company itself was looking for a senior engineer (in whose interview I took part of). Finally, I got sacked and the reason was that I wasn't ""the cornerstone of the team"". I was also told that it was a business decision and that I shouldn't take it personally.

Currently, I am looking for a new job, but also I am thinking that maybe I should change professions because I am very much tired of being the only woman in the office and horrible office politics.",2023-10-12 12:13:58

Company 2 - Finance
Help Desk (9 months, was made redundant) - £21,000
Desktop Engineer (1.5 Years) £23,500

Company 5 - Tech Consulting
Cloud Consultant (present org, not been here long) - £65,000 + £5100 Car Allowance. Taking the allowance as cash and work remotely 90% of year so £70,100 

Ceiling of salary for my city seems to be £70-£90k for DevOps/Cloud Engineering. Very rarely see jobs online over that mark unless you can gain a remote role for a London company. 

During company 4 I managed to achieve 6 figures by doing OE. I had a few contracts whilst doing Perm Job. Ranged between £600-£800 a day. I’ve taken a break from doing OE as it’s exhausting and have a 2nd LO on the way, really young family. I know some will say “just become a contractor” and I can understand that, but It was a weird experience and wasn’t all that consistent in the time I did OE. I earn 3x more than my partner who works part time so I can’t really ever afford to be out of work with 289k remaining on mortgage with disgusting interest. 

What’s the best advice to achieve 6 figures from permanent job? I’d like to achieve it before I enter my 30s which will be 3 years time.

At the moment, I don’t see anyway of being able to unless I go in to management, which I’m not against.

162tupq,My experience of trying to find a senior remote Python/data role in 2023,"My experience of trying to find a senior remote Python/data role in 2023

* I have >10 years experience, but was unemployed

* total cold applications: approx 100

* applications from recruiters reaching out to me: approx 10

* applications via referrals: 0

* total number of companies who at least invited me to some sort of initial phone screen or test: 23, so ~20% of applications.

The 20% ratio is really misleading though, it varied hugely depending on the role. For backend Python roles it was >100%. I hardly applied for any web services roles because most Python web roles are fullstack, but several times recruiters contacted me about roles I hadn't seen. For ML engineering (as in ML Ops, not data science) it was at most 20%, and that despite being extremely selective and only applying for things I felt I was clearly qualified for. For data engineering it was maybe 80% invitations for companies dealing with small datasets (Airflow, PostgreSQL, etc), and maybe 5% at companies dealing with large amounts of data (Redshift, Spark, etc).

* total time spent unemployed: ~4 months

Job search strategy:

- my LinkedIn profile is almost empty. Maybe I should have actually filled it out properly.

- about half the job apps were on on job boards (totaljobs, cwjobs)

- about half the job apps were on LinkedIn

- I made ~0.5 applications/week where recruiters reached out to me

The interview processes I went through:

1. Big pharmaceutical company, software engineer (contract)

Had a chat with the hiring manager, mostly just talking through my resume. They seemed to like me, and their main concern seemed to be whether I'd be happy just doing random odd jobs in Python rather than working on any particular product or project. Given it was a contract role this was fine by me. However, a few days later I was told that someone they had worked with before had just come back on the contract market, so they'd hired them instead. I imagine that in 2021/2022 this wouldn't have happened, this year there's a lot of people looking for jobs and very few fully remote contract roles.

A couple of weeks later I heard a different team at the same company was also looking for a contract data engineer, however I was no longer available to start immediately so declined the new interview.

2. Big oil company, data engineer (contract)

Invited to a coding test, it was at most leetcode easy, and I found it extremely easy. The interviewer asked a whole bunch of follow-up questions about data structures and algorithms, but on multiple occasions they were looking for the wrong answer. Also they couldn't tell me anything at all about what the position I'd applied for actually involved. Also I wasn't sure ethically if I wanted to work for an oil company anyway. The 2nd stage was apparently going to be a harder coding problem (maybe leetcode medium?), but given my lack of enthusiasm for the role I couldn't face doing leetcode practice in preparation. I withdrew after passing the 1st round.

3. VC-funded scale-up, backend engineer with a little ML engineering

Round #1 was a pop-knowledge quiz about various different technologies. Round 2 was a system design interview. I think I did OK but it was the first system design interview I've done in years so didn't do as well as I should, and they also asked several questions that seemed very vague and/or irrelevant. Round 3 was a bunch of pretty simple pandas coding questions in a notebook, which I mostly did OK on, though having hardly written any code for several months I did momentarily trip up a couple of times. During the questions at the end of the interview some of the things they said gave me a really bad impression of both the role and the hiring manager. This definitely came across in my tone of voice. The combination of my somewhat mediocre interview performance, followed by clearly having no interest in working for them, meant they ghosted me afterwards. I guess it was a good warm-up for future interviews.

4. Seed-funded start-up, data engineer with a little ML engineering

Round #1 was a chat with the hiring manager. #2 was an extremely easy system design interview. #3 and #4 were behavioural interviews with C-level people. I failed the final behavioural interview due to lack of enthusiasm and ""lack of a growth mindset"". I think it would have been pretty boring and it's probably for the best I got rejected.

5. Seed-funded start-up, data engineer with a little ML engineering

Round #1 was phone screen with hiring manager. I failed due to having zero experience in their domain+technologies combined with no obvious enthusiasm for switching. In hindsight I should have found a bit more enthusiasm from somewhere, as it did look potentially quite interesting.

6. VC-funded fintech scale-up, data engineer with a little ML engineering

Round #1 was an internal recruiter phone screen, #2 was a technical chat with the hiring manager, #3 was a leetcode easy followed by some technical questions, #4 was system design. Overall the interviews all went pretty well, and I was somewhat hopeful. However, they said they'd gone with another more qualified applicant. Their feedback was that I'd done well enough they'd seriously considered hiring two people instead of just one. I imagine I might well have got an offer in 2021/2022.

7. Old legacy retail bank, data engineer

I got invited to a 1st round technical test, but the role sounded so corporate that I decided it wasn't for me and withdrew my application.

8. Small fintech startup, lead data engineer

Round #1 was system design. It was conducted in a really weird, silly way, designed explicitly to ensure your thought process was identical to the interviewer, and prevented any potential for discussion around alternative approaches or technologies. Also it was a heatwave and I was way too hot to think straight. Zero regrets about not getting an offer, it didn't seem like a great place to work.

9. US big tech (not FAANG), backend/ML engineer

This had like a jillion rounds. A recruiter phone screen, then a fairly easy take-home hackerrank coding test, then a leetcode medium pair programming exercise. Then a ""virtual onsite"" consisting of four back-to-back interviews: #1 another medium leetcode pair programming exercise #2 a system design interview (that was actually largely about data structures and algorithms), then a short break, then #3 and #4 two behavioural interviews with engineers.

I've done a bit of DS&A study + practice but not loads, and I just about scraped through the two leetcode rounds. I relied on hints from the interviewers plus some luck with recognizing the relevant data structure or algorithm from things I happened to have recently read. The system design I kind of messed up, as it involved a data structure I couldn't remember properly (even though it was a system design interview it was actually yet more DS&A), plus I was mentally exhausted from the leetcode round immediately prior, plus the interviewer didn't want to give me any hints at all (maybe they didn't like me, or maybe it's like that for all their candidates).

The entire process seemed designed to hire FAANG-rejects, as there was a huge amount of DS&A that FAANG applicants would be very familiar with, yet also a low enough bar that I still managed to almost make it through despite doing fairly minimal preparation (I only applied because LinkedIn recommended it to me). It would have looked good on my resume, but other than that I wasn't 100% sure I even wanted to work there. I'm not a huge fan of their business practices, the pay on offer was barely more than UK startups, and working on ML for advertising is kind of bleurgh.

10. VC-funded ecommerce scale up, data engineer

I got invited to the phone screen but not any further. The phone screen went fine, so I assume the hiring manager didn't like my resume for some reason.

11. VC-funded health tech #1, data engineer

Round #1 was a technical screen with a manager. Round #2 was solving a couple of fairly realistic technical problems with access to google and docs allowed, on a video call with 2 engineers who gave some hints. The first problem I did pretty well, with only minor hints. The second problem featured a lot of SQL, and I got a big hint when I struggled at one point, but otherwise did fairly well. I got rejected, I suspect because I needed the big SQL hint. If I had done even one day of practice SQL questions beforehand to refresh my memory on window functions I wouldn't have needed their hint, but maybe the fact I did so little preparation is indicative they were right not to hire me. I liked the way that both questions were genuinely realistic day-to-day tasks, whilst still possible to complete in the space of a short interview.

12. VC-funded health tech #2, data engineer

Round #1 was a recruiter phone screen, round #2 was a largely behavioural chat with a couple of engineers. I failed #2, I guess they didn't like me for whatever reason. It wasn't a particularly amazing job, but it's still a shame the engineers didn't like me!

13. VC-funded health tech #3, lead data engineer

Made it to phone screen, but no further due to lack of leadership experience. Fair enough I guess.

14. Seed funded startup, data engineer

They asked me to do a really long online personality questionnaire before any potential interview. I did about 10 questions before deciding that I was highly unlikely to want to work anywhere with this recruitment process, and stopped.

15. Seed funded startup, data engineer

I was invited to an initial phone screen, but it looked a really boring role, plus I saw the CEO talked about ""web3"" and blockchain on their LinkedIn page. Withdrew my application.

16. Consumer-facing website, data engineer

Recruiter reached out to me. I passed resume screen and was invited to do an online logical reasoning test (?!). It didn't look like a particularly interesting role, and I said I'd get back to the recruiter about taking the test in a few weeks if I didn't have any better offers.

17. VC-funded marketing & advertising tech, backend engineer

They wanted some further information before proceeding with my application. I went to their website and all the copy about marketing conversion rates and influencer partnerships was so nausea-inducing I never got back to them.

18. Seed-funded fintech, lead data engineer

Round #1 was a technical screen with two engineers. There was then some confusion as to whether it was going to be possible to do the role fully remote rather than hybrid, but eventually I got invited to round #2. This was a take-home, timed 2.5 hour hackerrank coding test. The questions didn't involve any knowledge beyond intermediate Python and SQL, but they were intentionally really awkward and designed to trip you up with weird rules and edge cases. I pervesely enjoyed this, it was quite game-like, whilst simultaneously feeling more realistic than leetcode-style questions that are largely about memorizing data structures and algorithms you'll never actually use. I can imagine some people would be pretty frustrated by this round though, particularly given how much time it took. Round #3 was system design. Round #4 was behavioural with a C-level person. I was ultimately rejected for not being sufficiently enthusiastic about the role or the domain, which was fair enough. I think really the role would be ideal for someone living in London and looking to get their foot in the door in the world of stonks, trading, hedge funds, etc, and willing to work potentially really quite hard for relatively average pay. That really doesn't describe me.

19. Consultancy firm, data engineer (contract)

Round #1 was an internal recruiter screen. Round #2 was a short coding test followed by technical questions. The coding test was a very simple question that required using recursion. I wrote 95% of the solution in a few minutes, then paused to think. One interviewer gave me a slightly misleading suggestion that meant I ended up with a line of code that didn't do anything. I appreciate they were trying to be helpful, I've previously made the same mistake myself as an interviewer. Then the other interviewer wanted to know why I had the line that didn't do anything. It was a bit weird and awkward.

Then there were some technical questions, which went OK but sometimes we were talking at cross-purposes because it wasn't always clear what they actually wanted to know. I finally tried asking about the role but it was apparently top-secret for reasons that are totally beyond me (it wasn't defence or national security or anything like that). I got rejected, not really sure why, and I'm still not even really sure what the role was.

20. Consultancy firm, ML engineer

Round #1 was an internal recruiter screen. Round #2 was a supposedly ""realistic"" problem with access to google and documentation allowed. It was a really silly problem though, it didn't make any sense as posed, and was best solved with a very short script totally unlike anything you would do in a real project. I looked on their glassdoor interview reviews afterwards and there were several people complaining about the same task. It was so dumb.

I just about completed it in time, after taking a couple of wrong turns due to the fact I just couldn't tell what they were actually looking for. On several occasions the interviewers made suggestions that didn't really make sense. I was rejected for ""not following best practices"". If the interview was anything to go by, maybe this was for the best.

21. VC-funded scale-up, ML or backend engineer

An internal recruiter reached out to me about a hybrid ML ops role. I said I wasn't applying for hybrid roles. They replied it might be possible to make it >95% remote, and on that basis I agreed to apply. Round #1 was a recruiter screen. Round #2 was an interview with the hiring manager, which consisted of a very easy pair programming question (easier than leetcode easy), followed by a bunch of behavioural/teamwork questions.

They got back to me a few days later and said they'd decided the role would better suit a mid-level engineer, but asked if I would consider a senior fullstack position on another team instead. I said I was only interested in backend or data, at which point they came back and said there was enough backend work that I wouldn't have to do any frontend if I didn't want to. Round #3 was a chat with the hiring manager for the other team. It was a general technical and behavioural chat, without any coding, focusing on the problems involved in making backend services more reliable and scalable. There were also questions about mentoring, and whether I would be interested in being a principal engineer or team lead once they'd hired some more people. I passed this round, then round #4 was a long behavioural interview with an engineer on another team. I passed this and was offered a job.

22. Large fintech, backend software engineer

Round #1 was an internal recruiter phone screen. It was a bit weird, they spent 30 minutes giving me a sales pitch about how amazing the company was, whilst asking hardly any questions. I'd read the glassdoor reviews for the company, and saw it was super negative, way more disgruntled ex-employees than most companies. Maybe the two are related, or maybe the recruiter missed their true calling in sales.

Round #2 was a take-home coding task to add a couple of features to an existing project. They provided a basic way to interactively test your solution, but I decided to write some proper unit tests and do it using TDD instead. Unfortunately, for the first feature I accidentally messed up the tests, which meant I then implemented it wrong, and had to start all over again. This meant I was already close to the suggested time limit, whilst also leaving my code a bit of a mess due to rewriting it as quickly as possible (I ended up with some tests that weren't even passing). For the next feature I could see the naive solution that they were expecting, using some simple recursion, which would have been pretty quick to write. But for fun I decided to do it a pointlessly clever and efficient way instead, which took me way over the suggested time limit. I then submitted my code, and admitted in a note I attached that I'd accidentally spent way too long on it. I could have lied, but given the glassdoor reviews I figured eh whatever I'm not sure if I want to work there anyway, and I'd rather be honest.

I didn't really expect to get invited to the next stage, but I did, which was adding more features to the same project in a pair programming interview. It turned out that my excessively clever solution made this more difficult than if I'd used the naive solution, and therefore I didn't quite finish in time. Despite this, I still got invited to the next round.

At this point I withdrew my application, as I'd decided to take up my offer from the previous company.

23. Large non-tech company, data engineer

Invited to initial phone screen. The company actually has quite a good reputation as being a good place to work, but it wasn't an especially senior or well paid position, and didn't look to offer all that much room for growth. Given I already had a better offer elsewhere I withdrew my application.",2023-08-27 15:46:17
yoqneh,UK career changers - How did you break into software development?,"I've sent ~30 applications for junior software developer (frontend/full stack) roles in London and the West Midlands over the last couple of weeks, but only heard back from 2. For some reason the only companies getting back to me are the grad schemes at bigger companies. I know junior roles are super competitive, but tbh I expected a better response rate given that I have previous software development experience and would be less of a ""risk"" than someone with no commercial experience.

Would anyone that's been in a similar position be able to provide advice or suggestions? Or is this just a bad time to apply for junior roles given market conditions? Thanks!

My background: 27 y/o, first class master's degree in Electrical and Electronic engineering from a Russell Group uni. Currently a Software Systems Engineer with 5 years of experience at a large automotive OEM as well as around 9 months of software dev experience (embedded C, C++, Matlab and some Python) as part of the graduate scheme. I've taught myself CS fundamentals (data structures and algorithms etc.) and web technologies (TypeScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL, Python, Flask etc.).

1bgvk5u,Be careful of Global Voices Ltd.,"I have gotten a screening interview at Global Voices Ltd. through a referral for a Full-Stack position.

The interview process was as follows:

* Screening interview
* Take home assessment 72h (Auth system)
* On-site technical interview \~1h
* Another possible interview, but didn't make it that far

I have completed the OA successfully, and got a response that the Dev team was impressed by my solution and would love to invite me to have an on-site technical.

No problem I thought amazing, I've got good chances. The technical was ok, not good not bad.

Shortly I received a response: ""Unfortunately, at this moment we have paused recruitment for this position due to a change in the business priorities."".

I said to myself well this sucks but it might be actually true. After a couple of days while typing  full-stack interview questions the link to the job posting came as a suggestion, I clicked on it out of curiosity to see if the position was still up.

It was up, and they have extended the search for another candidate till May (my whole interview process started at the end of February). I emailed them kindly asking about the position and if I am still being considered. They didn't respond for 4 days so I messaged the recruiter on LinkedIn, where I was welcomed with the response that they are looking for somebody with 3-5 YOE.

I have 1YOE, it is on my CV and I have discussed it in the screening interview why waste my time and give somebody so much false hope for nothing? It is beyond me.

17sqyf4,Grad pay,"I graduated this summer and just started looking for software engineering jobs last month. It’s going pretty slow but I am getting some interviews. What’s standing out to me though is the pay, because I feel like it’s lower than what I was seeing last year. With most jobs I’m looking at around 35k, I think the most I’ve seen was 45k. 
Last year I turned down a 55k return offer from my internship (not due to pay or the role, I just couldn’t live where it was located and I don’t regret it), I was also hearing from my peers they were often being offered upwards of 60k. 
My question is then, is it the market that has changed and 30-40k is decent nowadays, are return offers higher than when hiring a new graduate from outside, or maybe I just didn’t realise that I was pretty lucky and the pay has always been this low? Basically I want to know what is standard nowadays so that I don’t have unrealistic expectations or settle for something way lower than what I could ask for.

1ar1shq,I work at a coding bootcamp and...,"goddamn it's hard out there at the moment.

Does it get better? Does AI advance once again far quicker than expected and become a viable coding companion for serious projects? Is software engineering a dying industry? Or are we just at the (hopefully) bottom of a particularly vicious bust with a boom coming in the near future?

I really want to believe we're on the way back up but in all honesty I just don't see where it's coming from. When there's so much instability in the world everyone is understandably anxious about shoring themselves up (e.g. not hiring).

But nothing really looks like it's getting better any time soon. Ukraine? Who knows how long that war will go on for. Until Putin dies maybe? The Middle East situation? Is Israel really about to massacre a huge refugee camp? What happens then? Lebanon, Iran, etc, don't react at all?

Against that backdrop you have downward pressure from highly skilled mid and senior devs getting laid off en masse, happy to take a lower salary than before. And then of course you have a proliferation of coding bootcamps churning out entry level applicants, placing upwards pressure on a small number of entry level and junior jobs.

What I would say is that graduate schemes and apprenticeships are excellent options. Even if you've worked as a developer before you can apply for apprenticeships. Just don't have a degree directly related to software engineering and you're golden. Even these are highly competitive though, particularly in London.

If you've made it this far, thanks. What do you think?

P.S before you start berating me for working at a bootcamp, it is a nonprofit. We are EXTREMELY clear and transparent with our learners from the beginning that the market is very tough at the moment. We are very conscious about not 'selling the bootcamp dream'.",2024-02-14 23:57:47

Hey all. 

I'm 31, and living on peanuts. Work  doesn't pay much, and I'm tired of living this way. I want to do work that means something.  I want to mean something.

I've been doing some deep reflections, and I want to start with sorting my career out. I've been thinking of going into IT.

If you are a software engineer/developer, cloud architect/engineer or work in cybersecurity, help me. Please answer these questions so I can have some ideas going forward. I'd really appreciate it:

1.How engaging is your work day to day? Do you have any autonomy on what you do daily? Is there variety in your day-to-day work? Are you given clear tasks and helpful feedback?

2. Do you feel Ike your work actually impacts people's lives? Or not? (If it's the former, what industry do you work in?)


3. Is your workplace diverse? Equal mix of gender, ethnicities etc? Do you get along with a few of your team members, at least? If not, do you feel that you can at least get help when you ask for it?


4. Are there any major negatives that affect your work? (horrible pay, horrible commute, horrible job security etc)


5. Does your work fit into your personal life? Or does your life fit around your work? Do you find yourself working evenings, weekends and holidays? Do you have opportunities to work as a contractor?


6. Is there/did you have a clear career progression path laid out for you? (e.g 'in 4-5 years, I can move on to this role and be on this pay band')


7. If you could go back in time to the beginning, would you make the same decisions that led to your current job? Or would you do something different?


8. Please state which of the 3 jobs you are doing, so I can make a decision 


I know these are very intrusive questions, and some people  may not answer them for various reasons. But if you can answer only one, I'll be very grateful!

Thanks a lot, and happy new year everyone!

y67xqu,Any 2022 grads having a hard time finding a job?,"I can't believe how hard it has been.

Last year, I received OAs and interviews from Facebook, Amazon, and HFT companies (and bombed them). I was already having a tough time in my CS course (I had never programmed nor was introduced to any CS concepts before uni) and barely passed my first year by 1-2 marks.

My evaluation from the above was: 

- **1-** There are enough job openings

- **2-** My CV is good enough to pass the first step (CV screening) of almost every job opening

- **3-** if I did enough LC before the OAs and interviews, I would be able to pass them

I was so naive...

- **Problem 1:** Many big companies are on a hiring freeze; so, there are not enough job openings this year

- **Problem 2:** My CV started failing the first step. I did a 3-month contracting job and a 2-week freelancing job this year while studying. I also reorganised [my CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xcz59_Mjl_1RSMQPyBnflcGaFieUp7PE/view?usp=sharing) so it looks more professional (and got validated by various employees from Google and similar companies)

- **Problem 3:** I did 119 LC questions (completed DS I, Algorithms I and almost all of Algorithms II) and still can't write code that passes all the test cases in the given OAs (my code usually passes 1-2 questions and a bit of the other one)

I knew I wasn't good, but this experience is _very_ humbling.

I started sending personal cover letters (which are validated by a few people who are experts in the area) and not sure if that changed anything.

**Overall, in the time span of 2 months, I:**

- did 110 LC questions

- sent >150 applications

- received 5 OAs (got rejected from 4, didn't start on 1)

- had 1 interview

- started therapy

mkr4yp,Should I ask for a pay rise after 2 years of working as a software engineer at my current company?,"To give context:

* Job Title: Software engineer
* Qualification: BSc Computer Science
* Professional Experience: ~5 years
* Employer: A very large essential service business (Deliberately vague for privacy)
* Location: North of England (Currently working from home)
* Salary: ~£40,000

As the title says, I have been working at my current company for almost exactly 2 years now and I am considering asking for a payrise. My motivation simply being twofold:

* Firstly, like most people, I would like to have money
* Secondly, cost of living in my city has risen sharply over the past year - most notably house prices. I am looking to buy a house and because my salary hasn't risen I am actually in a worse position to buy a house now than I was when I started the job.

I am hoping people here could give me advise on whether I should go ahead with approaching my manager to suggest a pay rise/review and aso how I can go about phrasing it.

Each year, my company does a pay review of all professional employees and assesses any payrises and bonuses. Last year, on my one-year anniversary, there was a modest bonus and cost-of-living salary increase; my payrise specifically was <1%. I questioned whether I got a below-inflation pay rise because of under performance and was assured that my performance was fine and it was unrelated. This year it has been announced that no employee will be given a payrise (however there has been suggestion that it can be petitioned for individual employees to be reviewed).

If I worked for a company that had been laying off or furloughing staff, I would not attempt this as it would be obvious that the company was struggling financially. But I know that even though the yearly targets of the company were not hit because of COVID, they still make very attractive profits and have continued to aggressively hire staff because of huge increases in demand.

Of course, I would not simply frame my request as ""I've worked here for 2 years, gimme money"". I think there are multiple arguments that show that I am worth extra money, such as:

*  Agreeing to be an on-call engineer for call-outs 24/7. I work 1 week on, 1 week off currently.
  * I have also voluntarily stayed up out of hours on system rollout days to monitor progress and to be able to react if something goes wrong.
  * I get paid modest standby payments for this, but in my opinion this simply covers my additional time spent monitoring and the general inconvenience. It is in no way a premium in compensation for me taking on greater responsibility in my role.
* I lead development and support tasks for a couple of lesser-known systems that I developed on a now disbanded team. And frequently onboard colleagues with those systems if they ever ask about or need to develop them in any way.
* When I was hired, they considered paying £40,000 for a person with `x` skills good value. 2 years on I have `x+y` skills through time invested at work and out of work so logically I am now worth more.
* I have submitted and achieved the recorded goals set between me and my line manager consistently since starting. Surely the point of goals is to develop an employee professionally. If these goals are being hit, then logically they are a more valuable employee and merit greater pay. If not, I see no value in these goals beyond being a box-checking exercise.

Given what I have said, does anybody have any advice on whether I should pursue this? I fear that unless I regularly push to make employers see my value, my compensation will stagnate. But, I do not want to make a fruitless effort and tarnish the relationship with my employer/manager in the process.

If you do think I should pursue it, what would be a reasonable figure?",2021-04-05 18:17:47

I've got no motivation to work, I find this codebase and the future features so dull, also my company industry is dull, but I look at other jobs in industries more in my interests (renewable energy etc) and still don't feel motivated to apply, I'm worried this codebase is the norm.

Out of my uni friendship group, only two have secured jobs so far, though they are both not the software dev jobs they wanted. (Data analyst).

Since August 2023 I have had 15 or so interviews - all of them being online. Also countless online assessment/behavioural interviews etc. I was final stage for 2 jobs but ended up not getting the offer which was disappointing. But this was back in August or so and nothing has come this far recently.

So I wanted to ask some questions to the others that are currently applying:

* What year did you graduate?
* How many interviews did you have so far? (actual video or in-person chats with the company)
* Do you have any job offers?
* Are you doing anything right now to keep up your programming skills?
* What are you finding is your most successful source of interviews? (linkedin, bright network etc.)
* Are you applying for every role, despite not being as qualified in a certain language?

16f05vk,Is going to university for computer science financially worth it?,"Reading around online, people sometimes say things like you don't need a degree to get into tech, or maybe that they know people doing well in their careers without a degree. And then there's the existence of non university options such as apprenticeships or potentially self teaching. It makes me question if going to university for computer science is really worth it.

The debt just feels like too much. I don't really know how to calculate it so this may be inaccurate, but I've seen figures like 50-70k with interest. And there were recent changes which apparently mean those starting this year are likely to pay more back, such as it now only being cancelled after 40 years. I know people say that you likely won't pay it all off, but I imagine it will add up to a huge amount over 40 years. What makes university worth that, especially considering the other options that exist? 

&#x200B;

I'm at the end of a gap year and I have a place for CS at Warwick starting this month, but even though it's a bit late, there's an urge to take a second gap year to try to do something else like an apprenticeship instead because of this.",2023-09-10 13:21:16

w10hbt,Is my partner being underpaid? Junior Full Stack Developer UK,"So my partner graduated from BSc Computing for Games with a 2.1 last summer. Been offered a Full Stack job for 22k/year in Brighton. Was due to rise 6 months after probation. He passed the probation but they told him ""he is still quite junior"" so they won't up his salary until the end of year, despite his contract saying it should have increased to 25k past probation. BUT it didn't. 

Now, he's been there 7 months and his mental health seems off, they don't offer him any mentorship and act very annoyed when he asks questions. He already had 2 full projects by himself and started a 3rd one. Plus doing tickets all the time. He wants to wait to have a full year experience and see if they bump him to 30k at the end of the year.

I work for the same company in a different department and I am on 30k (3 months in) as a Software Tester (no coding involved) I always get the impostor syndrome and I feel horrible seeing the way he is treated. Spoke to my own manager about the situation and he told me entry level engineers in my department get 30k before probation and between 32-35k past probation.

I know that he is being wronged as I checked with other people in the company. He now thinks he is just doing a bad job and his self-esteem got really low. He is also very anxious to start another conversion with them, as they didn't even say what he does wrong or what he could improve they only said ""you are still quite junior, but keep up the good work and do what you are doing and we'll look at your salary again at the end of the year"". I am feeling bad that I can't help him out and that he is OK to settle for this as he now doesn't belive he could get anything else. 

Are salaries really this low for a Junior Full Stack Developer with a BSc and 6months on the job? 

Also what could I do to help the situation as I am just worried and I really don't know how I could support him in this? He is super introverted and I wish they could see how much devotion he has to the job. (spent 15hours a week extra in unpaid  overtime so he wouldn't extend the deployment of his projects). I feel powerless as I cannot do the talking for him, and he won't battle with them because now he thinks he's shit.

At 30 years old, I decided to quit my relatively dead-end job in environmental monitoring/analysis, gained a CS masters degree and am now a data consultant at a medium sized tech consultancy based in London, earning double what I did before!

I see people often complaining about how just to stay afloat you must spend considerable time outside of work learning new technologies and keeping up to date.,"I have seen in reddit comments a common complaint about swe/software development as a profession, that you have to spend a lot of time ""keeping up with it"", and even that ""all of your spare time has to be dedicated to tech and keeping up with its fast pace of innovation"".

Something along those lines, there is a bit of personal projection I put in the last phrase from the consensus I've read online.

**My question:** 

**Is this true?** If so, what does this look like, going online in your spare time and tinkering with upcoming languages? And why is it moaned about as if it is exclusive to technology, isn't having to keep up with industry in your spare time a reality for pretty much every other industry? (at least technical ones)

I mention this as it seems like a big recurring trope told to people considering tech, and one of the things that separates people who genuinely have an interest in this industry to those who do not.

189vj3u,Job offer paying peanuts: worth it?,"I'm a post-grad non-stem student, looking to make a career change into software development. I have an offer to complete a L4 apprentiship paying £18k. I can afford it financially (partner earns well), and it sounds like I'll be able to learn alot. The future at the company would be about 3-4 years of low pay, so my intention would be to find a better paying job as soon as I've got the skills/experience. Currently not in London, but will be looking in London for next position. As the current market for entry level positions is so poor right now, I'm leaning towards this position being a good oppertunity to gain experience, and seeing pay as a longer-term investment. That said, being compensated so little will be challenging. 

I've been teaching myself now for 3 months, it's been going well. I focused on projects and conceptual understanding. This does mean that I only began working on algorthims / leetcode over the past couple weeks. This also means that unfortunately for me, I am too late for 2024 grad schemes, as I'm not quite up to passing their technical assessments. I did get to that stage for a couple of them, which is good for confidence, not all of them need stem degrees. 

Alternative apprentiships paying more doesn’t seem to be a worthwhile option for me. My experience makes me ineligible for quite a number of them, but more importantly, the start date wouldn't be for a while - by which time, I expect to be skilled up enough to be able to apply directly for entry-level positions, whether through this apprentice or through continued self-teaching of practicing leet code and more projects. Further, I'm not in a position that earning ~£25k will make it suddenly worthwhile for me. That said, if I were to take up this current offer, I wouldn’t be eligible to apply for better paying apprenticeships. 

I am a little hesitant that I am making a mistake by accepting a position compensating this little. I take confidence from being a potentially good candidate based on good degrees, getting through some grad schemes initial stages, and getting excellent feedback for the multiple interviews for the apprentice, perhaps indicating to me that if I just continued a little longer on leetcode and more projects, I'll be able to get an entry level position paying much more. Running the maths, I need a job paying ~£35k by ~June for there to be no financial difference in taking up this offer. Once being in the apprentiship it will definitely be harder to continue to work on finding a new job as applying can be a full time position in itself, although that won’t stop me from trying. 

In conclusion, I think it makes sense to take it up, but would be good to hear thoughts.",2023-12-03 15:14:02
178mgqw,Considering a MSc Computer Science Conversion,"I've been programming in my spare time for a few years now, with a few breaks here and there. I was close to enrolling on a £18k CS conversion course at my alma matter, but I pulled out as I started to have second thoughts about spending my entire savings, plus a postgraduate loan, on a 1 year course. Not to mention the high interest rates on that postgraduate loan, combined with the difficult market right now! 

I've built a few small side projects so far, these include...

* software to convert user-provided images into images consisting of character codes.
* a tool that allows semantic search via text vectorization to search through construction regulation documents. I'm interested in extending this to be able to analyze drawings / 3D models for code compliance, but it's a bit out of my depth right now.

I'm not really sure what the best way forward is. Should I keep on learning, building projects and perhaps aim for a cheaper MSc conversion course next year? I'm a bit worried at this point that the courses might just end up covering lots of stuff I've already done.

14jend1,Dilemma: very unhappy with a highly-paying tech job. What to do?,"35F, I am in London with a Skilled Worker Visa sponsored by AWS.  
My job role pays well (\~£140/150k at my current level, \~220k if I get promoted to the next).  
I hold a PhD in formal verification, which is a niche sector of CS that uses maths to prove that systems are correct. This expertise is quite theoretical and makes me worried that I will not easily be employable somewhere else.  
I was placed in a team that has no defined and stable project. We've spent the last year (and more) ""thinking"" about what to do and developing a (very poor quality) Java prototype for a bad tool that it seems no one inside the company needs. The team is new, none of us is very experienced, not even in coding (we have no SDEs -- only scientists in the team) and I feel like I'm not learning as I could have learned if I was placed in another team.   
I told my manager, and our VP, about this and I've asked to be moved to another team. They've asked me to please stay until we manage to see if this product will ever go anywhere... And they brought up promotion (like a ""reward""). If I endure, and stay for at least 6-9 more months, I might get promoted and my salary will be bumped to £220 (crazy!).

I know that I should be grateful for being in such a big established company and for having this salary; instead, I wake up every morning thinking that I want to quit and often want to cry when I get close to my work laptop... I've started doing therapy to learn how to cope with these feelings... 

To add to the stress, I'm in the process of buying a flat in London and will soon be committed to a mortgage. If I quit, I'll have 60 days to find another sponsor for the Visa and I'm pretty sure I'll never find another job that pays this well to keep up with the mortgage payments.

z9shh0,Leaving my job and abandoning a solo project,"Some background - I (23M) am nearing the end of my first year as a software engineer. I graduated in 2021 with a 1st in Computer Science. I have been building an app for a company for the past year, this opportunity started as a summer internship and ended up becoming full-time last January.

I have been working from home for the entire time and I can count the number of times I have gone into the office on one hand. I do not drive, although recently learned, the office is 50 miles away and after medical bills, that are not covered by the company, I cannot buy a car. (I earn £25500 before tax). Working from home has its perks, but it has been extremely isolating because the company is not structured in a way to allow for regular social interaction (I have spoken about problem with my line manager but there has been little change). I am the sole developer of the app so I do not interact with a team. I have a brief call with my line manager roughly one time a week.

I took up this job because I already had my foot in the door from the internship. I thought that building this app would be a great opportunity and while I have made significant progress, it is in development hell and I do not know when it will be released. I have made apps before, but this is the first major project I have worked on and I have been left to my own devices. The code quality is low and this is my fault, I was ignorant of the appropriate software design patterns to use for such a large project. There are bugs and sometimes it feels like I am spending my time just keeping it together. I do not omit the blame, but I am frustrated at the lack of management and direction. I have taught myself to code better as the project has gone on, but this means I am finding older code I have written to be insufficient, creating a cycle of refactoring.

One of my main concerns about staying in this position is that I am not learning the industry. The codebase used is Xamarin.Forms which I am well aware is becoming irrelevant and MAUI may have the same fate. I am not doing daily stand-ups or team meetings, and no fortnightly sprints. No one checks my code.

I am new to the industry and ignorant of lots of the best practices or what I should expect, so I do not know if my frustration is fully justified. 

Clearly, I have reached a tipping point, what stops me from leaving is two things:

\- The app is not finished and I do not see the company having the resources to continue development (their problem but still a concern, I do not want to burn bridges by abandoning the project). A year of hard work on an app that is never released is very disheartening to me and leads to my second point -

\- What would this look like on my CV? What will an employer think about the situation, will it reflect badly on me? I expect to take a break for a few months before applying for a new job.

Previously I have reasoned that I should just stick it out until the app is finished which COULD only be a few months away. But I am starting to just want out. Any advice is much appreciated, I am in a limbo on this decision.",2022-12-01 16:39:39

jkd9ad,Junior Web Dev - I struggle to find new job,"I am self taught developer. After a year of working in my first web dev job I have to moved to another in December to learn new things and the location was just so much better. The new company wasn't really good and I had little support learning knockoutJS. I had little training when it came to their product so I was struggling to navigate on the very thing I was working on. I have voiced it often (as example, client gets 3-7 days of training to use the software, I got just 2hours of training and the person who taught me said that they don't know what to teach me so they have showed me some random things which was obviously not enough). There was this weird thing where the manager would walk around and ask each person if they are ok but... he would skip me and ask me through chat if I am ok (providing he would remember to). As junior developer I had very little support and... I wasn't doing well. I still have finished my tickets on time but it just wasn't as good as I wished.

&#x200B;

To add it up, I got sick with Covid in March and since then I have been struggling a lot with my health (although I am much better now). I had multiple hospital stays between March and June and unfortunately due to that I have been fired (I have contacted citizens advice and since it was in probation period, I can't do anything about it).

&#x200B;

Now recruiters ask me in detail about my health (which I feel uncomfortable about). Do they have to ask details of my sickness? It feels like the way I lost my job puts me on massive disadvantage, any idea how I could improve my situation other than just working on my portfolio? Are there just so little junior developer job openings?",2020-10-29 16:27:45
is4eca,How easy/hard is it for a non-EU new grad to find a tech job in England during these times?,"Apologies if the question doesn't fit here. I'm a junior studying computer science in the U.S., and I'm looking to make somewhere my new home. Curious about two things:

1. How does tech hiring look like currently in England? What's the trend, with everything that COVID caused?
2. What are the chances of a non-EU citizen with a degree from an accredited U.S. institution to land an England-based tech job, assuming GPA is high and with a couple of relevant internships? Curious about your projections for one year from now, given the changes brought by Brexit.

1bc05ai,Progressing to higher paid dev roles,"28M here - I've got 4 years of experience in Application Support (which was kind of dead-end), then I worked for 18 months in a hybrid support developer/software developer role supporting internal business applications - our tech stack was pretty old and there were no code reviews or anything, but it was my first actual software engineering role. I'm now 2 months into a support developer role working with commercial software - it's a much more modern workplace - I get actual code reviews, we use version control properly, and most of our projects actually use CI/CD pipelines etc, unlike my old workplace, which was kind of a free-for-all.  
I have a couple of entry level Microsoft certifications (Azure Fundamentals and Azure Data Fundamentals) and an entry level cybersecurity certification (ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity). I'm also part way through a part time distance-learning degree in Computing with the University of London - I should be graduating in 2025.  
However, I'm still only on 32k, and ideally I'd like to be on a lot more than that within a couple of years. How can I achieve this?

1ainrv6,CS Conversion MSc - UCL or Bristol?,"Hi there,

I'm planning on taking a conversion masters in Computer Science, and am fortunate to have got offers from both UCL and Bristol. Both look like great courses, but I'm having difficulty deciding which one to go for, as there seem to be some differences in what is covered!

Bristol has one set of modules that everyone takes, which seems to be specifically geared towards software engineering. The main languages used are C and Java, and it covers all the fundamentals including algorithms, object-oriented programming, databases, computer architecture, and so on. (This is the course programme if interested: [https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/RouteStructure.jsa?byCohort=N&ayrCode=24%2F25&programmeCode=4COSC005T](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/RouteStructure.jsa?byCohort=N&ayrCode=24%2F25&programmeCode=4COSC005T))

UCL takes a slightly different approach, with some core modules and some optional, more specialised ones. Core modules are: programming, algorithms, databases, computer architecture, and app engineering, while the optional ones are: functional programming, interaction design, technology entrepreneurship and software engineering. The main language used is Python. (Link if interested: [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computer-science-msc](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computer-science-msc))

One of the main things I'm not sure about is which language would be more useful for me to learn. From what I've seen online, Python is most commonly used for data science, while Java is used more for enterprise software and Android apps. I'm not coming from a maths/science background, so I can't see myself going into data science - which makes me think Java would be a better route to follow. However, I've seen many people say the language doesn't matter as much as the concepts - so I may be putting too much focus on this?

I'm also aware that UCL is a bit more prestigious, and the course seems to have excellent links with industry which would potentially be a big advantage. I know that the market is very competitive at the moment, so anything that might give me an edge in being able to get a job at the end of the course could be key!

I'd really appreciate any advice or perspectives on this, especially from anyone who's taken one of these courses.

16hoi8b,Are there any recent Northcoders grads here?,"Hi,

I'm posting here since AskUK removed my post.

I secured one of the free spots in the cohort that starts at the end of November.  I heard it has a great reputation but I guess I'm getting cold feet now. I'm really worried whether I'll be able to get a job as a developer. And since it's full-time remote course I'd have to quit my job. I've asked for their grads employment stats and the figure they've given me, although very high, is the same as the one in another thread from 2019, which makes me worried they are using old figure (which they must have some reason for...). 

I have been learning on my own for over a year (with some breaks - strangely giving up for a few months and then coming back to it is what made me realise I really pursue this, though I still suffer from slumps and lows) alongside working full-time in a physically intensive job. I have been following The Odin Project (finished up to the Restaurant Page project and have done a bunch of reading ahead as well). I've also finished all the Precourse exercises required before the bootcamp. I don't consider myself to be good at it but it gives me an immense joy when I create something from scratch and make it work or manage to figure something out (especially after spending an eternity bashing my head on the wall). 

I graduated during pandemic, was struggling with mental health, and have an unrelated degree that I have never used nor have an intention of entering that field at this point. I'm a bit awkward, lack confidence (which I'm sure you can already tell) and my soft skills are not the best but I've managed to improve a ton.

I applied to the bootcamp after I was rejected from Code First Girls which would have came with a job offer before the start of the course (which would have been such an amazing opportunity...). I have a fast-track application in progress for the next CFG cohort, but the company is dragging their feet on the application process, so I doubt I'll find out whether I get rejected or not before Northcoders starts. I also applied to some apprenticeships and tester roles, but was rejected as well.

My other reasons for applying are as follows: 
-having deadlines I cannot ignore to help with my inconsistent, slow pace
-getting to experience pair and group programming
-help with the hiring process, polishing CV, interview prep, etc.

Are there any recent Northcoders grads(or any other bootcamps) or self-taughts here who would be willing to share their experience with bootcamps and whether they manged to secure a role in tech afterwards?

Is it still possible to get into tech as a bootcamp grad/self-taught at this point?

I spent the past 6 months working on a big personal project, and some people have said that recruiters don't even look at personal projects so there's no point. Or maybe its just a certain niche of recruiters who do.

The lack of stress is actually what scares me. Stress has always reminded me that I'm on the right track, but I'm not feeling any stress now. Only ambiguity. I wish there was someone who would just tell me what to do and if I do it, I'll end up in a job.",2023-06-08 18:43:26

y7szgn,CV style/length/advice for UK vs US,"Edit: Thanks everyone, this is great advice, exactly what I was looking for.


I'm currently working in the US but looking to move back to the UK. I've seen and received conflicting advice for CV style and length in the UK

The recommended resume style/length in the US is a single page with experience in reverse chronological order.

I thought the length and style was similar in the UK. I asked a friend in the UK for advice. He's fairly senior and had just moved to a new company, so he has fairly recent experience in the job market.

He suggested that my resume was too short, that I should add more detail and sell myself more. He shared his resume with me. It's 3 pages of career experience in reverse chronological order with some personal information. Each job has a paragraph or so describing what he did with some bullet points to highlight certain achievements.

If he was some rando saying this I would probably just trust my gut and ignore his conflicting advice, but he's no idiot and is pretty successful.

I checked in this sub and what I found seems to mirror my opinion, that a CV should be short and to the point or it'll get thrown in the trash.

Are there some good places to look at example CVs? Searching gives me a whole range of CVs but nothing to suggest whether any of them are any good, or if they'll help me get a job or not.

Are there any must haves or any real no nos for a senior developer's CV in the UK?

* How long should my resume be?
* How far back should I go with my experience?
* Should I list skills/languages used in each job, in a separate section?
* Should I include more detail on more recent work experience or similar detail all the way back?
* Should I include my A-levels and GCSEs, or just my degree?
* What about personal information?
   * Name and e-mail I understand, address seems a little bit irrelevant. Marital status seems like an outright intrusion of privacy.
   * I'm a British citizen so I'm guessing that I should make sure that's clear in either the CV or a covering letter so they don't think they need to sponsor a visa.
   * Hobbies and interests seems to be something that's normal on CVs in the UK. It seems like something really weird after working in the US. They avoid anything like that in a resume like the plague.

Finally, is there any value to using a resume writing company? I have some great experience but I'm pretty crap at selling myself. I could give the details, but not necessarily make it sound great. If I could tell someone what I've worked on and have them create an amazing CV, that would be great.",2022-10-19 04:39:30

My current employer will not be able to accommodate this move and I'll need to find a new gig. I'll try to keep this brief. Some context about my situation:

* Move is for my wife's work, her company is sponsoring her Visa. I will not need sponsorship and will be able to work wherever I please on a spouse visa, which is nice.  
* Current role is Lead Software Engineer, 6 years Dev experience (mainly .NET, React, TypeScript and Azure Cloud) with 8 additional years of semi-relevant corporate experience.  
* Seeking another Lead role or a Senior-level IC role. Ideally remote but given my situation I realize I likely can't be picky. Plus, it might be nice to have some coworkers to socialize with as I will have no friends.  
* Currently making 140k USD in the US. I understand that I will take a large pay cut for this time in the UK.  
* I will also be applying for US-based roles but given the time difference and current market, I am not holding my breath
* Will be living in Surrey/Hampshire, ideally within 30-45 minutes of London by train.  

I have done loads of research already, but as I begin my job search, I have several questions, hoping this community can help me out and either assuage or validate my concerns.  

1. Would I have a better chance of finding a job once I am officially residing there? I'd love to start applying for jobs now in advance, but wondering if I will be screened out immediately. 
2. How likely am I to encounter Leet-code style interview questions? It seems they are on the rise in the US. I am admittedly terrible at them. I firmly believe I make up for it with my work ethic and soft skills, but it's definitely a weakness of mine.  
3. What is a reasonable salary expectation? I am hoping for ~80k+ GBP but it seems that could be unrealistic.  
4. Would it be wise to reach out to London-based recruiters now, given my lack of network there?  
5. Would Azure Cloud certs hold any weight/give me any advantage?  
6. Any other advice?  

I'd really appreciate any and all feedback - even if it's pessimistic. I'm legitimately concerned about being able to find work given the market conditions and my foreigner status.

198tn4b,Is it worth learning Go?,"I currently work as a software engineer for a financial service company in the city and I work mainly with C#, ASP.NET, Angular, SQL and Azure DevOps/Azure. I have 4.5 years of experience and my salary was recently increased to £70k and received a £16k bonus. Employer pension contributions are also quite good.

I'm getting a bit bored and would like to work for another company, but I don't find a lot of opportunities where the compensation is clearly better or even equally good for my current amount of experience. There are some, but I feel I'm on the high end for a .NET developer with 4.5 years of experience.

I've seen some Go opportunities though where salaries are £30k higher than what I get and a similar amount of experience seems required, just with different tools. In the end I don't really care what tools I'm using as long as the job is interesting.

To that end I have several questions:

* Are Go jobs paid better in general than C# jobs?
* How realistic is it to pick up Go and get hired as a software engineer with 4.5 years experience rather than a Go developer with 0 years experience?
* How is it to work with Go? Is the work interesting, boring, challenging?
* Any pitfalls I need to watch out for?

Thanks a lot.",2024-01-17 10:37:11

18dnufs,Leetcode prep buddies?,"Hey,

We have a small Leetcode Discord group where most of us are beginners (or university students) but we have some more experienced members too.

&#x200B;

We host mock interviews to do some job prep every Saturday, so far we have been hosting them for a whole year.

Ideally, you are from PST/EST or EU as most of our members are from there. It is mostly oriented towards European/American folks as that's the primary timezone we have members from but everyone is welcome!

&#x200B;

It would be awesome if we had more members so we can host mock interviews most consistently, so feel free to join if you would like to get some prep. 

&#x200B;

All levels welcome. If you would like to join, PM me with a short intro of yourself (include your timezone if possible) and I will send an invite your way.

167berx,Recent graduate with no experience looking for advice on finding a grad job,"I have recently finished my MSci Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence degree at the University of Nottingham. I obtained a first class degree and have done well academically but I have not got any work experience in the field. The only work experience I have is an 11 day placement as a teaching assistant at a primary school.

I am currently looking for graduate software engineer and other related jobs in Nottingham but I am finding it quite hard to find any. 

I have a few questions regarding my job search:

1. Is it realistic that I would be able to find a graduate job in the current job market with my current qualifications/experience? 

2. What is the best way to search for graduate positions? I am currently using Gradcracker, Indeed, and LinkedIn but I am not getting much success. 

3. Is it a bad idea to focus on finding a graduate job in Nottingham/the East Midlands? This is very much where I would like to be located due to my partner working and living there.

135lf6q,Is it normal for recruiters to want this much information?,"I have never had a good experience with a recruiter. Every single one that I have ever spoken to has wasted 15 minutes with me on the phone, and then told me the job I applied for is unsuitable for me after taking my information. Every job that they have reached out to me about is also completely irrelevant (I have 1 yoe mostly using python, and I somewhat regularly get contacted saying that I would be a ""good match"" for a senior role that is fully in-office hundreds of miles away from me that requires 5+ years of experience in a language I have never used).

However recently I applied to one job through a recruiter and for the first time, they are actually willing to send my application to the company. But they are asking for a lot of information before they do:

- an editable copy of my CV so that they can add to it
- my home address
- my previous salary and a list of all benefits
- at least two references from previous employers with their contact details
- a list of all the days off that I have taken in the past year and the reasons for each one
- a photograph of my passport

This is what they are requiring *just to submit my application to the company*. I might not even get an interview or be considered at all. Also this is for a junior role that requires no experience and has a listed salary of £25k. I have also not been given any details of what the job will involve other than ""The successful candidate will work with and be mentored by senior developers, and will report to the project manager"" and the language that they use.

I had managed to secure a placement but it got cancelled due to covid so I didn't get the experience I needed. I applied to jobs but failed interviews because I was shit at them and despite doing well in programming modules I struggled with programming tests.  I am locked into the Leeds area so I restricted myself heavily.

I had bad social skills and didn't get the support I needed. And I do blame Covid for a lot of things. I was out of work for around 6 months. I managed to secure an internship in Project Management as I thought it might be IT I like and not programming but I realised I miss the challenge of programming and this job is not challenging at all for me. It did boost my confidence and social skills which is a plus 

I am very confused on how to proceed, brings me a lot of stress just thinking about it. I don't know what part of IT I want to go in Networking, Software engineering, Testing etc. I have the options of further studying a masters whilst working on personal projects to better my programming skills.

lkrfop,Feel out of my depth and too afraid to apply for jobs,"  
Hello, so I'm 27F and from Manchester! I did my first degree in English Lit from 2011-2014 but then decided to do a 'Conversion' Master's degree in Computer Science in 2017. It was one year and we did some webdev (this was my favourite aspect and I think what I want to do as a job), Java, SQL etc. I feel like it's kinda given me a ticket to a tech-related job but not necessarily the skills to back it up.  


I graduated and got a Distinction BUT... I haven't gotten a job in the industry and haven't tried. Not going to bore you with the details but basically: depression/PTSD (armed robbery in my last job) and both parents got cancer. But now I want to move on!  


As it's been so long since I did Computer Science related stuff (aside from some messing around with webdev and attending a few webdev related clubs in my city) I feel out of my depth and absolutely unready to enter a job in the industry (and I already felt like this on my graduation day let alone years later).   


I don't even really feel confident about what is required to get a webdev job. I'm 28 this year and have put my life off for so long... I just desperately want to get on the career ladder but could do with some advice. I'm thinking of looking at apprenticeships even.   


Could anybody guide me in any way? Regarding skills required for a Front End job I'm imagining HTML/CSS and JavaScript of course, maybe Bootstrap and/or something else? And what specifically should I feel confident in when it comes to JavaScript? I feel like I learn Js concepts when studying online but not necessarily how they'd be applied in a day to day job.  


I'm having a really hard time with the uncertainty of it all. I've heard many times that employers basically assume graduates know nothing... but what SHOULD I know? If I could (and we weren't in a pandemic), I wish I could just shadow a developer in their job for a week and just watch... see what's required of them and what their daily life is like!  


My plan is to get my skills up to muster and apply for jobs in a few months, if possible. Any help would be much appreciated.


EDIT, 2022 - did a coding bootcamp in 2021, got two job offers the following week. Got a job. Have been doing it for 7 months. Got my first payrise. Life is good.",2021-02-16 00:33:17

I've been working as a trainee actuary for 2.5 years in London and have been wasting my 20s away studying for exams.

I've done some basic scripting with Python before.

I want to switch jobs from my grad scheme to somewhere where I learn better practices in a more standard environment, but I feel like I'm too slow and don't know enough.

ultrabrief cv:

- 1.5 years on grad scheme 


- this included 6 months of refactoring/ optimising c# code to process payments in a small team


- 6 months building an internal webapp on AWS which processes transaction logs to create KPIs (cloudformation, cloudwatch, dynamoDB, IAM, Cognito, Lambda, s3, secretsmanager, APIGateway, Python etc). working alone 

- 6 months on the automation of testing internal services using Python and BDD

- Built & deployed a personal webapp using fastapi and postgresql


Due to being new to SWE and a graduate on a grad scheme I feel like the roles have been kind to me while I take my time to understand the work and the structure of the code etc, but if I got a 'normal' job I would be so out of my depth.

It's been near impossible to get a job since then and this week I'm relieved to have finally been offered a role at Snap in their London office which I accepted.

As grateful as I am, I do wonder if this was the best choice or whether I should have continued interviewing for other roles.

In terms of compensation, I was at £74k at Microsoft and Snap are paying £80k, though I was hoping for something in the £85-90k range based on my experience.

However, the biggest dilemma is that I could technically WFH every day at Microsoft and I finished at 5.30pm but Snap want everyone in the office 4 days a week until 6pm which means I'll hardly see my kids who are still little and will be getting ready for bed by the time I'm home.

Part of me says to just count my blessings and see this as a stepping stone but another part says I could have got a better deal if I was more patient.

What does everyone else think?

I'm Irish with a bachelor's and a masters, but have had 0 luck over the past number of months. I'm trying to keep my motivation up but it's proving to be rather difficult. 

My masters degree is in Interactive Media, which I finished late last year. And my bachelors is in Computer systems. My only experience was a 6 month placement as a SD nearly 6 years ago. Besides that, I've mainly worked in retail up until the start of this year. I immigrated to Canada to find work there after having 0 luck in Ireland but after 6 months I moved to the UK. Throughout the 9 months I've only had 4 interviews, all which fell through by either getting ghosted or the recruitment process was put on hold until further notice. 

I've had friends review my CV and I've been given tips on changes etc., along with setting up my GitHub and trying to add projects to that. But between job hunting and keeping my motivation up to continue searching, I've no idea what to do. I feel if I work on projects I'm not really focusing on job searching, and if I don't then I've nothing to showcase my work.

All I want is a break, one company to just say ""Yes, we'll give you this opportunity and take you on"". Just one. In anything. I just need to get into the industry but I feel like I'm barely being given the opportunity to try, and when I do get an opportunity I feel as though I'm f'ing it up somehow.

It's damn tiring, I'll tell you that much. Why is finding a job after graduating so damn difficult?

I know people can be searching for months to years, but it also feels like no one really talks about the impact it can have on ones mental health. I've always been a patient and motivated person, but the last 9 months has tested me and I'm at a loss not having that apart of me anymore.

14wx1c0,"Graduate software engineer, looking for advice","I (23F) completed a Computer Science and Mathematics Bachelors degree (2019 - 2022) at the University of Exeter and received a 2:1. I got a 1st on my dissertation (built a web app in React and Node.js).   
  
I've just finished a PGCE in secondary mathematics at the University of Bristol (currently unemployed). I thought that I would love to be a teacher, but this past year has been an eye opener and I don't think that a career in teaching is suited to me. I also really miss programming and whilst teaching I didn't have much time to do this.   
  
So, I'm now looking for software engineering / dev roles instead, but I'm filled with self-doubt. I'm not sure how much I should expect to earn for a first job and I don't have any commercial experience, only University projects and a personal project I've been working on. It's also been a year since I completed my Bachelors degree which is an extra year without any development experience. Despite this, is it likely that I will find a software dev / software engineering role any time soon? As I'm currently unemployed I'm naturally anxious at the idea that I won't be able to find anything.

I did super well on all of the interviews, matched what they needed to a tee and smashed all of tech tests, but they couldn't get approval for my contract with higher ups, I think they've since entered a hiring freeze.

Both me and the recruiter were devasted. She said it's been happening more and more to her. It's like they want to appear to staff to be hiring but not actually hiring.

I've spent a few years in my first job making stuff in game engines, but I'm thinking of moving towards more ""traditional"" software dev...

None of my applications have passed the CV stage yet, which I can understand as I don't have the ""n+ years shipping production software in language y"" every job posting seems to have, but maybe there's a way to approach this kind of role change that I don't know about? Hoping I haven't accidentally locked myself into game engine roles by this point.

Just to make things worse for myself my hobby projects aren't web projects either. I can go and make something new in my spare time, if that's the best way to spend it.

What do you think is the best strategy for this situation?

Thanks for reading!

Edit for others in this situation: I now have one offer for a junior back end role and am waiting for a potential second offer (junior full stack) next week before making a decision. In the CV versions that got me through, I used a statement of enthusiasm as described below, as well as namedropping nearly every software technology I had come into contact with. I think that was enough to get my foot in the door and I wasn't asked anything particularly deep about them, but obviously don't risk namedropping something if you don't know about it. I also started a relevant personal project a couple of weeks before these interviews so I was able to talk about that a bit, and admitting that I was learning in spare time rather than at work didn't bother them. Once you have their ear they treat you like anyone else, with the tech tests and culture interviews and stuff, but you can make the most of your slightly unusual background to stand out.",2023-06-05 18:22:10
13wwv1q,New Grad Advice + CV Review Please,"Hello Everyone!!

**!!CAREER ADVICE!!**

I am currently pursuing my studies in the UK with an anticipated graduation date in July 2023. Earlier this year, I received a full-time job offer, only for it to be rescinded in March due to visa-related complications within the company.

Between January and March, I was under the impression that my post-graduation plans were secured, and as a result, I slowed down my job hunting efforts—a lesson I have since learned from. During this period, I applied to a couple of MSc AI programmes, but given the late timing of these applications, I am not holding high hopes for acceptance.

At this point, I am seeking your valuable advice on which path to take. I currently have two confirmed possibilities:

* Pursue an Integrated MSc in Computer Science at my current university, which includes an industrial placement. I have already secured a place in this course as a contingency plan.
* Apply for a graduate visa post-graduation, and intensify my job search efforts, focusing primarily on new graduate and junior roles within the UK. I will have some money saved from my part-time employments but I am not sure how long.

**!!CV REVIEW!!**

To date, I have applied to over 200 jobs. Although I've been successful in advancing past the initial stage in most cases, I seem to hit a roadblock in the subsequent stages. I am an international student

I would greatly appreciate any guidance or suggestions on my job search strategies. Also, I'm in need of critical feedback on my CV. Here is the link to my current CV [https://imgur.com/a/7ue557H](https://imgur.com/a/7ue557H).

10kgvi4,"Cross post to a more specific sub - I'm 23, I just got let go from my first CS job that I started at 7 months ago, kinda at a loss."," Hi everyone, as the title says, this morning I was pulled aside after I pushing my last bit of code and told my the department head and the owner of the company that I was being let go. They made it clear that it was a management issue that had then cascaded down into me receiving as well as other new starters receiving minimal training (they use a custom propriety codebase). thankfully i had passed my probation period early due to producing rather a lot in a short space of time, if i hadn't then i would of been show the door with no exit pay. I was told to leave then and there, not to talk to anyone, to leave my access card on my desk and to see myself out, felt kind of like i was disposable sadly. Some of the other devs, especially the two that trained me initially were very surprised and rather shocked to hear this, and I'm not sure what the company is going to do now, considering that upper management are not devs, never have been, and now a rather big chunk of their devs have been let go.

The main point they were getting across to me at time of the meeting was that i wasn't a good fit for a company of that size, and that i would benefit from a larger organisation that has a more robust and dedicated training regime.

Not sure where I'm going with this post, i think i just want to air it out a little as it was not coming, still a bit flabbergasted at it all, has anyone else had something similar? How did you deal with it.",2023-01-24 21:31:22
10gu9sn,"I'm almost 5 years into my ""promotion"" with no payrise, What would you do?","So I'll try and be as clear as possible, vague as required and as short as I can.

Almost 5 years ago the company that I had already worked for, for 10 years advertised for 2 new positions. One was a new team leader role of my department (maintenance engineering) the other was a engineering project manager as we design machines and tools in house. I was approached by the manager of the department and was encouraged to apply for the design engineer position. I was told this would be a good opportunity as they were looking for someone to takeover the current designer who was nearing retirement but that after I had learned the system I could then decide if I wanted to train in automation control to take over from contractors in this position or to stay and train further as the designer. I was told regardless of my choice I would get a substantial payrise.

So I applied and got the job of apprentice to the project engineering manager. I learned quickly and was soon working alongside the current project engineering manager (Tony) completing the same tasks. After one year I was requested to sign a new contract moving me from hourly to salary pay.  My hours changed from 39 to 40 hours per week and my salary was equivalent to 40 hours x 52 weeks of my previous hourly rate. My title on the new contract was project design engineer. Also in this time I put forward for courses in automation control but these were never approved or even discussed.

Two years later (Tony) announced his retirement and a couple months later finished at the company. During those months anything outstanding was passed over to me. I then took over all responsibilities of this role. I also took additional responsibilities that were previously taken care of by the team leader and manager of the engineering department as some   people changed roles. After a year I decided to discuss a salary review as other than a few small pay increases that were inline with inflation I had not had a pay rise equal to the new role I was doing. My manager agreed that it was fair to request this and wanted to set a meeting with HR but mentioned as there was some roles changing including a new engineering manager it may have been better to wait. HR jumped on this info and said we would wait and it didn't matter as decisions on pay wouldn't take place until 2 months after. 

The new engineering manager (Sandy) joined and after a short time I filled her in on my situation. She continued where we had left off and requested a meeting with HR to discuss. The meeting didn't go well and ended with that we would wait a few more months for the Sandy to observe my contributions to the company. After a time Sandy was very pleased with my work but the company had put a stop to all spending for whatever reasons and she felt it wasn't a good time to ask. Half a year later she left the company and there was a internal promotion for a new engineering manager, as you might imagine I'm back to where I was a year previous but as of yet have not asked HR again about this. I've filled in the new manager but they haven't done anything to progress. Now I'm wondering what to do. The more I think about it the more annoyed I get and its extremely hard to put any effort into my job.

Some underlying information on this is that before Sandy retired she made me aware that I was on the same yearly salary as my previous role of maintenance engineer and that it wasn't when based on a 40 hour week anymore it was equal to their 39 hour week. I don't know when this happened but it possible that for 2 years I've technically given an extra hour a week without being paid for it. Also the other job advertised was given an extra £4k of the bat.

Is it time to leave? Should I look into legal right to equal pay for this position? Am I entitled to the hour that I'm no longer being paid for? Any legal course of action against the fact I've given 5 years of my life towards a career I thought would be financially worth it?",2023-01-20 11:09:59

Recently my feature team lost its tech lead, and is now losing a very senior mid. I am the last one left on this feature team who knows Python and the architecture of the feature we build, since we're pretty isolated from the rest of the business. 

I've discussed with the mid who is leaving, and he thinks I'm ready to be a mid level (I run a community of interest, I help mentor newer devs, and I'm a pretty independent coder). Further, like, it would be weird for the most knowledgable member of a feature team to be a junior, right? 

Even further, when my boss officially told me my mid was leaving, even he said it's a great time to ""ask for things"". I think it's safe to say they want to incentivise me staying.

my problem is I'm not sure what to ask for. I know the salary that I want: £65000+. But I'm not sure if that's too high or a lowball. I'm curious what other London mids are making.

For transparency, £65k is the number my husband and I agree would be enough for him to be okay with quitting his job to stay at home should the need arise (kids happen, his job starts to suck more or asks him to move, etc). I like working, he hates it, so this is a goal of ours. But I feel like I’m in a position where I can shoot for the moon.

uppkgm,Advice on leaving graduate scheme part way through,"As the title says, I need some advice regarding my current situation.

About 8 months into a graduate scheme at a company transitioning into tech. Grad scheme is as a software engineer and follows the structure of 3 placements over 2 years, 2 six months and one 12 months. First 2 are picked for you with the 12 month you get a say (but can't go to a team you have already been in).

The company is in a weird place with lots of internal politics. Basically there aren't many teams that do 'proper' software engineering and I have been fortunate to have been in 2 of those very few teams that do. First one in node.js express typescript with k8s, current with Java, Sprint Boot, k8 etc etc. Both been great, really enjoying spring and java.

The likelihood of me getting a placement of similar quality to develop is low.

I have been toying with the idea of moving company and continue backend (java spring boot), but don't have the strongest DS&A skills, but other grads in my cohort have managed to secure roles elsewhere with 20%+ more compensation.

If I leave I would have 8 months professional experience developing software, this is for the UK btw!

Initially I was thinking about continuing in my current team for the remainder of the placement (4 months) and then leaving, but I am wondering whether I should just start looking now? I have seen roles at Capital One for instance which I have read are big on tech and pay significantly more than I am currently on.

uavs5j,Self teaching programming but considering doing conversion Masters - Birmingham or Cardiff?,"Hi. I am a relatively young guy (early 20s) who graduated from a good uni with a humanities undergraduate degree in 2020, but now feels some regret about not having pursued programming or computer science earlier. To rectify that I have been self teaching Python and JavaScript for a little while now and have managed to build a small portfolio of 4 projects, which I aim to continue working on.

Naturally I'd like to get a job in the tech/developer space. In an ideal world I'd like to achieve that without going back to uni but I recognise that in practice things would be easier if I had a relevant qualification. 

I have been into conversion MSc programmes and the courses offered by the University of Birmingham and the University of Cardiff appeal to me as they seem somewhat more project based than others. They're also somewhat more affordable than universities like Bristol, which I think would be too expensive for me.

Between Birmingham and Cardiff, which course do you think would be better and provide me with the better prospects? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who studied at these universities. I am also interested in hearing if anyone is aware of any other universities which offer good project-based conversion MScs in software development or computer science. 

Alas, my choices for conversion Masters are limited by the fact that I have never been really good at maths. I was also really silly when I was choosing my A-Levels and chose not to do A-Level Maths, which I recognise now was a bad idea. Nevertheless I have always been interested in learning to do programming and, as I said, have developed a few things independently and continue to learn in my own time.

I’ve been applying for jobs for the past 4 months and I’ll get phone call interviews that go well but then they never contact me again, or I’ll do the hackerrank assessments that are sent to me, pass every question and get a rejection.

I thought the MSc might help but so far it’s done nothing.

Also I’ll get reviewers asking for 2 or 3 years experience which whilst I do have that in personal projects, it apparently only counts for commercial projects. 

I always write a cover letter and have a GitHub portfolio with projects that use Python (Flask), e-commerce websites (React and Vue), GOlang projects, Java projects, android apps, and Unity games.  

Anyways, does anyone have any tips. I must have applied to every graduate/junior dev role on Glassdoor, LinkedIn and indeed and not made it very far.

I have had a few interviews and I always think that the interview went great but after I just get reply saying they don’t want me. 

I have been trying to relearn python, but I can’t even do the easy questions on leetcode. I feel like I’m don’t have hope. I feel like I’m not getting anywhere.

He retrained a couple years ago and spent almost 10 years in hospo before that so he’s not new to the workforce but still a junior dev. 

I’m trying to figure out ways to help him. Are there any known networking events he could go to or recruiting agencies that actually work and don’t ghost you? He’s applied for 170 roles and had 1 interview. Any advice appreciated ",2024-03-26 21:28:02

I have an old version of my CV that I've sent off everywhere I've been applying and a newer version that I've just worked on now. 

Also worth noting that anything under ""Relevant Experience"" is freelance, done with handshake agreements. Clients ask for support, we help and get paid for the work we do. Removed the support role from the new one, since it felt less relevant and I could put a project I'm working on and will have finished by summer instead (Discord Bot). My ""employer"" is happy to act as a reference.

1b92t25,"How to navigate the job market when my ""YOE"" don't match my abilities?","I'm currently coming to the end of a fixed term 2 year graduate scheme at a big(ish) name american bank. I did 6 months of analytics, mainly using Tableau, then a year of software engineering where I joined a team who 95% use a low code no code solution. I've managed to avoid using that and have almost exclusively used Python. 

My main issue is I am the only one using python, so my code reviews consisted of talking the lead through my code, there was never any feedback given. Because of this I feel I don't actually know very much about best practices or what code would look like elsewhere as I've essentially been given free reign without guidance.

I'm now coming to the end of my grad scheme and they've told me they intend on keeping me on assuming they can get headcount and funding etc. However I'm going to start applying because I don't feel I'm learning as much as I could. I would have left earlier however I really like my team, I see myself being long-term friends with almost all of them including my manager who I've told about my frustrations and has helped by setting up a mentorship with a ""proper"" SWE in San Francisco at the same company but im not allowed to join their team so there's no hands on experience.

How should I go about applying when I feel I'm essentially a grad still despite 2 YOE and likely wouldn't come close to passing a technical interview?

Bonus question: what should I focus on learning in my own time? At the moment I'm doing a bit of leetcode and trying to teach myself Flask and Angular.

Tldr: haven't had any guidance over the 2 years as the team I joined as a graduate only used a low code no code tool.",2024-03-07 19:15:09

1b0gx2w,Simple system design interview for internship,"Hi guys,

I have a technical interview coming up, and they haven’t revealed much but from what I’ve gathered it will look like a simple system design interview. However, I’m pretty sure they also said that we will need knowledge of one programming language. 

My question is, how do you approach these types of questions? For example “Design a system that alerts a user when they have been paid”. I know for this role they’re not looking for knowledge of databases or SQL or any of that (luckily).

But how do I structure my answer? Where would writing code/pseudocode come into this? Any general tips for these types of interviews? Anything is appreciated - thanks!",2024-02-26 13:00:03
1aq90sg,Advice on Transitioning from Student to Systems Architect – Building a Career in Distributed Systems Design,"**Background:**

I found Distributed Systems truly fascinating (not limited to cloud computing). For example, understanding how Google Spanner operates, the consensus algorithm it employs, and the reasons behind its functionality intrigues me.

Also, I am currently in my final year, I've received a master's offer from a renowned university that offers several modules on Distributed Systems. I believe this opportunity will allow me to delve into the subject and fill the knowledge gaps I currently have.

**Goal + Question:**

I wanted to explore how to turn this interest into a career. My goal is not just to be someone who utilises existing microservices, but rather to be someone who designs, builds, and enhances these systems. It seems to me that these kinds of jobs only exist at big companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. I don't believe I can secure a position at these companies, especially in the roles I aspire to, without relevant experience. How could I gradually work my way into that line of work?  


**TLDR**: 3rd year student who doesn't know much about the industry. How can I progressively transition into a role where I design, build, and enhance distributed systems, rather than just being someone who utilises existing microservices?",2024-02-14 00:12:13

1afkr2w,Wage Negotiation Advice,"(Throwaway account) So, I’m a junior dev earning between 30-35k. I’m ready to be a mid-level dev and have been working at this level, my manager knows this, and is aware of (and happy) with an impending promotion expectation within the next 6 months. My manager is very comfortable in negotiations and has verbally said in related conversations that he prefers improvement over high-turnover. However, I have only been at this company \~7 months.   
I’m feeling the pinch financially at the moment, so in order to get a good sense of what I’m worth, and to prepare for the upcoming wage negotiation in a few months, I interviewed to another job which pays much better, \~50k.  
Surprisingly, I have received an offer from the new job, and the money would massively improve my quality-of-life, however, I really enjoy my current job (minus the wage), and feel that the new role would be a step-down in terms of enjoyment.  
So, my question, Should I:  
A) Quit my job, and get the higher paying role, risking a potentially less daily enjoyment.  
B) Stay in my current job, turn down the offer, and hope they offer a big wage increase when I get a promotion in a few months.  
Or C) Negotiate my wage now, early, hoping for a counter-offer from my current job.  
Bonus points if you have any tips at having the Option C conversation with my current manager.

I only recently started looking for a job, but already I’m finding it a trend where I’ll pass HR and cognitive tests just fine, but when it comes to coding tests anything higher than an easy level on Codewars I can’t do in the time frames, if at all.

My conversion course was great for computer architecture stuff, but the coding aspect was reaaaally basic. It’s been suggested that I could do a bootcamp since they’re more about the coding, but I don’t want to spend another £10k+ to start from the basics again and find myself in the same position in 3 months time.

I’ve bought [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/) which I’m hoping will help, and I’m going to do Codewars daily, but what else can I do to be interview/job ready?

15kzuej,I feel under experienced for a job offer,"My educational background is in visual arts but due to a difficult job market I found myself moving into QA as an entry level in one of the Big 4 (not London) so you're talking a huge company with thousands of employees in our office alone.

I've spent two years in my role and have had a scattering of manual testing projects and learning the fundamentals but also have been put on a few fluff not really technical projects. This was fine while I was finding my feet and still learning the ropes. Then the last half a year or so I was put onto a project working as an SDET and I absolutely loved it before I was abruptly ripped off it due to end of tax year resourcing shake ups. 

I'm now in a dilemma because I am again on the precipice of an engagement thats another ""fluff"" project so I started putting the feelers out for other opportunities. I'm currently at the stage in a new job application where I feel I am on the precipice of an offer but I'm very on the fence about my experience level and capability for the job.

They're a small-mid size company that are starting to expand and want to bring a QA in - however the vibe I get is that they would want me to build up an entire test framework and team from basically scratch (asides from some initial automation frameworks and manual testing artifacts) and which I feel I may be a little out of my depth on at this stage. 

Pros are of course doing something I love and am interested in, being somewhat in charge of my own work and knowing the framework inside out and back to front from day one, significant salary increase if offered (30k to 40k which is near impossible to work up to with my current employer due to being such a bottom heavy structure) almost 100% remote working, private healthcare, not being ping ponged between random projects that aren't even tech, less guff and bureaucracy to deal with.

Cons are that I have ADHD and I'm worried I could sink or swim in a role like this, that I haven't enough experience, my 3 month notice period meaning I'll need to start the role with basically only a few months to go until I get married (I'm not a crazy stressed bride but I don't know if I could handle a whole new job on top of that immediate lead up to it) I may potentially lose out on a bonus from my current role (£1500) and while their job ad mentions private healthcare I dont know if it would cover me as well as my current firm's package.

While I am waiting on a formal offer in writing to see the details I couldn't help but get the feeling I am going to be stretched way too thin, that they didn't have a specific timeline for bringing in more QAs, they mentioned ""self starter"" which flagged to me immediately and I'm afraid to take the leap even for such a significant raise. 

TL;DR do I stay in a cushier safer role in a big organisation for now even though I may not be building my tech skills for a while or do I take the risk on a role in a smaller company with the potential to thrive or potentially not live up to expectations and get burnt out?",2023-08-07 22:50:35

148d49e,<14 days to prepare for an on-site technical assessment after 6 months 'slacking'. Totally lost.,"Graduated in 2022. Spent 6 months looking for a job, some interviews/online assessments but no offers, then some knob knocked me off my bike and I spent 4 months in hospital. Broken bones, brain injury, all that good stuff.

Got out in May, and earlier this month I finally felt well enough to think about work again although I'm still having issues with focus/concentration (I'll say 75% of what I was before getting slammed into concrete). I started applying ignoring the elephant in the room that I haven't done a shred of coding in nearly 6 months because I thought it would be ages before I get replies anyway. 

Nope, send off 3 apps, all 3 get back to me, and one has invited me to an on-site on 23 June. No prep info has been/will be provided. It's apparently just a general assessment of skills rather than anything particularly difficult, but for fairly obvious reasons I'm proper lost.

Can anyone share general advice on how to prepare for stuff like this when you're going in both rusty and blind? Is it just the usual ""suck it up and grind leetcode""?",2023-06-13 11:24:54
13vamvv,"Company changed remote policy, general advice needed","My company decided out of the blue to change their remote working policy from full remote to hybrid , despite hiring multiple people far outside commuting range (6+ hour travel time) they are offering zero flexibility or making any exceptions. They never offered explicit remote contracts but all communications and job advertisements clearly marked it as remote(yes I know if its not in the contract bla bla , HR already gave that snarky response).

Unfortunately I am one of those people affected. After working it out , it would cost me in excess of £400-500 a month out my own pocket on travel and hotels to meet their new arbitrary number of days in the office(to sit on teams with international team members).

Now for the career bit.

I'm a backend .net engineer with a year and a half experience.

The final 3rd stage technical interview still had 10 candidates in the running...

I could hand in my notice when the deadline comes to begin going to the office or I could milk some extra time out of it and hand my notice when someone in HR notices I'm not going in( my manager wouldn't care). Alternatively I could just wait to get sacked and work remotely as long as I can.

Anyone have any advice ?",2023-05-29 23:57:03

Show you can work decently with a semi-decent portfolio, know what you're talking about, don't be an asshole, apply for junior roles hard and well. They seem to reckon I have good chances and have said I am ""more than ready"" for a junior position.

But honestly... Sometimes I panic a bit about my chances because some advice I read online ---that admittedly usually seems to be from American folk from their market standpoint---  suggests a job market where \[big number\] applications gets you maybe one successful job off a good CV, giving insanely low odds.

Here, the advice seems more positive sans lower wages than other countries, but it's hard to stay confident with so many overlapping voices, and even though in theory I trust the advice of people who have been doing this for years, there's still a part of me that worries a lot.

I'm getting back into looking for work after a long break due to illness, and I'm not sure where to start. I studied Computing at college, then got 2 years into uni before having to pull out and ended up in a call centre until COVID hit. Fairly recently, I decided that I should probably try and get into programming again with the goal of getting a job as a software developer.

I've searched up how to get into software development and found several rather costly bootcamps and 'graduate' postings that promise a job at the end (Sparta, FDM and Wiley Edge) but the mixed reviews are a bit off-putting. I have a checklist of things to study ripped straight from job postings, but I don't know if I should also be trying to get into one of these programmes. The best plan I have at the moment is working on a portfolio project and sticking a Github link in my CV, and I don't think that'll be enough on its own.

To sum it up, I'm asking for advice on how I should go about getting started. Any help is much appreciated.",2022-08-29 19:29:56

wiof9e,Is there a niche for a mechanical design engineer turned software engineer/dev? -UK,"
Hi All,

As per the title really. I'm learning Python at the moment as I want to automate several processes in my current role. I'm finding I really like programming, and programming seemingly get paid more than mechanical designers, so I would to transition into a programming role.

I did an apprentice in mechanical engineering for 4 years ( I have a HNC, no degree though), and have 6 years out of time experience. My experience includes 'on the tools' experience, mechanical design (product handling equipment, conveyors, lifts, etc...) and project management.

My questions:

1. With my mechanical experience, is there a niche area I could get into? Maybe PLC's or something?

2. Has anyone made the jump from mechanical design engineer to software developer? If so, could you tell me about your please?

All advice welcomed. I am UK based.

Thanks

vzyjye,Job offer but salary way below what recruiter lured me in with,"So got an offer of £85k with 3% pension contribution for a fully remote front end dev job for a small company based in Switzerland. 

However the recruiter lured me in with a salary of  “Up to £120k” with the range between £80k and £120k. I felt like I aced the interview and they seem desperate for a developer because they told me the project was urgent.

I told them I did not expect to be in the bottom of the salary range given my performance in the interview. They replied that the recruiter miscommunicated, apologised , and said the salary is market rate for my location (Scotland).

I am a lead front end developer and have all the skills they required in their job spec, so bit peeved with being misled. Also I’m only looking for remote roles so that I can get London rates , so feel their location argument is bollocks.

What would you do? Is it common to be mislead to such a large degree by recruiters?

Edit: should add my experience - 10 year experience : full stack dev (front end lean). Tech stack i work in are angular, react, Java/spring.

Edit 2: ultimately believed I’m worth more than their offer so got back to them declining and asking them to match my expectations. The hiring manager respected my reasons but could not match. So that’s that. Overall I’d have been unhappy with the offer if i took it so I’m glad I went back to decline. Thanks to u/Turbulent-Sail-7160 for the DM.",2022-07-15 20:37:52

It’s not that I wouldn’t enjoy being a doctor, I think I could if we were in a better system, but you know it’s bad when not one doctor that I volunteer with (of around 20) has recommended this career, and they’ve all recommended to look elsewhere. I don’t want the long degree and training, I don’t want the relatively low pay and lack of respect from the government, I don’t want the rigid progression system.

1bg6g33,Which behaviours/strategies have benefitted your career the most?,"I am forever a WIP, but if I had to give a few...

1. Always trying to improve how I come across to the people I work with. Avoid engaging in gossip (spreads like wildfire), and make the effort to make the people you work with feel important. This has involved some tough conversations with myself about my behaviours and attitudes towards others. People who like you are more likely to say good things behind your back to other people.

2. Knowing the right things from a technical perspective is essential, but I'm starting to realise that it's equally important to know what you DON'T know. Being able to say ""I don't know"", but being able to lay out how you will go about finding out is a valuable skill.
If you try to give the impression that you know everything, you will always get found out. Better to admit when you don't know something but be passionate about filling in the knowledge gap. Because as a SW engineer/developer/programmer, the learning never stops. Anyone who says it does, is either complacent with their career or a fool.

3. If you have the time, always help out your team mates when they are struggling with a certain domain or technology. They will remember this and be more likely to speak positively about you to others in the company. 
If you are seen as someone who pulls the ladder up after them and refuses to share knowledge, no one will love you for this. While it might help protect your position as a domain expert in the short term, the long-term effect is that people come to view you as unapproachable, and no one will want to work on the projects that you leave behind.",2024-03-16 13:46:25
1bdyn6e,Postgrad - Cardiff vs Brighton for compsci?,"
My background is in finance - for the last decade I’ve been at the same company earning £100k or so. I am however pretty burnt out (already took a sabbatical in 2021) and feeling that I’d like to start afresh. Really keen to live in a different city for a while as well (only ever been London based). I’m 33F with no dependents so this feels like a good time to make a change. 

I have been accepted onto the Computing MSc at Cardiff and the Computer Science MSc at Brighton. Both have a year of teaching and then a placement in the second year. 

I’m writing here to ask if anyone can offer any insight into the Cardiff or Brighton computer science schools that could help me choose between them? It looks like Cardiff is better ranked and also that the Brighton course is pretty new. Is that why it is is lowly ranked (because it might take some years to rise up the rankings)? The module titles all look pretty similar to me but don’t offer a huge amount of detail. 

I’ve never visited either city and only have 2 weeks to accept the Cardiff offer (!) so will be getting myself down there next weekend to check it out. Any compsci postgrads there who would be open to being taken for a drink - do let me know! 

Career wise I’m pretty open - I can see myself going into a product manager role (most similar to my current role in finance which is client facing) or else I’d like to work in technology in the civil service. I’ve got enough funds saved up for a few years of low/no pay and as long as I can get back to a salary paying £50k or so in 3-4 years, I’ll be fine money wise. I guess what I’m trying to say here is that I won’t be expecting (or wanting) to walk into a £200k+ job at Meta!

I have completed two final interviews so far; one for a start-up and another for a well known company.

In both interviews, I got all the programming questions correct (with optimised solutions too) as well as answering the technical concept questions clearly and correctly. 

I got rejected from both companies. 

The start-up didn't give feedback (no reply when I asked). 

The well known company said they liked my technical, my company research and how I expressed their leadership qualities, but they wanted me to give more in depth answers to behavioural competency based questions.

**My Question:**

I feel my answers to the behavioural questions were generally good since I was well prepared. I think what is letting me down is that the real life scenarios that I am using are not as effective as they could be at expressing the behaviour/quality the interviewer is looking for. 

Being at the very start of my career, how can I create better scenario based responses without exaggerating to the point of lying or just completely lying (which I don't want to do)? Or is making up scenarios that perfectly match what is being assessed the only way?

194cjay,Negotiating Salary after Successfully Applying for Internal Promotion?,"I'm currently a Senior .NET Software Developer, and a backfill vacancy for a Lead Software Developer role has opened up in my company. It's a large development team with some excellent Seniors, so I believe it will be filled by an internal applicant. I already operate above Senior level, doing pretty much everything in the Lead job spec already, so I think I'm in with a good chance. 

I've negotiated salary when I've successfully applied for roles at new companies, and I've been given promotions and pay rises in the past and I've always felt they were generous, so I've always been happy to accept whatever was offered. 

However, I've never had to apply and interview for an internal promotion before. No idea what they'll offer if I'm successful - it might be fine! - but I'm curious what I'd do if I felt the offer was low.

Does anyone have any experience of, or advice for, negotiating salary in this scenario? 

I feel like there isn't much leverage to negotiate if you're not looking elsewhere. They already know my current salary. I'm already doing 85% of what the role would entail, so it wouldn't be a huge increase in responsibility. I'm conscious having Lead Dev on my CV will make it much easier to find Lead Dev roles elsewhere if/when the time comes to move on, so maybe an offer that's lower than I'm hoping for wouldn't be so bad? 

Extra context if it helps. Joined 3 years ago on £42k, now on £56k through annual pay rises. Anticipate next pay rise as a Senior would take me to £59k-ish. Salary band for Lead role is £48k to £73k. If successful I'd be tempted to ask for £67k. Hays Technology Salary guide says typical salary for Tech Lead Microsoft Stack in my area is £68k. Love the team, the tech stack, the work we do, bonus is generous, benefits are great, so I'm not interested in looking elsewhere. I'd be happy to continue doing what I'm doing for years to come as-is, but I'm approaching top of the Senior salary band so wouldn't expect significant pay rises to continue for many more years. 

Also, I know times are tough for a lot of you out there right now, so I appreciate that (if my application is successful) I'll be in a very fortunate position.

191v9sg,UK MSc University Rankings Choice,"I'm looking at doing a conversion Msc (in the UK) in computer science / software engineering. If any people have experience/opinions on this: How much does the institution matter?

  
I could (potentially) attend: Imperial College London (£10k more expensive than other options), University College London, St Andrews (Supposedly less 'career-focused'? Does that matter??), or University of Glasgow - there are other options too but this is my shortlist, so-to-speak.  
They all offer courses in Computer Science for non CS undergrads - Glasgow's course has been described as the most 'career-focused'. I am looking for a job as a software developer after completing the degree in either the UK, Canada, or EU, and want to attend whichever university will give me the best career options afterwards. Imperial says the average starting salary is £60k with 90% employment but none of the others list avg starting salaries or employment hence turning to reddit for opinions!

18z8y8r,"Started a new job, didn't feel ready, what do I do now?","I am 23 years old, just completed a BSc in Live Audio Engineering and Music Production. Whilst at university I got hired at a start-up to make a device that can take sensor input and send it to a local server. I had to develop the API, the sensor modules, as well as a dashboard for the team. I thought I did well and did 99% of it in JavaScript, as well as micropython. This lasted 18 months.

After the 18 months, I got a quiet job and was able to learn a lot about C++ during my down time, I did this while going through the start of the AQA Computer Science Textbook.

Whilst in the middle of learning, I got an opportunity on LinkedIn to work for a Audio company to be an embedded developer on their R&D team, and took it.

I quickly realised as soon as I got in that I was well out of my depth, I described it to friends like knowing how to fix a bike, and being expected to fix an F1 car. As well as this, there was no sign of support from the team as they all had things they were doing, and there was no communication whatsoever (no meetings, basically silent room for 8 hours). I decided to quit on my second day after staring at the **C** code (yeah they said C++ was fine) they gave me to look at for the second day in a row.

I realise now that my self learning isn't going well, and perhaps I need to take an internship, degree apprenticeship (if such a one exists for Computer Science), or get a degree. I just don't want to spend another three years learning before I can work.

What do you guys suggest? Was it a mistake quitting or how should I get more knowledge before going into this passion of mine?",2024-01-05 15:04:52
18ryfy6,Do poor A-Level grades affect employability?,"So I am an international student, and I got 2Es for Maths and Biology, as well as a U in physics for my A-Levels...

Through a local university with a CS course that had partnerships with UK universities, I have transferred to the University of Birmingham as the entry requirements were only EE for my local university.

I plan to seek employment here in the UK but now I am wondering if my poor A Level results will impact my ability to find a job here... 

The reason for my poor grades was because I was going through depression during that time... I am in a much better headspace now and am wondering if I should retake my A-Levels back home. 

Or do my A Level grades not matter as long as I have a 2:1?

18mrvz4,Limited capability for work related activities,"This is the designation I have just got from the UK government.

The letter stated I don't have to search for work until my next review in a years time, as I have a degenerative neurological disorder, it's unlikely I'm going to pass the assessment back into the workforce.

So what next for my career?

The UK Government is considering legislation that people with this status should look for remote work - which is fine for me and my work role (senior cloud architect).

I've noted that a certain number of jobs posted as remote are just fishing expeditions from recruiters, where once they get your details and call the role changes to hybrid three or more days in the office, with an expectation of commuting.

As I'm sure you can guess this is adding a co-morbitity of depression on top.

I do not know what my next steps as far as a career is concerned, ostensibly it's over.

Through out my career from 21 to now, that being 36 years, I have only encountered 1 person who had a ""disability"", and I employed them when I was a hiring tech lead/development manager.

You may ask, what is the point of this post as so far its a series of statements. In some respects it is just that, a way to come to terms that my career may be over. I'd like to say it isn't as I think I still have a lot to contribute, plus I now have plenty of time to research (a benefit, I guess).

One realisation is that my career happened organically with sideways and upward movement, for the new, junior or mid developers, engineers etc. Start planning now for where you want to be in 15 to 30 years or more.

I start writing code in basic and c at the age of 13 - I was a combination of lucky and privileged for that and did O & A levels in CS, before doing a degree in a different science and then in my late 30 did an MSc in CS.

I don't think that enough emphasis is put on how to structure your career from school or university career offices and how to visualise your growth in  the IT CS space, where you are and where you want to be.",2023-12-20 10:51:05

16jcfwe,Options: Cambridge Uni or PhD or HPC AI Engineer or Startup?,"Hello everyone

Just finished my MSc and I’m at a crossroads because I got quite lucky with my dissertation and got a few good opportunities out of it.

I could do a few things:

1. Research associate at Cambridge in AI - 35k
2. Work on my startup based on my novel MSc research  - 0k — 5million upside 
3. Fully funded PhD from TU Munich - unsure on salary but around 30k but I’ll be here for 3-4 years
4. HPC ML Engineer C++ - 50k - Go into a highly specific engineer position 

What would you say is the best / most unique option out of these? Which is the best long term career / life plan?

My gut is kinda saying Cambridge would be the best but doing this would basically kill the startup opportunity in its track because it’d be very hard to research at Cambridge level and also run a startup on the side, even though it’s only 10 months at Cambridge it’d be hard to do this and a startup.

I'm currently a second year computer science student and I'm feeling a bit lost when it comes to deciding which career path to pursue. I'm torn between becoming a full-stack developer, an IT technician/Network engineer, or pursuing a cloud/devops role. My main concern is finding junior roles, as I'm not sure which of these paths would be the easiest to break into.

Up until now, I've been focused on becoming a full-stack developer, but I also have a keen interest in networking and cloud computing. I'm currently studying for the AWS CCP and Cisco CCNA certifications to broaden my knowledge in these areas. However, I'm not sure if this will be enough to secure a junior role in any of these fields.

I'm hoping to get some advice from those of you who have already navigated through these career paths. Which role did you pursue and why? How did you find junior roles in the field? Are there any specific certifications or skills that you recommend I focus on to increase my chances of finding a junior role in my chosen field?

11xnu0j,Most likely getting redundancy/dismissal where to go from here?,"Hi All,

I've recently moved to the UK around 3 months ago in a sponsored role as a senior software engineer. I thought everything was going well until my management changed and demands for lots of overtime and out of hour calls/weekend work started pouring in. Everything came to boiling point when today I finally stood my ground that I'm not able to work these ridiculous hours and then it was recommended that I quit.

I've been so focussed with my partner's career and getting her settled (medical professional) here that I stopped focusing on my own development and looking at other opportunities for a while. And to be honest I thought I wouldn't need to atleast for 6 months since I just joined a role.

My question is how to proceed from here? 
What are the best places to look for sponsored jobs in the UK?

I've started updating my resume right away using rezi and chatgpt. My main experience is 5+ years in full stack development with nodejs/reactjs/typescript and AWS. Have experience in leading teams in delivery for the past 2 years.
I'll be getting my AWS certifications (DevOps and Solutions architect) in the next 2 months. I have the knowledge and training just never took the exam being stingy about the cost, pretty comfortable/confident about this.

I obviously won't be putting in my notice until I have secured another job, but I suspect they may give a notice to me instead. I estimate I could delay it by a month or 2 with the good relationship I have built up. Which would give me 4 more months in the UK to find a sponsored position if I understand the visa rules correctly. (2 months notice + 2 months visa expiry). And to be honest even if they don't give the notice the relationship has soured and I want to move asap.

Id love to do another degree, but there's no way I can afford that. Only option there would be part time with the OU taking 5 years.

 I've applied for a million jobs, of all flavours. Apprenticeships, grad schemes, junior jobs a bunch of training then consulting type things, and it's all duds. Most recently I had a place on a grad scheme assessment center revoked because of my degree, after two successful interviews and about 15 hours working on a project. I've got a place on one of the training/consulting jobs, but it involves relocating 'somewhere' for two years, and last minute they've changed the role from programming to QA, which is not something I'm interested in. Now I'm terrified of again jumping at something, then messing up because it's not right for me, and leaving myself with even fewer options. 

I'm starting to think that there's no way I'm finding a job right now, but I don't see any other options open to me. I feel like I've reached a limit of what I can learn by myself, and I need real experience.  So, I thought I'd ask, what options do I have for getting started? Is there anything I've missed or can do differently that might have more success? [Here's a link to my CV for more info or to see anything I'm doing wrong there.](https://github.com/FegrusB/CV).

10zzof7,What field of CS should I get into when starting as a beginner to find employment?,"Hello I am just starting to learn coding to get into the industry after running my own business for a year becoming disillusioned with it.

wgby5l,"First web developer job going badly, is this normal?","I could really use some advice. I’ve been teaching myself full stack web development for the past 4 years and after a lot of searching and building a portfolio I landed a front end web-dev job at a web development agency. The problem is, the job is a lot harder than I was expecting and I’m having serious second thoughts about this career. First of all, the company that hired me is tiny, which is fine but they’ve given me almost no training for the framework and systems they use or even much onboarding for the company. They expected me to start making changes to live sites on my first day and keep telling me to use tools I’ve never even heard of, offering no training at all on how to use them.

I barely know what I’m supposed to be doing most of the time, I work remotely and the tasks I’m given are vague and confusing (my co-workers are non native English speakers so there is a language barrier issue as well).

The dev framework we are using is not something I’ve used before and I’m trying to learn it in my free time. Its extremely complex and niche so there are very few guides online and the documentation isn’t great. My co-workers offer almost no support and barely speak to me. If I ask for help usually they are too busy or their advice just doesn’t work. As a result, I can’t do most of the tasks I’m set and apparently I’m making mistakes that are causing a lot of problems on client sites and causing them to complain. I’m unsure of what these mistakes even are, no-one will tell me or explain how to avoid them in the future and now I’m terrified to make any kind of changes or pushes to the live sites in case I do more damage.

The company apparently isn’t doing well and clients are withholding payment due to our poor work. I’d like to help but the tasks I’m being given are far beyond what I can do or what was mentioned in the job interview. 

I’ve only been here a month, the stress is overwhelming, it took ages to find this job but I have no cs degree or prior experience so my options are limited. With no training or support It will be a struggle to get better at the job and I’ll keep messing up. Is this normal? If I leave the company will it damage my career and make me seem like a job hopper or is web development just like this? It took ages to find this job, should I sick it out?

I’ve applied to a contractor company where they help you find a job in finance, Ive managed to get an offer from JPMorgan software developer position with a salary of 23k through this said company.

I think that the salary is very low, however, the company is great and it can open many other doors in future. After a year the salary should increase to 30-40k levels if I am able to convert into an employee by then. But this is not guaranteed.

I'm an ex-Soldier who has recently started his CS career.
It's with a large financial organisation and they're training me from scratch (In Java, not in the Scratch application)

My issue is, I've been told by people already in the field that to get into management I'd NEED a degree in Comp Sci. I have experience in management in both the public and private sector beyond what most people would have at my age, I stupidly assumed that this prior experience would come in handy in 5-10 years as I learn about the field and progress.

On top of this, I guess I could do a degree in my own time but surely a decades experience as a software engineer (When I get there) and 7 years in management positions is enough? I could have just  done that in the first place.

w0kkxs,Should I start a job or take some time off?,"I've just graduated as an international student from a university in the UK. After 3 years of not visiting home mainly because of work and on some occasions because of COVID, I'm finally home and because of my job, I can't even stay here for 3 weeks.

To highlight my CV a bit, I've worked as a part-time software engineer throughout university, have 1 FAANG internship, multiple TA positions and I'm currently working as a research intern on a privately funded high-impact project which is being worked on by multiple universities (including mine). This internship finishes in September.

In my final year, I applied to multiple universities for a master's. I was rejected by all 5 universities. I had perfect LORs, and good grades: First class - the UK, 3.9 GPA - US, and overall a strong profile. However, I became overconfident, made loads of mistakes in my apps, and half-assed my SOP, I also only applied to top-tier universities which was my biggest mistake. I also think since I was doing too many things at the same time I didn't pay appropriate attention to my apps. Because of my naivety, the last few months of my final year were miserable, I was overworked with my dissertation, part-time job, TA work, and coursework. On top of all this every rejection I got basically made that time more and more depressing.

Extremely panicked, I applied for a few jobs, by that time the normal recruitment cycle was ending so there weren't many jobs available. In March 2022 I got an offer from a unicorn, which was redacted by the company because of some internal hiring issues and was told to keep in correspondence in case new roles opened, which I wouldn't have to interview for. This made me even more miserable. In May 2022, my thesis supervisor offered me the research internship as I somehow managed to score a first in my dissertation (which I accepted). Soon after this, I received a job offer from a large UK-based FinTech (which I also accepted). Now, I basically have to travel back to the UK early for VISA stuff, which I was fine with but since then some things have changed. First and the most important I didn't know how much I missed home these 3 years and I want some more time with my family. Secondly, I have mixed feelings about working at this company (partly because of how it handled recruitment and team allocation - it was very very weird). Lastly, I only get a holiday of 4 days between my current internship ending and the job starting (I've been working non-stop for 3 years, in all my summer vacations and even after graduating).

While the thought of taking a break always put my mind to ease, what scares me is the fact that other than working part-time and applying for a master's, I'd basically be doing nothing for a period of approx 8 months. On the other hand, I could be working and earning money but I also don't want to put myself in a position where I half-ass my apps again. Also, the fact that I have to leave home so early just breaks my heart (Currently I'm working from home for my internship). However, I also feel that I'm being very ungrateful that I got this job and acting like a brat when it comes to the company I'll be working at (does it really matter where you start as a Grad), and part of me also feels like I need to get over not having a break and just start the Job.

I don't know what to do, it's stressing me out quite a lot. Any advice would be highly appreciated.",2022-07-16 16:33:20

u516lm,Mid life career advice,"So I'm a 38 year old senior developer on the .net stack with 13 years in industry.

This is all quite hard to explain, but in my current company as a Dev there are three routes for me to progress, principal developer (whatever that is, I'll get back to this), Dev team lead (which is a senior with line management responsibilities) or architect (which is like the senior senior).

If I'm honest I have a little resentment for my company. As it's grown so have the roles, when I first started it was junior to mid to senior. Although the role of a senior is important and it took me a while to get where I am, though I had to lead a team twice (which also had seniors on) to get there.

Also if I'm honest, I'm still not sure I enjoy coding anymore. I'm not doing the type of coding that would make me proud at the end of my career. There are always compromises and tech debt to pay back because someone (usually sales or product manager) said something to a customer they shouldn't without consequences. Although I know this is the profession we chose it does get you down especially when we have scrum masters constantly saying we can improve things even though lessons are... Well enough whinging aye ;) 

Although it sounds silly, but honest at my age I have no idea what I could possibly do if not coding and following the Dev team lead or architecture route. 

I have thought about becoming a product owner, in my place they're usually from a sales or marketing background and we are told they don't need to be technical (which is bullshit.. the amount of times I have had to explain what an API is to a new PO). After all how is it such people get to set deadlines.. if I was a technical PO would that really play to my strengths?

Anyway, I'm looking for some help. At my age and experience what else could I do? and I'm even thinking non technical here.

My wife and family have no idea how to advise me really, non of them have technical backgrounds or even really what it is I do (of course they have some idea, but talk to them about docker or git and it's like a deer in headlights).

I am willing to retrain, only thing I wouldn't do is teach (it pays too little though I would do it when I have retired to give something back). I would be happy with anything that pays £45-£50k+ at least.

 the minimum requirements say ""coding experience in any programming language"".

* Will a Computer science degree help my career, no matter whether I choose to work in Data Science, Machine learning, Audio programming, or UX Design?
* Is a master's degree in Data Science, Machine learning, Audio Programming, or UX Design a good way to make a career transition into one of these jobs? Is it hard to break into those industries if you don't have a specialized degree for it, but ""only"" a master's degree in Computer Science?",2021-03-30 15:39:48

1bshble,[Vent] Am I being too hard on myself as a grad? My experience so far,"Hi,

I'm making this post just to vent about how I feel after 18 months as a Software Engineer and my feelings about my career and how I'd like it to proceed.

**My Experience**

I have been working for a very large US company who have offices in Belfast (Like a lot of the NI tech market) for the past 18 months.

I have been with this company for a long time. I joined them for a summer internship in 2019, and then a year internship in 2020. I returned as a grad in September 2022 and got promoted to Software Engineer in September 2023. I feel lucky in that I never struggled to get a job because I got this summer internship which basically guaranteed me a job at the end of the degree.

I don't actually live in NI anymore. I left in 2021 and moved to England (Derbyshire) during COVID and now date someone there. The company lets me work remotely however I have to return to Belfast once a month (This is paid for by them).

I currently make 42K a year plus bonus, and got a 3% rise in March from 41K (I wasn't really happy with this, but I know the only way to substantially increase your salary is to move company).


**My problem**

The work that I do isn't exactly fascinating (It's basically only AWS CDK and TypeScript, writing Lambda functions etc.), and I do find there isn't much variety in it because that's the only language that I use, and I don't know if that's normal for a Software Engineer. I see jobs where they ask for a very long list of experience that I don't have, and I'm worried my career will stagnate and I'll go no further.

I decided to test the waters and applied for a small number of jobs (I think about 10 over the past month) because:

1. I feel like 42K isn't much, and have in the back of my head that NI-based jobs will stagnate my career because nobody knows about the country (I left because I was sick of the place and how forgotten it is) and it always pays below average compared to the rest of the UK.
I have made the (I feel common) mistake of looking at the US-based /r/cscareerquestions and getting annoyed at myself at how little I make compared to my US counterparts. This has affected my opinion of myself quite badly.

2. I don't like travelling to Belfast every month as it's exhausting and I don't live close to an airport, and pretty much the entire company is NI based, so I feel like the odd one out.

So far I've been rejected from every job I applied for at the sifting stage. I find this ironic because I applied for a good number of jobs before I graduated (With the offer I eventually went with at my current company), and got a response back pretty much every time. The reason why I didn't go further with it was the anxiety of moving company as I had never worked anywhere else before. 

I don't know if it's my CV or if it's my lack of experience, or even if it's because the company isn't very well known outside of NI (They would be very well known within the NI tech market) if that even matters.

I currently feel like a failure because the work I do doesn't make me feel like I'm getting any real experience and I'm just doing my job to pay the bills, and I don't feel particularly ""skilled"" in what I do.

**What I would like**

My real dream job is to be an Android Engineer and would love to get into Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, but because I don't have direct experience in that area, I never get far when I apply anyway.

Because of my relationship, I can't relocate so I need to work remotely, but can occasionally travel to the office by train (And definitely not by plane). 
Because of where I live (Basically in the Peak District), the only places where I feel like this could easily be done are anywhere along the Midland Mainline or London, but my attempts at actually getting a job there have gone nowhere.

I know that everyone says it's important to hone your skills outside of work, but I don't see the point in it if nobody is going to accept me anyway.

I will say, that I know I am privileged in that my company does let me travel during working hours, and that they are extremely understanding and pay me for all those expenses, and I don't even know if there are many companies based in London who would be so kind as to do that (travel, hotel etc.) which also makes me very selective in who I apply for, as I think I've gotten too used to being remote and not having to pay anything to visit the office. But again, maybe that's normal for lots of companies.

I know that what I want is probably pie-in-the-sky thinking, and sounds very privileged too.

If anyone has any experience or thoughts, feel free to share them (It is Reddit after all), but I sort of just wanted to vent as I feel very deflated and passionless after only 18 months.",2024-03-31 18:33:45
1bsb8cl,Any self-taught / bootcampers who got a degree later on after working in the field?,"Hello, looking for some thoughts on whether this is worthwhile. I searched but most posts seemed to be from people trying to get their first job in the field.

I graduated from a bootcamp around 4 years ago and got a job shortly afterwards. I've been working ever since but I'm now considering applying for a 2-year MSc.

The main reasons are: worrying that my lack of degree will hurt me as the market gets tighter over the next few years, and becoming concerned I might get filtered out by ATS. I'm noticing more job ads with a 'hard' degree requirement rather than a 'or equivalent experience'. I'm also interested in the academic challenge and proving to myself that I can do it.

I'm looking at part-time distance learning courses.
I started off by looking at the University of York course but have been scared off it and other Higher Ed courses because of the bad reviews. 
The Georgia Tech course (r/OMSCS) is at the top of my list, the community around it seems good and it's affordable, I just worry it hasn't got the name recognition in this country. 
I'm also looking at the Queen's University Belfast and the Hertfordshire course.

1boxyl1,Is ghosting common in this market? ,"Background:Last Tuesday (March 19th) I had an interview for what they said was the ""final"" stage in an application for what I feel was the job of my dreams.

That's why it leaves me nervous that I have not heard back, yet, 8 days later. 

Part of me fears they might be ghosting me, since that's common practice where I am. 

But I'm also trying to remain optimistic. I know hiring processes *can* take time, and you know what the funny thing is? They explicitly said that the HR stage at this company is slow. I'm trying to tell myself that maybe this slow HR department is busy finalising my offer. Things also could be slowed down by the fact that it's Easter week. 

So, I'm sorry for this histeric post, but I need to get my thoughts sorted, and would appreciate if you help me. 

And yes, I guess I could write to them and inquire. But that is could also come across as pushy, so I'm not doing it this soon.

1axjxe9,Job switch in 1 year,"Hello r/cscareerquestionsuk,

I’ve been working as a junior software engineer for 1 year now (started in jan 2023). I am currently living in London and commuting to Reading for work. Initially when I started work it was mostly WFH and only had to commute to office once every fortnight. But, due to change in office policy this year, now I have to commute to office thrice every week. It was fine at the beginning now I am starting to get exhausted and mostly spending my weekends recovering. Since, it’s been only one year I feel that switching the job now will affect my career history. Also, I am not planning to move out from London. Any advice on what I can do in this scenario ? Also, how is the current market looking?",2024-02-22 22:33:52
1awru83,Choosing between two grad schemes,"Hi all! I'm in the enviable position of choosing between two grad schemes, but I'm having a rough time deciding.

One is for a smaller research company, which I'll not name to avoid doxxing myself, a software engineering graduate scheme with pay at £33k and relatively few other bonuses.

The other is Lloyds Technology Engineering, 45k plus a 5k bonus, and I think private health insurance. 

I'm strongly leaning towards Lloyds, since it's a bigger name, substantially more money for this stage in my career, and would probably set me up better in future with a more established scheme and potentially better training. On the other hand, the research happening at the other company is super interesting, and the environment is likely to be much faster paced so I might learn more? Both companies have rotational schemes which is exactly what I want at this point, and the locations are quite comparable in terms of safety, cost of living and general vibes.

I've got lots of family members telling me to go for the research company position since there's very little like it and I probably won't be able to go back for this opportunity later, whereas I can always get a job at a bank when I've got more experience.

My younger mates, who are mostly working already, say I'd be crazy not to go with Lloyds with the salary bump, and Lloyds being known to have good wlb.

I'm mostly concerned about the long term career prospects - just feels like I might be shooting myself in the foot not going with Lloyds.

Anyone got any thoughts between the two?",2024-02-22 00:04:37

1avnybq,Which placement should I choose?,"Hi, so i’m currently in the process of looking for a placement to do in my 3rd year of university. I’ve gotten quite far with quite a few companies (Assessment centres) and in wishful thinking, I want to sort of rank these companies so that if I get offers I know which one to choose.

Here are the following companies and their roles:
1. Capgemini SWE placement
2. Lloyds bank technology placement
3. Simmons & Simmons legaltech placement
4. Focusrite SWE placement
5. Mimecast SWE placement
6. Virgin media O2 technology placement

The things that are key to me are: 
1. A company that will invest - not looking for me to be perfect immediately but willing to teach
2. Companies that have a good salary or good salary progression (i.e. good base grad salary or if its bad it increases relatively quick)
3. A company where I will learn a lot of useful technical skills

Based on these, which ones do you think will be best suited? I have researched but I think it’d be useful to get input from people who work at these companies or know people who do, thank you!

169y6eg,"Doing a computer science degree and looking for an industrial placement, should I put my Autism diagnosis on applications?","Title, basically.

I'm entering the second year of my computer science degree and looking for an industrial placement in software development. I'm also diagnosed with high functioning autism / asperger's syndrome. It's not severe enough that it outwardly impacts my ability to live and work normally (so my employer won't need to make any adjustments) but I can come across as uncomfortable and ""a bit off"" in social situations like interviews. I'm not officially registered as disabled.

As adjustments aren't necessary I've heard lots of conflicting information as to if it's best to put my diagnosis on applications, tell them during the interview, or not tell them at all. Apparently some organisations actively recruit autistic people, but data published by the Office for National Statistics tells a very different story so I'm not sure where that leaves me. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the advice, I've read all your comments. There seems to be a range of attitudes towards neurodiversity so I'll probably decide at what stage to mention it on a case-by-case basis. If the firm seems to be diversity-positive I'll mention it if the application form asks, otherwise I may bring it up during interview or keep quiet depending on the impression I get. Obviously the latter isn't ideal, but at this stage in my career I'd still prefer work experience in a less pleasant environment over no work experience at all.",2023-09-04 17:29:05

They are like FDM, but they're smaller and have good reviews. 

I was researching this company lasty year, I used to stalk the linkedins of graduates who went through this consultancy company. You can see their case studies card UI for what type of companies they ended up at.   


It's been a long time since I checked the linkedins of graduates who went via sigma labs xyz, but I remember quite a few went onto Ernst and Young as technology consultants. I can see two right now on linkedin, this is one: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/gurpartap-lakhanpal/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gurpartap-lakhanpal/). He went to sigma labs xyz, did their 3 month training course, got a 24 month placement at EY as a technology consultant.

The first 3-4 months are unpaid training, and the 24 month placement is a fixed £30,000 per annum for the two years.

I know the graduate I linked was very competitive and competent, he graduated from warwick in engineering, which is why he's very succesful (in my opinion).   


Do you think this is a good opportunity for undergrads who aren't in CS and want to get into tech? Last time I checked, consultancies like this aren't looked favourably upon. But as I don't have a CS degree and am going into my final year with no experience, I don't have many options.",2023-08-19 20:46:56
15us8uu,Am I misundanding developer roles here?,"Over the last year I have been interviewed for a few Senior Dev roles. None of the applications were successful, and the feedback has all been ""we're looking for more management experience"". Am I wrong in thinking that a senior dev is still a dev, and what they're actually looking for is some kind of manager or team leader? I've always thought a team lead would manage a team, which would contain one or two seniors within it.

Edit: thank you for the replies. I agree that mentoring juniors is 100% a senior dev's role. It was more the project management, resource allocation and deadline management that I thought was more of a grey area. 

I just wasn't sure if I was wasting my time on senior dev applications if the industry standard says I'm imagining a mid level role (the level I currently think I am).",2023-08-18 18:25:36

They pretty much beat me to the punch, but despite it being great that I get to collect severance and travel instead of working during my notice period I was wondering about the stigma that being laid off carries.

I am currently looking for a company in the UK to work as a data/DevOps engineer. I select companies that I like and send them spontaneous applications, rather than simply waiting that they advertise positions.

14m7fgq,Stick with plan to quit and go travelling or wait around to become Senior dev first?,"I studied Philosophy at university and then began my a job as a C++ software engineer in January 2022 (So have been working for 1.5 years). The company I work for were open about the fact that they were taking a bit of a risk on me given that I did not have a technical background, but I have picked it up quickly and they were happy enough to give me deecent pay rises. 


It was my plan, to leave at the end of this october, go travelling for 2 months, then come back and start a different software engineering role. The company I work for is fine, but I quite fancy switching things up and getting some varied experiences in while I am young. I thought that having nearly 2 years of experience on my CV would look pretty decent and put me in good standing for finding a job when I return. 


However, I recently had a 6 month review in which it was made pretty clear that I am on track to be promoted to Senior software engineer in my end of year review (this December). I am now trying to decide whether to postpone travelling to get this under my belt. Obviously, going travelling will never be the best career decision even if it is the best life decision, but I am open to the idea that postponing the trip be the right decision.


In favour of staying longer:

 * I wonder whether having reached senior developer would quell any worries future employees may have regarding my non-technical background. Obviously, my current employer is aware that the risk paid off but I don't know whether this would be clear on my CV. If my next employer could see that I was good enough to be promoted to senior (only 2 years after starting), then it would be a strong signal that I am capable.


Against staying longer

  * I am aware that it is not uncommon to stay somewhere until you reach senior and then switch job, but I wonder whether this only gives an advantage for those directly switching from one job to another rather than those who quit and then look for a new job. Does it really count for anything if I reach senior developer and then quit without gaining any experience as a senior? Will this add anything to my CV?
  * Perhaps it might look actively bad on my CV if I reach senior developer and then quit immediately. It would be a pretty obvious self-interested move.
  * I am kind of bored and ready to leave and go travelling. More time in my role would obviously improve my CV, but I really interested in whether those extra 3 months will have an outsized positive impact on my CV so as to be worth changing my life plans
  * I am still a little bit uncertain about software engineering as a whole. I could see myself switching out to something else entirely, in which case, having senior developer on my CV might not really help me.
  * October is the best time for me to go for personal reasons. My rent contract ends then so If I push things back, I'll need to find temporary accommodation (could be a pain in London)

I would be really grateful if anyone had any advice or thoughts

Thanks very much",2023-06-29 15:07:26
1472xqq,Is London a good place for a CS career in the UK? Or choose somewhere else?,"Hi,

Currently working a remote job (junior web dev) in the southeast of the UK, the office is based in a town outside London. Earning 25k at the moment, also had a short stint at a very outdated company using Classic ASP, so I have about 2.5 years experience.

I'm looking to make a move to a new role sometime soon, as pay is low and the work is boring, perhaps aiming for a mid-level role. I'm in my early-mid 20s so was hoping to move to a city for the social opportunities, plus jobs around here are very limited, you only see about 5 postings at a time and I think they're always the same small but established companies, which don't seem to be doing exciting work.

I'm currently renting a flat with my friend, I was hoping to move to London if I got a job there. I'm aware I could live outside London and commute in if I get a hybrid arrangement, but I was hoping to live and work in a city as I'm a bit tired of living in a small-ish town.

I see a lot of talk about London being one of the best places in the EU to work as a dev, or at least the best place in the UK. However I've noticed that the average salary, or at least the one I could probably attain as someone with 2.5 years experience, is about 60k, which doesn't go very far in London, as the minimum rent for a tolerable 1 bed flat seems to be about £1800, and that's outside Zone 2... Unless you want to go far out to the suburbs which are mostly young families and maybe don't have a huge amount going on, or renting a tiny studio where you would have no room for a WFH setup. I know one pretty talented guy who was renting in London, and forced to move to a commuter town recently because of high rents.

I'm aware that most people in London share a flat with strangers or friends, but I was under the impression that working as a dev in London gave a good QOL, but I wouldn't consider flatsharing to be a great QOL, and it doesn't seem to be quite as commonplace outside London/south UK for people in good jobs.

I've considered other places in the south, e.g. Brighton, but that doesn't seem to have a huge amount of dev roles and a lot of them are based in Crawley (and I don't drive). You also have Bristol but the cost of living has gone up immensely there and it has public transport issues.

It seems like if you got, say, a 40k salary in the midlands or up north, which seems very achieveable, you could probably rent your own flat, e.g. in places like Manchester and Nottingham, while saving more money than in London on 60k, and that money goes further if you're looking to buy a property. I know a guy managing to rent his own flat in Manchester, which really doesn't seem possible in London unless you're working in fintech or other high paying roles.

I'm kind of at an impasse at the moment and not really sure where to go, it feels like my 20s are rapidly disappearing and I kind of hate my job, does anyone have any advice on where to go or what would be a good place for a career + good QoL? I know Manchester is meant to have a decent number of roles, not sure about other cities or if I should just go with London? Just want to get my own place really but don't want to live in the middle of nowhere :D",2023-06-11 19:31:47

I am wanting to switch careers but due to being chronically ill I am only able to access part-time online courses right now. My main interests are surrounding cyber security (including OSINT) but I am also interested in web development (front-end, UX / UI etc).

Here are a couple of options I have found - I am open to ANY feedback or suggestions you have to share. I feel totally lost so any wisdom would be very welcome! 

&#x200B;

* **Code First Girls.** Coding Kickstarter [here](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/classes/coding-kickstarter/).

Coding Kickstarter in Web Dev: *""An introduction to web development for budding coders, and those who need somewhere to get started! Learn the fundamental skills of front-end web dev, including Bootstrap and UX/UI design. By the end of the course, you will be able to build a website from scratch.""*

CFG also do MOOCs and an intensive ""degree"" which claims to be the gateway to a tech career.

&#x200B;

* **Udemy / The Odin Project  / Future Learn / MOOC / Codecademy etc.**

This would obviously be a much more mix n match, self-led approach to learning the same sorts of skills I could learn from a more comprehensive courses. However, I know that through various websites it is possible to undertake things like the CS50 and CompTIA A+ which are trustworthy certifications. 

&#x200B;

* **NCFE CACHE Level 3 Cyber Security.** See summary [here](https://www.netcomtraining.co.uk/cyber-security-practices-in-birmingham/).  
*""Learners will gain an understanding of cyber security and the consequences and implications of inadequate cyber security.*  
*You will understand threat models and the effects of malicious software.*  
*Learners will gain an understanding of common types of testing in cyber security including mitigations following testing.*  
*Learners will gain an understanding of the legislation surrounding cyber security.""*

I'm currently working as a web developer, mostly doing back-end stuff with PHP. All of my work is for Laravel clients, or Wordpress plugin issues.

I feel like there is quite a low technical skill ceiling - the most difficult task I dealt with was building a payment gateway, I enjoyed the challenge a lot, but from talking to fellow developers, it seems like this is the technical peak of what we do in PHP development. I do not want to be a php developer for life, so I feel like my best course of action is to learn new technologies in my spare time, starting now, so that in a few months I could have a chance to apply for jobs where I could do bigger, more interesting things.

My problem is that I am not quite sure what to do. Whenever I look at job boards, I am intimidated by the amount of job postings. My only conclusion from job market research is that the demand for Java and C# developers is high.

I know that I enjoy coding and solving technical challenges, but I worry that my lack of degree in computer science would hold me back from getting the more challenging and interesting jobs.

In the end, my main point is this - I do not want to be a web developer for small wordpress/laravel websites forever. What is the best way of making the jump to working on something better?

134wojs,Consulting vs Fintech for Junior Developer,"Hi! First time posting here.

I’m a junior software engineer at a large investment bank in the UK (1-2 years exp).
The project I’m working on is uninteresting and the culture at my office is grim to say the least so I’m trying to get out.

I received 2 offers:
1. Java engineer at mid-sized consultancy, will be working on a government project. The recruiter told me the role would also be client/facing and involve support work (fully remote).
2. Backend/Java engineer at a small-ish fintech (~150 people). Job looks interesting and I will get to wear different hats (hybrid x2 days in office).

My gut tells me to go for the second role, as from the interviews I got the impression that they cared more about the engineering side, which I think it might be better for me at this point in my career. 
It might sound silly, but the only thing attracting me to the first company is the perceived benefits of having a well-known company in my CV and it opening more doors for me in the future (eg. relocation abroad etc).

TC for both companies is ~50k.

10mhktg,Pressure to accept an offer,"UPDATE: I've directly reached out to the company, had a meeting with them, explained my concerns and they've agreed to increase the explosive offer for 10K to a week, they also explained why they told to recruiter to ask me to make a decision as soon as possible but they didn't expect the recruiter to put this much pressure on me. I've had a talk with them regarding the finer details for the role and so far I like what they're offering. I've decided to accept the offer as they've ironed out all of my questions and concerns. I think a company that takes out their time within 30 minutes to sort out a candidate's concerns is a good one.

Hello all,I'm in a bit of a limbo as to what do I need to do as the company (Personally, I think it's the recruiter but could be wrong) pressuring me to accept an offer just within a few days.

I currently work as a junior level games programmer and I am soon promised to be promoted to be a mid level programmer plus project lead. I love what I do but the problem I found is that I am getting massively underpaid. The company is relatively new so they don't have a budget to fund the employees atm and I understand that but it's also not helping me financially.

I love the company culture, how they listen to every employee's concern and make changes according to our feedback but again it's the pay that's making me a quite unhappy for what I can do in my current tech stack, how much work I put in, how much the management understands the difficulties that arise with this particular tech / framework and how much I've really put into this for them.

Now I applied for other well established companies via a recruiter and I got an offer just 2 days ago after months of multiple interview and technical test processes. They're offering me 10k more than what I'm earning currently. They're saying if I accept it right now and stop talking to other companies, they'll offer me 10k from the start or if I take my time in accepting the offer, it'll first be 6k during my probation period and 10k after. Which in itself seems quite ""different"" as the way I see it, it should be the full amount regardless. But I may be wrong with this so please correct me if that's a common practice.

Now this is alarming as I've asked the recruiter to let me have a think about this for at least a week because this is a big life changing decision. I am literally going to be changing cities to live and work from there for the long term and this will mean a lot of changes in my personal life and it is a big decision. I also want to think it over about smaller things like making sure I'll be okay with the company culture change as like I said it's going to be a long term employment and other personal life changes that comes with this big move.

I've not been able to keep in contact with the company directly and the recruiter has started to call me daily and email me multiple times a day about the pressure of that extra money if I accept it right now and wants an answer by the next 4 days max. Which I think is absurd as to how can I make this world turning decision in just the span of 3 days and if this is the correct way of pressuring a candidate into accepting an offer? The recruiter says it's because the company is really excited to have me and it's also good for that extra money.

This raises a few questions:

1. If the company is that eager to make me accept an offer that they go to tactics to give me the full money if I accept it right now and if they need manpower that desperately, doesn't that come as a red flag as it could be because people are leaving their company so often they need new employees RIGHT NOW.
2. Is it really the company that's pushing me to making these decisions within a spawn of mere days or the recruiter pushing to get their pay check? If it the latter, should I directly get in contact with the company and ask them if I can get at least a week to think this through because I can't make this decision this harshly.

If I don't like how they're pushing me, I may just decline it. As besides the money, I do love what I'm doing at my current job.",2023-01-27 10:20:06
yt4qhn,Family friendly career?,"Hi all, I just want to run this one past you all as I’m not quite sure. 

I currently work on the railway and earn £45k plus about £10k in shift allowance. I have a BSc in Biology but other than that no formal qualifications, just working my way up and luck got me into this position. I am not qualified for another job of similar salary on the railway. 

I work 12 hour shifts and have a hours commute either way, so 14 hour days leaving the house at 4:45am/pm depending on day or night shift. 

I have a 2 year old and due my second any day now. I’m finding the job completely impossible and incompatible with family life. I can’t get childcare around my shifts and hate not seeing my baby at all for so many days in a row due to leaving before he wakes and back after bedtime. 

I clearly need to change career, being a stay at home mum isn’t an option financially for the family.

I was instrumental in obtaining a good chunk of investor money, and had to be extremely careful re code safety and performance due to the nature of our robot (Malfunction was often not an option, many layers of failsafes etc), I delivered on time for important tests and demonstrations.

I' had a lot of responsibility for a junior, my title is now 'senior' and I have a few juniors beneath me whom I try to mentor and provide code review, technical direction etc.

I'm looking to leave this industry and find a more traditional software role, for more money and less stress that I can do fully remote, but I don't want to get in to boring CRUD apps or anything 'full stack'.

I really want to stay focussed on 'systems' style programming with C++ or similar, where I can continue to work on difficult problems, where performance and robustness is important.

Given my weird last few years I'm unsure how to sell this experience in interviews, I know I'll be lacking a lot of stuff I'd have gotten at a bigger company.

w3jg6v,Is an MSc Computer Science Conversion degree with the second year being in placement be enough for me to get a career change into the world of software dev/eng/etc?,"TL;DR of it all: are computer science MSc conversion courses enough to prepare me to work in the field of tech or are they money grabs by universities? I thought I would ask it here since universities seem to be paid to have positive PR.

&#x200B;

As a bit of background, I am 28. Looking back, I was a lost, depressed, people pleasing and undisciplined kid. I ended up with a 2:2 in Psychology BSc and have a Merit for Clinical and Health Psychology MSc. Also, I have a PGDip  in Low Intensity Psychological Interventions. The PGDip required that I had my BSc in psych, and it allowed me to work in a relavent psychological field. Having said that, I want to move to the tech side of things. 

The reason I want to move to the tech side of things is, even as a kid, I loved computers. Chalk it up to a bad upbringing and other bs that didn't allow my passion to flourish. Also, I have been at my current therapeutic job for close to 3 years (if you include the PGDip training) and I am sick of it. There is no progression, it's very rigid and the pay sucks tbh. Technically, I could apply to do the High Intensity CBT therapist training (where I will become a proper psychotherapist), however, given that it is still target focused (like my current role), I rather avoid it. Plus, I find that I am losing skills and not gaining any new relevant skills to keep me competitive with the market. 

I did my best to look up a few courses. The one at Kent University seems to be perfect since it is full-time and has a year in industry (which I read is highly regarded by future employers). Plus it is like an hour drive from where I live (I live with my parents at the moment). I have saved around 50k in the bank. On a fair estimate, I would probs spend around £20k. I am a bit nervous because it will be the first time that I am doing something for the benefit of myself, not others.  

I did a lot of job searching and it often states for the junior roles to ""have a degree or equivalent"", I presume that the conversion will count as equivalent, right?

Strangely, my therapeutic job is much sought after, even with the horrible pay lol. So I can always go back to it if I need to. Also, I have found that I can train to be a network engineer and go about it that way. 

I would love to hear your thoughts on the topic. Any feedback, questions and advice are welcomed",2022-07-20 10:58:00

By default the college had to withdraw me from the course and I appealed this decison however it was rejected and they didn't consider letting me retake those modules and progress to second year the following year.

Because they told me very late I wasn't able to apply for 2021 entry to a new university last year however I have applied to 2022 entry for this year as a backup option incase the university decided to not offer me the resits. After now being told I won't be allowed to continue I wanted to know what are my options? I have a solid set of A-Levels (3 A\*- Maths, FM, Physics) so reapplying to uni isn't the issue. It is the fact the i've wasted 2 years I seriously lack the motivation to pursue a 3 year degree anymore. I have exprience in Haskell, C and Java from my first year and also Python from my own learning. So far i think i have the following options moving forward:

1) I have heard of people doing courses on freecodecamp and learning backend (JS, React, etc) and trying to secure a job through there, is this a better option to try than going back to uni?

2) Are apprenticeships any good? I want something that can teach me C++ or Java, most of them are quite low-level ones that I feel take a long time to advance your career in. 

3) I have also seen accelerated degree's where you can do it in 2-years but these are only offered by lower ranking uni's. Are these worth it?

4) I have tried also looking for internships however many of them require that you are a student at uni which isn't avaliable to me.

5) Are there any big tech companies like Google, etc that offer courses in the UK that train you up and offer a salary? I feel like I wouldn't mind going this route if it was available.

sl72lq,"Choosing a Conversion Program: Guidance Requested (Newcastle, Swansea,","tl;dr: I have been accepted to the Computer Science Conversion Masters at University of Kent, Swansea University, and Newcastle University. I'd appreciate guidance on which to choose. My own meandering thoughts on the merits of the universities are given below 

* Of the four universities, Cardiff and Newcastle are both Russell Group universities, so I am inclined to choose between these two (touch wood for acceptance).
* If my research is correct, Cardiff and Newcastle are ranked 168 and 166, respectively.
* Cardiff is ranked higher in the Research Excellence Framework, but Newcastle has a higher ranked Computer Science department (200 for Newcastle, 363 for Cardiff).
* I was able to find employment prospects for Cardiff on (Times Higher Education), but Newcastle was unranked. 
* I did a quick search for jobs in the area on Indeed. Swansea had the fewest, Cardiff and Canterbury were pretty well tied, and Newcastle had the most. However, Canterbury is pretty close to London (\~1 hour by train), so I imagine that would make the job search a little easier, if I chose to seek employment there.
* Swansea and Kent are the cheapest to attend, but I'd rather pay the extra 6000 GBP now and have a higher lifetime earning potential. Nonetheless, if my potential is the same across the board, it is worth considering.
* On a subjective note, Newcastle seems to be the most accepting place. They had the most flexible application (longest allowed personal statement, longest period for accepting or rejecting a place offer) and seems to have quite a lot of international students.

As you can probably guess, my inclination is to accept Newcastle's offer. Given my options, does this seem like a solid choice?

My boss currently has me on mostly back end, but I am thinking this is probably offering less transferrable skills for front end freelance work, as businesses are mainly interested in how their site looks ( and gets them financial results), and not so much the business logic of how it works.

I work in an R&D group of both hardware and software people that's always been a small group - on average about 3 folks. For the last year I've been the only software developer in the company due to Covid holding up the recruiting process.

I have a mountain of unique knowledge of our software and products so my job security feels pretty bulletproof. I make £75k in the south of the UK (not London) which feels like a lot, especially for someone with no management responsibilities. I like what I work on but there are things I'm not happy about too.

It's not much fun having no software colleagues to work with. We have a bunch of different complex products to support and I get bombarded with technical questions from various people on most days. The mental context-switching is heavy. It also feels like I have too many different things to work on to be able to do any of it properly. Big projects often give me that feeling of ""a proper company would have a whole team just for this one product.""

Career-wise I feel like there's nowhere to go within the company - the only step left would be managing the whole R&D department which has an equal electronics hardware component that I'm not interested or qualified in. We're recruiting again now and I've been promised I'll be in charge of software going forward, but I don't think it's a promotion that will come with any monetary benefits. I will be surprised if the software team is ever more than two people, including me.

I feel like I'd like to work in a larger company, in a team with a more defined role than ""everything"". I've been looking around to see what other postitions are out there but I don't see much of anything with salary approaching what I make now unless I'm managing a whole department or I head into the big tech or financial companies. I'm not a CS graduate, I've been in embedded code for my whole career and don't have much exposure to other areas, though I'm increasingly having to learn it on the job. Basically I'm not confident I'd fit into a big software organization, but where I am now is too far the other way. Given the trouble my company would have replacing me if I left I feel like I should be paid more, but I'm not confident that I could earn as much as I do now anywhere else. 

Apologies for wall-of-text. **TL_DR** - at £75k am I maxed out in salary (in the UK) for an embedded software engineer without riding the leetcode train into FAANG? (Sorry, I read those things in related subs, I hope I used them right.)  I'm actually not sure my company would survive me leaving - should I ask for more money or am I already hideously overpaid for an engineer with no management responsibilities?",2021-03-21 09:46:10

m0e7lh,Is there such a thing as a part time job with training?,"After a 10 year long carrier in vfx i was thinking of branching out a bit just for a change of scenery. Unfortunately just dumping my quite well paying carrier seems a tad impossible with a kid on the way and everything, but i was wondering is there such a job where you could do a couple of hours outside of work with some guidance and handholding to kind of pick up some skills. 

I do have some experience using python as its pretty much a requirement to bash out scripts and pipeline tools needed to patch up jobs in cg but i am pretty much self taught and my knowledge lacks the structure you might gain in a computer science course at uni.

j9augo,How to prepare for SWE/Technical Interviews as Students and New Grads,"Hey guys!

I know that the interview and recruiting process get's crazier every year and this year is even weirder because of COVID-19. For those people still looking for a good place to start, I compiled some of favorite resources for behavioral/technical/cultural interview prep and just some of my personal tips and advice.

I would say some of my favorites are CSDojo Videos, the Byte-by-Byte guide, and the Tech Interview Handbook. Going through these definitely helped me get my Amazon internship and the other coding practice websites, GitHub repos, websites, and guides here were really useful for some of my other friends too.

1bmnzla,Is support dev work less lucrative than pure dev work?,"I worked in application support for 4 years - I eventually managed to find a support dev role, which I did for 17 months - it was supporting internal custom business applications and I didn't get any code reviews or anything like that, and everything was a mess, but I did end up doing a lot more greenfield work than I was expecting - it was definitely really a hybrid dev/support dev role even though it had been advertised as support dev.  
Then a couple of months ago I started a new role doing support dev for commercial software - we actually use GIT properly, code reviews, CI/CD, daily standup etc - it's a much more professional setup (I've gone from working with 3 other devs to over 30 other devs) and I'm learning a lot more. The new role primarily involves bug fixing, technical troubleshooting, and incremental improvements to the codebase, but there's some greenfield project work that my team is working on too, so I'm definitely not siloed into just answering support tickets.  
With my background in application support, I don't mind working in support dev, but would I be limiting my long-term earning potential by staying in support dev, or should I be looking to move into a 'full' support dev role next time I'm job hunting?",2024-03-24 15:53:36

1bki6lp,Unsure about career path (MSc?),"Hi all, I know this question is asked a lot here, but I haven't found anything pertaining to my current situation. I am an engineering student at a fairly prestigious university in my third year about to go into the integrated masters. I had some issues during 1st year and got 59%; in the second year, I got  70%, but this year, I don't think I have enough for an overall 1st class.

&#x200B;

I did my dissertation in generative AI for transportation. I made a diffusion model with a transformer and got some not-so-great results; I am essentially sampling and receiving one output out of 8 categories with some tiny bits of noise from another category. (but that's another issue, if anyone could help me that would be great!) My supervisor was actually very impressed with my learning and ideas and asked why I hadn't considered doing a PhD. I do feel he is a little out of touch since he thinks my very rudimentary python skills can land me a job.

However, I understood the basics of neural networks, gradient descent, backdrop, loss function etc, built a classifier to get started using Andrew Ng's course, and learned how to use PyTorch; all my deep learning background came this academic year, and for the first time in my academic life I found something interesting. My dissertation involved me reading a lot of papers, and the maths was okay. Given my engineering background, I understand calculus, matrices, eigenvectors, ODEs, PDEs, etc. However, I lack a real statistical background and would like to enter this field.

I'm considering a master's and have a few paths: an MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL (very unlikely I get in), a computer science MSc conversion course with self-taught machine and deep learning, or staying in engineering for now and transitioning into the field. My most straightforward option seems to be continuing with my engineering integrated Master's in engineering, completing the internship I have lined up this summer, and working in a field that I have no passion for.

What would you recommend for someone in my position? Given my background and academic performance, how can I best move into the field? I know the job market is very difficult and even with a masters it would still require a lot of effort. Am I being delusional in thinking I have a chance in this field?",2024-03-21 21:35:10

Obviously I'm still going to try my best for the 2:1. 

My current career goal is to be a machine learning engineer. It's just the part of my degree I've found the most interesting. 

A lot of the job postings I see want a masters. So my question is: If I get a 2:2 should I still get my master's even if it means going to a 'bad' uni? 

Or should I try and get a normal software engineering job first? 

Hopefully none of this matters and I manage to scrape a 2:1 but it pays to be prepared.

1b5vtw7,Seeking Career Advice for Graduate Front End/ Full Stack Development Roles,"Hey everyone, sorry for the long one.  
  
For context, my time at Uni had not been the smoothest due to a health crisis sometime in year 2, that ultimately extended my BSc to five years. Unfortunately, I had to take a 12-month interruption of study, failed my first attempt at 2nd year as a result of said health issue, lost my placement opportunity for the 3rd year as a result of that, and ultimately fell below my projected 2:1 into a 2:2. Yeah, not the best.  
  
With all that in mind, I'm reaching out to for advice on any suggestions on what steps I could take to make myself more marketable to employers despite the lack of work experience and the limits to pursue further education at the moment?  
  
I'm an international student, so my first step has been to get a graduate visa to potentially ease the first two years of trying to get a job. The second has been to start pushing out projects and contributing to open-source ones. I've got about three website projects specifically using Angular and Ruby on my portfolio website and CV that I think stand out, and at least two major contributions to an open-source project on there as well.  
  
Generally speaking, In terms of project work, do you have any potential advice on how to showcase them more effectively to potential employers? Are there specific elements or details that recruiters in the front end/full stack development field particularly appreciate in a portfolio? Additionally, considering my academic setbacks and the fact that most of my noteworthy projects were only really made in the last year, alongside the 2:2 classification and prolonged five-year timeline do you believe any of these have a significant negative impact on recruiters' perceptions of me as an applicant?

1arnobf,CV review: 2+ years experience across various roles.,"Hi all. I have 1.5 years experience in IT support (in CRE) and 7 months experience Software Engineering (Python) for the same company (based in London). I also did a basic python machine learning project at uni. However I am in the process of being made redundant (I got about 1 month of pay left (including notice period and redundancy pay)). I am applying to Python positions at the moment but no luck (not even an interview). I also mass applied to data analyst roles on websites such as total jobs and linkedin. Despite the fact that they have much easier requirements and I pretty much match most if not all the requirements (despite the fact that people state that it's not necessary to meet all of them) I still only get rejections. I also created cover letters for a lot of them (using chatgpt but did made a few minor changes). Maybe its because so many people apply for these positions. Other than maybe my lack of experience I feel like my CV might not be as good as it could be (at least its presentation being more eye catching to employers).

18tloiv,"Senior feeling unchallenged, stuck and over promoted","Long story short, I'm working as a Technical Lead at a company but I don't think this role will translate to a Technical Lead at other companies and I would like a change. 

Some background. I work for a multinational on an off the shelf software solution which I've become very proficient in customising and maintaining. I started working as a developer and I would consider myself about average in coding ability but given when a problem I would back myself against anyone to find a solution so that's what my real strength is. This ability has lead to me being the go-to for any difficult issue or question in regards to solution design. It also eventually lead to promotion to Technical Lead for a couple of our scrum teams which involves helping them be productive and writing both high and low level technical design documents for new stories and epics. 

The problem is that I don't feel like I could be a Technical Lead for a ""proper"" software company if I were to try change company. I don't even feel like I could land a developer role with my current abilities. I haven't coded hands on for months now and I'm afraid I'm going to be stuck between stools where I am. The off the shelf product doesn't help either as all of the work I've done has been taking that product and adding new modules, integrating 3rd parties and other projects like that. I feel that this type of experience won't look impressive enough to interviewers at software product companies. I don't find it overly challenging as the product we use takes care of a lot of the heavy lifting. 

I'm looking for some advice from anyone that may have found themselves in a similar situation. I saw a job posting for Monzo and it made me think wow this is the kind of role I want but I don't think I could ever land. The senior backend and even entry level backend look like they would give me the challenge I want, but I fear it would look back trying to leave for those roles when I've just gone from a ""Staff Engineer"" to ""Technical Lead"" in my current company (brackets are there because I really don't feel like these roles in my company demonstrate the same level of competency as they would in a software product company).",2023-12-29 12:05:43

186wi9q,Junior Developer C# Interview,"Hello,  


Over a year ago I have started learning programming as a hobby (self-taught, no degree) and recently got invited to a 90 minutes technical assessment for a job. I'm very excited about it but at the same time very worried.  


The job ad doesn't go into much detail about the level of knowledge needed, it only says creating/maintaining web apps written in C#/ASP.NET Core and the front-end stack ( JavaScript,jQuery,Bootstrap).  


I've done a few projects with the front-end stack however [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core is relatively new for me as I've only started OOP/C# for a few months and working on a few small personal CRUD projects in my free time.  


I'm at the moment going all over the OOP concepts, brushing up on SQL joins, procedures etc.   


Things I'm having a harder time to grasp/apply on  projects: delegates, events, design patterns, threading. I'll focus on these too.

Interviewers, what would you normally ask in an interview a junior?

I guess I could also take a year in industry (if I can find a placement that is) and graduate in 2026.

Not sure what to do, I work as a full stack developer using typescript and Node.js

Open up further job opprtunties long term.  
Gain experience with lower level concepts such as memory management, more control over stack and heap.  
C# or java : C# has way more job opportunities in the UK, so that would make sense to learn for backend development, and possibly hobby projects like command line tooling. Though I've noticed some larger companies have love for java...  
Rust: Way more exposure to fundamental low level concepts I want to learn long term, but way way less jobs and rarely used for backend web development comparitvely to C#.  
For further context, my direct manager is the technical director and he knows C inside and out, did all the embedded software for our company products and also helped setup the management web app I currently work on, so I'd like to discuss lower level stuff with him purely out of interest.

16qbq96,Non-CS grad. Struggling to get my foot in the door.,"I graduated a couple months ago with a First in Chemistry & Scientific Computing. It's a programming-heavy degree (66%) but I feel like most employers see Chemistry and throw my CV straight into the bin. As such, it's been pretty rough so far with 100+ applications and only 2 interviews. These interviews have just been chats so far and they compliment my soft skills but ultimately say that I don't have enough experience in software. 

I did a mixture of C++ and Python at Uni but my thesis was using C# and over time I feel like C# became my main language (especially because my side projects are C# games using Unity). I've programmed for several hundred hours in C# and I'm very comfortable with the syntax and OOP stuff.

Now the problem - I feel like knowing C# isn't enough for these junior roles. C# seems to go hand in hand with knowing JS, for instance, as well as React, RESTful APIs, Angular, MongoDB, SQL, etc. So I need to spend months/year+ learning these technologies/tools.

Is this typical or am I missing something here? I get that the market is competitive right now and my lack of CS degree doesn't help. I really don't know what to do as programming is really where my passions lie. Unfortunately all of my side projects are games which doesn't seem to be that relevant.

Can anyone provide some advice going forward or their experience being a non-CS grad? How much work and what kind of stuff did you learn in order to land a fullstack/backend job?

My current plan is to use pluralsight to brush up my OOP and then following a course to develop a website. Then I'll use what I've learnt to develop 2 more small-scale web projects to demonstrate my skills. But I'm not certain that these will help so I'm curious what you guys think.

16jdqby,Job switch advice for a Software Engineer with 2yoe,"Hello wonderful community,

I'm reaching out today to gather some insights and advice on my current career situation as a Software Engineer. A little background about myself: I transitioned into the tech industry after completing an MSc Computer Science conversion course, having originally majored in Maths. I joined a consultancy in London in January 2022 with a starting salary of £27,500. My journey began with a 3-month internal bootcamp focused on full-stack development, and six months into the role, I received a raise as did everyone who started with me, bumping my salary up to £30,000. Recently, I was given a company-wide annual raise of 5% in April.

**Career at this company so far:**

**Jan-April 2022** Internal full-stack development bootcamp

**June-Aug 2022** ""On the bench,"" engaging in independent learning

**Sept 2022-May 2023** Assigned to a robust project involving React and TypeScript on the front end and AWS (lambdas, API gateway, step functions, IAM, etc.) on the backend. I gained valuable experience in testing with Jest and Cypress, and collaborated closely with Business Analysts and Designers.

**May 2023-Sept 2023** (Current): Back on the bench due to a lack of available projects.
Challenges & Concerns


I'm increasingly feeling that my professional growth has plateaued, largely due to extended periods ""on the bench."" This has become an organizational issue, as it's hindering my chances for promotion. My self-directed learning, while valuable, isn't a substitute for hands-on project experience and learning from seasoned engineers.

Additionally, I'm finding it challenging to manage on my current salary, especially considering that a potential promotion would only offer an increment of £5,000, which doesn't substantially alleviate my financial concerns.

I've been contemplating applying for other opportunities but am wrestling with imposter syndrome. While my CV indicates nearly 2 years of experience, the practical time I've spent on project delivery is only 9 months. I also have a rather eclectic tech stack, with experience in TypeScript, Node, AWS, and Java, but I'm hesitant because many roles seem to focus on OOP backend skills like C# or Java, and my 2 yoe on my CV isn't actually two years as a software engineer on a project.

**Questions for the Community**

**Stagnating on the Bench:** Has anyone else experienced a similar situation, where being ""on the bench"" at your company stalled your career growth? If so, how did you navigate through it?

**Salary Expectations:** Given my educational background and experience (I feel I'm a good learner, and have done some small personal projects), would it be realistic to aim for roles with a salary of £40k or higher?

Your advice, stories, and suggestions would be deeply valued as I consider my next career steps.",2023-09-15 13:40:03
16dmu10,CVs for new grad software engineering roles,"Hi, my current CV is 2 pages long (and no more.)

This is fine by what my university's careers service is suggesting but I have seen mixed experiences* on whether or not it would be better to shorten it to a single page.

This can definitely be done, as I would just have to trim or remove some sections. These are:

1. The Career profile/About me - a paragraph describing yourself and what you are looking for.
2. Previous work experience (which might not be related, e.g. Tesco's or something)
3. Old education (e.g. secondary school) - is it worth mentioning this at all? I only included it to meet the GCSE requirements.
4. Hobbies - a small section describing what I do in my free time (hopscotch, leap frogging, whatever.)
5. Other skills, e.g. languages, driving license or some other qualification 

Also, what are some details not worth mentioning? 
I know not to include things like birth date or a picture, but what about location of the borough/place/city?

Finally, I would appreciate some insight into what made a CV better than the rest, even if qualifications and experience were roughly the same. Did one have a GitHub showing something extra? Mentioned something special on their LinkedIn? Stuff like that.

16cb5a7,I need a fair bit of careers advice… this may be a long one sorry,"About me: I am 23 years old, live with parents and pay £300 rent to them and that’s it for bills excluding car insurance.

I graduated with a degree in CS in 2021 and joined a crappy consultancy company under a 2 year contract. In that 2 years I have worked for the same client as an automation tester remotely. At the time I did want to give automation testing a chance but now I am thinking for my future career, development will definitely be better.

So my 2 years is nearly over and the client has offered me an associate developer position however I will need to go into the office twice a week and it’s a 2.2 hour drive each way. So it will cost about 8 hours per week and £300 every month on fuel.

I am starting to feel kind of trapped at this point to be honest as many graduate/associate dev positions require you to be graduating this year and where I live right now is only a smallish town so no grad dev jobs are available so I have no choice but to move.

Salary info: Currently earn £30k per annum, if I continue as an automation tester I will get £48k but I think as a graduate dev for this client I will get around £37k. Client is a well known media company but only known nationally.

I’m not entirely sure to be honest on what to do. I have enough savings to support myself and don’t have to pay any bills. At this point would it just be worth quitting and grinding to get a job at a FAANG company or a much better company that is known internationally? As then if I have to relocate the salary/career-progression will probably be worth it.

I guess I have been spoiled working from home for 2 years and have loved saving so much from doing it. But a 4 hour a day commute twice a week seems a bit too much for a grad job…

My future life prospects is ideally I’d like to live and work in China for an international company in the future so spend time studying Mandarin too. 

I excel very easily at my current job and honestly  I felt like I was probably at a mid level automation tester around 3 months into the job…and have no doubt if I put my mind to it I can achieve what I want but I know this will be a grind.",2023-09-07 09:18:53

14egtjc,At an impasse in my career,"Hi all,

I'm a British Citizen and I was working as a software engineer at Amazon in Washington DC, before being laid off in March of this year. I was on an H1B visa over there. Due to this, I have had to return to the UK to continue my job search.

I am looking for both US and UK-based roles. Unfortunately, the market in the US is horrible right now, so I am not anticipating finding work there for some time. In the meantime, I wanted to find a UK role for a year or two while I get back on my feet.

I've been told by many friends and recruiters that my CV is very solid. I get a LOT of attention for UK recruiters on LinkedIn (several per day), and have spoken with many recruiters on the phone who seem very enthusiastic and are keen to send my resume off to their clients.

Unfortunately, despite speaking with a few dozen recruiters, this has not amounted to anything. No OAs, no interviews, nothing. Recruiters will very often ghost at this point too.

I strongly suspect that due to having worked as a software engineer in the US, I am considered ""too expensive"" for UK jobs, as they pay substantially less than their US counterparts. I think companies here see me as a flight risk or unlikely to accept an offer.

So for the foreseeable future, it seems I am unable to get a foothold in either the US or the UK, so I am unsure where to go from here. I am neither eligible for unemployment in the US or JSA here in the UK.

I really do feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and don't see a clear path forward.

I'm single and currently living with my mum, not an ideal situation for an almost 27 year old guy 😂

-	LeetCode and System design interview practice
-	Most importantly, keeping notes on the interviews I got and then practising the questions I could have done better. This really helped in future interviews.

11vymn3,Should I take this placement year?,"Hi guys.

I got a placement year at a tech firm in London. It's an analyst position, specifically consulting companies on how they use cloud computing and ways to optimise that.

I am doing a degree in AI so would like to pursue that. However, I don't mind doing other things in software development, like even working on video games. This analyst position doesn't really fit the bill with what I'm looking for.

My question is, should I bother taking something that isn't really what I want, in other words will it improve my job prospects for a field that doesn't have to do with cloud analysis? Or should I just apply for other positions that are more related? 

Just as an aside I don't really want to do a year in industry, but a summer internship. So really the ideal would be a summer internship in AI. However, if doing a year in the industry even in a field that isn't my primary interest affects my career to such an extent, I will make the sacrifice.",2023-03-19 21:38:58
11svjun,What do you answer a recruiter about changing jobs too frequently?,"So the question is in the title. I am interviewing for London tech jobs currently.

More on my specific case: I have 3 internships and 4 jobs (currently employed at the last one) in my resume. And every job lasted less than a year. 

That was for various reasons: my first job was during my uni years so after a while I decided I am not that interested in what I do there plus I decided to concentrate on my studies. The second one was ok at the beginning, but then I fell into depression and started to hate it. Then after a while I decided I needed some new job in a quite different field (still CS), that was a startup, but i was still depressed and hated working and got fired actually. Finally, I am at Google right now but worried about layoffs and that's why I am interviewing right now.

So those were honest reasons about changing jobs frequently. But how do I present it to the recruiter so that I will not be rejected? Usually I use some combination of ""I needed to concentrate on my studies, then I decided to relocate because of a geopolitical situation (I'm from Russia), and right now I am worried about layoffs"". Does it sound good? Also, I'm 24 years old, am I expected to have 2+ years of experience in one company, or is it ok?",2023-03-16 14:21:55
11qlaeb,What else can I do?,"Ok, I'm a senior developer in .net.

I can't handle it anymore, despite my seniority the company re-organised and we have ""architects"" in charge of every team. Think senior senior.

Some people's code reviews sale through. I do something and I get loads of comments, I do adhere to coding standards. I even write the code in the simplest way so junior or mids easily know what is going on. I use TDD and I still get loads of comments.

I feel like I can't take it anymore. I have anxiety, I feel a knot in my stomach, I hit a punch bag and it doesn't help. I go out and buy beer and I don't want it, it's the only thing that can stop my brain from going back and throw.

It eats away at me because I try really really hard and it is the only thing I thought I was good at. I've been developing for 10 years....

This has been going on for the last year with this new guy. I feel like I can't just leave though I have a daughter and my wife is pregnant so I know I need to suck it up and man up.

I'm just getting to the point where I hate development. I feel like hurting myself for being such a dumb idiot.

I just don't think I think the same as other people, my code is provable but it's just not done the way this guy wants it.. we don't think the same..

What else can I do. I'm begging to know what else I can do, product, (could never sell out and be a scrum master)",2023-03-13 20:49:46
11os64l,UK vs EU for a Comp Sci degree,"Hi. I'm a non-EU third-world country national of 23. I've recently dropped out from my former university where I had studied medicine. Have been mulling over this decision for quite some time and came to a conclusion that I would be better off pursuing something which I have a penchant for-Computer Science. Wanna study abroad. Have two options-UK and EU countries. The former is draconian in fees but the programs are in English. Although my parents can absorb the fees. Conversely, some EU countries are dirt cheap in tuition fees but you have to know the local language like German or Dutch, both of which I have 0 knowledge of. So basically I'd have to both gain proficiency in Maths and a whole new language if I want to break in. What would you do?",2023-03-11 19:05:48
11b8yux,when to look for grad jobs + scared of unemployment,"Hi! I will be graduating from a UK uni later this year. It's a pretty mediocre university so the degree might not be that fancy to have on the CV but I hope I get a good grade (I'd say I have the skills for the jobs at least.) 

I didn't get any years in industry (decided to go on holiday instead but am kind of regretting that now)

I applied for a couple of jobs last year (around 15, around November) then stopped but the good news is I got into and through some early interviews, but no offers.

Anyway, onto the question:

Can I get a software job by the end of this and have I left things too late?

I'm not too bothered about the salary, I just want a normal job once I've graduated. I'm just really worried right now because of the news of ""impending recessions"" and ""tech layoffs"".  If more senior people are having it tough then it's impossible for new grad-to-bes like me.

I am based in London, so ideally I should be looking for at least £28000ish but I don't really know about what the market is like for graduates at the moment. I'm just scared I won't get a job.

Also, I want to avoid some companies I've not heard well about, like Sparta or FDM even if they've improved. Unless they really have.

P.S. if you've read all this, thanks ! It took some courage to post this but I really am worried about my future! I want to be able to buy stuff with my own earned money!

P.P.S. isn't FDM the name of some mail delivery group???",2023-02-25 02:01:26

First time posting, sorry if the post isn't the correct format/layout.

I just need some advice, feel lost as of what to do.

I graduated from my BSc Computer Science degree with a 2:2 in December 2021, did 3/4 months as in Tech support for a fairly mid/large size software company. I had to quit 3/4 months in for my mental health and have been working part time in customer service ever since.

Recently I developed an interest in web development and plan to learn it in my own time with the hopes of obtaining a job in a front end role.

Have I left it too late and is my degree worthless compared to fresh graduates?

10dl346,Unsure about next career moves,"Hi,

I'm a junior dev in the southeast of the UK currently making £25k.

I  have 5 months of experience at my old company, maintaining some classic  ASP application, which I left basically as soon as I could. My current  role, which I've been at for just over 1.5 years, I'm doing .NET  development (some .NET Core 3.1, some .NET 6), working on stuff hosted  in Azure, mostly Azure functions. for a 'digital transformation  company', which at the moment means I'm augmenting the staff of some  other company in the north of the UK (basically bottom of the barrel  work).

To be honest I'm kind of  tired of my current job, the benefits suck (bare minimum, we don't have  paid sick leave apart from SSP etc.), the work isn't that interesting,  we have to do time logging, I have to do Azure exams so the company can  get its shiny Microsoft badge, and I've been asked to do stuff on one  occasion which I'm pretty sure is illegal, like copying code from one  client's project into a new 'template' solution we will be using to  build other client's projects, but I'm pretty sure the client owns that  code because their copyright notice is in the file header...

I'm  not really in a tech hub, the part of the UK I'm in at the moment  (Kent) is basically devoid of tech jobs unless you want to commute into  London which would take me probably over an hour and a half.

Of  course I'm aware that I could just get a remote job, or hybrid and come  in once a week which would be doable. I'm living with a friend at the  moment but I'd like to live somewhere more exciting, I'm 23 and have  barely any social life, and opportunities around here aren't great for  dating and hobbies and such, we are in a fairly shitty area with not  much to do.

So I've been looking  at getting a job in London, as it's the closest city to me and everyone  seems to be indicating that it's the best place to go for software jobs  in this country. However I can't make any sense of it, I've been looking  at 1 bed flats in London and it seems hard to find a good flat for less  than about £1500 - £1600, and this is looking in Zone 3/4. I'd rather  avoid flatsharing if I can, but the average dev salary is about £56k in  London which makes it... somewhat doable, I'd be taking home £3100 ish a  month with my current tax code, assuming I could actually get a job  paying that much (not sure yet).

I'm  not sure how much I would be getting if I was to go for a role in  London, I'm thinking maybe around £50k because I feel like I'm a pretty  average dev but at the same time, I feel like I'm stagnating a lot in my  current role so I'm not sure. But even with £50k the quality of life  isn't amazing as I'd probably be spending over half my salary on rent. I  know you can make a lot of money in fintech, although I'm a bit fussy  when it comes to taking a 'moral' job so I'd probably avoid stuff like  hedge funds at least.

One of our  devs has moved up to Manchester for his new role, I've been looking  there and it seems like there are some decent opportunities. I can't  drive so Manchester seems like a good option for me as it is meant to  have decent public transport as well as being the second biggest tech  hub in the UK, from what I've seen at least.

I'm  also considering places like Cambridge (rent is expensive though) and  Reading (okay place, I went to university there but not a whole lot  going on).

I'm also concerned about leaving family behind if I move up north.

Can anybody give me any  advice on what would be a good choice in terms of cities to relocate  to, or just any advice in general? I guess my main issue is that,  despite salaries being pretty high in London, the cost of living there  is insane, and even people on an average developer salary in London seem  to flatshare for years or move out to a commuter town. It looks like  you can get a flat in Manchester not far from the center for about £800 a  month, while earning a decent salary, so I'm not sure if London is  worth it unless you're a super skilled dev?",2023-01-16 17:29:50

y8bvt0,First-time Contracting Advice,"I'm seeking advice on the current rates for someone getting started with contracting. 

This will be my first time contracting. Outside of IR35. I will do this part-time, on the side of my current job. 

I have 4 years of experience as a full-stack software developer. C#, TypeScript, SQL, React, Node, Azure, Dev Ops etc. 

In my current job, I am one of the two senior developers, in a team of 7. I have had this position for a little over a year. Before this, I was a regular developer at the same company. I also have an additional 1 year of experience with freelance work. I did this during university, my rates at the time were very small, as my objective was to get experience, so it's difficult to apply them to the world of contracting.

I'm finding it very difficult to determine the rate someone with my experience should be charging. Looking at contracting positions on Job sites, the majority of day rates are £400/£500/£600+ (Contracts outside of IR35). I'd imagine some of these have recruitment fees attached to them too. 

Given I have no contracting experience, my initial reaction to those rates is that they are too high for me. I assumed I would be around the £300/£350 rate. 

The company believe I would be better placed at a day rate of £240. I could be completely wrong, but this seems rather low, given I was unable to find any contracting positions that came anywhere near this value. I am told by the company that they have contracted developers in the past at a £350 rate that have 5 - 10 years of experience.

I'm wanting to use this part-time work as an opportunity to fully transition into contracting in the next few years, but at the same time, don't want to work at a rate that makes me feel undervalued compared to the rest of the market. 

It may be the case that this is in fact not undervaluation and that someone with my experience can expect these rates. If that's the case, then I'm willing to accept I have to start somewhere. 

A couple of additional notes:

\- I am UK based, not in London.

\- The position is remote.

\- The company is a small start-up.

\- The work will be very similar to the stack I am familiar with, I may have to learn a few things here and there as you'd expect when joining a company. 

\- There has been no technical test, only a meeting that included some technical discussion.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I very much appreciate any advice here!",2022-10-19 19:29:41
y85mmz,"Should I accept a Software Dev Apprentice Role, where I don't feel confident in my Coding skills.","Hi, so to provide some context. I graduated from University with a degree in Computer Forensics & Security around 3 months ago. Due to finances, I had to move back home to live with my family and I am now in an area where IT / Software Dev jobs are no where near as prevalent as they are in a massive city.

I have been mainly applying for IT helpdesk roles as they are a good way to enter the IT industry as my only work experience is working at a fast food restaurant. Recently, I have received a job offer for a Software Development Apprenticeship role that pays over 20k which is really impressive, given how much training they provide. I really enjoyed my interviews with the company and liked the team leader and manager. The only issue is that I have never really seen myself as a developer. Like yes I can code some things (not in a proffesional sense though), as I had a few advanced programming units throughout college and in my degree, but I also feel like I am quite slow when it comes to grasping logical problems, or thinking of solutions to things.

What I have going for me is great because it was very much explained to me that the role is you know an apprenticeship so a lot of it is learning, practising, listening etc which probably means I could survive at least a couple of months and perhaps pay back my overedraft from Uni. They actually mentioned how the last guy they hired was very talkative in the first interview but then did not speak at all for 2 months so they had to let them go. So my main issue is that I just don't feel confident in my coding abilities and sorta can't imagine myself staying / lasting past probation. Tho I'm certainly happy to give it a go.

I do have an interview on Monday for a role that is more helpdesk like, however the recruiter has said that the hiring team for this company that gave me an offer is going on holiday and they really liked me so they want an answer by either tomorrow or friday and they want me to start in November.

I would appreciate any advice or comments as to what decision I should make.",2022-10-19 15:24:57

wt3oxj,MSc Computer Science Conversion or Bootcamp?,"I have been self studying for the past year with a focus on ultimately transitioning from a career in education to one in Software Engineering/Web Development. I have so far reached a point where I believe I have basic but decent foundation with HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js and MongoDB. I'm currently working my way through The Odin Project and looking towards learning front end frameworks like react.

I'm passionate about getting a job within web development but worried my work experience is lacking and my degree is too irrelevant as it's within the arts. I think launching a career from simply self studying even with projects from this kind of background won't be good enough. I currently have a pause in between jobs and have some money and an opportunity to undertake some kind of formal course. However I'm oscillating back and forth between a bootcamp route and doing an online part time computer science conversion course.

I understand that computer science conversion courses are much broader in scope and don't necessarily teach programming, but I feel such a course is more long lasting than a bootcamp and if it was part time I can still spend my free time filling in programming knowledge gaps with online resources. However the bootcamps seem to offer a much more specialised set of skills that are specifically geared towards the industries I want to enter, so far I have looked at LeWagon and Makers.

wr1bga,Degree Apprenticeship vs Russell Group Degree,"Hi all,

I've posted here about this previously, but feel like I need more advice.

I am currently around 21 months in to my software engineering degree apprenticeship, with around 13 months left to go. At the end, I will be awarded the 'BSc Digital and Technology Solutions Professional (Software Engineer)' degree, from what I believe is a lower ranking uni in England.

I have contacted the careers advice team for my current uni, and they say this will not limit me in my software engineering career, and will actually likely benefit me due to having experience. The Russell Group uni's team has said the same in the past, however I have scheduled another meeting with an advisor to discuss further.

I have some worries, however, as I am definitely not where you'd typically expect a software engineer to be nearly 2 years in - my first company, who I left just over a month ago, did not do any software engineering or coding work. I essentially worked mostly with data tools - no coding - and wrote up technical documentation for them. At my new role, at a very small company where I have been for just over a month, is mainly web dev, and I currently work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all of which are new to me. The project also contains elements of Python, and some libraries for it and JS.

I do quite like my current role, however I don't think I'm necessarily looking to work in web dev in the future, and am working on very simple features since I am so new to these languages and haven't code in a couple years due to my first role. Generally, it happens like this:

1. I am set a simple feature to implement
2. I spend some time trying myself, and am either successful, or:
3. I ask for help and someone shows me, or I use similar code that already exists in the project and change it to suit me.

I am not sure if this is a normal or good way to learn? I am also very slow to implement these features and usually do need help, but I hope that is normal for a beginner. My course also doesn't cover very much theory, so my algorithmic and hardware knowledge is lacking. I am not sure how concerned about this I should be?

The alternative to this is I leave to study CompSci at a university which generally ranks in the Top 20, sometimes higher, for the subject. However, I want to get as much info as possible before I leave my apprenticeship if I am going to do this.

My current interests in employer are companies like Capital One, and big tech/FAANG companies. I currently have been doing some networking, and do have connections to Capital One, Microsoft, and Google.

I would love to get any advice, opinions or insights into my situation.

I hope that I have provided enough info, but there is also some extra on my profile :)

wnd94i,can I negotiate for the upper salary range as a new grad?,"Hi all,

I'm currently a software engineering degree apprentice, with the end of my course being September next year.

Some companies I'm interested in advertise salary ranges for their junior and graduate roles, such as £27k-£35k.

I was just wondering - since I will have 3 years of relevant experience, with 1.5 years directly relevant to the role they're advertising - would I be able to negotiate the upper end of a salary range for a junior or graduate role? My perspective is I have more hands-on workplace experience than a typical grad, whilst still having a degree (currently all of my grades have been 70%+, so hoping to carry that on and achieve a 1st).

Also, not sure if this is relevant, but I've had two employers during my apprenticeship, the first of which has now been bought out by the company whose grad scheme I'd like to apply to - could this also help me in negotiating?

vz4v5k,Is a PGDip or PGCert advisable in my situation?,"Hi, during the upcoming months I will be moving to the UK to work on AI R&D (unless my visa doesn't get approved...) and I would like to explore residing in the UK on long terms basis. My concerns is about how important are qualifications in the UK CS market, specially for AI and Data Science positions.

My worriy is that my degrees (BSc Maths, PhD&MSc in CS) are from my home country, which is a large Latin American nation. They are from the top ranked University in my country and one of the top three in Latin America. And for my PhD, I got an award as top graduate. But still, Latin America is not known for its technological prowess. **Would this be a problem for my career future in UK, even after significant work experience in the field?**

Now, I have been looking into getting a degree online from one of the Anglosphere countries (UK, USA, CAN, AUS or NZL). The benefits would be to pad my resume a little more, getting a paper from a *more prestigious country,* permanently getting rid of having to present TOEFL/IELTS tests on bi-yearly basis and improve my knowledge on the field. Plus I recon it would be a fun side project.

So, looking at my options, the Data Science  program from the University of London Online seems to fit the bill quite nicely. It can take up to 5 years, which means I can take my time and it being focused in DS makes it sufficiently different from my home country degrees, which where in CS. But what intrigues me the most are the PGDip or PGCert options, since they are faster and cheaper to get.

In short. Do you think that a PGDip or PGCert would tick the ""***degree from a respected country""*** **box, when/if is necessary?**

Any other option I should consider?

I just casually applied for a random job and got it without really trying. It's not really my vibe (too much going into the office) but it's a huge pay rise and promotion to tech lead.

I'm tempted to let them know I turned down a job for the money I asked for because I don't think they really believe that's what salaries are these days. Should I do this?

v1nyjb,"Am I doing it wrong/is my approach ""too wide""?"," 

Hi,

I  am a bit late to this (late 30s) and decided a year or so ago that I  would like to get into IT/computing/development. Part of that was based  around pay, but it's since become a true fascination.

Thing  is, I didn't know an awful lot about computers (I was ""above average""  with regards to the average user, although that may be setting the bar  pleasingly low for myself) and over the past year or so have been  learning tonnes of things.

I am  not sure on a job title I want to aim towards, but my fascination lies  with big systems. As in: the notion of an operating system, the way the  components all work together and are integrated, is deeply fascinating  to me. Or larger infrastructure, i.e. the way a large cloud environment  is set up and maintained. I have limited exposure to coding (got some  Java basics) and a lot of what I have done has been mainly around  getting basic IT skills. So for the past year, I've been  focusing on  CompTIA-style IT stuff, understanding how different components work  together, networking (which I also find very, very interesting),  teaching myself some basic Linux skills. That felt a bit diffuse, and it  still does. So I decided to focus on one project at a time. Currently  teaching myself SQL for BigQuery because in the meantime, I landed  myself a tech support job (very basic support for a limited product -  not really desktop or even server environment work, but supporting a  specific type of product).

My  question here is basically: I feel like I want to do something that's  like a backend engineer of sorts and either learn Java or any of the C  languages. However, because of where I am professionally, and because of  the volatile nature of my current job, I am relying on the general IT  skills I taught myself to get me into gradually higher positions (tech  support -> sysadmin -> dev?). With regards to the skillset I want  to have, I'd love to be like this guy: [https://www.youtube.com/c/HusseinNasser-software-engineering/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/HusseinNasser-software-engineering/videos)  So this means learning not just about coding, but also about databases,  reverse proxies, etc. I am just trying to marry up the concepts in my  head I guess, and trying to divine the order in which I should pursue  them.

I am wondering whether all  of this is necessary (it probably strictly isn't) as I have a friend who  doesn't care about developing a broad base for IT-related stuff and who  is just starting with Python and going from there. So should I even  bother with the compTIA stuff? Bearing in mind I can't afford to stay in  this job for years at a time; there is virtually no progression.

I  am just trying to get my thoughts together on this subject, so any  input is welcome; even ""tough love"" input. Also happy to further clarify  and answer questions.",2022-05-31 11:20:33

tkyqrz,I feel unfair of the amount of responsibility my company has put on me as a Junior Software Developer," 

Just a little background, I work for a small company as a Junior Software Developer with about five other developers, one being a Junior as I am and joining on the same day as me. This was about six months ago now.

Recently, about two months ago we were asked if we wanted to learn azure and take the exam, that it would be paid for and that we could spend most of our time studying for it. We both agree. I have wanted to learn azure and felt this would be a great opportunity to study it.

Apart from the fact that the company did not allow us enough time to study, instead, I have been pulled on many greenfield projects and working on a big codebase of legacy code that has taken a huge amount of my time. Getting a lot of tickets a day to resolve.

Then it was mentioned that we must pass the exam due to it being an agreement with Microsoft to keep a certain rating, this came up recently and was not mentioned when previously asked if we wanted to take the exam. Then it went from taking the Fundamental exam to taking the Azure Associate Developer exam. I have never used Azure, the company hasn't even paid for us to use it. I don't have experience as a cloud developer. I don't know how I am expected to pass this.

We have been given one week of full time to pass the exam. Which wasn't a week as has been scheduled on Monday, I have had to pay for it being told that I will be paid it back in my next paycheck.

Here is the thing. I am not passing this exam, I know it. Now I am stressed I will be the cause of the company losing this Microsoft rating and my job. The other Junior feels the same. However, I now also feel that the company has treated us unfairly by doing this.

&#x200B;

I am wanting to know what some of you guys think and what my next steps should be, especially if I fail the exam.

Thanks.

I am due to be promoted to a supervisor role in April, along with another ~20% raise. My original plan was to move to a new role as the pay is still below expectations however I was then offered a place on level 7 diploma (equivalent to the first year of an MBA) and I have jumped at the offer as this is fully funded. I am due to complete this by Summer next year. 


I know that within my current role my progression leads to practice manager however I want to aim higher e.g senior NHS management roles within a trust.

s2f817,Internal move from Senior Software Engineer to Site Reliability Engineer. Salary increase?,"Hey! 

I am a Senior Software Engineer at a fairly large company in London working mostly with .NET in Azure. I have been in the same team for 5 years, ever since I graduated.

An opportunity has arisen for me to move into a newly formed Site Reliability Engineering team. This would be a role change to Site Reliability Engineer. I'm pretty excited at the potential move; I have tended to gravitate towards that sort of work in my current role, and the new team contains some of the smartest engineers at the company so I'll be able to learn a lot from them. 

Given it's a role change, I'm being given the opportunity to enter salary negotiations. I currently earn a base salary of £58,000, however I do a significant amount of on-call which totalled £16,500 last year. Therefore my total take-home pay is around £74,500. 

If I move, I won't be able to continue doing on-call for my current team, which means I'll lose out on those payments. I appreciate in theory SRE's do quite a bit of on-call, but it doesn't sound like that's going to be a significant part of the role yet. The team is still finding it's footing, and on-call is pretty embedded in the product teams.

I do not want to take a real-terms pay cut if I move. Am I being unrealistic if I ask my base salary to increase by 28% from £58,000 to £74,500 to make up for the shortfall in on-call payments?",2022-01-12 19:53:50

o2k866,"Career next choice between a contracting ""Lamborghini"" and a permanent ""bar of gold""","Hi all,

I'm a business intelligence analyst and have been contacting for the past 2/3 years in London. I've just received two job offers and it's so hard to tell which one to pick so thought I would ask here.
Basically, there are two roles, one permanent, one maternity leave contract.
Perm is with a massive telecoms company but through a consultancy firm (based in India). The contract is with a small boutique finance company.
I've been diversifying my experience in different markets with the aim to eventually build my own consultancy firm in process analysis and BI. Since returning to the UK for 7 years in China, I've found it difficult to readjust into London life and a few roles I've had didn't end well but were great learning curves. As time had gone on I've gotten more adjusted and better at delivering results in jobs in London though I've had thoughts of wanting a more permanent role from time to time as I worry I don't know if I'm growing fast enough to justify continued contracting. This has made the decision even harder because either choice will take me on a different journey but both have prospects.

Perm role details: data analyst (telecoms)
Standard pay for my skills, 
consulting role (though with Indian consultancy firm so not the same perks and also, I do feel a little like I did in China. Hired more for being a native westerner than for my skills, but still, my skills will be used), 
uses Qlik sense which I've had 5 years experience in and may want to continue to brush up on. 
There's support from the consultancy firm but it's very hands off management as well from the telecoms company which I think may be a good mix potentially.

Contact role: lead data analyst (finance)
Better pay (Inc car allowance; 20% better, excluding car allowance: 10%),
First finance opportunity I've been offered which will help diversify my portfolio of experience,
Boutique size means my voice can be heard more (potentially),
Another crucial aspect is this role is a lead data analyst role, leading the weekly scrum meetings so it's a slight step up for me with a lot to learn.
It will use power BI which I have less experience in (just 1 year) but it seems more popular here with SMEs and it's easier to use (I think).
They talk about possible extension once maternity leave is over but I doubt it.
Possibly good learning curve with hand over period

Both are working from home so no worries there.

I need to make the decision by end of today potentially (at maximum push, Monday 21st) so it's killing me because both are excellent opportunities, but which is best to move forward in my career?! I know it's down to me but anyone with thoughts and inputs, I would highly appreciate it.

gj8yb3,Imposter syndrome as a developer,"Just a general thought. This may be a bit of a twist on the original meaning of imposter syndrome where someone may feel below pair or undeserving of where they are at work.

I'm 3 years ish into my graduate role as a .net developer and am looking around now for new roles ( bloody Rona!! ). 

I often think that although in fairly comfortable with development at work, I would struggle in new roles because what I'm comfortable with is the specific processes and tools we use. I am looking to get a job up in London, currently down in Brighton area, and I really worry that what I've learnt so far or my ability as a developer just wont be up to par in new roles although o guess I'll never really know until I try.

This may be a reflection on me as a developer or simply because I've only ever had one developer job but I guess it's just a conversation starter to see if anybody else feels or has felt the same way.",2020-05-13 22:06:27

1boys2b,"Out of my depth at work, what should I do?","I've recently joined my company from a non-cs background. I was placed in an intensive BootCamp for 3 months at the beginning that taught me everything from scratch. While the BootCamp was poorly led and structured, I still believe I was the worst performing in my cohort (it took me longer to grasp the concepts and implement them into practice).

Since then, there have been some admin issues with not only me but with other grads where we have been moved around teams a lot and have been placed in limbo with no tasks or team and just expected to come in and 'self-study'; this is during the period we were meant to be introduced to our team's technology and given mini tasks to help our understanding, etc.

Only recently I fully integrated into my new team which is great but I believe they overestimate my abilities as a developer. I've been given simple tasks at the beginning which were fine and there have been no complaints but every time I've been assigned new tasks it has become harder and harder, to the point I don't understand what I'm looking at half the time.

This has been causing me some anxiety as I am only one of two developers in my team so it's only a matter of time before they will catch on that I am not capable of this role. Everyday I have the thought of quitting but I can't at the moment (penalty in my contract). My contract ends in 5 months and only then will it be feasible for me to move roles.

Does anyone have advice on what I should do? I don't want these next 5 months to be miserable trying to tough it out but I also don't want to be caught out and let go early (which is highly unlikely but still possible if I'm not capable of my role).",2024-03-27 10:42:19

1bnl7ft,Confused about progression (Fairly New to IT),"  
Hey everyone I hope you're all well.  My friend recommended I post here, I've created a new account to keep things anonymous while I seek your advice.  (Please note I have autism so apologies if anything comes across as hard to read).

  
For the last 6 months I have been working in an IT service desk role, which is literally just answering calls and typing up tickets.  The only IT and technical parts of my job are resetting passwords and reinstalling apps occasionally, anything more complicated getting passed to our outbound MSP.  Besides that, I end up doing a variety of other tasks, like sorting out purchase orders and handling customer complaints.

  
I don't currently hold any IT certifications, but I'm actively working towards the CompTIA exams and will be sitting the a+ next week and will be studying for the Network+ and Security+ next. However, I do have a master's degree in Computer Science (Merit) which I got 6 months ago through distance learning from Abertay University, and a history degree (2.1) After completing my degree, I attempted to get into graduate schemes but didn't succeed, partially due to my struggles with interviews, although I communicate effectively over the phone and via teams.

  
The place I work at now is a small non-profit funded largely by the council, they let me work from home 2 days a week. I only do about 2-3 hours of work a day, tell the company this regularly and ask for additional work but they tell me they don't need me to do anything else other than await calls.  While they're supportive, I can't help but feel a bit patronised at times, especially with how they approach my autism. They mean well, but it often feels like they're not giving me enough to do because they're a bit wary. The company is pretty small, just about 25 employees, and I'm on £25k a year, which isn't bad for living near Leeds. But I honestly just want to get into something more technical.  My undergraduate degree  was in history, and for my previous work experience I worked in customer service at a call center and as a shift manager at a supermarket.

  
Would anyone be able to advise me on what I can to to progress my career, I'd ideally like to progress to a systems administrator or similar at some point but understand I am not ready for this yet.  Ideally I don't want to have to manage a large team, and would prefer to work in a more technical role.

  
Thanks for the help in advance everyone

1bfbfsg,Unusual background - Looking for advice,"Hi All, 

I am hoping for a little advice on how to market myself to put me in the best possible position to obtain a full time junior role in the web development field. I would also like to apologise in advance for the long read. 

My background is a little unusual, so I am unsure how I will look to potential recruiters/HR teams

Firstly, I am older (28M) and graduated in 2018 with a MEng in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from UCL (minored in computer science). At that point in my life I was very interested in sales so I went for a graduate role fintech (funding circle) as a business development associate. I did that for about a year, before I went on to working on my own ventures. 

The first being a fitness tech business, where I was mainly involved in hardware as well as sales. I did this for a year until moving on to another venture for personal reasons, the team at the fitness tech were quite volatile, and I did not see the company succeeding with the current people we had (this ended up being correct as they have not made any progress since me leaving) 

After that, I moved into the property space. Me, and a cofounder, founded a digital luxury estate agency which caters to predominately HNWI's. I am involved in everything here, from business strategy, marketing (most of our clients come through ad channels which I have been in charge of curating and maintaining). Sales (selling £1m+ properties to international investors), branding etc. We have also put together a team of people, a social media person, as well as multiple sales people. I have been in charge of managing the team. I have been here for around 3 years now and the business is successful (we have been profitable every year). 

I consider myself an entrepreneur, as I have been working for myself for a number of years now, however I have fallen out of love with it. I dislike having people's future (my sales team, cofounder etc.) rely on my performance, this is a level of stress I no longer wish to deal with. On top of this, I have fallen out of love with sales in general (one too many awful clients can do this to a man) 

Over the last year or so, I have been picking up web development, this started as a business decision in order to build a SaaS platform for my current company however for multiple reasons this did not work out. I still ended up learning HTML/SCSS/JAVASCRIPT/TYPESCRIPT/REACT to a decent level and have a few main projects I have completed. One being a javascript based battleship game which I did to practice my logic. The game is quite robust, and the when the computer plays it has a good level of intelligence. Another project which is more functional is a property valuations calculator widget which is live and embedded on our WIX website. We use this as a form of lead generation (landlord leads). I have also incorporated endpoints here as automated emails are being sent with the results of the valuation. As well as lead flow directly into our CRM. 

This leads me to where I am now, I cannot see myself doing what I am currently doing for the foreseeable future and have found a genuine love for web development, I enjoy building things. I always have, which is one of the main reasons I have been working on my own businesses for the last few years. I also want some stability with a salaried role rather than only being paid on good months. 

My aim is to leave my current role as co founder (albeit with some equity) that business will keep running and I will be an external consultant where I can be useful here and there. I want to further my learning in web development, learn new technologies. and get a stable job as a junior. However, from what I have been reading on reddit this seems like an impossible task. My background has taught me alot of things which I feel can put me at an advantage- soft skills wise I am great, being in sales for HNWI's will teach you these things I guess. I have a broad knowledge of different aspects of business i.e marketing, branding, social media presence, running a team etc. and hope this can work in my favour, however none of this is technically relevant work experience for web development. 

I  guess my question is for anyone who took the time to read my post (and I appreciate you for this). As a sales based entrepreneur,  with a STEM degree from a top university, but no formal experience in web development do I stand a chance in obtaining a junior role? And if you were me, how would you go about marketing yourself to employers?

* Does Meta sponsor visa for the London office?
* In the program manager role, is it purely project management leveraging my technical expertise or is there a hand-on aspect whereby I would be expected to do Quality Assurance review for technical stuff?
* What can I expect in terms of salary? I have seen a range of 87k to 120k GBP per year for Program Managers? I have over 10 years of exp with 8+ years in Security Consulting.
* How normally are the interviews structure for such positions? I have seen people saying for SWE, you have to solve coding problems. However in my case, there is no coding. Is it only discussion & conversation driven?

1b2x5os,Advice for a change in career,"Currently I'm a doctor in GP training. Unfortunately I hate the job and want to change career. If I'm honest I probably should have studied maths / comp sci at university. 

I'm looking on some advice on how to transition. I've coded since I was a teenager, but only ever self-taught. 

I have 2.5 years left of GP training (which I will probably complete), but that will hopefully give me time to build a portfolio (given no formal CS training). I am thinking of trying to build my portfolio around C++.

1b2ofi8,Career advise ,"
I am seeking advice / good wisdom as I think have not managed my career well and I wonder what te do now.  I kind of drifted from one job or project to another and end up a bit lost and without amazing skills.

I will describe what I’ve been up to and I would like to get helpful suggestions as to where I could go next.

I’m an EE by trade, 20yoe, 7 years FPGA, 13 years writing software mainly in C++ developing software for hardware devices. Not algorithmic stuff and not enterprise. I only worked at very small outfits. 
The main projects I delivered are: several APIs, a few GUIs and recently developing a fairly big app running on Linux on a SoC (bunch of systemd services, some webAPIs also written in C or C++), a Yocto BSP and some driver debugging.
I also did a few small projects in C# - library and WPF UI.
None of it is rocket science nor complex.

I enjoy mostly pure software work, when hardware is not a consideration. For example I enjoyed working on the UIs. I developed a small Django app a few years back and loved it too. I think this is the kind of work I’d like to do if I could.

What do you think are my realistic options given where I am now? I feel that the work I did was too repetitive and my skill set is now too narrow.

One option is to double down on embedded and do some bare metal. There seems quite a few opportunities around. I don’t enjoy it that much but it fits well with my existing experience so seems achievable.

Do I have much hope to be able to do non hardware related work in the languages I have experience already C++ or C#? 
Note, I have no problem learning new languages but without professional experience I doubt I’d be taken seriously.",2024-02-29 01:58:41
1b2e4g1,Which companies use hackerrank for their technical interviews?,"I just did a technical round with IBM (for a role in London) and I bungled it up.

For exmaple lets take Luck Balance as an example (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/luck-balance/problem?isFullScreen=true&h\_l=interview&playlist\_slugs%5B%5D=hackerrank). Also a normal input such as (contests = \[\[5, 1\], \[2, 1\], \[1, 1\], \[8, 1\], \[10, 0\], \[5, 0\]\]) is formatted in the STDIN weird format.

1aqlix6,Should I Go Back to University for a CS Degree,"So a bit of context 

I did a Media Production degree after trying Comp Sci 10 years ago and struggling back then due to the poor faculty and lack of help and generally never coding before 2014

After Media Production turned out to be the biggest waste of money I've spent. I'm partly to blame for this because I failed to really take advantage of the extrastuff at university. 
I then came full circle and ended up getting my first few Data analyst/Dev jobs around 2021.

Unfortunatly for me I'm at a dead end as I got laid off at around August the very moment I got back from holiday citing - buget issues, my position was the only one eliminated (keep in mind this is while I'm still working in Europe so laws are diffrent to how layoffs work here)

Haven't been able to find anything else since, I do have a fallback job which is customer service, but  its driving me nuts (had to take it with no alternatives) and from what it seems like everyone and their mother wants CompSci degrees.

Would it be worth it solely for the networking oppertunities and placement year to try another undergraduate Comp Sci degree? Kinda at my wits end here. Knowing what I do know, would it be a viable idea?",2024-02-14 12:16:38
1als6ji,Showing non-uni taught skills for graduate jobs,"There are some jobs popping up now but I can't apply to them. The main issue for me is that I haven't got proper experience or practical knowledge of the stacks they use.

My knowledge mainly consists of Python, JavaScript and C++, as taught throughout my university modules.

But the jobs I always see popping up tend to mainly use either:
- Java, paired with spring boot
- C# and .NET

How can I apply to these jobs? I believe that most of the practical knowledge can be transferred to the new language but I need a good way of showing this to the recruiter.

One method I am thinking of using is creating a small application using a familiar language (e.g. data on a map using Python) then finding the right libraries and replicating it with the unfamiliar tech stacks.

Then, once again comes the problem - wouldn't I need to beef it up more for the CV? So it is at a more advanced level like for the university modules?

I guess in the end I need to put more time into learning these two specific technologies as there is a lot of demand for them. Just would appreciate advice on what an interviewer or early careers person would look out for.",2024-02-08 09:50:09

I am teaching myself to code (with some help from a friend), and am using the MERN stack to develop a web-app for my current employer to improve a particular process they carry out. The app development is going well, and is receiving quite a bit of excitement within the company due to some of it's capabilities, but it feels like taking it forward quickly is moving slightly beyond my skill level. 

I am currently on just shy of £50k, which is quite low for a engineer with my experience in central London, but from what I can see, seem relatively high for a software engineer with my coding experience (just less than 1 year).  

**My first question is:** *Is it reasonable to be asking for a pay-rise in March, and by how much would seem sensible?* I feel that I should ask due to the potential and value I bring with the app, however am aware that I might not be getting paid this much elsewhere as a software engineer. I suppose I am trying to work out how much my domain knowledge is worth.

**My second question is:** *When is the right time to move on to a company more focused on developing software?* I think I am lacking in personal development due to not being within a dedicated software team, and being the only individual within my firm that can actually code (potential to learn bad habtis). However, I am in complete control of the project I am working on, and with the on off help of my friend, am getting experience across lots of areas of development.

18xuvy7,2-3 YoE But feel quite Niche. Unsure what to focus on learning an which areas to pursue? How to show case skills without professional experience?,"I studied Theoretical Physics so im more or less self taught / learnt on the job when it comes to software engineering. I have been working at a small start up (3-7 people) for the last 2.5 years, exclusively in python.

I have definitely grown a lot as a programmer but I worry I have become quite niche and will find it hard to find other roles. **My experience is entirely in computational geometry, operations research / other combinatorial optimisation problems. I'm confident in my ability to design an write complex software and to pick up new technologies**. But I feel like I have been stuck on this work due to the scale of the start up. I have found a few roles within this niche but there are not many.

When I look at other software roles I often see that **I meet the python requirements 2-3+ years. But the more ""standard"" software/backend stuff im not experienced in**. I regularly see these in job adverts and I have very minimal experience in all of them**.  AWS (cloud), APIs (flask,Django, fast api, REST, GraphQL), Docker, DevOps, DataBases (Mongo etc).**

This job has been effectively my only position and I think that it might be quite hard to find another job. However after that, especially if it is a bit more general, I feel like I will be in a good position to find future work. So I just need to get that second job.

I am going to try and pickup these at my current job if possible, but the start up is looking a bit shakey financially and I think I need a new job asap.

However im unsure if I should pursue the backend route as it seems like there is a lot to do and I may be better off focusing my attention elsewhere. My current ideas are:

* **stick in this niche** and hope I can find work and become a expert in the area. Less secure as again, its niche, but for the roles that are in that field I should have a better chance at getting.
* focus on the **mathematical algorithm route. Increase my C++ skills** (I have done some in the past in personal projects) and look for more **mathematical/quantitative developer roles** as supposed to the geometry roles.
* **Pick up some more geospatial skills** and try and transition into the area of software as it is quite adjacent to computational geometry.
* **focus on the python backend route**. This seems the least interesting to me but the most stable and secure job wise. It additionally has a lot of resources online.
* **focus on Machine learning**. I have done some in the past, find it interesting and seems like it will be increasingly common in the future. I have a good maths background so feel confident in this area.

At my current job I can try and move into more back-end stuff/ML as we do both of those within the company.  As for the others, and potentially the backend and ML I would have to learn and showcase my knowledge through personal projects. This does suck a bit because after sitting inside all day coding I want to get outside and exercise/socialise but it might be the only option.

**So I guess to some it up. If anyone has experience in those areas, how do they find the work, and job market?**

**Have you also transitioned between areas and had to create personal projects to showcase your understanding. How did you find it?**",2024-01-03 21:38:16

18qvbnt,To move out or not to move.,"Hi all,  
  
Background: I'm a developer with roughly 4 years of experience in Java, currently earning £40k per annum. I reside in the north-east of England and mostly work from home, needing to commute to the office once a week.  
  
Situation: I've noticed I'm becoming too comfortable in my current, slow-paced role and am considering a change. However, I'm facing a dilemma. Opportunities seem scarce in the north, and relocating to a busier area like London means most of my increased salary would go towards living expenses. Currently, I live with my parents without contributing to bills or mortgage, which allows me to save significantly. For instance, moving to London might boost my income from 40k to 60k, monthly, my income will get raised by £900, but the costs for rent, utilities, broadband, and food are likely to exceed this increase.  
  
Experience: My career includes 2 years as a Java Associate Developer and 1.5 years as a Java Developer Intern.  
  
Seeking Advice: I've been contemplating this move seriously but remain undecided. Should I plan to move south, or explore options elsewhere? Any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated.  
  
(P.S.: My parents are supportive of my current living arrangement as they want me to save up for my own house.)

18dnicm,Next Career Move - Business Analyst or Cyber Security?,"Hi, 

Bit of context, I am a Comp Sci grad who recently left my first tech job after almost two years. It was a bit of a weird vague role, mainly leaning towards a mix of BA and UX consulting. The decision to leave was for various reasons but mainly just feeling underpaid, lacking a face to face team and collaborative opportunities, and tasks became repetitive. I've been looking into lots of different paths I could go down, even outside of tech, but have narrowed it down to either BA or cyber security.

I've always found cyber security the most interesting area in tech, even though my experience is pretty limited to a couple modules during my degree. I tried applying for cyber grad schemes after graduation but couldn't land any. My biggest worry at the moment with going into cyber security, is putting in months and months of learning and project building and then struggling to land even an entry level/junior cyber security role, and potentially having to start at a lower level in something like a help desk role and build my way up. It seems like the barrier to entry for cyber security roles is quite high but once your in your good.

On the flip side, BA seems like it would be a smoother transition, and I think I could find a role fairly quickly based on my practical experience. But, after digging into it, the work sounds a bit dull to me. Plus, there's a lot of client/stakeholder interaction, which I can handle, but it's not exactly my favourite task to have to do.

I'm feeling a bit lost, torn between diving into a new, exciting field where breaking in might be tough but the work excites me, or sticking with something I know I can get into fairly easily, but might lead to tasks that don't really interest me.

I'd really appreciate any thoughts or advice you might have on this. Thanks.",2023-12-08 14:03:48

- offer: meta e5 in London
- offer: TC around 145k + joining bonus
- I am from a 3rd world country but currently live in Germany (on blue card) at another tech company with around 100k euro salary. 
- for me priorities in life are: 1) living in developed country 2) living in english speaking country 3) money

**Pros of taking the offer:**

- I make more money
- I get to live in London (english speaking and I won't have to learn German anymore)
- better tech companies and interesting work in London
- I really want to live in the UK instead of Germany (culture wise)

- meta might do layoffs again. will I be able to find another job in London that sponsors my visa in just 2 months?
- have to give up my chance of getting PR in germany
- it takes 5 years to ILR in UK and I am beholden to my job during that period. worst case I will have to go back to my home country (don't really wanna do that)

ive been working at a high profile investment bank for 4 months on a 2 year grad scheme as a developer. Ive had very little work to do each day, and the work i do do is seldom developer work, more general tech. Work env is very relaxed. I live with parents and save most of my entire take home (\~40k before tax). 2 days in office a week.  


I have been offered a job in london for a hedge firm offering 70k for a very junior position. This role offers a lot more challenging work environment as it is a very small team with high responsibility. Id expect to learn a lot very quickly. 3 days in office per week. Id (obviously) end up saving a lot less in London. Id probably be on the same salary after 2 years where i am now, but by then the new place maybe 90k.

I feel like i would be exchanging mental wellbeing/ living with family (which i enjoy a lot) with career progression.

I dont expect id be the sort of person to avail of all of what London has to offer.

I know this is a very subjective choice, but what should i do? Would i be stupid to decline? Im sure others have had to make similar decisions before in this field, did you regret it?

Got about a year of GoLang experience however the microservices written in GoLang were already there when I joined so have mostly maintained the existing codebase.

I find that the PHP market has declined heavily with the majority of roles web focused being node based. Non web roles being primarily a mix of Java, .NET, Ruby, Python etc.

I guess I feel a bit stagnant with my career progression.

Surprisingly (perhaps?) finding it difficult to find companies working with other tech stacks to take me on and give me a chance even it it means a pay cut temporarily.

My main concern with the role is that the primary responsibility is to manage a single Excel sheet and maintain its integrity. The problem arises because up to 20 other individuals could also manage and edit the same Excel sheet, potentially disrupting certain functions. I don't feel particularly comfortable with this being my sole responsibility, as it doesn't seem very practical or convenient for me or anyone else involved. I would prefer if this solution were transitioned from Excel to an SQL-based platform like Airtable. I believe that what they truly need is a database rather than an Excel sheet, though I fear that my request might be disregarded given my junior position.

Furthermore, I would be required to work in the office from Monday to Friday, from 9 am to 6 pm, with only one day of remote work allowed per month. Additionally, the company does not have very favorable reviews on GlassDoor.

On the other hand, accepting this job offer could potentially lead to a degree apprenticeship opportunity once the initial contract ends, which could significantly benefit my future career prospects.

16issic,Looking for advice - 2-3 YoE Software Developer and studying for a degree in SWDEV,"I am looking to get some advice on what you guys would do if you were in a similar position as I am.

Currently, I am a software developer working for a small biotech start-up. I have been working there for 2-3 years. Although this has been a great opportunity for me to gain some experience and get my foot in the door, I feel that my progression has somewhat stalled, and my salary is only £20K as the company doesn't generate much revenue. One year ago I started studying to get a degree in Software Development in Business as the company partnered with a nearby university. This allows employees to study while working under the graduate apprenticeship programme, of which I have completed the first year so far. This has given me the chance to obtain a degree whilst also working full-time. Although I'm not considered an apprentice at my work place, I do feel it does have an affect on what employers think of me as they see that I am still studying.

For the past few weeks, I have been actively searching for a new job as my situation is calling for progression as its no longer sustainable on this salary, aiming for a salary of around 35-40k. Mainly I apply for back-end or full-stack engineer positions based in Glasgow or Edinburgh as I'm from Scotland, or remote for elsewhere in the UK. So far it hasn't gone terribly, with interest from 9 companies so far out of around 60-80 applications (haven't been counting), 3 of which being for senior positions for sizeable companies. This seems a bit odd for someone with around 3 years experience and still studying but I didn't get past the first stage anyway as I anticipated. I have had one take home test which had a technical interview after and unfortunately didn't make it to the next stage, and another live coding test on hackerrank which was interesting.

The tech stack I'm experienced in is Python, AWS, Vue.js, MySQL, JavaScript. As I'm working at a small company I have quite a lot of responsibility and have been able to cover more areas than others would get in a couple years. This is good in a sense but it also means that I am lacking in certain other areas as the team is small and the development practices are pretty informal and unstructured. The areas I'm lacking experience in are fundamental requirements for most of these job positions, such as containerisation using Docker/Kubernetes and other things like unit testing. I have started a side project at home which will help me to learn about these areas as well as exploring other frameworks like Django and React to be able to add them to my skillset, helping for future applications.

Looking to hear all advice and opinions on my situation. Do you guys have any recommendations that can help me in my job search or help me improve in my interviews? Such as better job boards or ways to network within Scotland or online in the UK. As I've completed one year at uni that is technically a HND so there is the possibility of quitting and just putting the HND on my CV as that my be less of a turn off for employers. I am also open to hearing about anyone that is in or has been in similar situations or if you have studied while at work.

Willing to post my CV if anyone would like to see and help improve it.

Currently upskilling in Django and React to add to my CV. Seeking advice on my career search and routes i should take, there is the option of quitting uni as it seems to turn off some employers although recruiters dont think it does.

16e53qm,End of probationary period + interview promises - ask or keep my head down?,"Hi, I graduated this summer and got a job right out of uni. I'm tech support for a pretty small and niche software company, but I also do some implementation stuff for customers who buy our software by personalising their setups, some web stuff, etc. 

I'm getting 37k. I'm so excited and and grateful for this, it's much more than I thought I'd get in my first professional role. However, living in London is hard and I got screwed for rent due to being desperate. I was also told we'd be moving offices before I started or within a few weeks of me starting and chose to move to a more expensive place in the knowledge I'd save a lot on transport, but I've just hit three months and we still haven't moved offices. Three months is also the end of the probationary period, and my manager told me that 'the pay increases in the first few months'. My manager said nothing at the end of my probation, so I guess it's lapsed and I passed it, but it'd be nice to get some confirmation.

It's a good wage for a new grad. Although the rent sucks a lot, I'm not starving. I just have no savings coming out of uni and feel pretty insecure living paycheck to paycheck, with random expenses coming up left and right. I worry that being new to this whole field I'm not doing enough or will screw up and lose this job and then not be able to afford to live. 

Basically I want to know, what's my next move? Should I tell my manager I want to talk about whether I passed my probation? Should I bring up the promise of the pay increase in the first few months? End of probation seems like that would be the time for it, but maybe I should wait until 6. Is it unreasonable to ask for some kind of travel allowance or to work from home more days a week than usual (usual is 0, but we can on the odd day if we ask and we did for a couple weeks while my manager was out) while we wait for the office move? 

Thanks for your help. I'm not sure how to approach discussing these sorts of things, I've only ever done small part time roles and factory work before. ",2023-09-09 12:56:56

169zl8v,Choosing a town/city in the UK,"Hi,

Junior developer here, I mostly work on backend .NET stuff with a cloud focus. I've got just over 2 years experience and am on £25k so looking to move on to a new role, potentially mid level.

However I'm currently based in a pretty meh part of the UK without many tech jobs (think commuter territory to London, but one of the more deprived areas with long travel times to London). I'm looking to move to an area with more opportunity, but struggling to decide on where to move to.

Ideally I'd like to work for a larger company, doesn't necessarily have to be huge, but thinking the sort of companies that have 1000+ employees in LinkedIn, but I'd probably be happy with something smaller like a couple hundred. At the moment our company has like 50 people and I wouldn't want to go for a smaller one or a startup.

I know that London is supposed to have the highest salaries, best career progression and highest number of jobs, so I was considering moving there - however, I'm not sure if it's actually worth it, considering the insane cost of accommodation. Lots of people say that the vast majority of jobs are in London and it's harder to build a career elsewhere, the salaries are too low etc.

Looking into other cities like Manchester, Glasgow etc., it seems like for the quality of life you get in Manchester on £40k, you'd need to be taking home about £65k in London, and that's just to get the same amount left after rent + bills + transport - so that money left over wouldn't go anywhere near as far as it does in Manchester in terms of saving for a deposit and such.

Rents for a flat in Manchester are like £1000 for a 1 bed, in London it's like £1800, possibly more, plus the transport in London could be up to £200 while it's much cheaper in Manchester (think about £50?)Getting £40k in Manchester, or somewhere like Reading, Bristol, Nottingham etc. seems like it would be easier with 2 years experience than getting £65k in London, having looked at the job postings...

Plus you get annihilated by higher taxes at really high incomes, so even if you can get much higher salaries at senior levels in London, I'm not sure if that would even go that far compared to getting like £60k as a senior elsewhere.

I know that you can get really high salaries in companies like investment banks and fintechs, but then it basically seems like you have to choose those sorts of jobs if you want a decent income, whereas in another city you could just choose some generic ecommerce web dev job and still make a decent living.

I'm aware that I could work remote/hybrid and commute from somewhere cheaper, but a lot of the appeal of London and other cities is that they are good places to be socially in your 20s compared to a commuter town. Also I know you can houseshare in London, but I was under the impression that London salaries would make up for the cost of living WITHOUT having to compromise in that way, I know they can be ok but I've heard horror stories too.

Plus you have to deal with longer commutes in London among other things. Older threads on this subject seem to heavily encourage people to move to London rather than other cities but I'm not sure if that's even a good idea anymore.

Anyone got any thoughts on this? It seems like there is a large focus on London when it comes to these subs, and other towns/cities don't really get mentioned. So if anyone could mention their experiences in other parts of the UK, that would also be helpful.",2023-09-04 18:21:52

15uql9v,Implementation consultant or trying to be a developer?,"
Hi I have been working nearly 4 years since graduation as an implementation consultant in the UK. Day to day job includes installation, configuration, teach customer how to use our software, a bit code bug fixes. It requires lots of specific domain knowledge and some basic JavaScript to use our software.You need to travel often after covid.


I have been thinking of trying to be a developer, as it may be more interesting, potentially earning more money and less travelling. Ideally I would like to have a fully remote job. I have a CS master degree in the UK. The current job was the only one I could find that gives me visa sponsorship. I tried to apply developer job last year, the closest one was that I finished all 4 rounds of ocado Java developer interview but they didn't give me the offer.

Boss told me the developer role in my company may earn less than my current consultant role. They also need my language skills(native mandarin) to communicate with customers so they want me to stay as a good consultant instead of a new developer. But for sure in the long run I think you can learn more widely acceptable useful stuff and it's easier to change a job as a developer compared to consultant.

The good side of the current consultant role is once you know enough, it's fairly simple everyday. Not much of stress and you don't need to sit there all day to learn much. But the downside is that you attach yourself to the product too much and it's almost impossible to apply those knowledge once you switch a job.

I hopefully will get my UK residency in less than 2 years and I guess it will be much easier to find a job without worrying about Visa sponsorship. So in the next 2 years I need to practice leetcode, pick up Java/python/JS or whatever popular again and hopefully can find a job that earns 40000+ pounds. Is it achievable, or any suggestions are very welcome.",2023-08-18 17:20:57

I'm considering transitioning into IT/tech as I'm highly motivated to find a remote or hybrid remote position (I live in rural south east and can't move because of family who need support). I'm not particularly driven by money, I would like to achieve a comfortable middle class salary after I have gained several years of experience (37-45k annually pre tax) but work/life balance is far more important to me than continually chasing careers goals. 

I've always been decent with computers but I've never actually pursued it as a viable career option. I'm fairly confident that if I applied myself that I would be able to become a competent employee. I've spent the last 2-3 weeks working on a free web design course to get my feet wet and I've found it fairly engaging. 

The problem is that I don't really have any reference for what career paths in IT/tech are like. I'm considering a 12 week government funded boot camp to help build some momentum and develop my skillset before approaching an apprenticeship. They offer the following:

IT cloud level 3

Software developer level 3

Data utilisation and analysis level 4

Software tester

Can anyone offer some general advice on which path may be most appropriate for someone in my position based on the kind of career I'm looking for? I understand that people might say 'Don't go into IT unless you're passionate about it' but to be honest my last two careers were both chosen out of 'passion' and they both made me completely miserable. I'm absolutely in favour of pursuing a career now that is well compensated and provides a solid work/life balance with remote options over passion.

As for the second role, I'm pretty interested and definitely want to have an interview and see what it's about in more detail. However, since not getting past the second stage interview at the first role the recruiter has been practically ghosting me despite me following up on LinkedIn multiple times.

The recruiter does not generally reply except for once - 9th February. I'd asked (again) if the second role would be interested. The recruiter just replied saying they've not got back to him on a few CV's he'd sent to them.

I'd understand if that was the case but as the recruiter almost never replies (I've tried three times in the last 2 weeks) I'm more inclined to believe they are just too busy or ghosting me.

The role is genuinely pretty exciting from what I know so far and don't want to miss out. I applied to the role directly yesterday and got a reply asking for my availability for an interview!

I don't know what's going on between the recruiter and the company but I assume it's some kind of communication breakdown or some drama.

I'm going to arrange an interview but what do I do about the recruiter?

* Do I mention it upfront during the interview that the recruiter I'd been using has ghosted me and I don't want to miss out on a role I'm genuinely excited to learn more about
* Not mention it at all until they bring it up?
* In either scenario what do I do about this recruiter if he suddenly starts talking to me again? If I hypothetically got the job or he chased them up about me again mid-way through interviews it could get awkward

Never been in this situation before, advice? I know the recruiter will not get their share probably but on the other hand I don't want to miss out on a job that so far sounds pretty good (especially when my current job is impacting my mental health so don't want to be in limbo for weeks) just because a recruiter decided to stop talking.

113b368,State of Data engineering jobs with visa sponsorship in the UK,"Hello,

I arrived here in the UK last year with my family through an employer sponsoring visa for me( skilled worker visa ) and joined as a data engineer. 

Now I see the org and economic outlook looking not so great as it’s a startup that expanded in the pandemic like many others, and now that I am thinking of looking out for jobs. 

Is it easy to find jobs sponsoring me visa throughout the UK? Because my visa is tied to the employer and the org giving me offer has to sponsor again. 

About me, I have 5 years of experience in data engineering and drawing ~70k in Glasgow. TIA for your ideas.",2023-02-15 22:55:18

zw6g6h,Difference between £40k ML engineer and a £80k ML engineer,"Hi, 

So looking around at the post-graduate job market place for ML engineers there typically seems to be 2 levels (ignoring lead/senior positions). 

The first pays 40k ish, and the other pays 80-120k. Now, they are both for the same “ML Engineer” - I’m just wondering what the difference between a successful candidate for each would be. What makes one set of ML engineers more valuable than another? I still have 9 months until I enter the job market to train skills if I have to, so just looking at the differences in the engineers that get a 80k ML engineer job.

So when the next employee comes along we just have to buy a brand new device and drop ship it to them.

I've worked my way up to a senior developer for a large software house. I didn't finish my degree because work was getting on top of me and I wanted to focus on my relationship with my girlfriend who is now my wife and we have a daughter together.

Despite doing ok, I have this nagging feeling that I should have finished it, I wish I didn't think to myself ""he's done well and he didn't have a degree"" I just kind of want to feel like ... I guess normal or that sentence I wish didn't apply to me.

There were long issues why I didn't do it first time round and that made me determined to get into the industry.

Some of the best Devs I've worked with don't have their degree, and some of the worst had masters in mathematics (this is in no way having a go at anyone's ability in anyway or criticising anyone given their current degree status, I'm simply saying that having a degree doesn't always show what your abilities in the workplace will be), so I don't think it will make much difference in my own abilities considering how long I've been developing for now.

But I believe in doing the right training at the right time in one's career. At the moment everything is going cloud, so on top of the degree there is AWS Azure and all the other stuff you have to keep on top of.

Apart from that I also have intermediate knowledge of Linux, Nginx, Docker, Wordpress, Ghost and Python. I am aware, with regards to any programming language I mention, that I need to do some projects....

Anyways, my instinct is that I am more of a system administrator as I work with Ubuntu servers, as I said, I reply to support tickets - all tickets created by the customers are mostly related to Ubuntu servers.

Currently, I am struggling to take a decision - which way to choose. Since this is just a part-time job I have decent amount of time to learn new things but I am stuck at ""what to learn"". Should I learn Backend development (server-side JavaScript as I have zero knowledge of frontend - no knowledge of html/css) or should I learn DevOps (like any course related to AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud as the underlying technologies are same, just a change in the number of services offered and UI changes).

Now can anyone of you say whether the work I do or my past learning is close to DevOps? Would you think it would be a smoother transition if I choose DevOps - for the discussion's sake leaving about the salary?

In all ways, I agree that I have to do more research but I thought that this sub has experts who can point me in the right direction. So here I am.

And, want to know, is there, generally speaking, a large change in salaries of DevOps compared to Backend engineers?

u1vxd7,"Should I stay, or hop again?","Hi all. I feel like I need some career advice, something that I've never really asked for before, but genuinely confused as to what's right for me.

Some background: I'm in the UK and graduated in 2019 with a CS degree and now have 3 years of professional experience. Currently focused on frontend dev with React, React Native, TypeScript etc because I enjoy it and I feel it's where my skills are.

Since graduation, I've had three roles (I'm going to include salary as I think it's relevant, obscured a bit because I don't know if I work with any of you. Unlikely.):

**First role** General SWE role, company known for taking on fresh juniors, work was varied with a wide tech stack, stayed for 2 years, learned a lot, was well supported. Left because management were really awful and we were all being massively underpaid, also pandemic and they were forcing an office return which I won't do. (£21k-£23k)

**Second role** Took it only for the pay rise which I really needed at the time. Job turned out to be mis-sold. They didn't need a SWE and had me on data entry work. Company is a bit of a mess structurally. Did some basic React stuff they could muster up for a couple months. Left after 6 months. (£33k)

**Third role (current)** Joined a start-up (<3 years old) to specialise in frontend. Joined at the same pay, but took it for the experience and to skill up in frontend. Got good vibes from founders, 100% remote, all good initially. Work is relevant to my skillset. (£33k - £37k)

\----

I've been lucky enough to work on a very wide variety of projects and tech stacks in that time, as well as for some massive well-known clients.

I've been in my current role for 6 months. I spoke to CEO a month ago during performance review and explained that my primary focus was up-skilling and bringing my salary in line with market rates as soon as possible. He acknowledged the company was under-paying and explained this was because of its start-up nature and the value of the clients we take on. Turnover is good, but not high enough to pay devs what they're worth. He said that I'd had a profound impact on the projects I've worked and had very happy clients.

He got back to me a week later and opened a discussion about a possible future role which would be more leadership in style, with the promise of a modest pay rise and a stake in the company that may or may not pay out in a few years. He was upfront about the fact it was his way of trying to retain me. I said I was interested in skilling up technically so would follow this path if I was able to do that, he agreed.

Fast forward to right now, I feel I have been not been given the same opportunities to work on a variety of projects as others have, and find myself spending a lot of time working on learning outside of work time because the job isn't giving me the opportunity to do so. I was promised that I'd be exposed to a wide variety of new tech skills, but this hasn't happened for me where it has for others. It's clear they won't be able to pay market rate any time soon, and I don't really believe the company will ever be truly valuable. I feel like I'm going un-appreciated, and that I don't really fit in. They're all very young, child-less etc. The company also employs lots of cheap foreign SWE labour which I find difficult to agree with. I do get on with everyone, and have no specific complaints about anyone. My day to day is relatively smooth sailing, if not a little vanilla and unchallenging.

So my confusion is this: do I make another 6 months jump, or do I hold on a year? Am I being too picky/needy? I've been in touch with recruiters recently who seem convinced I could win a frontend position paying £70k+ and fully remote. I want to move house soon, inflation, economy etc etc so money is obviously a big pull for me. But overall I'm concerned of the impact on my career to have two 6 month stints on my CV. I feel I have a good enough excuse for both of them, but do you think I should hang around until the 1 year mark, and then go elsewhere? Is that enough to not look bad? How much does this stuff matter to recruiters/companies? I know in my heart that if I felt I was being fairly paid, I would probably just stick around and get on with it. Job hopping is stressful and I need stability for my family. The client variety works reasonably well for me, other than feeling like I'm not being given the same opportunities as others. I'm constantly reading on LinkedIn that the market is crazy and we've never been more in demand, and part of me is really worried about missing that boat.

Any advice at all is very welcome.",2022-04-12 10:33:27

The reason is because I need money as well and I don't wanna work in any bar jobs as while I'm studying because I don't feel i'll be upgrading my skills.

sh8udm,Verification Engineer?,"I did physics at university, then got a graduate job at a company that designs semiconductors/hardware doing python/scripting. I helped on a glue script to run tests together, and worked on the companies internal website. Now they're offering to train me to become a verification engineer, using specman e and sysverilog.

It seems like a good opportunity-seems like a good idea to specialize, and I find the more mathematical side interesting. However, it could get boring just testing other people's designs for a whole career? Can anyone (especially if you're in the field) advise-is it common/easy to go from verification to designing? What is the pay like, and is it in demand/easy to find a job (seems to be from a quick search)? Do you find it interesting, or do you wish you'd gone into designing? And any other advice you might have

sebkey,Move from SRE to Developer in 30s,"I've become a junior SRE to a mid level SRE over the last year with no experience - mature career changer. To be honest, I've been in a testing team under the umbrella of SRE. I have a great team of people but I'm unfulfilled in my role and left on my own to do more analysis than technical work. I've been learning,  practicing and working with java abit. However I have been given minimal work to be fulfilled. 

I am deciding whether to move from my current team to anothe rSRE team in the department to have more exposure to SRE fundamentals. 

However, I have been given the opportunity to develop my skills of a developer in java in another deparment where I am given the opportunity to pair programme and work more in an agile way. Also, exposure to other agile roles. I'm hoping to do a degree at some point in the year in Software Engineering, offered by the company.

Part of me is to take this opportunity in the new department but I heard to.be promoted its hard to achiev in the new department. I don't want to be stagnant. Secondly, I'm questioning if I gave SRE a chance and its more pay in this arena.- a lot of people are wanting to come in this area. Also, I do loads of work in my current department outside my role  and built a good reputation. I feel like I'm going to start over a again. But I am acting too loyal. 

Anyway, I was admant on leaving for the dev role as it can open more doors. Now I'm having second thoughts as I'm a career changer, have a family and need to think through my decisions. Any advice would be appreciated.",2022-01-27 23:11:14

As the title says, I'll be moving from the US to the UK in about a month. I'm a junior dev over here in the US in a backend role for about 2 years now at a large bank. 

Just wondering how the job search is over there. I changed my location on LinkedIn and had a few recruiters reach out to me. I replied to them but haven't heard back yet. 

Do you guys primarily apply through online job search sites/ consulting companies/ reach out to recruiters? Any other method that I should know of? 

I would really appreciate some pointers. I'm just stressed out because of the move and am just getting started on the job search.

I'm 31 and have been a systems engineer for the last 7 years within the marine industry. I'm sick and tired of it. I do months away at sea and I've lost all Interest in electrical engineering. It pays well but the thought of doing this forever makes me sick. It's really been getting me down the last few months. I'm writing this from within my cabin on a ship. 
My spirits were lifted recently when I decided to teach my self Python. It's going really well and I'm enjoying it. I struggle sometimes but I eventually pull through. I started looking into careers in cloud engineering and the idea of it really excites me. I bought a AWS course on Udemy and have been working through that while I've been away.
Where do I go from here? I can't go and do a degree, I have a house and financial responsibilities to care for. I keep seeing adverts for these training centres that offer 9 week courses and promise interviews but I really don't trust them
The idea of doing a job I love is really picking my spirits up at the minute. 
I can't imagine I could do courses online , get certified in AWS then get a job. I just don't see it happening. I feel like I'm a teenager again wondering what I'm going to do for the rest of his life.

j9lda0,Software Job prospects in the UK for Non-UK/EU citizen with a master's degree,"Hi mates, long but a desperate post ahead. Kindly bear with me.

I'm a non-UK/EU citizen and working in the UK had been my dream. I've been looking around Reddit about how I can make it possible, and it would be great if you could offer some inputs on how I could get a job to live and work in the UK. I'm aware of the high difficulty of getting a company to sponsor my work visa and the difficulties of getting a job in the UK without a UK Master's degree or Citizenship, but still hoping for some light at the end of the tunnel.

*A bit of background:*

I'm currently doing my **CS Masters** and have nearly **2 years of work experience** as a Software developer. **I rue everyday about not going to do masters in the UK** as I didn't apply there because the UK didn't have a long post-study stay back VISA for non-UK/EU nationals (it was only 4 months I guess) and since the MS degree usually happens for only a year in the UK, I thought finding a job would be difficult given the limited span that I would be allowed to stay there post-study. But now they have changed the post-study stay back policy which allows international students to stay for 2 years. And, since last year, I've developed an obsession/ambition to live and work in the UK as even though I don't know about how living in the UK **actually** is, I have really liked its environment and surroundings, its cultural/historical significance, etc.

I've really been questioning my decision of going to study at NUS and not applying to the UK universities (Oxbridge/Imperial/UCL) and this is taking a mental toll on me as I contemplate my decision and feel worried. And even though salaries in the UK are on average lesser than what the US provides for tech, I guess it will be higher than what I could get in Singapore and **I'm inclined more towards the country than the salary**. A few questions, it would be really great if you could help me realize my dream.

1. **What should I do to make my dream come true of living and working in the UK and will it be worth it to leave my place from a job point of view?** I don't mind salary differences but to the point where I can manage my expenses in the UK. And also, please let me know of other points which I wouldn't have known about living and working in the UK which I should really consider before making any decision.
2. How to make myself visible/convince UK recruiters to consider my profile?
3. Apart from LinkedIn, are there any portals that post jobs that could sponsor a tier-2 work VISA?

**TL;DR:**

Prospects for a non-UK/EU citizen with a master's degree wishing to live and work in the UK as a software developer.

It's almost like I'm in this in a in-between period where I can't use services for graduate jobs but I'm nowhere near qualified for the majority of jobs that I see, even if they're in my area of expertise. I should probably mention now that my area is front end app development and I want to get into game development.

Currently I'm using Reed, and the majority of the job listings are for £40k+ salary type positions all asking for a lot of experience as a bare minimum requirement. I'm not saying that there aren't any junior developer opportunities on the platform, but I am saying that it doesn't seem to be the main focus of the website.

**This makes me think: what websites would you recommend that are more tailored to junior developers with a lower expected starting salary?** **Where companies are more open to their employees learning on the job?**

I'm not looking for a £60k starting salary, I just want to get my foot in the door in a different area of computer science as I've discovered app development is not for me.",2020-08-22 18:16:40

husvvv,Is it a red flag when the startup that wants to hire you is being funded entirely by the founder?,"A startup wants to hire me as a lead developer. This would be a step up for my career that imposter syndrome tells me I'm not ready for, but my CV says I probably am.

I like the company's MVP (they hired an agency) and I like their vision. The founder is a very easy guy to get along with, based on a couple of Zoom calls. He's pretty inexperienced in the software industry, but is apparently a fairly successful restauranteur (Googling him backs this up), but he acknowledges this and he's looking to fill that experience gap with devs (like me), designers, QA and PO/PMs so that he can ""avoid just being the annoying ideas guy"" (his words).

The big thing for me is that he's planning to self-fund this company from his family's savings, and seems to have no plans to seek outside investment. This worries me because I don't have much of a ""business brain;"" I don't know if his business model makes sense, or if people would actually buy this product. I have worked for startups before, but usually I come in much later in the company's life, after they've secured funding and therefore validated that other people smarter than me think their business works.

This is the dilemma for me. Everything about it seems like a great opportunity at a good time in my career, but if the money is just going to dry up before anyone's even bought the product, then I'd rather not be involved.

If you were in my shoes, would this self-funding be a big red flag? Would it be a dealbreaker for the whole thing?",2020-07-20 20:19:53

My company allows us to put forward ard our preferences and i have asked if its possible to have contact with FO people e.g. Traders and have around 40-50% coding involved. I am kinda wishing if i could enter a quants team since its more lucrative and very finance driven plus gives me modelling skills if i want to later transfer to a more direct FO role, but i don't know how likely that would be.

When I was studying around 10 years ago I loved programming, and spent a lot of my free time working on pet projects in C#. I did my degree in mathematics and intended to get a job in computer science or software, but personal problems at the time got in the way with (among other things) very bad mental health. I eventually got a job in pre-sales. I've been here around 6 and a half years, promoted twice to a sort of 'non-manager team organiser' role, but I honestly hate it. It's keeping me in a depressive funk and I don't want to be stuck doing this kind of work for the next 20+ years.

I'd basically need to build a portfolio again from scratch and refresh myself on everything (which I don't mind as I've been wanting to pick it back up again anyway). I've good general office experience and remote working, but nothing in the field.

Dev with nearly 3 years experience here, stuck at the same company as a junior in the southeast (Kent) as there's nowhere much better to hop to in my area, the tech job market is dead here compared to less economically deprived areas like Surrey and Berkshire. Currently making £25k (I know it's bad). This is after a few months stint at a crappy place using Classic ASP.

I'm looking to move to a city with actual good tech jobs. However I can't really decide which one to move to.

I've heard Bristol, Manchester, Leeds, Nottingham, Newcastle, Glasgow, Edinburgh and London can be good, obviously there's Cambridge as well but that's more embedded stuff etc., and parts of Berkshire like Reading, but they're more towns than cities. Have also heard Birmingham might be decent but it does have a bit of a reputation lol.

I've been trying to work out where would be good to move to for ages now, but it's quite hard. Ideally I'd want to live and work in the city I move to, rather than living in a commuter area, as I'm in my 20s.

London seems to have by far the most jobs that look like good places to work at, and they do seem to pay better - maybe I could get around £60 - £65k with my experience doing .NET, Azure etc.? Although, most of the places seem to only pay enough to cover the extra cost of rent, assuming student loans (e.g. Manchester might pay £40k for a mid level, so I take home £2400, vs London paying £60k which means I take home around £3200). And the difference for a city centre flat is around £800 or £900 (maybe £1000 - £1100 in Manchester, or £1800 - £2000 for a cool area in Zone 2). So you aren't making more money, apart from your pension.

Now I know that career progression is meant to happen much faster in London for whatever reason, but what's the point of working there when you could probably buy your own 2 bed city centre flat in somewhere like Manchester on a mid-level salary, while it would be a struggle to even do that in London when you're earning £100k?

So you put in all that effort, having to house share for ages to have any decent savings, all so you end up having to buy a flat way out in the suburbs or a house in a boring commuter town, probably living far away from all your friends that have also had to move out to whatever other part of the UK, because it's so expensive?

Every post around UK careers in tech seem to be focused around London being the default, best place to work, I feel like I'm missing something? I feel like the only benefit is being able to afford to live in London (although only being able to rent your own place once you're a senior) and that there are more + more interesting jobs.

Obviously this changes if you have a partner and are looking to buy, although I'm not sure what I want to do relationships-wise, and you do have the issue of the other person not necessarily being in a career that gets a large London weighting, so you might still not be that well off. And I really don't want to get a partner just to buy a house obviously.

The main problems I've found when looking at other cities, apart from them having fewer jobs in general, is that they tend to have much smaller companies, as well as a lot of agencies / consultancies which may be worse to work for. So you have more choice in places to work at in London, and are more likely to work at a 'better' company, apart from the pay vs cost of living.

Can anyone offer some suggestions around where would be good to move to, if those places have decent jobs, and some suggestions for what I should be doing in my career? I've been thinking about this stuff for months and I can't figure out what to do, and generally am in a state of analysis paralysis. I know this type of thread will probably bring the London haters and 'I work remotely from some random town for a London company for £70k' people, but I'd appreciate a more balanced response if possible.

I appreciate I've posted/commented a lot about this kind of stuff before, but my 20s are rapidly disappearing, and I want to move somewhere more interesting with more opportunity, but the prospect of moving somewhere like London seems a bit depressing if I'm eventually gonna have to leave anyway, but I don't want to move somewhere where my opportunities are like 5 different large companies in the city, or working at a crappy agency, for my whole career.

The thought of house sharing until I become a senior also sounds depressing, I know a lot of people have to do that though, but having your own place doesn't seem like much to ask for in a career that's supposed to be well paid in the UK... there's so many things about it that worry me, like struggling to find time to cook in the Kitchen, scheduling showers, cleaning, getting bad flatmates, even things like getting good internet and being allowed to run an Ethernet cable to the router (I play fighting games so that's kind of essential).

I'd imagine a lot of people just see the big salary in London and want to live there so they take it, but feel like a lot of the problems of London have been revealed to me before I've even moved there, so the prospect doesn't seem that exciting :D It seems like a cool place to live obviously if you're earning a shitload or are okay with compromising on accommodation.",2024-02-13 21:08:43
1apdg8k,What should I learn for my second job if my SWE experience is just limited to legacy tech?,"I have around 1.5 yoe in London, and I’m looking to switch roles soon as the tech I work on is legacy and the pay isn’t great. 

From this job I have experience with C# .NET, but we pretty much only use .NET framework and WinForms, so I have very little exposure to anything modern or the kind of wide range tech stacks most companies use now, and I’m worried staying too long will have my skills stagnating and make it harder to leave the longer I stay.

I have some other experience in Python, SQL, and basic HTML/CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript and PHP for website project I did before for university. I know I don’t want to work with PHP again, but I am open to learning anything else.

I feel stuck as I don’t think my current experience will be enough for any other job, as I don’t have experience with most of the common job requirements I see, and companies don’t seem willing to train people much nowadays given the market. I could learn something like ASP.NET or Blazor and some cloud technology, as I have C# experience already and frequently see these in job posts as well, or I could learn Django for Python, or go with something like React/JS/NodeJS/TS etc.

I don’t have a huge amount of time and energy outside of work though (alongside also trying to practice some leetcode) so I’d like to take the path of having the least to learn and preferably what would open the most doors for me. It’s hard to tell what would be best because I see such a big mix of the above stacks and others, so I’m scared learning just one will block myself from 2/3 of the other available jobs.

Any advice please?",2024-02-12 22:45:34

In my degree and my current working role (1 YOE) I am using C, I'm sure some people will comment that there are a 'lot of jobs out there' for C programming but I think it might be best and more enjoyable to work in web development.

Because I did a degree in Electrical Engineering and only used C before, the roles I am eligible for is limited for Junior Dev roles.

I am very tempted to do a Software Engineering bootcamp to help better equip myself with the skills and programming languages I wasn't taught during my degree so I can compete for Junior Dev roles. Many people online say you can teach yourself online instead of paying the fee of a bootcamp, but is this realistic? I see the fees for the best bootcamps are all roughly £8k which is a lot but if they offer career support afterwards, is that not worth it in the long-run?

198uvfh,Recommendations for courses and accredations for seasoned software engineer?,"Hey guys, first time posting, long time follower.  
I've recently been made redundant in a R&D software engineer type role (mostly support but also some development work on tools to supplement existing products (which other dedicated developers work on)) however previous roles all hardcore software engineer (design, dev, testing, deployment, agile/sprint plannings/demos/retros, etc).  
I've been working as a software engineer for about 4-5 years now and have become pretty settled in the mid-to-senior software engineer role.  
I feel as I have some time whilst applying for new dev jobs, this is a great opportunity to do some courses/accredations and get a bit more skilled, maybe even try something new, as I really enjoy learning. Also couldn't hurt to brush on up on latest tech.  
My tech stack in my previous roles has been Java (a good amount of Spring but I'm not an expert), started out on a C++ grad scheme (Comp Sci with Hons), plenty of SQL/Oracle in every job. Also more recently worked with JS/React and Python so thought maybe to brush up on that. I like the idea of doing some more Java Spring in the future but also not keen on boxing myself into a specific language  
I've also always been interested in Cybersecurity and thought about CISSP/CSSLP or CompTIA's line of courses but the later seems a bit too junior for my level (the entry requirements for A+ is a year of experience). There's also things like AWS qualifications that look quite useful.  
I'm based in London and could really use some insight into whether these courses/specializations are useful and if so, which ones would be most useful, especially for a software engineer?",2024-01-17 11:55:50

I wasn't very happy with my work, so decided to look out on the market and found a very good opportunity with a very good payrise (40%. See related post). My concern however is that  my CV has shown me jumping to 3 companies in less than three years.

1st job - 1.1 years Jumped company for 50% payrise.

2nd - Currently 1 year. Offer \[see 3rd job\] offering 40% payrise.

(potential) 3rd Job - Offer. (40%) payrise. This job is giving me a solid compensation with an opportunity to work with good engineers in the industry.

whilst people were a bit harsh telling me im an idiot in the post I referenced, I genuinely felt I was feeling underpaid and underchallenged. I now have found a job reasonably fast offering me compensation more of my value. Interview feedback said that my technical knowledge was excellent and that I (the candidate)was looking for a faster environment and ""no ceiling"" to one's development which is True.

My concern is however that I'm seen as a ""job hopper"" in the future if shit hits the fan?  Whilst I intent to stay in my third job for ATLEAST 2-3 years....what if there's layoffs or that I'm fired within the next two years? I will have a hard time explaining why I would have have 3 companies under my belt in 3 years. I have always had solid reviews and performance. I just felt like for how much I contributed, and how much of a challenge I need, finding the next opportunity within a different org is key.

Reading through my contract it actually has a 3 month termination clause for both sides, and reading the employee handbook a performance plan will last 12 months minimum if they decided to go that route. I've been at the company for over 2 years so am protected against unfair dismissal. 

It's a shame as I really like the company, however a year ago we got a new CEO who I'm not sure I have faith in. We've gone from a great engineering team to a bit of a hierarchical nightmare with multiple engineering managers and project managers.

Since finishing the bootcamp, I was fortunate enough to be able to return to my employer and join their automation team part time where they develop web applications and add-ons to automate civil engineering processes.

In the 4 months since returning I have developed a few web apps that solve problems that the company is facing, but only about 40% of my time has been spent doing this so I don't feel like I have 4 months of experience. Of the apps developed the only one requiring substantial ""software engineering"" was a solution developed using React Typescript with a Power Automate back-end. Other tools included Excel based tools with VBA/Python scripting.

My long term goal is to transition to a full software engineering role, but at my current company the opportunities are limited, lots of politics involved since its primarily a civil company and not a tech company, and no structured mentoring/guidance.

I've been thinking of applying for junior roles and am willing to take a pay cut (current salary is £47k), but am I better off staying another \~8 months by when I will technically have 1 YOE, hence making it easier to get junior roles, or go all in on applying now before my knowledge of all other things that I'm not practising starts to decay?

18yr5wd,What to do after not being in a CS/IT role for 3 years after graduating,"Hello all,

I graduated with a Computer Science degree in late 2021. The plan was to find a job straight after, but unfortunately my parents both contracted severe illnesses due to Long COVID, as well as my grandmother being diagnosed with cancer. So immediately after graduating I was taking care of them, and the only jobs I could take were either zero hour contract types or ones that would be flexible enough to work within my care schedule, which was incredibly difficult and draining and left me no time to continue focusing on starting my career.

With the slow recovery of my parents as well as the passing of my grandmother ~6 months ago, the burden of taking care of them has been mostly lifted and I can begin to start building my career. The issue is I have absolutely no idea where to start. My progression as a programmer essentially ended as soon as I graduated, and I have a real feel of impostor syndrome and uncertainty. I don't know if I'm even applicable for grad roles as I graduated so long ago now, I really don't have any idea how to go about landing my first CS/IT job.

18f6lih,CV Review for next round of applications in January,"TL;DR

Hi, I was looking to get my CV judged since I'm not having much success, the link is [here](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/677/fpZKeP.png) (2 Pages in one picture). Quotation marks replace sensitive data, XXX is links to my projects on GitHub

Detailed explanation: I've been applying for jobs as a graduate since September with a similar CV. Jobs I apply for are graduate/junior positions where I fit most of their requirements at a rate of about 2-3 per day. I've had plenty of recruiting agencies calling me along the lines of ""This job is gone/ we dont think its a good fit for you. But we will see if we can get you something"" and then noone gets back to me again. When applying directly to companies I usually get ignored and don't even get a rejection letter. But here comes the weird part:

I was invited to first step interview 3 times:

\- One was for a job that I applied without expecting a response (55k p/a, way out of my league) where I fell off on first code interview (they asked me to review someone else's Java code to which they said ""you did good but someone did even better"" essentially)

\- One company where I ended up cancelling next interview after first HR interview (it was about customer front facing consultancy and it wasnt mentioned in job advert)

\- One company where they didn't care about my Java and C# experience and instead interviewed me for full-stack web/mobile junior dev that I passed all the way to final interview purely on charisma and quick learning evidence and now im waiting until after Christmas for results

So all the jobs where I seem to fit perfectly (Java, C# etc.) they dont even respond. In jobs that I don't think I actually fit (Mobile developer - dont have any projects or exp. in that) I'm getting attention. While I am happy to be considered sometimes it feels very strange to me, can anyone explain?

I am applying at: job boards like Reed, Indeed etc. but also LinkedIn and company career openings pages on their websites.",2023-12-10 15:58:22

17stzdf,Transition into Infrastructure Role from aerospace,"Hello,

I have been thinking for a while now about changing my carrier into an IT. There are a couple of reasons behind it, first is that I have been always interested in computing specifically in hardware and most recently an virtualization aspects of it. The second one is that I don't really enjoy my job and general type of the roles I'm qualified/experience in.- I currently work as a process engineer for one of the big aerospace companies. 
Following the advice of members here I have narrowed down what part of the IT I'd like to get into. Given my interest in hardware and recently virtualization I think this is a solid choice. I do have a understanding of network configuration and have experimented a lot with VMware and proxmox in my homelab. I don't have any work experience in IT expept that I used to work on the IT helpdesk when I was doing my degree.

 So essentially my question is what should I do now? What courses/ certificates should I get to be employable? I have no specific preferences as long it's infrastructure related, virtualization related even better, the aim being to maximise my chances of getting a job and ability to progress in a next couple of years. I do understand that I will have to take a decent paycut to get started. 

Little bit about me: M40, MSc in materials science, 10+ years of experience in aerospace sector in various process engineering/quality roles. Based in South West England - south of Bristol.

17q4a89,How to present intern and graduate role on CV,"Hi Reddit :)  
  
So I started working for company X, a large multinational in 2020 as a software engineering intern on a placement year from University, at the end of my internship I was given a return offer which consisted of working 1 day per week during my final year of study, and doing my final year project on an area relevant to the company. After I finished University I started full time work as a Software Engineer for company X.  
  
My question is what is the best way to display this information on my CV?  
  
It feels slightly dishonest to simply state that I have worked as a SWE there from 2020 - present, when some of that time was as an intern and some of it was part time, and I obviously think it would be a bad look if a recruiter thought I was being deliberatly misleading.  
  
On the other hand, my graduation date is on the CV so the fact that I started there as an intern could likely be discerned, and I was lucky to be in a company where the interns were largely treated the same as junior engineers in the responsibilty and oportunities to work on the product, so I don't want to deliberately down play that as I see the experience that I gained as an intern to be valuable to me now. Maybe the best way is to split my employment section into ""Intern Software Engineer"" and ""Software Engineer"" giving the same company for each?

I had completed CS50 previously and enjoyed it more than anything else I'd done that could realistically make me money.   


So I got onto this conversion course at York, the problem is that it is 2 years long (part-time) and I went to uni late so I'll be 26 by the time I finish. 26 years old before I start making money / progressing in my career. I have enough savings such that I do not NEED to work during this time but I'm finding that having enough money to get by but not do much that's exciting is a bit more depressing than I thought it would be.   


Of course, I could just work alongside my course as it's part-time but at that point, I'd have to start to wonder if I should be doing the course in the first place as by the time I'd finished I'd have 2 YOE in some other career! 

I'm reading that the market for CS jobs is extremely poor at the moment...  


**So I'm in a bit of a fluster and wondering... If I spend 20 hours a week on the course and get Distinction/FirstClass grades while spending 20 hours a week building a portfolio could I reasonably expect to get an entry-level job (happy to earn mid-20k for the first year or two) after one year, being half-way through the Msc?**

But I feel quite scared I picked a degree, which although I enjoy 70% (unfortunately, it is one that is missing any embedded programming modules or any architecture as the department doesn't offer them) of and which is valuable, it also means I have no more funding available to study hardware and even with a decent salary savings it's just way to crazy expensive to pay for a second degree and pay for the cost of living.

17a0vp9,"Transition From Data Analyst to SWE, help with CV","Hello guys,  
  
I completed a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in the UK 3 years ago (I took a sabattical 1 year and 9 months so I started to look for a job in Tech in January 2022) I wanted to start a position as a Graduate Software Engineer in London but it wasn't easy to get one so in the meantime I applied for a role as junior data analyst to be able to pay the bills and I was hired.  
  
My idea was always to become Software Engineer but last year I got rejected at several Graduate SWE positions in the last round,so because of that, also seeing there were less and less positions for entry level and other life events, I wasn't as active looking for a SWE as I originally inteded to in the last few months.  
  
Having said that, I was recently laid off from my company as Junior Data Analyst and I am looking for harder than ever for a position as Graduate SWE as a backend, in the FinTech industry if possible but I don't have experience per se as one. I am confused because I am not sure if i should include some experience gained from my role as data analyst with Python and such or just ignore that I have experience as data analyst so I am not discarded when applying fro a SWE position.  
  
I have heard that companies use Applicant Tracking Systems to evaluate resumes agains Job descriptions in search for good matches and if what it is contain in the resume such as ""Data Analyst experience"" and such, it discards you because you are not a strong match.  
QUESTIONS:  
 \- Shall I include my experience as DA in my CV for SWE position?  
  
 \- Could you please help me with suggestions for my CV so I can tailor it for a Graduate SWE position?

Former Games SDET here, writing automated tests in Unreal and Unity - I'm on the hunt for a new job and found myself burned out on games, and not enjoying adding tests to Unity/Unreal due to the messy code inheritance and implementations required to get gameplay tests functional.

I've shortlisted a lot of tools to learn/master before applying (selenium, Cypress, Playwright, Cucumber) but I'd be interested to hear if this role is relatively hard to do, or competitive to get into? 

Would appreciate any advice or topics on the area, as well as what else I may need to learn to migrate.

I'm now 4 years on from graduating and have not been able to find any work in the field I trained for. What I am becoming painfully aware of by reading most of the CVs posted and comments on this subreddit is that the most impressive thing on my CV is that I graduated. There are no note-worthy projects in my history. I just work well on tasks given to me and I have a knack for things mathematical. The longer I leave this pitiful attempt at a career, I feel like I'm losing what I learnt and just need a single company to say yes to get my foot in the door. I have no idea how I get from where I am to employed, only that I'm going to have to re-re-re-redo my CV. Are there any suggestions that can make me more hireable and help me get into programming or something similar. Right now I'm working at a garage for 50 quid a day and it's pathetic tbh.

1713zqz,"26.5k as a full stack developer, how to ask for a raise","So to preface, this is my first dev role after self teaching over 1.5 years. I have a STEM based MSc but not in maths/engineering. I also worked as data analyst for a year on £32k prior to this.

I have two questions really:

First, I like my job but it's just me and my boss (technical director), he's a super smart guy and has been programming for 20 years and created all the embedded software for our products. So I feel I have a lot to learn from him, however I'm handling the business web app responsible for all aspects of the company, written in angular, typescript for backend, postgres, graphql, redis and restify. We have servers on site and my boss is teaching me how that side works, which is also very cool.

I'm basically responsible for the entire business app and it's future direction already and somewhat left to my own devices when tackling problems. I've been told i'll also get opportunties to create some new software in the pipeline within a year and I'll be designing that myself (with my bosses help if needs be)

He's a smart developer, but he knows more about embedded software and the guy before knew about web dev more. Will I fall behind after 3-4 years from not working with other web devs? I feel like this job could be very good for me as I'm getting hands on experience leading projects, but I also feel like I may just be living in the kingdom of the blind where the one eyed man is king.

Second, I want to ask for a pay raise at my 6 month probation meeting, i'm 2 months in and i've already created a working module that i'm being praised for and fixed multiple relatively surface level issues teams in the company had. I want to ask for 15% but with my background do you think that's reasonable? Ultimately i'm happy to just be getting the experience, and I applied for probably 100 jobs to get here, but also money.

&#x200B;

16iee8s,Quit my full time job to study SWE?,"Bit of a context. I'm nearly 20 now and I work full time as a machine operator in a factory making 2000£ per month after tax. 

I have been aspiring to be SWE since few years before I've finished school at 18 but haven't been commit myself to full time to study and work on projects. 

My current job is making me really depressed as it's physical and it's just doing the same thing over and over. Also it's a shift work so 3 days on and 3 days off and 3 days off, day shift for 3 weeks and night shift for 3 weeks. 

My plan right now is to quit my full time job and look for a part time job that pays little bit above minimum wage and give about 16-20 hours of work per week. This is so I can fully commit myself to studying. But my idea of studying is not enrolling in any courses or training. It's to study off resources from the web and work on things I've learned, eventually making a portfolio for an employer.

I am fortunate enough to have good parents that will enable me to do this, as I currently pay 300£ for board and pay for my own food. So my expenses are just over 500£ per month if I don't make any large purchases.

I am also enrolled in BSc Computing & IT by the Open University but have paused my studies because the cost feels like it doesn't justify the resources and support given. I am to finish this degree sometime after I've gotten a developer job to further progress my career, potentially having my employer at the time pay for it. I would really like to study CS full time in a university but the cost is too much.

Is my plan realistic ( person with no qualifications looking for a developer job in this market ) or should I keep working full time and wait until the market improves?

16emu1o,Phd? Or go into a job? Been offered fully funded PhD based on my Master’s research at TU Munich but unsure if I want to spend another 3 years in academia,"I posted my MSc research online this week and it went viral. A professor from TU Munich who has 2x startups in the field reached out to me and offered to help me create a startup (one that manages and licenses IP of innovative research) and also offered to help me submit a funding grant for the PhD. 

I really didn’t expect this prior to my MSc. I had an incredibly difficult year with my MSc (hated the exams) and I kind of just wanted to start working after my MSc in an MLE role, start saving, maybe get a GF, reconnect with friends, see my family more, but I did not expect my research to go as widespread as it did and be given this opportunity to study at TUM and also have basically 1 on 1 mentoring for a startup too.

I also don’t know if TUM is well regarded in the UK, is it a good place to study? I kind of want to raise a family in the UK so I will have 90% of my engineering career in the UK, and if possible I’d like a PhD that has upward mobility. My MSc was from Kings College London and I’ve already seen how much of an impact this name has, and would like to keep this if I go for a PhD. 

My other option is to spend 3-4 months learning MLOps tools and refining my C++, and land a MLE job in London for a startup, or go down this TU Munich PhD route and also become the CEO of an AI startup that manages the IP of my research alongside it. 

Any advice from the forum here? Bit of a unexpected situation I’m in. It’s a massive crossroads in my early 20s that will likely change the rest of my life. 

My end goal is to have a startup / my own company and to sell it for a few million, but I also don’t know if I should get startup experience first and then branch off or continue with my research into a PhD and do it that way.",2023-09-10 01:17:32
16dg5en,Ethical/legal concern at current company,"Hi,

I'm a junior dev working at a small web agency/consultancy/staff augmentation firm.

Recently some coworkers, including my manager who is a senior dev, have been complaining about one of the clients they are developing a web portal for.

The client is a cleaning company who hire cleaners to work for them, among other things probably. My colleagues have allegedly found out, or at least suspect many things of the client:

* The client is classing their employees as self employed to evade taxes/illegally underpay them or something of that nature (something to do with tax codes I think)
* Someone at the clientmay be involved in getting illegal eastern European immigrants into the country
* They have been charging two parties for certain pieces of equipment when they should only be charging one (not sure on specifics here)

There are probably some other things, but we are developing the portal for them, I'm guessing my colleagues found this out due to seeing some employee's payment info as there is a payment section on the portal. They also keep referring to the company as a pyramid scheme but not sure how serious that is lol.

My manager raised this with upper management as it would probably be wise to distance our company from the client. But they didn't seem to care and we are still developing the portal for them.

I'm concerned that our company would come into legal trouble, as essentially we are assisting that company by developing the portal that allows them to do these things. Also I don't really know if this is even an issue or if it's a common thing in this industry.

My manager gave the impression that our company may or may not be in trouble depending on the contract with the client, but also that it's really an issue with the client configuring things incorrectly so the blame doesn't really lay with us. Also I'm not too sure of that, I guess it depends on the functionality we added and if the functionality in itself is illegal e.g. offering the self-employed option for employees so they don't get paid fairly.

I'm not currently working on that project but I'm concerned I will be in the future, and worried that working on it may be a stain on my career and it's kind of weighing on my mind as I don't want to be doing something unethical.

I do want to move jobs anyway but I'd likely need to relocate, I don't want to get a fully remote job but I'm also not mentally ready to change job, I'm also getting behind on work at my current job because of this stuff stressing me out so it's a big downward spiral.

As I said I'm not currently working on that project but just being associated with a company that doesn't really give a shit about associating with these sorts of companies is a bit depressing. And as I said there's potential for me to be put on the project in the future.

We've apparently worked with this client for like 10 years, as we inherited their old portal to support it (and I guess add features), they then tried to sue us for some reason (something to do with missing features maybe) and then we won, but then we continued to support them lol

Has anyone else been in a similar sort of situation or can offer their thoughts?",2023-09-08 17:08:57

I'm more interested in ML, back end, or even iOS development, so I'm willing to put in the work to learn and build a portfolio in these specialities, but I'm not sure if I can say the same for front end. I've heard suggestions to go into front end anyway just to get a foot in the door, especially with the current hiring freezes, then can think about switching to something I actually enjoy after a year or two, but again I'm not keen on switching from a career I do largely enjoy to one I think I won't for up to 3 years. 

I'm interested in hearing people's thoughts, based on their experiences, whether starting in front end then switching to something else after a couple of years is something many people do, and whether this strategy is feasible for someone without a CS degree who, on the face of it, isn't interested in front end.

15dptsr,I could really use some help picking my optional module! [Games Development Programming],"Hello all. I just wrapped up my first year of University, studying Games Development Programming in the UK. With the 2nd year starting in September, I wanted to get my optional module sorted out so I can get some early studying done and some academic books started. We have a total of 3 mandatory modules as well as 5 optional ones, but I'm struggling on deciding which one I should pick.

***For reference, here are the mandatory module's descriptions of what I will learn:***

**Computing Systems**

This module takes you on a journey, from underlying computer architecture through to operating systems and networking and finally on to cloud computing. We designed this module to enhance your understanding of how modern computer systems are designed and used.

You will explore the essential features of each of these technologies and acquire both theoretical and practical knowledge. In addition, you will also develop knowledge of containerisation, parallel programming and algorithm complexity to make use of new parallel and cloud computing architectures to design application scenarios for today's modern computing environments.

**3D Graphics Programming and Artificial Intelligence**

This module is designed to allow you to master two pivotal techniques, artificial intelligence and 3D graphics rendering. This will serve as the cornerstone of your expertise in game development, enabling you to push boundaries by creating truly innovative and optimised game experiences. Instead of relying on high-level game engines, we will take you to lower-level programming, granting you a profound understanding of algorithms and techniques that underpin game development, regardless of which engine you happen to use.

**Professional Game Development Environments**

This module teaches games programming using the two leading games engines – Unity and Unreal. In the first teaching block you will create a game in Unity, then in the second a game using Unreal blueprint as part of an agile games programming team. To make the games you will follow games industry best practice, including the use of Visual Studio and git as well as the game engines themselves.

The module stresses the importance of portfolio building to aid employability, and also the requirement to develop software in a rigorous, professional way. It is taught with an emphasis on spending time actually making games - not just learning the theory - so there are plenty of workshops on developing your practical skills.

***… and these are the list of the 5 optional courses and their descriptions:***

**Introductory Digital Media and Computer Generated Imagery**

You will learn the underlying principles of digital imaging in both its static and moving forms. The theory will be supported by workshops using professional imaging, and video editing software, as well as software tools for manipulating audio.

The CGI Foundation part introduces you to the use of a professional 3D computer graphics and animation application. You will learn how to build 3D models, shade them using assorted textures, illuminate them and render them out as images. You will learn how to make an efficient use of data, and appreciate the underlying topology of the geometry that makes up that model. Assessment will mostly be by the creation of 3D computer generated assets and presenting these as rendered images.

**Database Driven Application Development**

In this module you will learn to design and build full stack web applications. The first half of the module will be dedicated to relational databases which are crucial to any company or organisation, and form the back-end persistence layer of the vast majority of modern applications. You will learn the fundamental concepts and principles of database design before moving on to building the databases and writing queries to extract data from the database.

Once you have the foundation of database development, the module will move on to teaching you to develop and deploy web based applications that use an MVC design pattern. You will learn server- and client-side development, how to access the database/persistence layer, and techniques and technologies that span the whole stack. By the end of the module you will have gained the skills to build a complex, scalable and robust web application driven by a back-end database.

**User Centred Design**

This is an optional module intended for undergraduate students who are studying computing-related subjects. HCI is the core academic discipline that examines the relationship and interface between human and computer. It informs and provides the theoretical and methodological foundation for user experience, the professional discipline which is practically applied. Although this module forms part of the user experience guided pathway it can be taken as a standalone module.

You will explore major themes in HCI from both a theoretical and a practical perspective. The module will establish an understanding of key concepts within HCI theory and methods, and examines techniques for HCI design and evaluation. It offers students a practical domain in which to apply knowledge and skills, including those gained from other modules, to the design, implementation and analysis of interfaces between people and computer systems. You will undertake practical exercises in which you will evaluate real-world problems to identify user experience issues. You will utilise the synthesis of data from methods which explore user needs and requirements and also users' cognitive models to build a suite of artefacts e.g. personas, user journeys, empathy maps etc which will inform a prototyping phase. This process involves iteratively building on low, medium and high-fidelity prototypes of increasing complexity and levels of iteration. Thus you will synthesise theory and empirical data to build prototypes of a redesign solution to usability issues. These artefacts will iteratively and incrementally inform a user centred design.

**Digital Motion Graphics and Compositing**

This module builds on the foundations of the Level 4 modules, in particular CI4001 and develops knowledge and skills in creating and manipulating motion graphics assets, managing the editing process and compositing multi layered as well as multi nodal visual effects. This includes still images, video, audio, paint, and video based animation and effects.

These skills are further developed to a high level of appreciation, in particular for the flow of work for digital editing and contemporary composting in 2D and 3D spaces. You will acquire knowledge, develop skills and synthesis media products for self and tutor assessment. Professional level motion graphics, editing and compositing software will be employed. Furthermore studio based green/blue screen filming will be undertaken to create original material for visual effects project work.

**Multimedia Authoring and Design**

The primary aim of this module is to develop a range of skills in the creation of multimedia products, through the study and production of sophisticated content driven interactive material using industry standard multimedia authoring software. You will also be taught to write computer code (script) to a high level using a scripting language in order to generate interactive content, animation, navigation and data storage/retrieval.

My thoughts:

\-	One of my professors (my first year Games Design teacher) pulled me aside to recommend that I chose the 3D modelling module, as picking it in the 2nd year is the only way to pick it as my 3rd year option and she would hate to see my artistic talent go to waste. I love art but I’m not very good at it and I might end up wasting a lot of time getting frustrated with someone I’m not good at.

\-	From what I’ve done so far, I do enjoy programming. I find it interesting and the thought of learning tools like algorithms and engines to make videogames and art is really appealing to me. Ideally, I would just be filling my time reading and learning from various programming books and doing projects.

\-	I’m trying to strike a balance between technical skills for both a job and solo-projects. I want to make interactive media and games in my own time whilst having a tech-based job, though I’ll likely spend time in the games development industry.

\-	I’m not sure if I should try to balance art and programming by sticking with my programming-based core modules and have my optional one be 3D modelling, or to go all out on programming, which I also find interesting and is a more secure pathway.

Any and all advice is welcome!",2023-07-30 16:31:25
15d2s2v,Bootcamp or MSc coversion,"Hi

I have the option of starting a software development bootcamp with northcoders next month, or am also considering the possibility of completing an MSc computer science conversion. My degree is economics with one module that had some statistical programming but not much. I've been self teaching originally python and now JavaScript and have completed fcc for both as well as doing a bunch of leetcode/codewars for both. 



Bootcamp:

Free (govt funded)

Finished by end of November and can look for jobs

Mostly frontend some backend and apis

MSc Cs conversion:

Free (10k loan to pay back though!)

Finished by September next year

Content depends a bit on where I go but seems less industry focused and more baseline programming skills algorithms databases etc 

Which would you guys choose? I have 10 years experience as a maths teacher but no professional coding experience.

Follow up question: some universities in UK offer the course as computer science, other say software development/software engineering, does it matter much which I go for?

Hi,

Thinking if I should start applying somewhere else and what I could expect salary wise because I started to feel I am not learning that much anymore and personal development at this stage of career I think is important.

Also, manager, its manager and now this new promoted ml eng/manager are all from the same country (not UK) and I feel the better projects are dished based on the country you are from. While I'm wary of crying foul play without concrete evidence, it's a pattern that's hard to ignore, and it's impacting my morale and job satisfaction.

I am thinking to go to finance, but I heard a lot of negative reviews from my friends in software that the work is boring and the implementation of systems is only around 30% of the job.

Maybe anyone has experience with ML in finance and could summarize shortly if they recommend it?How do you find the daily grind? Do you spend more time talking about ML than doing it? Any SOTA implementation or usage?",2023-07-18 22:27:01

I am a BSc. Statistics major about to start her third and final year in a prestigious college in India. I wanted to study in the UK further for my masters in Data Science, but I find the theoretical syllabus here and the way it is taught terrible. We aren't taught any practical applications, and rather pushed towards useless derivations. The quality of teaching is terrible, with teachers missing most of their classes. I can't bring myself to learn useless derivations and thus exam time is full of existencial crisis and dread. I am a good student, but the dullness, monotony and constantly mugging up derivations with no clue of it's use is taking a toll on me. I did a research internship in the summer related to demographics, and I found it really interesting that it prompted me to think about applying for the degree apprenticeship instead in the UK.

14dljlu,Career advice,"Hello all. Looking for some advice.

I currently work as UX researcher but I am not enjoying the role. I don't feel my personality matches well with the job and I'm extremely anxious and stressed everyday in the role. 

The role involves very tight deadlines, constant communication with team members, a lot of collaboration and is very time sensitive. We also don't get access to information until very late which impacts the job. 

I basically operate on the opposite where I highly dislike tight deadlines and working across big teams. In previous roles I have excelled when I have time to do my role but not under the eyes of others which I hate. 

I've got over four years experience as a researcher across UX, academia and social research. 

I prefer working by myself or in small teams where you can work flexible hours. In previous roles if you finished your tasks by Wednesday then you didn't need to tell your manager until Friday when you met. Now if I finish a task at 11 I've got two new ones at 11:01. 

I can't handle living like this and have been stressed for months in the role and need to find a new job. 

I was wondering was there any careers that would fit my personality of being able to work to tasks in my own time that wasn't under strict deadlines. I'm happy to leave research if needed but have extensive experience and skills in the field. 

Any advice would be appreciated as I'm constantly thinking about work and it is making my life negative right now. 

Thank you.",2023-06-19 17:53:31

135l4k6,Edinburgh vs a German program for language processing/CogSci.,"I was recently made an offer to study speech and language processing at Edinburgh and as much as I want to go, I'm starting to get cold feet considering the cost of the program (33K GBP for foreign students). This + rental and living costs, nearly 45K GBP at least is a significant amount of my funds at the moment (lets say 50%).

The ultimate goal (2-3 years down the line): to obtain a phd and get a research position in the private sector (DeepMind...one can dream lol), **specifically in the UK**.

I'd just like to know what your impression of the speech processing and cognitive science research industry in the UK and Germany are like.

\- I would need a visa to work in the UK. This is always a risk because of the current immigration situation. If I don't get a visa, I'd like to return to Germany (I can live and work in the EU).

Are the job prospects (entry level nlp / language engineer roles, not research scientist roles, altho that would be even better!) for language processing grads *as* good or manageable for UK postgrads as they are for German-uni postgrads? By manageable, I mean can I get a job in this field in Germany within \~6months post graduation from Edinburgh? My German is \~B1.

\- My area of interest itself is more within AI/\], cognitive science (embodied cognition) and multimodal semantics. When I look at people working in Google Brain and DeepMind, most of them have degrees from the US/Oxbridge/Imperial/Edinburgh/ETH Zurich and the likes - although there are plenty of other good unis in europe for the same field - I'm curious, is this because of some ""brand"" value, elitist reason or the likes? Where are the neuroscience and cogsci doctorates from TU Munich, LMU, Aachen and so on? Other than these two companies and OpenAI, does anyone have other suggestions I should look into in Europe?

\- Speaking in absolutely shallow terms, does such ""clout"" matter enough to pursue an expensive degree in Edinburgh vs one in Germany? Will pursuing such an expensive degree pay off later on in doors that it may open (+ money that it will pay lol)? I'm trying to better understand my returns on investment here :/

\- I noticed that entry level jobs in NLP/speech processing pay more or less the same in germany and London. However, recently, a friend told me that post entry-level (mid and exec) salaries in London are higher. To what extent is this true?

Sorry for the world vomit. I want to go to Edinburgh but I don't know if I will earn that money back.

116oxin,Applying for jobs with a foreign address,"I'm eligible to work in the UK, I'm a British citizen. But I moved to Canada roughly ten years ago for school.

I'm considering applying for new grad jobs in the UK (and moving back if I get one), seeing as the market seems a little better there. But I'm not sure how to go about it.

I could put my current (Canadian) address and phone number on my CV, and include a note about how I'm a British citizen and I'm happy to handle my own relocation.

Alternately, I could put my sister's address on there. Although if I do that I'm not sure I'm not sure how interviews will work and I'd have to figure out what to do with my phone number... Maybe some sort of online rerouting service?

I guess it comes down to how much employers care about where I'm living right now. Do you think applying from Canada will make much difference?",2023-02-19 21:47:11
10nncrq,Asking for extended leave to study a Masters.,"Hi. I'm a (very) junior software developer, currently been working for 4 months or so and I feel I'm fairly lucky to have a good employer and a job I'm happy at. I graduated last summer with a good undergraduate degree, and searched for a job with the intention of leaving after a year to do a Masters degree. However, having seen the current job market, I'm starting to think this is a bad idea, as I'm scared about how difficult it will be for me to get another job once I graduate from it.

That said, I'm still pretty set on doing a masters degree for multiple reasons (both personal and career reasons). I'm planning to study either Data Analytics or Business Analytics, giving me a bit of choice in the roles I could apply for in the future, as I'm not sure software engineering is something I want to do long term.

My question is, do you think it would be inappropriate for someone in my position to ask for a year away to do a Masters, so soon after joining? I would be with them until September, meaning I'll have been there for a year once I leave, but it still feels a bit wrong, especially as they're only a small company and I'm so junior. Or do you have any other advice/suggestions? Thanks.",2023-01-28 19:31:46

yuazcu,Questions about sponsorship & time limited working holiday visas,"Hey guys - I was wondering if anyone had any knowledge of how the job market here works for people that don't necessarily need sponsorship straight away but have a relatively short period of time remaining on their current visa. 

&#x200B;

\- I'm a full stack JS developer (more skilled / focused on the frontend using React - so am mostly looking for frontend roles) with almost 3 years experience back in Australia.

\- I'm in the UK on a 2 year working holiday visa with approx 16 months remaining. 

\- I'm employed at a non-tech specialised company now and have been doing dev work but this has dried up now so am looking for something new.

&#x200B;

Do you think only having 16 months left on my visa will be too much of an issue? 

&#x200B;

Ideally I'd be able to get a sponsored role so I could stay beyond 16 months - in my mind it's almost a bonus - a company could take me on knowing that if it doesn't work out that they can easily just get rid of me by not offering sponsorship at the end of the 16 months.

&#x200B;

More broadly, is it difficult to get sponsorship for intermediate level dev roles? I know it can be hard for juniors. I'm also open to sponsored work in the EU if anyone happens to know anything about that (whether its easier or harder than in the UK).

Any insight would be much appreciated!",2022-11-13 19:16:04

Also for context I was predicted a 5 in maths a month b4 exams and only got the 8 bus I only began revising just b4 my exams bus o previously did not care for maths.

y207b5,Leaving the French academia for a UK job?,"Hi,

I'm a 34 man, with a partner and two kids (2 and 3yo).

I have studied in a prestigious school, did a PhD in a prestigious University in Paris, did two postdocs (two years total, shortly in Dundee and then in Bologna). I have papers (not that many) in top conferences and journals. Not to brag, it will be useful later on.

I have been Maître de Conférences (inbetween Assistant and Associate Professor, tenured) in France for six years now. Last year I was a bit fed up with the job and wanted to be closer to my family, so that I applied for a new position in my hometown and got it. The teaching load has been 400h a year for most of the last years, I barely did research unfortunately. Don't mention the administrative load...

With my move to my hometown I lost a lot of extra sources of income. In spite of my studies and research, I received 2560€ this month, which will be roughly my new income, and my partner's salary is quite low. We just realized that we can not face the costs of the city -- I'm really surprised by how much the prices have increased in this city in a few years, so much I didn't see that coming.

Well, to sum up: the job here is worse than the one I left, and I can't make it financially. Time to move on. Either an academic job that would pay enough for living decently with two very young kids (I'm not even asking for a comfy life), or enter the private sector.

My research is about the verification of functional programs. It is rather specific, very mathematic; I'm not very experienced in programming (not used to huge projects), I just know a bit of ML (usual things with scikit-learn, a bit of keras).

I am quick to learn and willing, but I hardly assume that someone will pay me to reach the level they expect.

So, several questions:  
\- in general: any idea in the UK, at the academic or in private sector, that would allow us 4 to live decently?  
\- shoud I follow some online training so as to apply somewhere in the private sector? any guidelines on which one?

Basically, for now I'm stuck in a job whose only interest is tenure, and we can't make the meets end. I'm looking for a plan I could propose to my partner, then we'll see whether she agrees, but she does not seem as reticent to move to the UK as I expected.  


Honestly, thank you all for reading and for your thought. Never thought I'd write such a post some day...

Do not hesitate if you need details of course. My nickname doesn't make things very anonymous.

xziayp,"Bored working for the current company, advice?","I'm tired of working at my current company as an employee mainly due to how the company is being managed for the last \~5 years and considering moving to contracting or another company with more flexibility (4 days week?) and maybe a better career path. I was a contractor when I moved to the UK to work for the current company.

Might be too specific to my case, but maybe someone out there has gone through something similar in the past/recently?

About me: from EU, early 40s, 2 kids and wife, over 15 years experience as full stack dev, based in the UK working for the same company for 7+ years in a stable full stack role remotely since the pandemic as the company sole dev/sysadmin, earning £60k+ ($66k) per year.

About the company: small/medium(?) size company (13 employees + 1 owner/director, \~£15m ($16m) turnover per year), 12+ years trading, I report to the director.

I feel stuck and bored as there is no progress to be made due to it being a private owned business with one director. A lot of decisions taken benefit the director personally instead of the company as a whole.

I want more time to get back in education, but working 9-5/Mon-Fri is really draining and when I finish work I just want to get some rest. I have 3 months emergency fund that could pay for the house expenses if I decide to leave.

There are no benefits except what's required by law (28 holidays, including bank holidays, 3% pension match), no education budget, no perks.

Perhaps I need to look for a bigger company with a better career path? Maybe get back to contracting?

xys5pw,Can Job Titles Be Changed on Resume for Jumping Seniority?,"Asking this question for one of my friend. So he recently graduated from his masters degree in data science in the UK and had trouble landing a job even though he had two years experience as a data analyst. He therefore accepted a 1.5 year internship on his post-graduate work visa as 'data science Intern'. I know this is preposterous but he was desperate to get a job.

His day to day duties are although nothing like working as a data scientist. He does mostly data engineering stuff 90% of the time. Getting data from different resources, doing ETL and sinking it in a warehouse, then making data marts for analysts to maintain reports etc. He also noticed that he is way overqualified for his work as he helps his seniors with their work who are totally oblivious on many data engineering/data science concepts.

It's been 6 months and he feels like Jumping ship, but he really wants to change his job title for his present company as 'Data Engineer' only, because that's what really reflects his day to day work and the work intensity is surely not of an intern. He also has google and Azure certification as a professional data engineer during this time. Will it be ethical for him to do this? I really feel he's getting robbed by companies here due to him being from a less developed country, but that doesn't justify getting work from him in an internship salary.

Obviously the easiest way to move back would be to transfer, but my company doesn't have a lot happening in the UK which was one of the reasons I moved to the US in the first place. On top of this they don't pay that well in the UK compared to a lot of other companies.

One of the reasons I don't want to self relocate is that my wife needs to get a visa, and I don't want to move before securing a job. I think it would be easy enough to get my wife a spouse visa, but I would rather not have to handle that, on top of everything else.

I'm not the biggest fan of it now, mostly due to my manager being horrible so I kinda wanna move into some other IT role.

On top of my manager being a butt, they basically told me that I will not be paid for my annual leave if I don't use them by the end of the year. Now, I'm broke and need the money. I don't want to use the holidays because I want the extra pay which every other position I've ever had (all in Ireland) paid my for the days I never used. I know that's Ireland not the UK and I should have investigated the work culture more, another stupid decision on my part, but I can't change the past.

I gave in and said I'll take a long/extra long weekend every weekend from now until they're used up them (sometime around November). They refused this and said they will assign me time to take it off. They said as per the law, the only way I get paid for the days is in the event of my employment termination.

I'm not letting the rob over a grand from me so I want to resign my position and get a new job. But I'm scared it'll look bad if I'm only in this place for 10 months on my CV.

wk6jot,How to Prepare for BDO’s Online Assessment," BDO’s Recruitment Process:

BDO has a relatively simple recruitment process compared to many other companies, and you only need to go through three steps.

**Step 1: Online Application**

To be considered for a role at BDO, you often need to visit BDO’s careers site and submit your application for a position you are interested in. Online application involves filling out an application form and providing the necessary information.

**Step 2: Online Assessment**

If your online application meets their criteria, you will be invited to an Interactive Assessment. This is a blended assessment that consists of [numerical](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/) and [situational](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/) tests and a behavioural assessment. The behavioural assessment is a [video interview](https://learnandpass.co.uk/interview/), where you will see up to 5 different questions and record your answers accordingly within a given time. During the video interview, BDO will be looking for evidence of what you do well and enjoy doing to make sure you’re a good fit for our firm.

**Step 3: Virtual Assessment Centre**

The Virtual Assessment Centre is a chance to find out more about the roles and whether they are right for you. You’ll take part in a continuous assessment with some key objectives to achieve by the end of the day. The main exercises you need to complete include a group discussion, a report/email writing, a presentation and a [one-to-one interview](https://learnandpass.co.uk/interview/).

To be successful, it is very important to understand BDO’s business, their service lines, your motivation and your career aspirations. In addition, you will need to demonstrate good teamwork, relationship management, presentation and leadership skills.

### How to Pass BDO’s Online Assessment:

Apart from the video interview part, BDO’s online assessment is not timed. When completing the [numerical](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/) and [situational judgement](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/) tests, you can take your time and really give them a think. If you have already been practising with us, BDO’s online assessment should be easy for you.

If you have not practised similar tests before, we advise you to spend time going through our [Numerical Reasoning Tests](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/) and [Situational Judgement Tests](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/). They are designed to give you the sense of real assessment and help you develop the skills and knowledge needed to be successful in actual assessments.

Other tips:

* **Check BDO’s website and find out what they are looking for**
* **Read the questions carefully**
* **Have a pen and paper ready. You are also allowed to use a calculator.**
* **Double check your answers before submitting**
* **Try to relax and take your time**",2022-08-09 15:41:32

uu6dhe,Real job after graduating?,"I attended a AWS Jam session today, it was ran by ”students” in AWS graduate scheme.

I feeling the graduate scheme “jobs” as this generation’s apprenticeships where it is just 1-2 years of on the job training at low salaries With the hope of getting a real job at the end.  
I mean no disrespect to those that value a grad scheme and is just my gut feeling.

So my question is this, is it possible to get a real developer job after graduating from a CS degree?

Also should I be re-evaluating starting a CS degree at 36 when I am reading how poor the starting salaries are?  
Or should I prepare myself for having to do another 4yrs doing a PhD as a degree is now seen more as an A-Level these days?",2022-05-20 20:00:49

I want to know how much support I should be given. I went from not getting work at all to getting work that's very overwhelming. 

I've had 1 years experience in web dev but this is my first in software dev. I was given a project and I've had 0 knowledge training on it. The SME is working on other projects so he can only allocate 10 minutes to me if that offer a call and I have to ask him questions rather than him giving me that information. 

This project is given in angular with a Java backend, I've learnt java as per their requirements but angular I'll have to learn outside (which I don't mind doing) it's just that their on a time budget to which I always get anxiety about because I don't know if I can deliver in time? With time and support, sure I can deliver but that I feel like I'm not getting enough of either because my position? 

They're not getting on with their team of two developers (a senior and mid level) so the plan was to replace them with me? Which doesn't seem right.

I get that they can't baby me and they can't just be training me which is why I feel like I'm stuck? There's literally no one in the office who can support me since their team is over in India.

I'm currently working in tech and science publishing and have a degree in Medical Genetics, but have recently been looking at breaking into Software Engineering (would love machine learning but I'm in no hurry). I'm finding the prospect of getting an early job quite daunting, and was looking for some perspective from an outsiders PoV.

For reference, I have completed two courses on C++ and feel confident doing easy tasks on Leetcode, medium ones contain a lot of DS&A which I am not too familiar with yet. I am also currently completing CS50x.

I have narrowed my options down to 4 paths of entry I can see, would love any other suggestions.

1. I spend the next X amount of time self-teaching and developing a portfolio to hopefully get a junior role.

2. I spend more time self-teaching and try and enter a graduate role, which are extremely competitive.

3. I pay for a conversion masters, which would put me and my partner in a difficult spot financially.

4. I enter an apprenticeship, like those for Amazon nearby, which take 4 years to complete.

I am really unsure which is best, and am at a bit of a loss right now. Frankly, I enjoy programming in all forms and exactly what language is not too important to me, as long as it isn't front-end design.",2022-04-29 08:32:38

tmpqeh,Least paintful return to Engineer from Data Modeller?,"Paint.. woops. 

I was a software engineer for about 7 years, and switched into a data modeller role about 5 years ago, working at a few different places.

I want to return to a software engineering role - I enjoyed programming a lot, and would much rather work in a scrum team than as a floating individual contributor. Too vague!

A data modeller is not a data engineer, and I spend maybe 10% of my time coding - typically little scripts, prototypes and automation. Therefore my coding skills are not completly rusted but my CV won't have recent big projects that I actually coded.

I think my CV would be rejected from a Junior role due to too much experience / age, and I also think it would look like a step back on my CV and cause me trouble later.

At the same time I do not think I would be selected for any given senior role because I lack recent specific experience. During my software days I was at best an intermediate engineer because I did a msters and switched industry in the middle, so I may lack the qualification for senior.

Mid level, I have no idea really. It's where I'd like to end up I guess. Having done the job before, I am pretty confident I could be productive at that level.

I am currently on about 70K, and need to keep my pay above 40K to meet my fixed costs.

Does anyone have any suggestions about:

* Things I can do to build the experience required to apply for a mid level role
* Employers who are willing to take unusual candidates at a mid level
* Anyone who went from engineer to manager or quasi technical back back to engineer, it would help me a lot if you share your story",2022-03-24 17:29:44

s69dim,Your opinion about this offer for a Junior SWE in London,"Hi guys, I am afraid this is going to be another one of those « is this salary good enough for my profile? » type of post.

The context:

To cut it short, I am a 25yo recent graduate from a top 20 Uni in the UK. I completed an MSc in Computer Science here and graduated with a Distinction. I previously had a bachelor from a university in my home country and worked in the field for around one year as a full stack software engineer building mainly React/React Native/Node apps.
I recently got an offer from a company that I interviewed for asking for the exact skill set I have. It was for a Junior SWE position mainly doing front end with React. The offer is £38k with the standard benefits as far as I can see so I would consider that number to be the TC.
It’s a big organisation with 5k+ employees and the position is in London.
Other info: I’m not currently based in London and I am not a UK national.

The question:

Given this information, Is this offer reasonable or should I aim for something higher?

I would appreciate your input on this. Thanks!

It's my first ever actual developer job, so I guess I was a little naive/didn't know the questions to ask, because it turned out once I'd signed on that I'd be the only developer. I've adapted well to the technical requirements of the role; I'm working on moving over our web presence to a better host, I'm keeping backend services running... and sometimes I have time to do the kind of front end design work I really enjoy. And lately I've been working on designing a way to bulk input data into a noSQL database and then inputting that data, and I've been really proud of my ability to come up with a mostly-elegant solution to this problem. But... at some point while I've been trial and erroring out this process, I just hit a wall of dread. My task list that used to provide stability and support now feels like it's drowning me. I'm juggling a company's entire web presence while trying to make a difference in the processes, and I'm just feeling burnt out.

I guess my questions are: Is this normal? Does it get better? And... my pay is about £10 an hour, which I think is contributing to the burnout, because it doesn't feel fair... but is that fair?

I am a first-class graduate of a physics Master's with substantial programming experience looking to make the shift into software, intending to move towards more complex software or data science like ML and other AIs.  Through a recruiter, I've interviewed for and gotten a job offer for a Tech Consultancy specialising in Enterprise IT (e.g. CRM, EPM, BI using platforms like Creatio, Azure, AWS, etc). 

Whilst the job is a guaranteed route into software, it feels rather indirect, and I don't want to have a career in Enterprise IT. Part of me, feels like I would be better off waiting and retraining using free online courses, as I am a proficient self-directed learner, to then find a more direct route into ML.

1ajpwy5,Career change with a STEM degree,"So I’m 24 years old, and started out doing a maths degree, but left before my final year to pursue a career as a self employed music producer. Had a successful 3/4 years doing that, with a fairly impressive CV in that industry but over time I’ve decided I want to start a career in software. I’ve completed CS50x and found it fascinating and not too challenging, and looking for my next steps - I’ve also started making a personal website as I know a good portfolio counts for a lot.

I’ve enrolled in the Open University to finish my degree so will be graduating with “BSc Combined STEM (Honours)” in 1 year, which at least includes me in the “or STEM degree” category when applying for jobs - will be studying a combination of maths, statistics and hopefully a computer science module if I can prove ability to the OU in that area.

I’m trying to decide what I should do until that starts in October to maximise my chance of a job in software at the end of my degree.. considering a Northcoders bootcamp as it seems like a good one. (I know you ‘can’ learn anything you do on a bootcamp for free but I like the thought of discipline/accountability and a proper structure). Any advice is hugely appreciated.

1ajjx94,Seeking Advice: Degree vs. Bootcamp for Career Transition into Tech,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently in the process of preparing to start a dev bootcamp in March, and I'm eager to transition into a career in tech. However, I have some concerns about my qualifications compared to other candidates, especially those with degrees, when it comes to landing roles post-bootcamp.

In my research, I've noticed that many tech companies require candidates to have at least a bachelor's degree for their minimum requirements. Additionally, feedback from previous graduates of the bootcamp suggests that many successful candidates in the field have some form of higher education.

While I understand that the bootcamp is designed for individuals from various backgrounds, including those without prior tech experience, I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons of pursuing this path versus pursuing higher education before or alongside the bootcamp to enhance my chances of securing employment afterward.I've been diligently reaching out to past graduates for insights into their experiences, but I'd greatly appreciate any advice or perspectives from individuals familiar with the hiring process in the uk tech industry.

Do you think it's essential to have a degree, or can a bootcamp get me closer to the minimum requirements for a junior role?

I'm a little skeptical that its even possible for me to get an interview without some act of extreme luck. Any insights or guidance you can provide would be immensely helpful.

Thank you in advance for your time and input.

Context:

\-I have no higher education and will not even meet the minimum requirements for a graduate apprenticeship.

\-5 years as product manager at a tech firm (in USA though).

\-5 years mechanical engineer on Submarines (Royal Navy).",2024-02-05 16:01:20
1ajh1om,How hard is it realistically going to be to change tech stack?,"I currently work as a .NET developer working with C#, VB and Oracle SQL Developer. I also have some experience of frontend web dev including Vue.js, CSS, etc. I've been working in tech for 7 years but have only been a Dev for the last 3 (worked as a BA, and in RPA).

Long story short I feel like I've gotten all that I'm going to out of my current position and I want to move on, and due to my family situation I want to find a job that is local to me. There are not any .NET developer roles local to me. The only jobs I see coming up in my town are for C++/Java devs. I did Java at university and also feel that it's similar enough to C#, so not concerned about that, but I have no experience in C++.

I recognise that I if I want to make this change I have work to do to improve my familiarity with C++ before even getting to the point of an application, but I'm worried that without relevant industry experience I'll struggle regardless. All the jobs I see coming up say that they require experience in C++/Java so I'm concerned that I'd not even get to the interview stage to be able to make my case. It's not like I'd be applying for positions aimed at new grads.  I can't afford to take a paycut.

I've gotten the advice online that changing tech stacks should be easy and I shouldn't be concerned, but does this advice apply to the UK? Would also love to hear any specific advice about things I could be doing to improve my chances.

I’m in my mid-30s and currently working in the social service sector. I’ve dabbled in freelance web and app building for some charity projects, picking up some skills along the way. I also hold a degree, but it’s not stem /cs. 

I’m now considering applying for a software apprenticeship. It looks like a lot of higher SWE apprenticeships need you to have at least a C or D in GCSE Math. However, my GCSE math grade was not great. I am unsure if my social science degree and work experience can overshadow my earlier academic performance. 

Given my situation, I’m thinking whether I should resit my GCSE in math before applying for this apprenticeship.

Can my degree and work experience compensate for my past GCSE performance, or should I just resit GCSE math?

So I have my first job as a software developer on around £30k and been at it around 8months however Im qualified and self employed in a trade and earnt a lot more than that, however money isn't the main concern I earn enough to live on just about and I'm happy enough.

However I miss my flexibility of bein self employed and choosing what I want to do each day be it software or trade stuff.

Is it possible if I say quit for a year or so went back to working self employed part time and programming in my spare time building full stack applications for the real world (that I need myself, I have plenty of ideas) and then applying for a mid level job on say 50k+?

I feel working for the company I'm at I do learn a fair bit but most the time is just spent in meetings and I get that's necessary but just not to the extent that it happens. I could spend a lot more time coding and Ive found a lot of my skills running a self employed business has helped me with dealing with POs etc and asking questions and also not having the fear to put myself out there because I have a skill to fall back if I ruffled too many corporate feathers.

Would I be mad to do that?

Would anybody here who does hires value this kind of experience or would u feel it needs to be time served at a company?

* Currently work as a ‘Senior CRM Manager’ on £72,000 in London with 10% bonus. Started at this company 5 years ago as a ‘CRM Project Manager’ but starting to get unsatisfied working there and feeling like I’m starting to stagnate since we’re still stuck on Dynamics CRM on premise (though there’s a project in the works to move it to 365 next year). Have about 10 years experience overall, mainly in Dynamics CRM but also doing project/product management.
* Used to manage three people but now only managing one because of attrition and also the fact that we’ve automated/matured a lot of systems to the point that the workload is manageable between two people.

  
I got a job title change/promotion last year (though I would have preferred a different job title) because I demonstrated that I’m not just doing CRM but also:

* Integration development work involving Power Automate, Tibco Online and Kingswaysoft as well as some data migration projects
* PowerBI data analysis/presentation, including getting the PowerBI qualfication.
* AWS setup and management (but it’s very vanilla and stable, to the point where an AWS solutions architect qualification I got in 2020 I let expire a month ago). Also done abit of Azure, but we use AWS more and I only have the Azure Fundamentals qualification
* Product/Project Management in enhancing the CRM (it's very customisable beyond just 'CRM' purposes, more an ERP really) or integrating it with other systems. The qualifications I’ve gotten in PRINCE2, Scrum Product Owner and Scrum Master I’ve all let expire recently rather than renew them.  
I also got the CRM Fundamentals, CRM Sales and CRM Marketing consultant qualifications from Microsoft.

  
As you can see it’s abit of a jack of all trades role (which I do like – keeps things interesting), where I could focus anywhere from a future career perspective from Dynamics 365 consultancy, Cloud (AWS/Azure), Data analytics or more Project management/product management. But the role is very much a sum of its parts in terms of where I am with salary (in my opinion) which makes it difficult to transition to the next role without taking a step back in career.

  
I do like the technical side of things, but I don’t love it, and I don’t want to be doing a heavy amount of coding or anything like that. Occasional integration development languages, web services, light devops, powershell scripts, low code tools, SQL and a dash of Python, Javascript/.NET is plenty for me. I don’t want to be going down any developer path. If I had to choose, I’d rather go softer skills in PM or BA.

  
I know the tech markets gotten worse than it was the previous years, and the situation at my current job isn’t so dire that I need to get out straight away. I’m willing to take as long as a year to find a decent new job and will gear any learning towards that.

  
The better career progression/money seems to be in product and/or project management now.  
Salaries in Dynamics 365/CRM seem to have really stagnated the past few years (at least in the UK) and not kept up with inflation. For example, Senior Dynamics 365 consultants (sometimes they don’t put senior in front but its basically at least mid level) don’t seem to be getting much above £60000-£75000) and I feel a role in that area would specialise/pigeon hole me even more then other specialist pathways (e.g. AWS). The highest rates I’ve been seeing even for Lead consultant or similar is about £100K and I’ve only seen two.

  
Whereas a product manager/project manager title has so many applications/flexibility, are way more common than Dynamics 365 roles (which are quite niche these days, especially CRM, since Microsoft appified the whole thing) and senior rates in London are getting as high as 80-125K for product managers. I guess there's a lot more competition for those roles though.

  
The problem is, I don’t know if I have the ‘chops’ to apply for such senior product manager roles, or if I should try and take the hit applying for mid level product manager roles and a probably lower salary (and less benefits since I’ve been at my current role five years) because product management isn't my day to day, it's not in my job title, and the only core 'product' I've been managing/enhancing is essentially off the shelf.

  
I’ve gotten agile qualifications in SCRUM, the less useful waterfall PRINCE2 qual and have done plenty of sprints, so I do feel I have relevant and solid experience, but they’ve all mainly been for the core product I work with (CRM) and it isn’t always my full day job – e.g. it’s very possible on a given day I could be mostly making/enhancing a PowerBI report.

  
Meanwhile on LinkedIn, because of my job title, all recommendations and recruiter contacts are about CRM roles whereas I would like to see more product/project management roles (I have plenty of keywords on my profile relating to that).

  
Are there any recommendations on how I might ease into the product management pathway more firmly without taking too much of a salary hit, or should I just suck up the salary hit for afew years? Are there any good recruiters to try or should I just get on the radar by applying to roles I see on places like Indeed/LinkedIn? Or should I try doubling down on any of the Dynamics CRM, Data, AWS experience?

  
Are there any qualifications I should refresh or get new in making myself more attractive to employers? Most product management roles don’t necessarily mention qualifications, but I’d be happy to requalify in SCRUM (or get higher levels) or add something like Lean Six Sigma or another agile qualification. Currently I’m learning and will soon hopefully get Power Platform Consultant qualification, but that’s Microsoft focused.",2023-10-15 12:41:44

16yoxfm,Getting interviews but no offers - what am I doing wrong?,"I graduated back in July with a 1st in Comp Sci. and have been balancing part-time work and sending out as many applications as I can. So far, I've had 7 interviews + 4 'video' interviews for grad schemes. None of these actually got back to me with any relevant feedback, apart from 1 interview that said ""\[the interviewer\] said you came across as motivated and personable, and a good communicator. Unfortunately, he also felt that you could have prepared more in depth"".

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. For each of my interviews, I research the company indepth, making sure to quote things that I find in the interview, I refresh myself on my university projects (I don't have any internships or experience so I have to rely on projects). What other prep should I be doing for interviews? I felt as if the interviewer himself was less prepared than I was - there were a lot of pauses after I answered something indepth where he would spend about a minute clicking around trying to find a new question for me. More recently, one grad scheme video interview declined me without any feedback, though their questions had nothing to do with Tech or Computer Science, I think it was a behavioural interview - I felt like I was applying to work at a clothes shop again. When it comes to technical interviews I had, I felt that I was able to comfortably answer 80-90% of the questions they asked me, being honest where I could not recall or hadn't studied something in a while.

As I mentioned at the start, I am forced to work part-time and I don't have the ability to sit down for a week straight and put all my effort into 1 interview, so what steps could I take to make this process more efficient? Or am I already doing the right thing?",2023-10-03 11:05:49

16917t2,CS at Warwick or take another gap year and attempt to get an apprenticeship?,"I have a place at Warwick for CS which starts this month, but recently I've been wondering if I'd prefer doing an apprenticeship instead. Some aspects of apprenticeships sound good to me and I don't like the idea of going to university then once I'm there, thinking that I should've done an apprenticeship instead, especially since I know of someone who went to uni and thought that. 

But it just seems like it might be too late seeing as I am already at the end of a gap year. And that supposedly the better degree apprenticeships start their recruitment process a year in advance (I only recently heard about this). And I've heard they're extremely competitive, and if I'm being honest I don't think I have that much right now to make me a good applicant so I'm worried that if I didn't go to university now I would just fail in getting one and waste a lot of time. 

So even though I do like some of the aspects of apprenticeships, if it's a dumb decision to go for one now then I'm not going to go for one now. I'd just like to hear what other people think first.

161gaed,Advice on Free Intern Work Where Boss has Since Vanished,"Throwaway account.

TLDR: Did free work for a guy, and he has vanished leaving a possible reference nigh impossible. I want to include it on my CV (to reflect the work I did do), but don't want to come across as dishonest. Advice?

During my AI master's degree I did a bit of unpaid ML engineer work for some guy who has his own company (he is the sole employer, super small business/contractor/freelancer, but he seemed like a legit knowledgable guy). It wasn't much work, maybe 2-3 hours a week for a few weeks. The result of my work is a GitHub repo of a PyTorch CNN model that I designed based on a few papers for a specific dataset and, some feature engineering scripts. Work kind of naturally tapered off as I began my thesis with him saying there was no hard deadline for the project. Yet, he has vanished after I went into 100% dissertation mode. I reached out after \~2 months to see if he still wanted further work on the project now my dissertation has finished and I have more time again, but he said ""I'm too busy at the moment, its probably best to find someone else to mentor you at these times, good luck!"" but I have since noticed he has unfollowed me on LinkedIn. Perhaps critically evaluating myself it would have been better to have tried to have formally ended the work earlier, but I'm a noob and I didn't think to do this at the time. Obviously this is very good to put on my CV, and it would be dishonest to not include it because I have the experience of working for someone else, designing a ML model to a certain specification, but I would find it very hard to get a reference now, so its a nice catch 22 paradox situation. I have the GitHub repo public and currently linked on my CV under ""work experience"", and the conversations throughout the project on still saved on LinkedIn. Now, I'm not sure if this is OK for HR at most companies. I really just want to be as honest and transparent about my skills and history, but this is not an ideal situation if a new employer asks for a reference.

I should underscore its not like on my CV I'm claiming to have ""worked full time as a ML engineer"" or anything, it is much more like an ""alongside studies research project for a small startup, where I did some tests with PyTorch and built/designed a preliminary ML model.""

It seems my options are: to NOT include it on my CV, and be at a major disadvantage, perhaps I'm over emphasising this too much? But it is definitely a strong part of my CV against other graduates. Or, include it on my CV and aim to explain myself at a later date after going through interviews and (if?) they ask for a reference.

13i393v,Advice for an interview at non-tech company,"Hi, I've got an interview lined up this week for a non-tech company. From what the recruiter has told me, they have no development team and have funding to build up few different teams over the next few years.

They're looking to recruit 3 developers to begin with, ranging from junior to senior. I don't have all of the skills on their list, the recruiter said not to worry too much about the extensive list of requirements.

I'll speaking to the operations director for my first interview, will go over my CV and experience. Then there might be some technical questions, but not really sure how that will go down or work if I'm not speaking to a developer 🤷‍♂️

My main question, what exactly do I ask them? I usually default to certain development based questions, what development processes they follow, how their deployment pipeline looks, etc. They have nothing setup and no dev team. So I can't fall back on that.

I can ask them what output they're expecting within the first 6-12 months. Are they planning on having the first developer to setup the basic tools and processes for the team or will they be waiting for all the developers to start around the same time.",2023-05-15 09:31:23

13e2u2q,Apprenticeship for career-switcher with degree?,"Hi everyone. I’m using a burner account.I would like to seek some advice.

A short while ago, something really bad happened in my country (like complete change/ collapse of government kind of change), and staying in my job was no longer safe due to state persecution. I had to leave my hometown abruptly and start a new life here in the UK.

I do have the right to live and work in the UK. I also have a Masters degree. But most of my skills and knowledge are country-specific, meaning they are kind of useless here. I can continue to do what I used to do remotely, but it will be risky for me and my family back home.

I am really looking to switch career, because the one I used to have is essentially killed.

I have been taking software engineering courses since arriving in the UK (CS50, udemy full stack, doing Hackerrank exercises etc.).

I don’t have a lot of money so paid bootcamp / conversion Masters are not an option for me.

I applied to SkillforLife government funded bootcamp but did not take the offer as the reviews of those I am eligible for are really bad.

I have been looking at SWE apprenticeships. I have applied for a few but none was successful. I wonder if it’s because employers do not really want to use their resources on someone who already has a degree?

Do you know of any apprenticeship opportunities that may consider career-switchers?

Any advice on other possible next steps would be really helpful.

Edit: sorry I would like to add 2 more questions- as I already have a degree, is a level 4 apprenticeship suitable?  And those who went for / is in an apprenticeship, how's your experience?

Thanks a lot!",2023-05-10 20:51:00

Job A:
- in the hospitality sector.

- A small company that was acquired by a bigger company due to COVID having a big impact on the industry.

- tech stack seems really good. Front-end could do with a bit of upgrading but I'm mainly a backend engineer.

- Seems to have some really good benefits like private health insurance, one day per week to ""work on yourself"" 

- People seem really cool too

Job B:
-in the gambling games sector

-Mid sized company

- would be working on some things that are very interesting. They have two game engines. One of them is a legacy monolith. I would be working on both.

-The team that I would be working with have worked with each other for about 10+ years (is this a green flag?)

- I'm not fully aware of all the additional benefits I'd get other than the pay. I've got a meeting booked before I make the decision to ask for more details about this and other things


I'd like to know everyone's thoughts on which of these jobs you'd choose if you were in my position.

Edit:
Thanks to everyone who commented. Really value your opinions. In the end, I chose the hospitality sector. The main driving force was that the gambling one seemed quite disorganised interview-wise. Also the hospitality one gave me a better salary and benefits.

I'm glad that I actually enjoy coding and since the bootcamp have been learning/practising in my own time, something I never did with my old career.

I've been very fortunate that my old employer has a small software team that develop software to automate/optimise civil engineering design where I will be starting next week, rather than have to go through the whole post bootcamp job app process, especially in the current market. They use a variety of technologies including Python/JS/C# and do cloud/deployment stuff too, so it looks like I'll be getting good experience.

The current plan is to get at least 1 year of experience here before trying to move to a tech firm. In 3/4 years if I keep learning new skills, learn some CS fundamentals (something that bootcamps don't teach), pick up new languages (interested in C++) etc. do I have a chance at applying for the top paying jobs at banks/hedge funds etc?

I just want to know if it's alright to put down my master's degree on my resume as MSc in ""Computer Science"" or MSc in ""Software Engineering"".

Getting a degree in computing will give me a few more years to think about what I want to do, while also studying modules in the course which would give me ideas about what exactly I want to do. 

It's not heavily programming based, as it's not a computer science degree, but I worry that a degree isn't really needed in many tech roles and I would be wasting my time, alongside getting myself into a student loan which I would be repaying for the rest of my life. 

I'm currently studying IT in college, so an apprenticeship is possible, the only issue is they are very hard to find and I don't want to commit to a specific job role, as I'm still not sure what I want to do.

1589a2h,Career change from civil engineer - stay at current company?,"Hi all, I am based in London and am currently halfway through a software engineering bootcamp which I am really enjoying, but I keep hearing of how tough the job market is for junior devs at the moment.

I was previously a civil engineer/PM with a masters in Civil Engineering from a world Top 10 uni and have 7 years of experience in the civil industry. Before leaving my old company for the bootcamp they offered me a sabbatical to do the bootcamp, on my return from which I could join their newly formed ""Digital Automation"" team as a software engineer to develop applications to assist the business using my new knowledge, and also keep my current salary (£47k).

The digital automation team is a team of \~6 people who combine civil engineering and software engineering to expedite civil engineering design e.g. using programming to automate repetitive calculations with given input parameters and packaging this up into fully developed applications using python and front-end frameworks. The team have produced some really good outputs, with some of their products being endorsed by the UK government highway/rail divisions.I currently see this option as a backup as my plan was to apply for junior software developer roles after completing the bootcamp, but given what I'm hearing about the difficulty of getting junior roles, and the initial salary cut I would be taking (I hear most junior dev roles in London pay 30-40k?) I've been considering taking this option more seriously.

Would this option hinder me from getting mid-level developer roles in 1-2 years since the digital automation team is quite small I'm not sure how much mentoring/support/training would be provided to develop me as a software engineer.  The main benefit is being able to keep my current salary.

Would I be better off trying to get a junior dev role in a more traditional ""tech"" grad role and take the pay cut, would that set me up better for the eventual higher paying roles, or do I have a really good opportunity in my hands that I'm just not realising?",2023-07-24 12:27:58

14lc1fx,Is there any Junior Software Engineering jobs that provide Visa Sponsorship,"Hello,

I graduate two years ago with a first-class honours degree.

Afterwards, I was able to get work immeditaly and have currently gained two years experience as a Graduate Software Engineer, using mainly PHP with the Yii framework, JavaScript, HTML and CSS programming languages. I also have experience Cypress for testing and have experience in Docker, Hira, Trello and GitHub. 

With this I have a year of experience as a Junior Data Analyst, which was part of my placement year at university for an NHS Trust.

&#x200B;

I am worried as my current place has indicated that layoffs may occur and therefore I would also lose my Visa Sponsorship that they have been able to provide for me. Currently, this is a scenario that may occur and if it does it may not even affect me, but I would like to potentially get a head of it just in case. I have been searching but most jobs do not provided Sponsorship or I cannot find ones that do in my level of experience.

11rer2s,Choosing a country to study Comp Sci in,"Greetings to all. So I basically want to study Comp Sci abroad as a third-world-country national and then subsequently settle in the country of studies. So basically, English-speaking countries like UK cost about 50k per annum in their national currency with living expenses included, whereas countries that cost significantly less, like Germany, require you to learn their national language up to C1 before applying. The deed that will take me 2 years to surmount. I'll be 25 by that time. Now, some folks suggested that I should look into EU/Nordic countries whose fees are moderate for non-EU students with a handful of English-taught programs to choose from. The problem I see with this is that it will be extremely difficult to network and procure internships when studying in a country with zero knowledge of its national language.

So I've been dabbling with coding and went through the application for one of the government funded bootcamps but unfortunately didn't get a place.

An opportunity came up to do CodeOp without the financial commitment from me and that's due to start on 15th.

However, pesky targeted ads, last night the diploma offered by a bunch of colleges in partnership with Code Institute was pushed to me. It looks like I can self pace so could still commit full-time and get it done in 6 months or so. 

My dilemma here now is, from an employer perspective and by the looks of it, a more in depth curriculum, be worth it? Particularly if it's a more recognised qualification vs bootcamp cert. Obviously I'm on a time crunch with a decision on this but just wondering on general thoughts.

17d13eh,Regretting my degree choice or just overthinking?,"So I’m currently doing a degree (BSc) in Computing and Management. It’s basically a 50/50 split between computer science and business management (very similar to ITMB) and taught by the department of Computer Science. 

When I chose my degree I always wanted to do CS but I saw this one that also offered a business side to it and at the time I was unsure if maybe I’d want to go into a businessy type job so I applied to it while the others being pure CS although I had offers for CS I decided to go with this. 

Come now I’m leaning towards a role that would be more technical, something like Software Engineering or I’d also love to getting into machine learning. Except the fact that my degree isn’t a full CS degree and misses out majority of the mathy modules. 

So it leaves me worried if employers will see that on my CV and just not bother to interview me because I didn’t do pure CS and it’s not as technical since the math modules got replaced with business modules. Although I have done many other cs modules, such as modules that taught us Python, Java, JS and Software Engineering which taught the main principles to name a few. 

For final year I get to choose which modules I want to do, so far in terms of CS modules I’m thinking, Cloud Computing, Data Mining and Machine Learning, Cyber Security. So 3/6 optional modules are the cs ones. 

But I’m just worried if the name of my degree would have me seen as lesser than someone with a pure CS degree should I want a job that is more technical like a Data Engineer or Software Engineer. I could simply be bugging out for no reason, but honestly don’t know and it’s been getting to my head a lot recently that why didn’t I just pick pure CS those years ago",2023-10-21 12:07:19

16p40r9,I really need help deciding whether to go to university for CS,"I have a place at Warwick for CS this year, but there's still some things on my mind telling me it's a bad idea to go. But I need to decide ASAP whether to go and I really feel like I need help deciding because I don't know if I can trust myself

This is my line of thinking telling me going to university for CS is a bad idea:

* I've seen that entry level software roles are low paid with many people applying for the same position - there are a lot of people trying to get into software
* People have said here that AI may be able to perform junior work, which I assume would make the problem even worse in the future. And AI could still potentially improve and do more than that
* Some have said that, because of the increasing supply and potentially lowering demand, salaries for people working in software might not be very good in the future
* Committing to learning programming/software development seems risky because of this - what if software engineering is no longer a rewarding career in the future? If it isn't, the tens of thousands of debt and time commitment would not be worth it
* And I kind of agree with the sentiment that, because university is so expensive nowadays, you should only go if you need to for a job with that job having a pay that justifies the cost
* Therefore, with my previous goal of going into software now seeming unreliable, it is much less appealing to go to uni because I don't really know what kind of job I would get at the end or what the job market would even look like
* I'm worried that there might no longer be that much potential for a well paying career in CS in the future - maybe due to too many CS grads and limited jobs, AI not creating more jobs than it takes, or something like that
* Going in without a job in mind is kind of scary in itself - there's a possibility I wouldn't really like the jobs available to me at the end
* I feel like I'll regret it a lot if I get into tens of thousands of debt just for the degree to not be that beneficial
* These worries make me think that it might be better to try to get an apprenticeship, because at least then there's no debt, or not go into CS at all

(Tl;dr: I'm scared that the future of working in software won't be good, or that the future prospects of CS won't be good, which makes doing CS seem risky, especially because debt)

13whcek,is 100K job in UK stressful and OT-demanding???? In need for general advice.,"Hi.  
I am senior CS researcher and currently I worked in a start up in Asia. I used to worked in a big tech company and resign because of the culture and uninteresting work. I jumped to work for start up and expect a intersting and fun working environment. However, I worked in the first start up for 8 months and left because that start up is basically a scam. The second start up is one I am working in.   
  
The work is fun and challenging. But suddenly I am facing a big drama with the CEO. The company is very small (10 people) so each person has to work totally seperately in a task of a team. Basically I started to work in a new task for few months and failed to reach the KPI even though I worked hard, OT every day and my team leader kept on confirming that I worked hard but simply the task is more difficult than he expected. The CEO wanted to change my task which I agree and reduce my salary by 10% which I refused. The labor law in my country prevents him from either firing me or reducing my salary, so he is acting like a child to punish me for not agreeing with him. (The team lead kept on arguing and persuaded him but he would listen to no one). Anyway, he tried to punish me by removing me from some work group chat and other work resources and threaten that he will never increase my salary.  
   
I feel frustated and want to leave. However I and my gf have plan to move to uk next year, so my gf persuaded me to stay in the job, just work during working hours, talk back with CEO if he complain about my work quality ( you don't raise my salary so I do not OT) for 1 year. The reason is we want to go to the UK next year and if I look for a job now, the new working period would be short and no guarantee that it is better.  She told me that 100k is supposed to be stressful everywhere, so if I really want to work at 100k/ year, I must accept that It would be stressful in this way or that way. If I expect my work to be work life balanced and stress-free, it would not pay well.  
  
Do you think she is right? Is the 100k CS job in UK  stressful and OT- demanding?  
  
Thank you",2023-05-31 09:29:28

I hold a bachelor degree in public health, but I've never worked in public health, I was working as a business analyst for a few years. I've been dealing with personal problem for the last 3 years so currently I have a 3 years gap in my resume. Last year I got interested in software engineering so I've been studying by myself for the last 6 month and I just finished my first project last month. So I've been thinking to start a career in software engineering and move overseas since the situation at home is not ideal. I was debating to join a bootcamp but apparently it's not easy to get an overseas job from bootcamp especially if you don't have a cs related degree. So after some research I concluded the best way to get an overseas software engineering job with my current situation and my non-europe passport is get a degree in cs and I found uk has some great computer science conversion program. My issue is to get to these programs they need evidence of computational and mathematical thinking while I didn’t do A-Level maths and I didn’t have any maths course to show in my academic transcript. The other option is several years experience in related fields which I also don't have. The other thing is some of them require you to graduate in the last 2 years, while I graduated 7 years ago. Do you think I need to actually take the bootcamp and gather a couple years of experience and portfolio or should I just start from a bachelor degree? Or do you have any other suggestions to get into a cs job in the uk? Thanks!

18k6ygg,Advice for devops engineer husband,"Hello,

New to this sub reddit, getting straight to the point

So my wife is getting an offer of around £150k / annum (Staff engineer at a semiconductor company includes annual RSU) with Visa sponsorship for myself and our kids

How would rate this offer? I don't know anything about UK cost of living, hence asking here

This is for Cambridge UK

Few ques:

1. How is taxation in UK, what can she expect out of this post tax? 
2. What are my prospects to find offers for SRE / DevOps role in this job market near Cambridge? I am a SSE-SRE at a networking giant currently? I have 9 YOE? What should be the pay range?
3. Do my chances increase as my spouse's company is ready to sponser my visa?
4. How does one approach this?
Find employment first from current country? or relocate without an offer and crack an opportunity there?
5. Which Visa category is generally offered to IT/Semiconductor employees?
6. What are our prospects if we want to permanently settle in the UK? How much time does it take to get the PR for the family?

We are currently situated in Bangalore, India

16iim36,"Can I be confident that a CS degree would be worthwhile, considering AI?","I'm just concerned that it might be risky to start a CS degree now, hearing about the potential problems in the tech job market that AI could cause. There's the argument that if it makes programming easier, less software engineers will be wanted, causing a demand problem and significant decreases in salary, and that argument seems sound to me. And there already seems to be a problem with people struggling to get jobs in tech now, with people saying it isn't going to get better. And I'm worried that it might be similar for other jobs in tech too. I've seen qualified people say that it is already killing some careers such as data analysis. While there are people that are confident that AI isn't replacing anything, there are also those that are confident that AI will end up making a lot of people lose their jobs. I don't know what to believe as an outsider who knows nothing.

Degrees come with huge debt that will stay for 40 years, they take years and a lot and of effort to get, and I pretty much only have one chance to choose right due to student finance rules, so I can't take this decision lightly. I wouldn't like to get into that debt just for the tech job market to decline significantly and ending up having to do a career that needs no degree that I could've started  earlier, or the pay not being worth the cost of the degree.

I know nobody can predict the future, but I'd just like to hear opinions on this: **Can I really be confident with a good amount of certainty that a CS degree would be worth it, even with AI as it is?** Please be honest if you don't think so.",2023-09-14 13:32:17

13ikqgg,Tech Company Thinks I Lied To Them. How Do I Fix It?,"Made a post regarding this before as well. Basically, I've applied to FDM multiple times in a span of almost half a year. I've always heard that they were great for people joining the industry and for getting your first job 

And when I've applied to them, I've got the feeling like they were trying to brush me off immediately (Like I was doing something seriously wrong) 

They had put up a job posting some time back and sounded very enthusiastic about it. Barely 1 day after I applied, I got a mail saying that the start date was unannounced so my resume is kept on file. Which I thought was weird, because they had just put up the posting.

Then it later occured to me  what might have gone wrong.

My first contact with them was an email and a resume request from one of their staff. Then about 2 months later or so, I applied again on their website and got called by one of their recruiters. The recruiter asked me some questions like GPA, what college, etc. Then as the phone call was ending, the recruiter asked me "" Have you applied at FDM before? ""

I said no.....and just from the recruiter's tone, I could tell they sounded surprised that that was my answer. Like they were not expecting me to say that. 

Now that I think about it, this is probably what ticked them off. I sent my resume and then said "" No I didn't apply "" in my 2nd encounter with them.

But I only said that because the first encounter was not really an application. All I did was email my resume. Should I have said yes instead? Am I overthinking? Because I know in the world of recruiting, this is one of the major things they use to label candidates as red flags. Whether they lie about anything. They think I lied to them. 

In retrospect, I think it would have been better to say something like "" No I didn't apply, but I did contact you before "".",2023-05-15 21:13:29

I was unemployed for a while and then found some work in 2022 may in the UK and worked as a admin for a while. On the side i did some courses from udemy and started applying vigorously for jobs from june 2023. Got pretty much no responses just one callback and and an interview. And many rejections from Indeed. Dont really know whats going on maybe this is happening because of the AI revolution. Ive applied for almost 250 to 300 jobs.

16kzq68,Worried about over-saturation,"I'm supposed to start a CS course soon, but I've been worrying about over-saturation. I've seen a lot of people say that CS is over-saturated, and that CS graduates can struggle to get employment after graduating. I've heard that graduates from even high ranking universities can struggle, or that sometimes even with a portfolio, projects, etc there can be a struggle. And with how popular computer science seems nowadays, I'm worried that the problem might just get worse. Adding to this is the uncertainty about how AI will affect things in the future, with people saying that AI is able to replace some of the work juniors do, and less engineers may be required.

It just makes it seem like there's a good chance that the over-saturation and struggle to find employment will just get worse in the future, and it might become extremely difficult to get into tech due to over supply and the salaries might decrease proportionally. I know it's only a chance, but if this does happen, I still have the tens of thousands in debt for 40 years and no chance to do a different degree, which makes it seem like a big risk to take. 

Is there something wrong with my thinking and it's not as much of a gamble as it seems? I don't have a clue how the job market works, so I could definitely be wrong. But as it is now, I don't feel like it's worth the risk when 40 years of debt is on the line. I'm willing to consider doing something else.



(I know people say the debt is more like a tax, but it's a tax that I'd have to pay for 40 years which will add up to a lot. I feel like I'd regret it a lot later in life if the degree ends up not being that useful and I have to keep paying for it for like half of my life)",2023-09-17 12:43:08

I’m looking for some advice on how to perform well in system design interviews. I notice that it’s one of the rounds where I fail the most and I have no idea why. 

Here are some of the things that I have tried:

1. Follow the structured pattern

Clarify Functional requirements
Clarify Non functional requirements
Come up with rough capacity estimations
Come up with HLD and deep dive. 

2. Read DDAI. 

The book is really insightful and gives an overview on the problems encountered in distributed systems but mostly I notice that I never even get a chance to discuss these trade offs/concepts in the interview as the conversation generally derails.  

3. Participated in more architectural level initiatives at my work. 

I generally don’t find myself facing an issue at work when asked to design RFCs/architecture documents. 

4. I try mock interviews with friends, their feedback has mostly been that my solutions are fine/good.

At the time I figured that once I had a few years of experience as a dev under my belt, it would be easy to move on and find something else. Three years later, it feels like I'm trapped in this job with no way out.

At the start of the year I brushed up my CV and started firing off applications. So far I've not had a single response. I've tried to follow up with recruiters directly and been blanked every time.

I've not applied to a ton of jobs, because there haven't been a ton of options. I don't want to work remotely (though I have sent out one or two remote applications where I felt the role was a particularly good fit), and there just hasn't been much coming up near by. 

I know there are worse positions to be in. I've got a job. The pay's.. OK. I'm getting by. I feel like I've got all that I wanted to out of this job, however, and I never wanted to remain working for my partner's family long term. I hate feeling so out of control of my own future.  


I guess this is as much a vent as it is a request for advice, but the question would be:

**What should I do?** 

I just bought a house so I can't afford to (a) move or (b) take a large paycut, which limits my options. I've thought about whether I ought to pay for one of these CV writing services, but I have no idea how I'd vet that the person actually knows what they're doing. ",2024-03-22 16:35:37

I have been working at my current job since 2017, mainly as an SQL and C# dev and sort of DBA.

I know this is a very broad term and there are lots of roles that could fall under this, but I’m not really sure where you start to look for roles in this sort of stuff, the normal sites I look at are Reed, Monster, Indeed nothing comes up just the normal run of standard development jobs maintaining CRUD apps etc.

1bgy7in,Quitting job to pursue CS Master's full time?,"Hello,  
  
As the title suggests, I am thinking of doing a master’s degree and I’m not sure whether to quit my job and go full time for a year or keep working and do it part time.  
  
For reference, I am a 24yo working as a Graduate design engineer (soon due a promotion). I hold a first class bachelor’s in civil engineering, and I’ve been working since I graduated so around 2 years. I still live with my parents (ofc I pay my share as I am working but this has allowed me to accumulate some savings), but I am thinking of moving very soon depending on whether I keep working or not.  
  
Lately I haven’t been feeling fulfilled with the job I am doing (ik this happens alot but i feel like i am young enough to do something about this), and I really do not see myself sticking to this mainly because the opportunities at this company aren’t something I am particularly interested in. I have thought about the idea of looking for a job in a different sector of CE (highways, railways, bridges etc) but before doing that I wanted to give something I am passionate about a go. Since I was young I was always into computers and tech in general, and throughout my teens I did some coding as a hobby. I have also been doing some self-taught work lately and I really enjoy the programming and problem solving aspects that software engineering has. I have given myself until May to really see if the tech industry would be something I genuinely see myself getting into.  
  
Anyways, I have done some research online on the various ways one could break into the tech industry and afaik, the most likely I can do this is by getting a master’s as well as work on my portfolio. The idea of going back into academia and getting a master’s really excites me as I was always interested in learning new skills and knowledge, especially on something that I feel passionate about. My idea, is to start working on my portfolio as soon as possible and start my master’s in computer science sometime in September. After doing some more research, I was faced with 2 main options:  
  
\-	Quit my job and do a master’s full time at a university.  
\-	Keep my job and do a master’s part time while working on my projects.  
  
Quitting my job would mean that for a year or so I won’t have no income which isn’t the end of the world as my parents have kindly allowed me to stay with them therefore my savings can comfortably last me for a long time. However, I understand letting go of a job is not the smartest option, but I believe this will allow me to fully focus on the master’s  and my portfolio and I am sure by the time I complete my degree I will be in a positon to apply for graduate roles, granted I have a solid portfolio.  
  
The second option is to stay at my current job (around 40hours a week) and do a master’s part time for 2 years while also working on my portfolio. The issue with this is first of all, the vast majority of people online say that these online master’s are just a money grab and are really bad due to having minimal support and the curriculum is not taught well. I wanted to apply to the MSc Course at York University, but the reviews are mostly negative which has honestly really put me off. There are some other course from lower ranking universities but I can’t imagine them being better taught that York’s course so I don’t know. Secondly, due to the lack of support I am predicting a minimum of 20 to 30 hours per week of self-study, which coupled with a fulltime job and allowing some time to work on my projects sounds like a nightmare to deal with.   
  
I understand that the market right now is all over the place and this has been my main worry to not let go of my job. Furthermore, I know that SWE is very competitive especially the entry roles hence why I want to go thru the master’s route rather than just simply completing some bootcamp. I would really appreciate if somebody could give me some advice on what option to pick or whether there is a third option that I am not aware of. Thank you for your time 😊.

I started learning programming 10 years ago and have done lots of projects since then. I graduated from university in 2020 with a first class honours MSc in maths. I was then claiming universal credit for a year until I managed to get my first offer starting in the beginning of 2022, where I was assigned work that I believe to be far beyond what should be expected of a developer in their first job, while being paid a lovely salary of £20k/year. After setting up on my first day, I was immediately assigned a new (difficult) project on day 2. I was actually told that they had been wanting to do this project for a while but none of the other developers had any idea how to do it. I therefore had to work on it completely independently, and wrote a ~10kloc code base for it and had it finished and deployed to production after a few months.

At this point after just a couple of months, I was already starting to get burnt out and wanted a long break. I kept getting assigned more difficult work after finishing the first project too. I was asked to start working on building an ML model and integrating it into something (which I have almost no experience with), doing some devops stuff that I also knew very little about, writing embedded firmware, etc. Over the next 6 months I had no actual results to show in any of these things. Eventually I got so tired of this and realised it probably wasn't going to change any time soon, that one day I just quit on the spot and went home.

Now, I've been out of work for 3 months again and I could easily see it taking another 6 months or longer to get another offer. It's really hard to even find any jobs to apply to, and I've had no interviews in the past 6 weeks. And who's to say any offer I get won't be just as lousy as my job last year? After all it's so hard to get even one offer that I can't have any choice about where to work, I'll just have to take the first thing I get regardless of what it is.

At this point I don't even see the point of trying to get another software job. I've recently been wondering if I could just get some simple low-paying repetitive IT job that I can automate, but I don't even know where to begin looking for such a thing either.

I ask for self-teaching to be excluded as I already asked about that on Reddit recently, and also normal apprenticeships, as I already know about those. So, I'm just wondering about even less well-known paths, like the Makers apprenticeship, which is special as it has the great combo of lower entry requirements, as well as maybe a higher salary, than most apprenticeships. I'd appreciate if anyone knows other options like that.

xprwxj,At a crossroads,"Hey everyone,

Long time lurker here.

I've got a BSc and a MSc in computer science and have been working as a cloud engineer in London for almost a year now. Problem is that I think I'm stuck in a rut.

I just lack the passion for coding now and I have a massive list of projects that I want to create but no motivation to do so. During uni I was always making projects and my GitHub was updated daily, I believe my last commit was in March and before that was probs September last year.

Perhaps I need a career change or a new passion to pursue.

My kind of plan to solve this conundrum is to do either...

1. Pursue a PhD in AI (distance learning for 6 years) whilst working full-time still in the cloud engineer role (Both my BSc & MSc dissertations were on convolutional neural networks and utilised machine learning which I  enjoyed)
2. Apply for AI style jobs within MAANG (problem is the lack of commercial work experience within AI but can most likely blag my way and learn on the job) This step will also automatically happen  afterwards if I pursue step 1.
3. Do the law conversion course (4 years) whilst also still working full-time and go into software/patent law

I have savings to support me during the law conversion or the PhD and my main reasons for the plan is that I currently earn 33K and one of these solutions should give a boost to my pay. 

I guess I feel like I should be doing more or aiming higher as I took the first job offered to me straight out of uni. One of my friends did engineering and constantly travels abroad to Boston and Germany which sounds appealing, though I know travelling for work can be dreary and not the cool jet set lifestyle it appears to be. Nevertheless it still sounds really fun to experience at a young age (I'm 23 atm) 

I'm just a bit stuck, is this how working life is meant to be? I was always inspired by movies such as the social network to create the next big thing and start a side hustle so I will most likely also attempt to do that during one of my solution steps. 

Anyways I know this is a bit of a rant but do you have any advice for me on what I should do? I'm just a bit lost career wise atm.",2022-09-27 20:36:04

I'm currently a degree apprentice software engineering student, and I will be finishing my apprenticeship next year.

I've been shopping around for grad schemes and have found some I like, in particular Capital One's.

I think I generally interview quite well, and am hoping my experience will help me land a role (my degree isn't from an RG uni, not sure if that will matter?). However, we don't do much algorithmic work on my course, although I did do CS at A Level.

wrjs01,UK or Germany for software jobs,"Hello redditors,

I want to start by aplogising for asking the same question, but I do need some perspective and have been unable to come with a proper conclusion on this question.

I am a 22M, Indian, with a bachelors degree in electrical engineering and 1 year experience in embedded systems.

I will be going for my masters and then move to work in these countries. I had some questions about the software developer opportunities and the market for junior devs or devs in general:

1. Is one country better than the other in terms of software development and jobs in that field?
2. Is the language barrier a big factor to consider for Germany, even in the field of software development?
3. Are all the good jobs concentrated in London for the UK? In that same tone, for Germany, is it all concentrated in Berlin?
4. Is it hard to find sponsors in the UK, especially in the case off junior devs?
5. Is the pay significantly better in one place over the other?

In my mind, the pros for the UK are:

1. 1 year for masters, so that means I enter into the job market asap, so the savings I would make on free tuition are countered by this.
2. No language barrier as I do speak fluent english.
3. Quite a large Indian community
4. taxes are lower apparently?

Cons are:

1. Fees are relatively exp
2. I would need sponsorship
3. NHS is a mess?
4. London has good jobs but is super exp
5. Junior dev jobs are hard to find?

For Germany, the pros in my mind are:

1. Lower tuition
2. healthcare is good
3. EU access
4. Slightly lower CoL

Cons are:

1. Language barrier
2. People are apparently cold and rude?
3. Not a big indian community
4. Higher taxes.

xlqjnl,Deliveroo asking to pay back relocation fee after declining offer,"Title Edit: Deliveroo asking to pay back the money they spent on sponsoring my work visa even though I never joined them, nor did I use the work visa to travel to the UK since it's tied to Deliveroo.

Hi,

I accepted an offer from Deliveroo and they got me to sign a letter which says that I must return the relocation fee if I leave the company in 0-18 months after the “start of employment”.

I then got a better offer somewhere else (after my visa from Deliveroo had already been approved) so I emailed Deliveroo that I won’t be joining.

Now Deliveroo is asking me to pay them £6000 GBP as per the signed letter since I left after the “start of the relocation process”.

I feel that as per the signed letter, I owe nothing to Deliveroo because the letter says “start of employment” instead of “start of the relocation process” which is on the latest email.

Do you think I should directly say this to Deliveroo or would it be better to get a lawyer first? I’m just sad that I’d have to spend ~£200 GBP to get a lawyer. 

I fearlessly declined Deliveroo’s offer only because the signed letter said “start of employment”.

Thank you.

Edit: It seems that my post reflects that I am keeping 6k in cash that they paid me. To clarify, they did not pay me anything but they sponsored my work visa, for which they claim that the cost was 6k GBP. I never used this work visa as I didn't join them.",2022-09-23 07:18:58

will employers prefer a entry level developer to have someone with C# .Net experience or Front end (JS,TS,React,PHP)

I am in year 12 studying a levels maths, computer science, history, and English lit. I have a brother and cousin who both have IT jobs with good salaries (around 25-30k at 22, and 45-50k at 29). I am also thinking about a tech career however I want to be on a salary even higher than that (greedy I know but I'd like to retire by 40/45).

I am looking to move to England this year, and would rather find a job *before* moving, so I am currently searching.

However, I am getting very little in line of responses or interviews, although there's an ""official"" shortage of Software Engineers and I don't require visa sponsorship. If I had to guess, I'd say it's because I'm applying from abroad, and they don't check to see that I don't require sponsorship (which I have in my CV). Setting aside the fact that applicants fro mabroad are always at a disadvantage. But maybe also because the job I apply to tend to have 100+ applicants.

I've tried LinkedIn, where I don't get many replies, but I get them sometimes if I send many applications. I?ve also tried [cord.co](https://cord.co) and [hackajob.com](https://hackajob.com) , where i get regular replies, at least.  I'll keep using them, but I want more insight.

So yeah: Where else could I look for a job?

1axm83w,Resume review for a Master's student looking for a job,"I am applying for jobs after getting my Masters in Computer Science. I did my bachelors in the same field after which I worked as a software engineer in my home country for 2 years. Even though my post was titled Software Engineer, I did the work of a QA. I have been applying for jobs via company's career pages and have been getting rejections for all my applications. I am applying without a cover letter as I read that most employers don't read it. I feel like there is something wrong in my resume and I am scared about it.

The country I want to work in is different from my nationality. I want to get sponsorship at some point so when applying should i mention i need sponsorship (that can also be a reason why I am getting rejections). I have a visa which allows me to work full time for 2 years so i can work in that period without sponsorship. 

I would love to get any sort of feedback.

About me

1) I live in the UK now where I am looking for a job, willing to relocate anywhere in the country.

z401jv,Remote Software Engineer job from home country with $40.000 location-independent after-tax salary VERSUS entry-level on-site Switzerland job with $85.000 after-tax salary???,"I'm trying to decide between these 2 options as a Software Engineer...

# Option 1: Apply for a company from my home country with a remote job with a location-independent salary ($40.000 AFTER danish tax)

There is a consulting company from my home country (Denmark) that after a year on-site allows me to work remotely 6-9 months per year with the same salary ($64.000 yearly before tax. $40.000 after tax) in almost any country (also in cheap countries like Peru or Vietnam... I only need to be available for some meetings and spend some time in the danish work hours).

**Pro's**

* I want to travel/live in other countries after 1 year, and this company allows it, so I can keep this job for 2+ years, instead of quitting after 1 year to travel and apply for remote jobs (which I've heard is really competitive if you don't work onsite first). I've heard it looks better on a CV if you can be loyal to a company for 3-5 years and job hopping looks bad.
* I feel pretty confident that I can get this job as I think the company is at the same level as another company where I got offered an entry-level job.
* Since I can spend 6-9 months per year in countries with a low cost of living, I'll be able to DRASTICALLY reduce my expenses while still having a high quality of life. I only used $1.000 per month when I was traveling South America.

**Con's**

* The $40.000 after-tax salary from Denmark is 42% lower than the $68.000 after-tax salary from Switzerland.

# Option 2: Searching for an entry-level on-site role in Switzerland ($68.000 AFTER Swiss tax)

Salaries in Switzerland are crazy high. Even entry-level Software Engineers usually make $85.000, which is $68.000 after swiss tax.

But I only want to spend 1 month on the job search in Switzerland, and I'm not sure I'll find a job in that timeframe... (if I spend too many months searching, then it would be better to go get a job and make money immediately in Denmark, where I already have some job offers)

**Pro's**

* The $68.000 after-tax salary from Switzerland is 70% higher than the $40.000 after-tax salary from Denmark.
* Even though I won't be living/traveling in South America/Asia, I'll still be able to enjoy the beautiful nature in Switzerland. I love hiking. 

**Con's**

* I'm not sure I'll be able to find an entry-level job in Switzerland for these reasons:
   * With some companies, it's alright to only know English like me, but there is way less competition if you know one of their official languages (German, French, Italian or Romansh). With jobs where only English is required I'm basically competing with the whole world (although EU citizens are preferred by companies for Visa reasons, BUT there are also many EU citizens...)
   * I only have a bachelor's in Software Engineering, but no master's degree.
   * While I've created and published some simple Flutter- and native Android apps in my free time and coded 6-semester projects at my university, I don't have any work experience in a company yet. 
   * My coding experience is very scattered (Some Flutter apps, native android apps, some machine learning university projects, some front-end HTML & CSS, some Python, C# & Java),  and not focused on one specific position (for example react front-end developer or .net backend developer).
   * Switzerland has the HIGHEST after-tax salaries in Europe and some of the highest in the whole world, so I assume the competition is WAY HIGHER compared to my home country (Denmark). Especially for jobs where only English is required. 
* Another disadvantage is that I want to live/travel in Asia/South America after a year, so I would either need to quit the Switzerland job and maybe search for a remote job or hope I'm allowed to take a 6-month unpaid sabbatical. 
* Also, the living costs in Switzerland are obviously higher. But with an after-tax salary that is 70% higher, I still estimate I'll save up more money because I live VERY frugally when I'm in first-world countries (no restaurants, no expensive alcohol, public transport, etc.)

# Financial analysis

**Option 1: Remote job from my home country (Denmark) with a location-independent salary while working remotely for 9 months per year and 3 months per year in Denmark.**

Income: $40.000 yearly after tax

Expenses: $1.75k per month living in Denmark. $1k per month living in cheap countries. ($2.000\*3 months+$1000\*9 months=$15.000 yearly)

Saving up: 40.000-15.000 = $25.000 yearly.

**Option 2: On-site job in Switzerland**

Income: $68.000 yearly after tax

Expenses: $3.000 per month ($36.000 yearly)

Saving up: $68.000-36.000= $32.000 yearly

**Summary of financial analysis:**

In the example above I will save up $7.000 extra per month if I get the on-site job in Switzerland, so from a financial standpoint, the difference is not huge... 

# What will be the most fun?

**Option 1: 3 months per year in Denmark and 9 months in other countries**

I would really love to be out in other countries for 9 months per year. In those 9 months per year, I can live like a king instead of being frugal in Switzerland or Denmark.

**Option 2: Living in Switzerland all year while having that onsite job.** 

Switzerland is beautiful and I love nature, but having an onsite job in Switzerland means I'll have to stay here only and I need to be very frugal if I want to save up money.

**Summary of what's the most fun:**

Both options are good in their own way, but I slightly prefer option 1 with traveling in cheap countries, because then I can live like a king while still saving up money. 

# TL;DR

**Which of these 2 options is best for a newly graduated Software Engineer with some scattered coding experience but no work experience:** 

1. Option 1: Applying and likely getting a job with a company from my home country (Denmark) where I can work remotely 6-9 months per year from almost anywhere with a location-independent salary after a year working on-site for them ($40.000 AFTER danish tax)
2. Option 2: Search for an entry-level on-site role in Switzerland ($68.000 AFTER Swiss tax) and after that job try to find a remote job with a good salary.",2022-11-25 01:17:39

The problem is our university has put our degree on hold due to CoronaVirus. However, once I get my degree, I will have to sign up for a 1 year service agreement at my current company which means I can shift to London after one year.

My degree will come around Sept-Oct 2020, which means I can leave India in Oct 2021.  Plus, due to Covid19, my current company has shifted us from Developer Position to SRE position.  In our company, the SRE position only requires operational work and no coding so this position does not really interest me.  But due to Covid I am stuck to this position.

My main question is it worth leaving India and shifting to Uk a good idea,  amidst the pandemic or should I wait for one year?  Since my degree has been delayed, my internship has been extended and I am currently having an experience of 10 months.  Is this experience enough to get a job in Uk, if I shift now.

1b1js3b,Conversion masters: do they work,"I currently do philosophy at Durham
The plan is to do a law conversion and then do law

I come here mainly to ask, whether or not the conversion masters actually works?
In law, about 50% of lawyers come from the conversion, so I was wondering
Some pretty good places like UCL, Bristol and imperial offer conversions

Bristol, and UCL offer ones that don’t need a STEM background (UCL requires maths a level)

So my question is:
Does the conversion masters actually work, and is it as accepted as the law conversion?

The reason I ask
Is every single resource on the matter is totally split:
“I did philosophy then the UCL conversion, and it was the best decision I ever did”
“ in this job market, the conversion is a scam”

1096z2x,Should I pursue Quant or Computer Science,"Hey all, hope you are having a good new year.

I have a pretty strong academic record for the UK (1st Class degree and Masters at Oxbridge in a STEM subject) and I started a PhD in North America but decided that it wasn't worth it/ working and now want to get a role in London.

I am being contacted by recruiters to work in Quantitative Finance but I think that Tech is a much more interesting space. I have experience doing statistical / data science work in an Academic setting with a couple publications in this area.

Should I just pursue Quant finance given that my credentials are reasonably strong for this role or could I get a Computer Science that was comparably interesting, prestigious and well paid?

I really would want to work in an interesting tech company in London but the opportunities in Tech for me seem worse than in Finance. Get paid far less to do less interesting work.

ydxj5d,"Boot camp, Makers academy vs Futureproof any advice?","I've been accepted to Futureproof and it seems like I'll get accepted to Makers with the Department for Education funding. 

Futureproof is a 'free' on entry boot camp and they will contract you to other companies with you getting a salary of 30k year one and 35k year two but if you quit within the first year you will have to pay 15k back or 7k back in the second year. The general curriculum seems pretty good being Web dev with what seems to be the MERN stack. Their whole funding is off getting people a job, which would suggest they'll work hard for you, or people quitting.

Makers seems to be more well known and will get funding upfront from people paying or the government. The curriculum seems to have more Ruby/Rails at least to start along but still has a lot of the general Web dev necessities but also there's much less information immediately so I may be wrong. There's no constraint for the years after the boot camp which I see as a positive.

wxezx5,Landing a Junior Java Developer role,"
Hi All,

I’m an engineering graduate (with 2 years experience in the energy industry) looking to transition into the Tech industry, specifically as a junior Java developer. I’ve been learning Java, Spring Boot, REST API, Gradle/Maven & PostgreSQL.


I’ve found the majority of junior roles demand some commercial experience developing in Java. Any advice on how I can find opportunities that don’t require experience? 

I’ve been in contact with recruiters and passed my CV onto them which has found a few leads. I’m conscious though that many of these opportunities are often with companies that have a small name + team. How important is having a big company name on your cv to progress as a developer in the Tech industry? 

If I compare to the engineering industry the company name you have on your CV makes huge differences in job prospects, progression and salary expectations. 

Would be great to hear your experiences of how you guys progressed in your careers!",2022-08-25 13:59:06
wcz9ov,Am I Making A Mistake by Not Going To Traditional Uni?,"Hi all,

I'm posting on a TA as I'm sharing some specific info - hope that's okay!

I'm currently a little stuck as I'm not sure whether my current path will limit me in my potential career. I am currently a Degree Apprentice, working towards a 'BSc Digital and Technology Solutions Professional (Software Engineer)' at a very low-tier university. I worked about 18 months at a company where I was basically an admin monkey, and have now moved to a very small company - <10 people - and am mainly working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; I wasn't particularly interested in web dev originally, but figured that any coding role was better than my old role. My apprenticeship is set to finish in mid Autumn 2023.

However, I also have an offer to study CS at Uni of Nottingham - I've also been awarding some scholarships, meaning if I do really well during each year of the course, I could cover just over 50% of the tuition fee costs. But this is conditional on my grades every year.

Thing is, I'm not sure if it's worth swapping now that I'm over half way through my Degree Apprenticeship - but on the other hand, the 'uni' portion of the apprenticeship has been terribly run and not particularly challenging. My average for the whole course so far is 80%+, but I don't feel as I've learned much at all.

My new employers seem nice enough, however I'm worried that I'm limiting myself by not pursuing a CS degree, especially one from what is apparently a top uni. I mainly did the Degree App because I wouldn't have any fees to pay, and the experience was just a bonus. However, I feel I'm missing out a lot of the algorithmic knowledge, and obviously after having 18 months of not coding I am doing my best but it is quite challenging.

I guess my questions are:

1. Will the 'Digital and Technology...' degree be regarded my future employers/recruiters/further education staff?
2. Is uni ranking that important?
3. Am I limiting myself by taking the current path I'm on, especially when it seems very webdev focussed when I'm not sure if that's what I want to do?
4. Is there any advice you can offer? What would you do in my scenario, or have you known anyone who has done anything similar?

Thanks, I hope I've provided enough detail for my question :)

Edit: At the moment I'm interested in FAANG, Capital One and a couple other companies.. Not sure if that's important!",2022-07-31 21:19:04
w3v72d,Is a qualification necessary to become a successful Software Developer?,"I have recently received an offer to become an apprentice developer with a small dev agency. I am currently admin for a Magento website,  and have long wanted to make the jump to the other side of ecommerce, so I am super excited and will definitely be accepting the offer!

Throughout the process of finding a company willing to take on a career changer, and interviewing for the role, I have been adament that I want to complete a formal apprenticeship qualification, purely for the peace of mind a formal qualification gives you if you suddenly find yourself having to search for a new job... 

The agency is happy to support me in pursuing a formal qualification, however, they have also floated the option of being taught in-house by the devs.

It is completely my choice which path I follow, so I would appreciate any insight from experienced software developers on whether a qualification would be necessary for a successful career in software development. 

If I choose the qualification route, I would be completing an NVQ Level 3.

  Im in my early forties and feel it’s a little too late for me to go back to school, get a cs degree and go for a junior dev job, but at same time not sure what paths are available to me.

  I feel like I know enough programming to be more than just a Automation tester, but not enough to compare myself to actual Devs. Example is I created a API like layer to allow testing to be done against a web app by headless http requests for when full browser test isn’t required, and it’s not something most of my Automation colleagues could do, but to someone working as a software dev, what I’ve done is a trivial task.

rkxd5h,What is enough to get these SWE jobs?,"**TLDR: I have 1 year to know how to get an interview at FAANG/F100 and then learn enough to pass the interviews.**

&#x200B;

**Q1)** What do I need to do to get an interview? This is my biggest worry. Can anyone here offer their experience with this? what kind of profile specifically are they looking for?

**Q1.1)** Will FAANG/F100 even be interested in an EEE for a SWE role?  


**Q2)** Is doing Leetcode + Data structures+algorithims theory enough to get onto one of these grad schemes?

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* Study Electrical Engineering at Imperial.
* Have near perfect grades starting from high school.
* I have done 2 Internships:
   * **Internship 1:** Data consulting at a large bank, complete garbage, learned nothing got paid ridiculous amount of money to make PowerPoint slides.
   * **Internship 2:** Software Developer at a start up, did many many things that had a significant impact on the company and was a great experience.

# I HATE ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.

**Motivation:** Just had to make that clear. After working as a SWE, I 100% want to go into software engineering. The issue is that I have an almost 80% interview rate for EEE jobs and somehow studying here has allowed me to get interviews at places like Tesla/Qualcomm/Mediatek/Intel Etc rather easily. I want to replicate some level of success for SWE roles.

**Objective:** The equivalent to these would be FAANG for a SWE role. I understand this might be a bit too ambitious but I would at least want to get a grad scheme at a f100-500 company as **I want a structured graduate programme so I could maximize my learning opportunities** , writing production code to then eventually make it into FAANG.

**What I have done:**

* I am proficient in Python and C++ and have done various projects in Computer vison, modern C++ etc. I have a good project portfolio.
* I am grinding Leetcode and data and algorithms 2-3 hours on weekdays and 5-6 on weekends on top of my degree which is slowly taking its toll so hoping this pays off.

itentm,Very Interested in a career change away from accountancy!,"Hi All, 

I’m fairly new to this so apologies if I have posted to the wrong subreddit. I’m just looking to get people’s honest opinion about a career change I’m considering. 

As the title suggests I’m looking to move away from accounting and into coding, particularly within software development. I’m in my mid 20’s and have a BSc in accounting and finance with 0 experience coding.  The reason behind this switch is because I enjoy working with technology and feel as if I’d have more of a purpose and enjoyment switching roles. This obviously puts me at a disadvantage as I’d be self taught and competing against those who have completed Computer Science degrees at top universities. 

The main reasons I’m hesitant about the switch is firstly because of the competition this field has and having 0 experience or formal qualifications puts me at a great disadvantage. Secondly is in terms of career prospect and opportunities, within the accounting sector there’s many opportunities to progress with the ultimate aim of becoming a finance director or cfo which brings a market salary of upwards of £90/£100k with the switch, from what I’ve read online the upper limit for software engineering is £65/£75k. This is obviously quite different ranges and one of the main doubts in mind. 

I’d just like to hear from the community if the decrease in salary potential is viable and if anyone has had a similar career switch what advice they can provide to someone like myself 

Appreciate any responses and hope to hear from some of you soon! 

Many thanks in advance!",2020-09-15 18:33:26

I wouldn't mind this normally but they have me working ""40"" hours a week which really ends up being 45-50 and i'm too drained each day to go spend another 2-3 hours studying for certs each night.

I worked in SecOps for a \~5/6 months too and I know I don't want to go near a SOC either. I was more in this to try go for digital forensics or work for the police in some capacity, but every job I can find in that requires a Security Clearance that I can't get yet until I have 2-4 more years residency. I moved here from Ireland to be live with my partner.

I just thought i'd ask what other career paths might be an option for someone with my skillset I suppose. All the career paths I am really aware of are in the security space and virtually all of them besides SOCs require an SC if you wanna make more than £20k/yr and I might as well do an apprenticeship or retrain in something else at that stage.

The only others i'm aware of are software engineering, but it's been a couple years since I went through all the data structures and algorithms so I doubt i'd be able to pass many leet code questions at this stage. I can code with Java, python and c++, but all my dev work has been with basic malware development interfacing with WinAPI to get C2 shellcode past AV/EDR solutions for initial access on enterprise systems. I just never really required the serious practice of DSA in my line of work.

Maybe some form of administration or networking job but there are lots people with cert stacks for those specifically that I don't have.

Any others i'm missing? Any input is appreciated. Thanks.",2022-12-31 22:01:39

xcburc,ASP.NET for 10 years to Django - will the change negatively impact the career?,"I don't say I am a super expert in C# however I lead a few teams who successfully delivered project on C# ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core stack in the past (being a lead developer since 2019 - however I lead another small team before that since late 2017). I, started C# with Windows Phone programming in 2011 and lately found myself really good specially in ASP.NET Core API applications (even though I did contributed to MVC, Angular and React based parts of the project). 

Currently I am working with a small team and in my team the new projects (imagine these as micro services) are being developed in Django. The original project of the team was developed in ASP.NET Core where I contributed to a solid foundation (which was validated by both industrial and academical experts due to the nature of that project). 

Honestly, I am really comfortable with Django, The change of stack is a good change to me as well. I actually learnt Django to help my fiancé for a project of theirs and did a couple of hobby projects as well.

However in the past weekend someone asked me, will this change affect me in any bad ways considering in the past I have a very good experience in leading C# based teams and the Django stuff is something I never had in my CV in the past. My ambition is to become an Enterprise architect how will this change affect me? 

I know frameworks really doesn't matter in the technical point of view, I am more interested in the opinions in HR/Recruiter perspective.",2022-09-12 12:43:56
vsabce,Will interviews be strict about language syntax?,"I’ve never had a coding interview before but I indend to start applying to jobs soon. I’ve practiced some leetcode, and I generally have a good idea of a plan/strategy to solve a problem, but I often find myself looking up basic syntax I forget or mix up.

e.g. not using the new keyword to instantiate objects in java as opposed to C style programming, or syntax for using pointers in a specific language.

I think it’s mainly a problem because i switch between a lot of languages for different projects, but i’m worried it would look really bad if I end up needing to look up the syntax for something simple like a switch statement because my memory is kind of bad in general too.",2022-07-05 22:37:37

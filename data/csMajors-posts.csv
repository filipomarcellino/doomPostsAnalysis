1b7lxpf,4 reasons why CS is absolutely 100% dead,"1. It's way too competitive. Everyone agrees with this.
2. It used to be exclusively done by a group of elite people but everyone and their grandma went into it. Now it's flooded by mediocre normies.
3. Grinding. You have to grind CS for a thousand hours and then you'll just be average.
4. Cheating. So many people cheat so it's extremely unfair.

So that's why the new Counter Strike game is pretty much dead already. It has some neat smoke physics but otherwise it is inferior to other games. Unrelated to computer science btw",2024-03-06 00:44:41

1bdfru5,How me and my friend finessed FAANG SWE INTERNSHIP,"I don't know how we were able to pull this off. My friend who is a complete dunce (can not do fizzbuzz) somehow got an invitation to do the technical interview. He of course having close to no leetcode experience was panicking, this was his first ever interview as a junior in college. 

We devised a plan to cheat the system. I sat next to him as he started the interview. Basic introductions and we move straight into the technical portion. He has no clue what to do, I used chatgpt to get a basic solution to the question and showed him my computer. Being as sneaky as possible he copies it down and spits word for word the description of the solution, taking sips of water to buy time. By gods grace the interviewer was content with that. 

The behavioral was very easy as he bullshitted his entire experience portion from his completely fabricated resume. The interviewer ate that shit up. Realizing we had successfully bullshitted the interview and likely passed we went out and got plastered.

s5gi86,"No they’re not a diversity hire, you’re just a racist","So this post is largely inspired by [a recent post about Tech tiktokers](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/s4u0jk/what_do_you_think_of_the_tech_influencers_on/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) in which the tiktoker jameslyonsswe was brought up as an example of good/non-exploitative tech tiktokers in the comment section. 

Some things to note about jameslyonsswe: 

- Graduated from Stanford 
- Got his first internship in the 10th grade 
- Interned at NASA during highschool 
- Got an associates degree while in highschool
- Worked as a researcher at Stanford
- Currently works as a SWE at Airbnb
- Apparently completed 400 leetcode questions in 6 weeks 
- is Black 

One of the commenters under the thread mentioned that they weren’t really a fan of jameslyonsswe because he seemed like he was just a diversity hire and didn’t seem particularly talented. 

As a black person in tech who has similar accomplishments to jameslyonsswe (but honestly not Stanford-grad-and-NASA-intern-in-highschool level), I’m no stranger to the diversity hire comments but I quite frankly don’t give a fuck about them and I’ve always dismissed it as a mixture of racism and jealousy. I’ve always known I’m more accomplished than the average cs student and my resume speaks for itself. However, reading that commenter’s posts in the thread sparked something inside me for some reason. 

I realized that if people on here are willing to dismiss jameslyonsswe as a diversity hire, it’s a symptom of a much deeper issue of blatant racism and hatred. At this point you must just view all black people as inherently inferior in order to justify that mentality and I would just like to say in the most honest way possible that there is something deeply wrong with you. The black people in tech that you come across are not the problem, you are. You’re a racist. 

So if you would like to continue living that way, good luck and enjoy being broke and bitter &amp;lt;3. 

If not, here’s a few questions to ask yourself in order to figure out whether someone’s a diversity hire or if you’re just a bigot (it’s most likely the latter) : 

- If their race, gender, sexuality were switched to straight white/asian male (i’m adding asian men to this because asian men make up a large portion of tech workers relative to their population in western countries. i’m not dismissing all the hardships and discrimination faced by the asian community. I will always be an ally to asians), would  they still seem like a diversity hire?

- Are there any prejudices you might have about an element of that person’s identity? 

- Do you have any role models with a similar identity to that person? If not, is there a reason? (are you likely to dismiss everyone with a similar background to this person as unqualified?)

- Do you know enough about them and they’re background and accomplishment to even make an accurate assessment? (the answers is probably no). 

If you answered yes to one or more of the questions above you probably have an issue. 

It’s 2022 guys, this type of thinking is frankly ridiculous and i’m especially disappointed to see so many asian guys sharing the same mentality. As fellow minorities in western countries we share an understanding of what it’s like to be discriminated against and shouldn’t perpetuate that.


Edit: Wow, what an experience. I’ve never had a post this “controversial” blow up like this. Here are some takeaways i got. 

- A lot of people on this community are kinda dumb. Judging from the really immature or blatantly irrelevant responses i got I would say their reading comprehension and argumentative skills could definitely be improved. But alas, it’s impossible to win an argument with a stupid person, so i had to give up in those instances. 

- The tension between black and asian students is definitely a delicate matter. I noticed a lot of the comments I made in defence of black students were automatically seen as disses towards asian students. I’m not sure why that was but I did find that interesting. however, there was no point in which i was trying to say anything offensive towards asians. 

- I stand by everything in my original post and i think the reception of this post is reflective of the dissonance a lot of non-minority CS students have about Affirmative Action and American race relations as a whole. Educate yourselves and stop being a piece of shit towards others : )


Edit 2: Thanks to everyone who’s been PMing me. That’s really sweet but I just wanted to say it’s completely fine. Like I’m not really taking any of the negative comments seriously so don’t worry! I was also mostly expecting this reaction to my post based off other comments in this community.

17fjjks,It actually happened to me.,"Ok so it actually happened to me. I hear this joke a lot amongst CS majors. But I actually didn’t think it would happen to me, and ngl when it was happening I thought they were pulling my leg.

It was a random Tuesday morning, I was walking to class beside the business school. I tend to wear pretty CS-identifying outfits, like headphones, (not sarcastic) space grey/black clothes, glasses. One of my friends from the business school stopped me and asked me if I would be on board with their startup idea.

“Sure, what will my role be?” I asked

I immediately knew the answer. “Can you code up our app? And website and stuff?” I quickly replied “sure. How much will I be compensated”

“Um well the idea is you get experience 🤡🤡”

I genuinely never thought this would happen to me. Lesson learned, never walk by the business school again. 

I wish I could say I was joking, but it’s super common for business students and other professions a like to ask CS majors to code up their stuff for free.",2023-10-24 18:23:42

As an international student, the journey was nothing short of daunting, but here I am, a testament to the power of perseverance.

The path wasn't easy. I remember my first interview at Bytedance; it was a disaster. I froze and couldn't speak for 20 minutes straight. It was one of those moments where everything you've prepared just vanishes.

Fast forward to now, and I've received 3 offers, including one from a company that had previously rejected me. In a twist of fate, I've decided to accept this offer.

To everyone out there struggling, I want to say: your next offer, your next interview, your next opportunity is on the horizon. Keep pushing, keep striving, and most importantly, keep believing in yourself. The road might be tough, and the nights long, but the dawn of success is near.

Keep going, everyone. Your time is coming!

1bmzryz,"Went to a hackathon, realized I don't know anything AT ALL.","I started taking CS courses in fall 22, and I am about 10 courses away from graduating now. My grades in my classes are great, and my school is known for having a slightly more applied curriculum than most. Unfortunately even that is not enough. I can ace data structures/algorithms and discrete math all I want, but I don't have the capability to so much as START a project.

Today I went to my first hackathon. I spent 10 hours trying to set up a database on Amazon RDS. I couldn't even do it. I'm not even sure if Amazon RDS is made for projects. I don't know ANY tools for developers (not even the names of these tools). Someone mentioned an ""environment variable"" to me the other day, I still don't know what that is. Despite the amount of credits I have taken, I am in all honesty, a beginner. Yet, I am on borrowed time. I want to get at least one internship before I graduate but my skillset is seriously concerning me, and I'm panicking.

I'm looking for a general direction for someone like me, or at least a list of very small baby steps.

178gyxf,I hate my job but it pays $135 / hr with overtime bonuses.,"When we meet a deadline we get gift baskets and massive Amazon gift cards on our desks. When my code builds with no errors or warnings (C#) I get Friday off. My project team has regular outings to Saks 5th Avenue and we get to pick out purses and stuff. The company is an unbelievably funded startup but the VCs never come around and bother us. I'm paid a base rate of $135/hr and I get a 50% rate increase for overtime hours, which are almost always optional. 

But, I just hate the place. They have a golden lab that wanders around and it eats my snacks when I leave my office to get a massage. My parking space is, like, at least 100 yards from the building and sometimes there's bird poop on my car when I leave to go home. Also, no one likes to play Quidditch so I have nothing to do at lunch time. 

I just don't know what to do. I have to decide something soon because I'm getting promoted and they want me to take over some new project with Kotlin and AI and ML. I just know they will throw more money at me to make it that much more harder to decide. ",2023-10-15 14:48:38

Then I stepped into my CS class and it was the complete opposite. It was a free-for-all of unhygienic geeks talking over each other, during the lecture this one kid was constantly butting in and trying to add his own details along with unfunny nerd jokes that nobody laughed at except the professor in a form of pity. All the rest of us stayed quiet whilst the loud guys gave nobody else a chance to answer ANY questions. There was a palpable feeling of cringe in the room the entire time.

Aspiring software engineers don’t exactly fit the stereotype of hard networkers, but unfortunately, that is how you are going to get a job.

I know I’m going to get downvoted into oblivion because no one wants to hear that they need to network. Everyone hates networking. I hate networking. But it’s necessary and going to get you a job.

Remember, networking is just getting people to trust you. How do you get people to trust you? Meeting new people. How do you meet new people? There are a million ways to do that, and they all suck. But they’re necessary.

xd2frk,TikTok - Worse than a rejection,"The worst they can say is no. Right? Well guess what…

I recently applied for a TikTok internship because I really liked their product and was interested to learn more about the technical challenges they are facing while growing so quickly. I have a good CV with great grades from a top university and multiple projects and work experience. 

However, I really wanted to stand out from other applicants because working at TikTok was a dream of mine for a while.

At the beginning of the summer I decided to start a project that is related to TikTok in some way. I thought it would be a great way to show my dedication. 

I spent several months building a mobile app which enables TikTok users to see detailed analytics about their follower engagement and track who unfollowed them etc. I published the app on the app store and mentioned it in my CV. There I explained my motivation behind it, the tech stack that I used and included a link to the app store listing.

On the very next day I did not only receive a rejection, but also a trademark infringement complaint from TikTok asking me to remove the app from the app store. Reason for this being that my app uses the word “Tok” in its name.

I guess I should have just grinded leetcode over the summer…",2022-09-13 08:58:40

15kfl0n,The job market is f***d,"Me (M) and my friend (F) Applied to the same software internship at big tech to see what would happen.

Semantics/Biases: Since we were experimenting, we solved the OA together. We both are from the same high school and an Ivy university studying the same course. We created the resumes using the exact same template & even sent the same Thank you email after the interview. I have a higher SAT score, I have a higher GPA than her. I have co-authored 2 research papers. We both have no prior internship or work experience.

________________________________________

So long story short, me and my friend are from the same high school & university. We both got very similar SAT scores. We both applied & got assigned to the same recruiter. We both cleared the OA & landed interviews & made it to the first round.


Final backend Interview: We were completely honest to each other about the questions, and even she agreed that the complexity of my problem was through the roof compared to her leetcode EASY problem.
(The easy one was a sorting problem btw) 


Final Systems Deign Interview: We got the same question for systems design interview. However, I designed the entire system (Db schema, api contract, etc) and she wasn’t able to explain what an API exactly means as she had no prior knowledge about CS.


Result: Even though there is virtually no metric that she beats me in, academically or professionally, SHE GOT THE OFFER!?!?

I’m genuinely happy for her & honestly a little bit bitter! The fact that the profiles are pretty much the same with mine slightly better, & still getting rejected.

I can’t say with 100% certainty but I’m convinced that the market prefers female software engineers over male. Doing this was an emotional roller coaster but fun & I hope this experiment helps a random stranger!",2023-08-07 09:25:03

17vd61s,Microsoft Interviewer told me LeetCode is bad,"I had my final interview for the Microsoft SWE internship role today, and something really stuck out to me. We were wrapping my last interview up after all the questions were done, and he literally told me “you aren’t like other candidates”. I asked him what he meant, and he said every candidate he had interviewed so far just grinds LeetCode and he could tell. He said that apparently, everyone comes into the interviews and just codes out the solution regardless of how difficult the problem is that he gives them, but as an interviewer he doesn’t actually know if they can code well or not, they could literally be copy pasting a solution that they memorized. He said no one talks their solution out loud, and doesn’t communicate their thought process or ask questions, and he is left with no clue of their actual programming capabilities, so he isn’t impressed by their solution. He also said that, maybe for other companies LeetCode might be good, but at Microsoft they aren’t necessarily impressed by it anymore. 

I have no clue if I’ll get the role or not, but just thought that was an interesting tidbit to share. Just something to keep in mind, to talk through your solution and communicate way more than code, as that seemed to be what he was actually looking for.",2023-11-14 21:45:50

My third round was supposed to be yesterday at 3pm and I was told to arrive at 2:55pm. So I did, sitting there waiting for the interviewer to come (they had been 5-6 mins late before too). I waited and nobody showed up, until 3:09, I got an email from the recruiter saying that the role has been filled.

I've spoken to them and they never had personal portfolios, CRUD/MVC framework full stack application projects, hours of Leetcode grinding. They just showed their class projects on their resume, didn't know any frameworks for front end or back end development, and just knew the languages they learned in their classes.. Python, Java, C

A lot of them never even had LinkedIn accounts... and still don't! I hate all this social peacocking.

When I showed them the stuff i have to fucking do just to be a competitive candidate it makes them gasp. So i have to put in 5X+ THE EFFORT.... for literally NO result. They told me for their interviews they were asked the equivalent of a Leetcode easy... to get an 85k job

137t5yd,Offer rescinded for asking about negotiation,"I went through the intensive interview process at a Series B startup **Fathom Health**, which included:

* 1 Hackerrank
* 1 Recruiter call
* 1 Phone Screen (Leetcode-ish)
* 4 onsite rounds (2 system design and two leetcode)
* 1 Tech Talk (A presentation with a topic of my choice)
* 1 round with CEO and 1 round with CTO

After doing well on all of these rounds, I got a call where the CEO gave me an offer.

The recruiter had mentioned that their typical work day is 10-7 PM and there there would be some form of on-call for a few hours every other Saturday.  Also, there was no bonus aside from the total compensation.

So, I asked for a base compensation that was 8% higher than what they offered me. A day later, they called and said it was the founders decision to rescind my offer.  I understand that not all negotiations work out it is outrageous that they are not even willing to talk about it.

This is a tough market and , needless to say, this news felt like a gut punch, especially because I gave three weeks of my life to this process, and excelled at every round. To pull an offer from a candidate you thought was a good fit for the company just because they asked about negotiation is entirely inappropriate.

The whole experience took a huge toll on my lot of mental health.

psxpby,People in This Field Are Abhorrently Bigoted,"Quite tired of seeing people parrot crap about how the evil “Diversity Hires” are coming to take CS majors’ jobs.

One of the most common things I’ve seen said about tech is this: “Don’t worry about not knowing everything. You’ll never know everything when joining a company, you learn on the job.” Why, then, does it seem like underrepresented people in CS have to practically be Steve Jobs in order for many of you to consider us competent enough to get a job offer? Either we know everything and can jump to senior level on Day 1, or we simply got an opportunity because of our sex/skin color. Cool. 

When minorities (particularly Black people) or women joining the industry is brought up, suddenly everybody is concerned about “keeping CS meritocratic.” I read some comments earlier on a post about being a woman in CS, and some comments were (predictably) whining about how companies care more about diversity now and not about who can best perform in the position. 

The problem with this mindset is it presumes the two are mutually exclusive. Newsflash: there are plenty of Black/POC and women software engineers who can do the job; I’m confused as to why so many of you automatically think otherwise. Many of you seem to believe any minority or woman can just walk right into Google today, ask for a job, and be given one without any demonstration of potential. I’m pretty sure this isn’t happening anywhere.

One minute, y’all are raving about how hot the job market is. Then, when minorities or women are brought up, y’all start talking about “diversity hires” taking the jobs and how “we’ve just changed who we discriminate against” (meaning men, usually White, feel like they are being oppressed because Black people and women are joining the CS workforce and often are *actually* as good at software engineering as a lot of them *pretend* to be).

Whenever someone asks how to snatch an interview at certain companies, many of you say “get a referral,” fully aware that it’s acceptable to partly rely on your social connections to score opportunities in tech instead of entirely on your aptitude. I thought y’all were concerned about protecting the meritocracy of CS, though? Why are you asking friends for favors if the job absolutely must go to the best-suited candidate?

I’ve also seen some comments (mainly on Twitter) complaining about minorities in tech “ruining the vibe of the workplace” by finding each other and sticking together. If you are someone who thinks this way, I’d challenge you to reflect on why that might happen. Underrepresented demographics in tech enter workplaces with virtually nobody they can relate to beyond occupation. This can be jarring in multiple ways. Then to also have to deal with a litany of microaggressions and major incidents of racism/sexism…it’s not hard to see why we find each other and stick together in these kinds of environments.

Some see this topic as just a “political debate.” Sorry, but the idea that minorities and women have the potential to perform well at a job in tech is…not political. That has absolutely nothing to do with politics and everything to do with your own personal biases.

I posted this here because I presume most of us, being CS majors, are in school and have yet to fully enter the industry. A lot of you should do better at interrogating your underlying (or not so underlying) racism and sexism before joining the workforce; we all do, to varying degrees, but I feel like some of you have done absolutely nothing to tackle your own prejudices. Ultimately, I wish y’all would just boldly stand in your bigotry instead of hiding behind some false intellectualism. Trying to shroud your biases and hatred in “logic” only works for so long and on so many people before the rest of us look past the bullshit.

TLDR: a lot of y’all are bigoted as fuck and need to reconcile that.

Edit: wow thank you very much to the generous people who gifted gold and other awards. This post was something I simply thought needed to be said among us who are preparing to become, or already are, CS professionals. I’m glad it resonated with many of you.",2021-09-22 02:12:03

sr12wz,"Here’s the truth, sorry if I sound mean or jealous","I fully expect to delete this post Bc of the backlash I’m going to receive. 

But I want to preface by saying this is a community, we’re everybody helps everybody so we all succeed or put ourselves in a better spot as a result of interacting with others in this community. So although this  is ganna sound like a person bashing CS, I’m not but people need to broaden their horizon.

Yesterday in class kid to my right had tears down his face in the middle of lecture, just to be a good person I asked if he was alright and needed anything, he told me he didn’t get an offer from Meta which he was expecting. I told him shake it off, it’s not the end of the world, plus it’s Friday so after lecture you can hang with your friends and go out and stuff. After he hear those words come out of my mouth he just went silent and said he is solely focused on job searching and that non of that “irresponsible hooligan stuff matters”. I stopped talking to him because I got annoyed for a second. By the way we are only sophomores lol.

First of all there is more to life out there in computer science people. Finding friends, hobbies, or things that you enjoy doing is almost as important to a person then just some computer science internship. Go out with friends at night, meet new people, go enjoy life. Sitting inside until you land a VP job at Google is not healthy, I respect the grind but there is more out there. 

I also wanna say this, if your not an upperclassman, you should have zero expectations to get into these companies. Aim for small or mid companies just to get experience, it’s so early in our lives that it’s better to start building from small companies to get the experience to work at the big ones.  

If your in a place right now where u have things outside of computer science then your doing great, keep it up. For those who won’t rest until they work at a company with 500k TC, I respect the grind, but take a step back when you feel down and go do something fun, and will probably bring you more joy.

1avo0js,new grad battle won,N/A,2024-02-20 17:55:08
152fwlj,taking a below-average offer isn’t settling," 

Yesterday at an extended family dinner I had a long discussion with my younger cousin about the tech industry and his career path. He is a 2023 new grad and still hasn’t secured an offer he is happy with, and the stress of the current job market has really been eating at him. I don’t know if I was able to help much but he suggested I post what we talked about on this subreddit (I’m not really a redditor) as our talk seemed to give him some clarity/comfort.

My cousin is a classic overachiever who has done everything “right” when it comes to tech recruitment. He secured multiple internships, grinded leetcode, kept his grades up, and did extensive networking. But in this competitive environment its easy to downplay your achievements when you compare yourself to others, and for new grads in tech it is especially easy to become demotivated when one is surrounded by peers who seem to be securing record compensation packages and cushy jobs in FAANG/ FANG-adjacent companies. It is also important that hard work and determination is not always rewarded with stellar or even equivalent results.

My cousin has secured jobs but he doesn’t want to “settle”. The offers are as you might expect, a handful of local companies and startups. A few with titles that don’t quite align with “maximizing” his future job prospects, a few whose core products aren’t even technology at all. It was evident to me that he was really waiting for those “true” new grad in tech offers, an offer that can be easily be found adorning the avalanche of flex posts across social media around graduation season. In his mind this offer would snowball him to the pinnacle of tech greatness and without it he would be sabotaging, perhaps irrevocably, his career path. As someone with a few YOE under my belt and a senior engineer at a unicorn, he was hoping to emulate my career path.

The thing is, I “settled”. In fact, when I left for my new grad job I was painfully embarrassed at my job results that I almost kept my workplace a secret from all my university friends.

I am a below-average developer. This isn’t even imposter syndrome talking, as I couldn’t even secure a return offer to the one middling internship I managed to secure in my junior year of college due to bad performance. My job prep was also mediocre, mostly I used a infamous book called cracking the coding interview and barely practiced any of my interview skills until graduation had passed. Long months of unemployment followed, and this being 2016, the new grad job market wasn’t even particularly bad at this time.

Eventually at the beginning of the fall of 2016 I secured employment at a small startup in the SF bay area earning 48k a year. This place was truly terrible, and if any of you have experienced working at predatory startups you also know how awful it is to work at one of these places. Terrible processes, founder ego, nepotism abound, work life balance that resembles indentured servitude, etc. Every day was a miserable loop of stressful days in the office getting yelled at by upper management and unhappy nights at home in a small apartment I could barely afford with unpleasant roommates. But I knew that this wouldn’t be for long.

After a year at that place I did what nearly every other new grad has done after they signed an offer at this “startup”. Leverage their newly found skills and jump ship. My next destination after some needed rest was a media company in NYC, owed largely to a connection I made at the startup. This time I was making just shy of 90k in the Big Apple, working and living in much better conditions than before. At this point I felt proud enough to share my achievements with my friends and family, but at the end of the day a job is a job after all. And just like those celebratory posts on linkedin, the importance of the job offer faded into obscurity. I was loving my work, my team, the culture and I thought I would stay at that media company forever. But it was not to be, barely half a year into the role my organization was re-orged and I was one of the unlucky employees to be last stranded.

At the time I was convinced that a job at a “true” tech company would prevent such a future catastrophe. I subscribed to the belief that since the engineer wasn’t king at that media company, this was the reason for the layoffs. A truly naive point of view but nonetheless one I held as I was forced back into the job search. Eventually, I secured a position at a large FinTech company in NYC, finally breaching that six figure floor and making 134k a year, somehow upleveling myself even with my disastrous previous experiences. All cash as the company was and still is privately held, though it has notoriously good benefits. This was July 2018.

The next two years I grew at the company, survived through another re-organization and steadily grew my compensation. But as part of a slower moving team I was feeling my skills plateau and truthfully I didn’t find life as a developer in NYC to my taste. As 2020 hit I took the start of the pandemic as a sign to take a break to prevent burnout and return back to the west coast to spend time with family.

Of course, one can only stay out of the workforce for so long. Luckily after an initial hit to hiring from the pandemic, experienced engineers were in demand again at the end of 2020 and I was able to secure employment starting the beginning of 2021 at a large tech company in the Bay Area, a company I remain at to this day. Here the numbers get a little fuzzy because of not only the frequent equity shocks through the prevailing years, but also due to some promotions and a job function switch I made. I reckon that my compensation was about \~360k in 2021 due to the small bull run, dropping to \~290k in 2022. And finally this year I’m probably in the 400-480k range depending on how our stock performs.

So why share such a flex-like career trajectory? Because to a new grad like my cousin my “career path” seems straightforward and illustrative of the compensation maximizing, leetcode grinding, job hopping, up leveling mindset that seems a core ethos in the minds of today’s computer science students.

48k -> 90k -> 134k -> \~300k -> \~400k

But mine on path and that of my colleagues I increasingly find is the opposite of straightforward. The vast majority of my coworkers didn’t “plan” and “execute” a career so rigidly determined in their college years. Many of them are like me, average people with average performance; stumbling and bumbling their way in their own mediocrity through layoffs and triumphs until one day you wake up with strangers, relatives, and your friends’ kids asking you how did you “win” in the tech rat race.

And the truth of it is, I just “settled” and let life sort itself out.

Truly I have no idea if this collection of thoughts would be helpful, but it was a fine enough distraction for me to put to words during my lunch break. Safe travels all.

uy7gg3,LeetCode Tips from author of Blind 75,"Did 500+ LeetCode questions, created Blind 75, and interviewed hundreds of candidates. Frankly speaking, I dislike LeetCode, but the rules aren't set by us and the best we can do is to be better at this stupid game together.

Hence here are some tips for you.

1. Revise your CS fundamentals before your start LeetCoding. You don't have to spend that much time studying, but you need to know the advantages of each data structure and when to use which for the question.

2. The average question difficulty you'll get is Medium. Start with Easy questions, do more of them, move on to Medium questions. You probably won't be asked Hard questions in real interviews but you should do some famous Hard questions like Word ladder, serialize/deserialize Binary tree and trapping rain water. You should not be practicing only Easy questions.

3. LeetCode is not fully representative of real interviews. In real interviews, you don't get long descriptions nor do you get so many test cases. Questions in interviews are intentionally vague and underspecified, you have to clarify the requirements. You will also not be given input ranges during interviews.

4. To better simulate interview conditions, come up with a solution in your mind and be sure of the time and space complexity before you start to code. Trial and error-ing during the interview is not seen as a positive signal. As a good habit I write the time and space complexity of my solution as a comment above my solution.

5. If you find yourself stuck after half an hour on a question. Determine if you are close enough to cracking it. If you're close, try for a while longer. Otherwise read the solutions and move on. Learn the technique that was crucial to solving the question and internalize it. Revisit in a few day's time and try to solve it without referring to the answer this time. LeetCode also shows you similar questions for a problem. To test if you have understood the concepts, try the similar questions and see if you can solve them.

6. You might not get to run your code during interviews. Interviewers aren't just evaluating how correct your code is, the signals you exhibit during the process matters as well. You can end up failing even though you wrote correct code but it's messy and not readable. You can also end up passing even if your code had a minor mistake but your code is super clean and well-structured. Getting an Accepted doesn't mean you did well if you only got it on your tenth attempt. Before hitting the submit button, scrutinize your solution hard. Come up with test cases, standard ones, edge cases, think whether your code will pass those cases. You can run your code against your own test cases, it's still better than hitting the submit button. Just note that you might not get to do that during interviews.

7. Some topics are more important than the others. DFS, BFS, binary search, trees, graphs are the most important and common ones. If you're going for Google, practice DP. If you suck at DP like me, at least be good at backtracking with memoization.

8. The chosen language doesn't matter as much as your mastery of the language. You don't have to pick up Python just because it's the best language for interviews. But if you have enough time (more than two months), it might be worth doing so.


9. You don't need to practice too many questions. 100-200 is sufficient for most. After a while, the questions are variations of previous questions and are based off the same patterns. The returns on practicing above 300 questions is marginal at best. The full list of 169 questions in Grind 75 (https://grind75.com) is 90% of what you need.

10. LeetCoding is a marathon, not a sprint. If you start too early, you run out of steam. Start too late and there's not enough time for spaced repetition to take effect. Recommend starting a few months in advance and spending 1hr a day doing a few questions per day. You should be in top shape when it's time for interviews. If you've completed all recommended practice questions, do the weekly contests. If you can solve at least 3 of them, you should be ready for interviews.

11. You might never feel ready for interviews and that's perfectly normal. Interviewing is a numbers game. Interview performance is a function of luck and preparation. The more you prepare, the ""luckier"" you get. You will fail some and you will pass some. You just need to pass one.

All the best and lemme know in the comments if you have any questions!",2022-05-26 13:18:47

16c0wn4,I was the guy who needed to become a leetcode god within a week...,"What I did: I went through neetcode's 150 problems like my very life depended on it and got through around 90(?) problems. Made sure I actually actually understood them. It was really, really, painful as I was a) doing this for hours each day and b) panicked about my interview and c) I'd get scared whenever I saw a problem that I didn't have a clue how to approach. It did help that I had reasonably strong foundations from my school's data structures course so I wasn't learning anything from scratch. 

I watched the videos, wrote out stuff on paper, and made sure I could explain the solution to myself from scratch and justify each and every line of code. ChatGPT was so, so helpful in this regard. If I ever didn't understand something, I could paste that chunk of the solution (with some context) and ask it all the dumb questions I wanted to ask, and it worked like a charm.

That said, I had my tech screen today, and *I killed it*. I got a leetcode medium (dp problem) and I got so lucky - it was something that I'd gone through 4 days ago, and repeated yesterday night to make sure I didn't just memorize the solution. The interviewer basically said I'll be moving onto the next round(s) today itself. 

This was a huge wake up call, guys. I'm aware that if I hadn't been this lucky, I could have had an extremely mediocre interview. I've started to practice things more consistently, and pushing past my tiredness at the end of the day after schoolwork is done. Thank you to those who were encouraging and positive - *and* those who shat on me. I deserved all of it, the good and bad. 

On that note - for system design, do people think neetcode is better or grokking? Or something else? 

^(In unrelated news, I'm 10 days behind on schoolwork and have a shit ton to catch up on. You live, you learn.)",2023-09-07 00:17:00
16gpj01,To everyone who wants to ignore theory and math," CS PhD here, was a professor for many years, now 15 years in industry including a few startups and two FAANGs. 

At my second FAANG job, a major component of the system I was hired to design and deliver  required consuming user submitted source code and allowing it to run on a very popular public facing website. As you might imagine, security was a top concern.  My manager was pushing hard for a static code analysis solution that I knew was not solvable.  I described approximations that would probably work in practice (and their tradeoffs), but my manager insisted that we couldn't approximate the analysis step and that it was crucial. 

Only after I PROVED (in the theory of computation sense) that what he was asking me to do was equivalent to the halting problem did we settle on another approach (a combination of simpler static analysis and a dedicated human review team who would reject submitted code that wasn't clear). 

Without solid theoretical CS fundamentals, another engineer (principal or otherwise) might have spent months going down a rathole trying to solve a theoretically unsolvable problem, and created a huge security hole on a VERY popular website. 

This stuff happens more than you think, and not just to principal engineers building whole new systems from scratch. It really matters. There are people in high up positions of authority at the best companies who will ask you to do things that are inefficient or impossible. It's not a circle jerk for nerds who can't code, and it's not punishment.",2023-09-12 12:01:40

swe27f,"A talk I wish I could have with myself 6 years ago, for those who are blowing off their career and grades","I’m writing this because I wish I someone would’ve sat me down and told me this 6 years ago when I was a college freshman and I think this might help some people in the same position. 

I’m now 2 years into my career as a software developer at a decent no-name software company. I make a decent comfortable salary, I work with decently interesting tech, decently competent coworkers. I feel very privileged to be where I am, but simultaneously I know I could do much greater if I had applied myself in college.

1.	**CS theory does matter. It’s not useless**, and you will eventually enjoy it once you get enough of an understanding to not be intimidated by it. Theory knowledge will form the basis of your ability to find a job and solve interview problems to prove your knowledge. 
2.	**You are good enough and smart enough**. You may not know it yet, but you will build your confidence in your abilities and come to see you are much more capable than you think you are.
3.	Stop wasting so much time on video games and Reddit (both fine in moderation) and trying to save a doomed relationship. Every week dedicate a bit of time, even if it’s just an hour (but ideally a few hours) to working on side projects, an hour or two practicing Leetcode, etc. **Consistent habitual practice will go so much farther than last minute motivation and cramming before an exam or interview..**
4.	**Grades do matter, but not in the way you think**. The vast majority of companies do not care about your GPA, but they care about your knowledge and abilities. People with vast knowledge and strong abilities in CS tend to have good grades, because after all, if you know your material then you’ll be able to pass your exams.
5.	Get over your shyness. Nobody is going to think you’re weird or a loser. **Go mingle with classmates that are interesting and fun to be around**. You’ll have great conversations, maybe you’ll work on projects together, maybe they’ll end up referring you to a job, maybe you’ll learn about an interesting new Framework, or maybe you’ll just make a cool friend. Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there. If you don’t take the first step and try, you’ll never succeed. 
6.	**Talk to your professors outside of class.** They’re really knowledgeable, they’re often friendly and cool people despite how intimidating they may seem at a distance. Go to office hours and ask a clarifying question about a homework problem. You’re paying for these resources, so use them.
7.	**Apply to internships early.** Apply during your freshman year. Who cares if you look like an idiot who knows nothing, most people do at this point. By making yourself be that idiot who is underprepared freshman year, you learn about the process and now you won’t be that idiot sophomore or junior year. 
8.	**Go to career fairs**. It doesn’t matter that your resume sucks. It doesn’t matter that you aren’t good enough. Get over your shyness and go. This will teach you how to speak like a professional with a recruiter, and you might make a contact at a large company who can help you out. You might become friends with the nice person in like next to you. 
9.	**Go to hackathons**. No you don’t have to pull an all nighter. No you don’t have to abuse caffeine and eat greasy food. Go to a hackathon because you will make friends. You will build a cool project that you can put on your resume, and you’ll have a lot of fun. You might win a prize and you’ll almost certainly get some free swag.
10. **Join student clubs**. You’ll become good friends with these peers. The club might work on cool projects together or bring interesting speakers from companies, or help each other with mock interviews. 



**All of this mostly sums up to put yourself out there, don’t be afraid to fail, because if you don’t try and fail a few times you will definitely fail, and long term. You are capable of way more than you think you are.**

I’m two years into my career and I’ve learned a lot of important lessons and I’m now for the first time getting on the Leetcode grind, fixing up my resume, and trying to get into the FAANG companies. 

But even if I get into a FAANG company this year, there’s a few things I’ll never be able to go back and do. I’ll never be able to go back and have an internship. And I don’t regret it because I missed out on money and clout, I regret it because I missed on friendship and fun / interesting experiences. But I’ll find them in other ways.

xi6knk,There Is Nothing Better Than Grinding Leetcode,"Back when I was starting out, I used to think that grinding leetcode was tedious and that I was wasting my life doing boring problems. Not anymore. Now leetcode is the best part of my life and I have come to accept the fact that there is nothing in this life that is better than grinding leetcode, all day and everyday.

Leetcode has endless interesting problems to offer me. I love occupying my brain with interesting things and solving interesting problems. Leetcode offers me exactly that. It has endless interesting problems which I would never have been able to experience had I not been a Leetcode addict. Because of Leetcode, I have been able to solve more problems than 99.99% of people who have ever lived on this earth. Isn't that worth something?

I barely even feel human anymore. I feel like an omniscient, all-knowing AI that has matured and transcended beyond the human experience and lived a thousand lifetimes already.  I even dream in code now: Yesterday morning, I snoozed my alarm so I could finish the solution to the problem I was solving in my sleep. I know that there is so much more that Leetcode can offer me. I don't even want a job anymore. Google could offer me 500k a year for all I care, and I will still reject them, because Leetcode is all I want to do. I will not be satisfied ever, I exist only to read more interesting problems, to think through more creative solutions, to consume every problem Leetcode has to offer, through my blue light screen in the safety and comfort of my own room.

At this point, I have become Leetcode incarnate. I exist only to scroll through Leetcode, consuming every little piece of an interesting problem I can get my hands on. And as my blue-light stricken, blood-shot eyes flick over hundreds of thousands of characters of code, my dopamine receptors work overtime to keep up (and that's a good thing).

Why would I ever be interested in growing my own personal mundane, generic, stereotypical cliche life experiences? Boring! When I grind Leetcode, I am experiencing the best of the best the world has to offer, given to me on a silver platter for easy and limitless consumption. How could real life boring experiences and hobbies ever hold a candle to the the sheer dopamine surge I get from designing complex algorithms in a matter of minutes after reading a Leetcode problem?

And vacation? Forget it. We all know that vacations always end eventually, and when you're back it feels as if you never went at all. I just want to grind Leetcode. That's all I want and that's all I need.

I have read plenty of books (fiction and nonfiction) earlier in my life, but why would I read books now? It takes so much time, I'd rather just grind Leetcode. You see, reading books, though better for your attention span and less dopamine-frying, is actually just another form of consumption, that doesn't actually get you anywhere in the long run. It's less effective; for me, the opportunity cost of reading a book is consuming a vast variety of tons of different interesting problems on Leetcodet truly broaden my perspective. And the broader my perspective gets, the more I realize that there is nothing better than grinding Leetcode.",2022-09-19 09:00:07

However, this internship season, my girlfriend got into Jane Street while I didn't get a return offer. Obviously, my supervisor was threatened by me and afraid I'd take his job. I've had to settle for interning at Google Brain (eww) and now my prestigious girlfriend wants to break up with me. She says she's found another guy who has interned at every single trading firm every summer since middle school. How do I win her back?",2022-02-23 18:41:49

1ayx8fz,2023 grad. I'm leaving CS,"I did what I was told to do. I got a CS degree from a top 20 school. I worked hard in classes. I regularly attended office hours and company events. I was decently passionate about the field and never entered it ""just for the money"". I didn't have a stellar 3.6+ GPA but I was comfortably in the top 25% of my CS cohort. Literally the only thing I didn't have was an internship as I chose to pursue a double major. And yet after ~1000 apps sent over 22/23, I got 4 interviews (all only through uni partners) and 0 offers. I've read the posts here about getting your resume checked, writing cover letters and cold calling recruiters on LinkedIn. I did that too. But I was an international student so no one wanted me. 

After graduating I decided to take a gap year and return to my country. All my international friends who delayed their spring '23 grad to December or this May because ""hiring should have started by then"" are in as bad a state as I was in. I gave this CS degree all I had but evidently it wasn't enough. I just paid my enrollment deposit to business school and I'm not gonna look back. I'm obviously gonna use the CS degree as a platform for my career and I'm not gonna disregard it entirely but I'm likely never gonna work in a traditional CS entry-level role ever when I spent the last 4 years of my life grinding for it.

I was listening in on a meeting that had nothing to do with me. They were abandoning a project because revenue was much less than expected. Overall, the company lost 11 million dollars on this. The lead says great effort nonetheless, we’ll reassess our goals going forward. That was it. Everyone was nice. Everyone was professional and respectful. Like it was nothing.

My memories of working fast food are still fresh. The rude customers. The low pay. The long hours. The level of disrespect that you get from all levels. I remember customers who threatened violence when we told them we had a mask policy. 

And now here I am listening to how 11 million  dollars was burned like it was monopoly money. Everyone is treated like an adult even when things go wrong. I’ve entered into a world where people can be treated like human beings because we can all afford to do so.",2022-05-31 23:38:59

ktfe85,I am just a freshman but so over this clout chasing. A short rant,"Instead of HYPSM during college apps, now it’s FANG or FAANG or whatever it is for internships, and I’m just so over this clout chase 🙄

During high school I tried so. Hard. For a top college bc everyone acted like the end goal to everything. I thought that being a top school student would be my happy moment. To feel validated for my hard work and feeling smart. And now sure, I’m at a top college. It’s still hard. I’m still not happy. I still don’t feel smart or successful— tbh, I’ve never felt dumber. Not to say I don’t feel grateful and lucky to be at my college, but it was really not what it’s cracked up to be.

And now I’m stressing out over winter break, trying to push through leetcode, finish side projects done, trying to keep up at my internship. All so when I graduate, I can achieve the “dream” of going to work at a FANG.

I just spent fifteen minutes taking a good hard look at my life priorities and it honestly makes me want to laugh how dumb my self imposed pressure to go after these weird acronyms is. 

Is my goal really to live in a tiny apartment in California with a 3k/month rent to go work at a not-so-ethical mega company to devote my energy towards developing a tiny tiny not that impactful part of their code base. Just so I can have “software engineer @ {FANG}” on my LinkedIn headline and hypothetically feel successful and happy, but I’m betting it’ll not be what it’s cracked up to be either. 

I know that this is all self imposed pressure, I don’t need to be trying this hard, I just need to chill out. But that’s much easier said than done. 

Realistically, I would be at the same level of happy living in a mid-sized city, making 80k as a software engineer in a no name company with a good work environment, reasonable work life balance, and friends and family. That’s the reality and I’m trying to convince myself it’s true but that’s not too easy.

Interviewer showed up with his camera turned off and wanted to go straight to coding. He gave me a question and I explained my approach and then he wanted me to solve it using a stack DFS instead of recursion, which I had never done before so I struggled a bit. I usually have some scratch paper in hand so I can visualize things, but he told me that I wasn't allowed to do that  and to use the Codepair scratchpad. Later as I looked to the side to think for a second, he asked me ""why the fuck are you looking to the side"" (verbatim) and to focus on the screen, to which I apologized and kept going. He wasn't really angry, in fact he was laughing when he said it but at this point I was extremely uncomfortable and it was impossible to think through the problem. I was explaining my thought process and when I said something about popping a node from the stack he deadass replied ""Ayee pop it like it's hot"".

He then started getting impatient when I couldn't solve the problem and he started throwing out a lot of curse words in his hints (that weren't ever helpful) and then said ""C'mon you're a \[T10 uni\] student, show me some code"", which is probably one of the most demoralizing things I've been told. He ended it and asked me if I had any questions. I asked him how he liked Microsoft and he said you learn a lot but ""the pay is shit and the work is boring."" I thanked him for his time and he said yeah and dc'ed (this was the first interview of the loop). Got rejected the next day.

mfx8oq,Women's experience in CS,"In lieu of the 'stop sexism in cs against men' post from last night, I wanted to provide some context to the other side. I'm not denying the existence of positive discrimination for women, I'm just saying thet it isn't as prevalent as a lot of yall like to make it out to be (20% of cs majors are women vs btwn 20-25% of swe's are women) and the crap women have to deal with is equally, if not more, important. It's very easy to 1. assume women only get jobs in this industry because they're women and 2. act like being a woman in this industry makes our lives easier when that is easily not the case.

I could sit here and give anecdotal evidence on what it's like to be a woman in cs and I'm sure a lot of other women on this sub can, but I won't. Some people accused me of making baseless claims so I decided let's look at some stats

According to [this article](https://www.cio.com/article/3516012/women-in-tech-statistics-the-hard-truths-of-an-uphill-battle.html) the amount of women who get cs degrees has dropped from 27% of total cs degrees to 18% in over 20 years. I want everyone to ask themselves: did women wake up one day and decide that they no longer wanted anything to do with computers? In fact, here we have a [NYT Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/magazine/women-coding-computer-programming.html?auth=login-google) that explains in depth the history of women in computing and how it started off predominantly female, as a lot of you know.

I also saw someone say that the amount of jobs given to women in tech is disproportionate to the amount of degrees that women get which is also false as the retention rate for women is 38% versus 53% for men. [Here](https://www.isemag.com/2020/10/telecom-the-latest-stats-on-women-in-tech/) we can see that that the rate of women seen in higher level positions decreases as well.

So why is this? One could argue that it's purely women's problem that we as a whole often choose to not enter male dominated work spaces.

/u/ilovechee3e pointed out very well in that previous post that [60% of women face unwanted sexual advances](https://www.elephantinthevalley.com/) when working in this industry. Maybe, as much as we attack positive discrimination, we should be holding our colleagues and classmates more accountable for how they treat women. It's also frustrating, as a woman who regularly frequents this sub, to see SOME of you act like being a URM (in this case being a woman), is the only reason we get anywhere. When I got my first offer last fall (after applying to 100+ positions and practicing JUST LIKE THE REST OF YOU) I was told by my recruiter that I was one of the top candidates they interviewed.

More reports:

[3/4 women report discrimination in computing industry vs 3/20 men](https://www.vox.com/2018/1/9/16870120/women-discrimination-pew-research-computer-job-workplace-harassment-stem)

[78% of female start up founders have been sexually harrassed](https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/at-work/tech-careers/the-numbers-of-women-in-tech-rise-and-fall-but-sexual-harassment-is-ever-present)

A lot of interesting stats by [pew research](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/01/09/women-in-stem-see-more-gender-disparities-at-work-especially-those-in-computer-jobs-majority-male-workplaces/) includiing 50% of women in stem report some kind of gender based discrimination, 1/5 being sexual harrassment (that's TWENTY PERCENT OF WOMEN). This number goes up to 30% for women in cs

TL;DR:

Yes positive discrimination for women exists. Context is required. To paint it as just 'sexism' without ever addressing the amount and level of misogyny women face is wrong. To act like it severely hinders the ability of men to get jobs in this field is also just blatantly wrong.

&#x200B;

Also wanted to clear something up before some inevitable comments I get:

This is mostly about the US. I can't comment on practices in other countries as I've seen a lot of people complain about India.

I'm not a man hater. I literally love men.

147fbwh,Where is the light at the end of the tunnel.,"I did everything I could. This past month I graduated uni with a 3.7. I held myself to a higher standard and took the most involved classes in CS, math and stats our program offered. I did cybersecurity research with one of my professors last semester, graded for data structures and algo, and did some peer tutoring on the side. I have my own website and a laundry list of meaningful projects in different languages all on github. I’ve done hackathons by myself, with a couple friends, with 16 year olds from Gibraltar who pronounce deque with three syllables. I’ve done about 300 leetcode questions but most of them were medium or hard, and that was after I switched from C to Python and had to start over. I let my resume undergo cycle after cycle of metamorphosis along with my very being. I even networked my introverted ass off at meaningless lunches if it meant a chance at an endorsement in HTML on LinkedIn. I can only truthfully say I gave it my everything because I know there isn’t an English word that means more than that.

Over the past year I have applied to over 1100 different positions at over 500 different companies. FAANG, hedge funds, startups that make you do CTF, even the made up word salad job descriptions that keep escaping containment in South Carolina. Those numbers easily would’ve quadrupled if I let myself apply to jobs I was even remotely underqualified for. But I hold my head high, knowing I can succeed once I take my first step into the real world, and I cling onto my confidence and its cousin, naiveté.

All this time I’ve kept a color-coded spreadsheet with a list of companies, job titles, locations and apply dates. Red is an auto rejection, yellow means I got an OA. I’ve long forgotten what the other colors were going to be because I haven’t had to use any of them. The last two weeks of rejection emails have grinded my career to halt and my hopes down to a fine dust. The world seems to have decided I’m not fit to live the dream I’ve been working towards for the last five years and it’s tearing my mind and body apart. I’ve conditioned myself to have chronic migraines every time I wake up in preparation for the emails I’m about to read. I’ve lost so much weight from the stress that I can say good morning to each bone in my ribcage before stumbling over my computer desk. “Unfortunately”, “no close match”, “not retained”. I let the memory of what these words once meant to me guide my descent further into the abyss. “We regret”, “not the right fit”, “role has been closed”. If anyone was truly sorry for saying no, would they hide behind the facade of the same words of rejection time after time?

Home has been hell on earth. My mother has become unbearable, constantly berating me for hibernating in my room as I scrounge the internet for any morsel of a job offer I haven’t yet discovered. When I finally heed her advice to join at the dinner table, she asks me which video games I’ve been playing all day and compares me to my psych major of an older brother until I crawl back into my real home to resume my fruitless search. My grandparents came out to visit this weekend and were absolutely livid that I was still at home without a job. My grandmother asked why I don’t just walk down to Best Buy and work on the computers there, threatening to bring me there on a leash. It would take more years off my life explaining to her what a software is than she has left on this dying earth, so I remain zen through their outrage as I let the anger caramelize into fortitude. But it was different when my father watched my struggle from the bedroom door without saying a word last night. When I turned around from my bloodstained spreadsheet and saw him, he didn’t need to say anything to shatter my existence into a thousand little splinters, the look on his face was painful enough to do that much alone. I’ve had some enemies over the years, but I wouldn’t wish upon any of them the profound sadness of watching your number one supporter lose faith in your efforts and turn their back to you without even saying goodbye.

The world has humbled me enough to ask if it even cares at this point. Was I wrong to keep trying after all this time? Would I have felt better had I given everything up earlier? Every day I think I’ve reached a new low the threat of tomorrow creeps under me like a quicksand. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to think I deserve the food on my plate or the air I breathe in. I would beg for someone to tell me everything’s okay, but I think it would be more comforting to know when it will all end. When the pain finally goes away, does it really vanish from your life, or do you just grow hardened enough to not feel it anymore?",2023-06-12 04:56:18

1bbs834,Giving up on CS for now,"This is mostly to get it off my chest, but I have to finally give up on CS. It's something I was really passionate about, and I still am, but just something I can't do anymore. I'm an international student studying CS in the US, but I have not been able to make a single cent back from my major. All my work experience has been in research labs where I obviously don't get paid. I am in my Junior year and was not able to find an internship last year, nor do I have anything coming up in the summer.

Despite multiple personal projects, research experience, doing over 250+ LC questions (even getting LC premium and getting a 200 day streak), I have not seen any return from my major. This cycle I sent in about 1000 applications, but did not get ANY interviews. I attended career fairs, networking events, coffee chats, everything as well.

Now my family has run out of savings and there is no way I can afford to pay tuition anymore. I will take out a loan and graduate early (next semester), but after that I am going back to my country. I don't see any way I can use my knowledge and passion in CS to make any sort of financial gain, so I had to make the hard decision to give up. I am probably going to end up working as a blue-collar worker. I feel awful because I was ""gifted"" in school and extremely ""smart"", at least according to my parents who made a lot of sacrifices to pay for my tuition. Even now, I won 2 hackathons last year. But alas, no money made there either.

It is probably going to take me at least 10 years to just make back the money I spent on my education. So I am giving up on CS for now. I don't see any way to make this a career for me at this point. Perhaps in the future I will get another chance because it really is something I am extremely passionate about.

One piece of advice for students who are considering CS is that you should really have a backup plan if you're not able to find a career. My mistake was coming in and just assuming that I would find a job after I graduate. That is not the case anymore. You need to have the financial freedom to try at it for a couple of years. Unfortunately, I don't have that luxury :/

 The interview process I had for my position  consisted of a hackerrank, and 2 behavioral interviews. No technical rounds other than the hackerrank, just a conversation about technical skills with some senior software engineer leads. I honestly prefer it that way.

Overall, I think I've gotten invited to around...6ish interviews out of 70 ish apps? I have previous swe experience at a small IT company and also research experience (which I 100% recommend you to do research at least once if you have the time, interviewers are always asking about my research and think it's cool lol).

Fast forward to today, near the end of my Sophomore year, and I realize that I have no real coding skills. All of my projects were either written by ChatGPT or copied from a YouTube tutorial. I struggle to even write a program that determines whether or not a number is prime. I can’t solve Two Sum. I have no one to blame but myself.

As I approach my Junior year with no significant coding ability to speak of, and no internships under my belt, my anxiety levels are through the roof. I want to utilize the time I have this summer to reset and build the skills I need to be an independent and knowledgeable student/developer. I need to hear some harsh truths and some advice regarding the following:

1. Building Coding and DSA Knowledge from Scratch: I want to rebuild my foundations in coding, data structures, and algorithms, ensuring I understand the concepts and can apply them without immediately turning to ChatGPT for answers. What are the most effective and efficient strategies for achieving this?

2. Escaping Tutorial Hell: After building a solid coding foundation, how can I transition from following tutorials to building projects on my own?

Any advice, resources, personal anecdotes, or strategies you could share would be immensely appreciated. How did you develop your skills, and what made the biggest difference for you in becoming an independent coder?

Thanks in advance for your help and guidance!",2024-03-28 13:56:56
mxwspd,You don't need to be passionate or excited about CS to succeed,"I wanted to share my personal experience as this is something that I had previously beaten myself up over. For some context, I'm a class of 2020 graduate currently working for a popular search engine.

To put it simply, outside of my courswork I've never given much of a crap about CS or anything going on in the software development scene. Unlike peers I've found myself jealous of, I never had the motivation to do anything dev-related in my free time. All of the projects listed on my resume were for class finals and I'm among the worst offenders when it comes to buying a project domain then never touching it. I have zero familiarity in anything modern and 'exciting' like React or app development or ML (or even github before I started work). 

My senior year when I was still job-hunting I remember horrendously mispronouncing Kubernetes to a FAANG-bound classmate (who could talk to you for hours about Kubernetes and Docker and React, etc.) and thinking to myself that my disinterest in CS had killed my chances of achieving their level of success (that same classmate and I work together now).

Despite my lack of motivation I found myself able to receive two solid offers due to the usual leetcode grind and having strong grades plus some years of mundane freelance Wordpress development. Looking back, I realize that my lack of passion never really held me back as much as I thought it did. I do fine in my job (which involves working on an in-house C++ framework) and I could learn something like Angular if I needed to. At this point I've pretty much accepted that I'm only going to touch code 9–5 for the rest of my life and I have plenty of other hobbies that capture my interest.

It goes without saying that passion for CS can go a loooong way for a new grad, especially if your interests and skills align with those a potential team or you have a knock-your-socks-off personal project to showcase. But for those of you who are in my boat, it's important to recognize that it's not a requirement.",2021-04-25 00:28:12

A lot of people told me that it was too late to get an internship in 6^(th) grade and I should have started earlier. I was very discouraged. However, someone told me to apply to Amazon. I applied to Amazon and was asked a few questions such as print ""hello world"" and what is a computer. After those two questions, I was given the internship! Even though Amazon is less prestigious than Google, I am excited to start my journey there and one day work for the big Google.",2021-11-21 23:51:39

18dc7yx,Name and Shame: Visa Inc.,"So I went through the lovely recruitment process for a software engineer new grad with Visa Inc. this year. Applied in October, aced the code signal, and they requested a first-round interview. I gave my availability for the next 7 days. 5 days go by nothing. I reached out and got a message a day later saying they're trying to schedule ASAP and ask for additional availability for the next week.

Then before I can even reply I get an email from the lead recruiter giving a time for an interview the next day in the morning. The interview went well. Then nothing for 2 weeks, At this time I got another offer and informed Visa of said deadline.

Then finally after another week and a half, almost a month since my first interview. I got an invitation to a final round, and the recruiter asked me to get a week and a half extension for my offer. Which I then did.

Final interview time, I'm talking to my potential future manager going great. In the end, he asked me about any offers and I explained. He basically said, ""I think you'd be a great fit, our recruitment processes have improved a lot and we should be able to get an offer in front of you before your deadline and I hope you sign it. I look forward to you joining the team"".

So of course I'm ecstatic. Then the next day my recruiter reached out and asked me to get another couple-day extension in addition because ""we need till the end of the week to confirm results"". I'm somewhat sussed out but I ask and somehow get the extension anyway.

I was told I'd get an update this morning. The morning of the day my other offer was due. I waited patiently as the morning rolled past. Nothing. Around 2 pm I emailed the recruiter to check in ""Well have an update by the afternoon"" they replied. Fast forward, now it is 8 pm my time. Left with basically no choice, I send another email asking whether or not I'll get a decision today. 4 minutes later an automated rejection email from Visa hits my inbox. All I can say is what the fuck. Like not even the recruiter reaching out with a rejection. After I was told in everything but print I was hired and extended an offer deadline twice. Like why couldn't they have rejected me a week ago?

I don't even know what to do anymore tbh.

vgr69p,Never realized how accurate HBO’s Silicon Valley portrays big companies until I started interning at one,"Always thought it was hilarious how the employees of Hooli behaved. Talking about Gavin Belson like he was a deity and all the corporate speak/fake smiles.

Literally the same thing is happening where I am interning. “It was a transformative and rejuvenating experience talking to our CEO!” “What was the most life-changing insight that you heard in your breakout rooms?” “Oh, my friend I met working here is no longer with us [with an ominous tone, makes it sound like the person died when they just left the company].” “If you were sleeping and you’re now woke, it’s time to do the work! Our company really values social justice!”

Meanwhile, a lot of the other interns are just gobbling up this stuff and I’m here wondering if I’m playing oblivion or Skyrim and interacting with NPCs. Am I an NPC? 

I should mention I am not in an engineering role and working with data and people in finance.

mbgwtu,To all the freshmen on this sub,"Go enjoy your life. Get off this sub. You are valuable, talented individuals and will certainly have a successful career without selling your soul to this endless rat race propagated by so many here.          

  
You don’t need to start learning algorithms and leetcode immediately. You can actually enjoy your first year at college instead. Go make friends, play sports, try out a ton of clubs, pick up an instrument, experience your school’s traditions, **live your life**. There is so much more to your college experience than internships, despite what some on this sub would say.           

This post isn’t attempting to discredit the value an internship can bring to your career prospects. You certainly should try to get one! However, you don’t have to start interview prepping the minute you step on campus. For me, I just enjoyed freshmen year. Sure I applied to a few first year places - totally bombed a Microsoft interview lol - but certainly I never spent more than a few hours total interview prepping and working on my CV that first year. I got an internship 3 weeks before the summer started with a no-name government contractor in my hometown by networking around when I visited home. I originally was just going to study abroad but ya know, COVID. If anything, that internship was a glorified EE internship - pretty much no programming. But it was experience, and valuable experience at that which I didn’t need any leetcode for.            

Starting sophomore year, I took internship hunting a lot more serious. Learned Leetcode, applied to a billion places, etc, and had far better results. However, I did not accomplish those results by spending all my time interview prepping freshmen year. To be blunt, you don’t really need to. I don’t think I could have even learned much leetcode until after I took Data Structures and Algo’s, and I didn’t do that until second semester freshmen year.            

I cannot imagine what my life would be like right now if I had not taken time to enjoy freshmen year to the max I could. I would not have the friends I have right now, I would not have met my gf, I would have lost so many valuable memories and experiences. Freshmen year is special - in my experience, it’s true that the friends you make your first year will be your friends for the rest of your time at college. So please, don’t be a leetcode hobbit who sits in their room all day doing nothing but worrying about internships and their career. Go have fun :) there will be time for this stuff later.            

.          

Edit: a few people have been replying and saying that they think this post is encouraging freshmen to slack off or not care about their careers. I hope I didn't come across that way as that was not my intention. My main point is merely this: **don't feel pressured to spend all of your time interview prepping as a freshmen; instead focus on classes and life.** If you want to interview prep, that is totally cool and good for you! Just don't obsess over it or let people convince you that grinding is absolutely essential for freshmen to have any chance at success.",2021-03-23 15:13:38

I didn't know anything about software development, or frameworks and node and all that stuff and the interviewer asked me **""what's your favorite most exciting technology?""** and I said...... 😭😭 I said..... **""STACKS & QUEUES, I just love the way you can manipulate data and make it come out in different orderings""** I still cringe so bad omg idk why they hired me. it was at a life insurance company
* the second was at Salesforce SWE intern interview. I wrote my code to the problem and the interviewer asked me ""can you **rate** your code?"" I had no idea what he meant by ""rate"" so I said ..... 😭😭 ""I mean on a scale of 1-10 I feel like the style looks nice and readable so I would give it a 9/10,""and he said.. ""I mean time complexity ""  LOL I DID NOT get that position, but I actually did move on to the next round after that . 

anyways just goes to show, regardless where you are at in your journey, just do the best you can with the knowledge that you have and things will hopefully work out.

I don't.. expect to post this to have my ""life"" deconstructed into arguments you can debunk. You can make whatever you want of what I'm about to say, but **please stay respectful.**

It's a \[very\] long post, but I hope it helps bring a new perspective to some. I guess I'll add some TLDR at the bottom for the normal people that won't read the freaking essay-length post I wrote. I got a bit carried away, sorry :v

\*\*\*

I started playing with computers when I was 3 or 4. Apparently, my parents were impressed with how quickly I understood how to get around user interfaces, but it might've just been something that any young kid fiddling around the computer at that age could figure out.

Y'all, you don't know how often I begged my parents for ""magnetix"" construction toys (but got [this](http://www.richardmanvillestudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ELLO_PLAYSET.jpg) instead), hot wheels (but got a barbie RC car), etc. Honorable mention to what my parents gave me when I asked for a skateboard bc [it's fucking hilarious](https://pixl.varagesale.com/http://s3.amazonaws.com/hopshop-image-store-production/28559490/aa7ed5364ab0f3b16be47c60cc8fe9ab.jpg?_ver=large_uploader_thumbnail&w=640&h=640&fit=crop&s=06af8d05bb404641b4c6042e3fb77816).

During my teenage years, I started getting into things like animation with Flash Player (rip Flash) and generally became a lot more knowledgeable than my friends at knowing how computers work, but I learnt that sharing that passion with my female counterparts would often be met with ""meh""s, as opposed to if I'd gotten into makeup art or drawing. For a while, my guy friends actually liked it when I told them about programming ""games"" in excel(!!), but that was until everyone started wanting to date each other, and suddenly my hobbies were seen as ""not feminine"" - wanting to fit in, I eventually just took to keeping these things to myself.

My parents occasionally praised that I was ""really good at computers"", but that was about it. Where I came to get really mad was when my cousin (who was my age) came to stay at our house for the summer, and my parents sent him to science camp while I was sent to art camp (I wasn't asked which I'd prefer).

By the time I was 16 and was looking for a summer job, I knew my way really, really well around computers and really enjoyed this, so when one of my friends told me that his work was looking for someone to work at the computer sales department, I was ecstatic and went to interview. I was asked veery general knowledge questions about computer parts/electronics, and I immediately answered correctly to every single one of them. I was immediately hired on the spot for that position.

Working there, I didn't really understand why people kept asking me ""*honey, how do you know all this stuff about computers?"",* ""*did your dad teach you all of this?*"", and, my favourite, ""*would you mind if I got a second opinion on this from your colleague over there?"".* Said colleague who often shared shifts with me, often came to work high and his knowledge was so limited about all the products and warranties, that his hesitance when he was called over for a ""second opinion"" made me lose a sale more than once. I asked my friend (who got me the job) if he often was asked for ""second opinions"" during a sale, and he looked pretty confused - he told me I must ""sound shy"" when doing a sales speech. I was super passionate about computers, and clients who didn't ""doubt"" me would often tell me that they adored my service.

Oh, yeah, also at that job, still 16, I was sent constant creepy texts about ""my boobs looking hot in my uniform"" by my 29 year old manager. I also found out that he did the same thing to a 15 year old cashier. We were all too scared to call him out, and I don't know what happened to him, but I doubt anyone called him out on it. 

The best part about that job, is that despite me ranking first or second in sales, more than once the ""rumor had it"" that I was only hired because ""a girl hadn't worked there in a while"". Fun fact: out of everyone that worked with me, I'm the only one that pursued studies in CS or anything related, but hell it couldn't be possible that I did well in the interview.

When I was graduating high school and told my dad and stepmom that I wanted to study engineering, my stepmom told me that ""I had too soft of a character for that field"", whatever that meant. That was not the only reason why I didn't go into it, but it certainly didn't help with doubting if I had what it took. So I studied something in humanities instead, and unsurprisingly was miserable and envious of the kids in my college who were studying STEM. During that time, I still worked at my college's computer lab, and of course I was the only girl there. I just got used to the fact that, probably for a big part of my life, I would be the only girl in things related to computers.

I finally started studying in STEM, and was so freaking happy and got the best grades I'd ever gotten. But there were a few things in and outside of class that always left me a bit uncomfortable.

My math professor, who I really liked, during a class about 3D integration, explaining how ""girls in the class would probably not be as good at these, since everyone knew they were not naturally good at spacial awareness"". The irony being that we continue to give girls barbies and boys legoes, and wonder why things like this are said.

My hardware team, in which I was the only girl, joking about making me the ""secretary"" of the team. Eventually, when the captain of said team asked me out and I explained I was gay, he flat out stopped inviting me to the final reunions of the competition, and I didn't get to finalize the prototype. I did attend the competition, only to be extremely awkwarded out because the others thought that I had bailed out on the team in the last minute.

Another CS club (only girl there too), where we went out for drinks and I was the only one who was given a ""BJ shot"" in the table (it's an alcoholic drink that's made to make you look like you're giving... you get the point), paid for by the captain (not the same guy as the hardware club). I felt super awkwarded out by this, but being scared about what had happened in the other club, I just shut up and drank it. A comment was passed about how ""I looked like I knew what I was doing"". The whole night I was constantly asked about my personal sex life with my girlfriend, and the comments got more and more invasive as the night went on.

I got a scholarship and did some research internships at the beginning of my bachelor's. My boss in one of my industrial internships was and is to this date the most supportive guy ever, and he set the standards on what treatment to expect from superiors. It's after working for him that I realized how over the years, my input on things were *not* given the same consideration as my male coworkers. \]

In quite numerous occasions, and this still happens, I will have an idea I just gave ""reexplained"" to me by a male counterpart. If you're a guy: I very much understand you are trying to be nice, and you're not less my friend if you do [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/it-s-man-s-and-woman-s-world/201603/the-psychology-mansplaining), but it does get annoying overtime.

Last year, I started looking for internships for this summer. Did my CV get read quicker because I'm a girl? Maybe. But my CV is so filled with tons of projects, internships, awards and scholarships, that 5 out of the 7 places I applied to (yes, I only applied to 7 places, including 3 FAANG and the rest being pretty much below FAANG), hit me up. (Fun fact: amazon did *not* get back to me!). I am pleased to say I will be an SWE intern for one of the two hardest FAANG's to get into.

I dare you to tell me that I only got in there because I'm there to fill up a statistic.

I end this by saying, I am aware some of the things I got that I sound like I'm complaining about, like the toys, the art camp, not doing the major I should've done right away, I'm still very privileged to have had. I am still extremely grateful to my loving parents, and I don't blame them for anything, I know this is more of a societal problem.

If I sound extremely frustrated despite where I ended up, it's because this journey was f\*king frustrating when it shouldn't have been, simply from the attitude about women in those environments.  And as much as this is a personal story, and I probably went trough a particularly shit time because I got involved in a gazillion CS activities and clubs and jobs, talking with other female friends in my field, we *all* have *multiple* stories like these.

So if you're wondering why a company would need to put in extra measures to try to get women to apply, go read those statistics, think about stories like the one I just told you, and maybe all of that will help you understand why while women's participation in CS was going up in the first 20 years of the field (+1%/year from 1970 to 1985), the number of women crashed dramatically for the next 30 years after that (-0.5% year from 1985 to 2015).

We do not want to be treated ""better"" than men in the field, but we also do not want to be treated worse, and this has been the case until now, which is why you can't get that many women in the field. Nobody is saying that workplaces need to have a sharp 50/50 representation of women, but all we ask for is to be *treated* equally. Until then, companies can maybe try to encourage us a little bit by giving a second glance to our CV.

That was my story. Now, who wants a BJ shot??? :-)

TLDR: considering the *shit* (understatement) I went through because I was a girl interested in compsci among a sea of men, the least companies and colleges can do to make me *stay* in computer science at all is give my resume a second look.

Edit: I did not expect people this many people would respond!!! The amount of positive comments sending love AND the incredibly constructive and healthy conversation that is stemming from this post, gah it makes me so happy y'all don't understand. I don't expect everyone to agree with every word, but even those who are literally just acknowledging the shitty parts without being for AA, this is more than what I could ask for.

Is this normal? I feel like my life has been dominated by code. Is it normal to see everything and anything I do in code? Sometimes when I do something like search my bag I imagine myself as a recursive program and my base case is when I find it :)

r0687c,I feel like a fucking idiot for going through Microsoft final round as an undocumented student,"Hello fellow CS Majors. This is just going to be a vent post because I'm feeling really depressed right now, and I don't really know what else to do. I guess I just want to speak to my CS colleagues anonymously, because I don't feel comfortable saying this in my IRL environment.

&#x200B;

I am ""undocumented"" in the United States by way of visa overstay. Throughout high school and up til now, I was never able to work anywhere that required work authorization (so, basically everywhere). My father still has work authorization through some convoluted process before our visas expires, so he's basically been the sole provider for our family. My mother has a chronic illness and is in need of an organ transplant, which we can't get because of our shitty state provided poverty insurance and we need another to supplement it.

&#x200B;

Anyway, yeah. I did not have the most privileged childhood. Our utilities would get disconnected every now and then. My school had exactly zero STEM opportunities, and I had to learn coding on this atrocious laptop from the late 90s (in the late 2000s). It was bad. There was no way we could afford college, but I grinded in high school, got a perfect ACT, and got a full ride based on merit to a T5 CS school. That was wonderful. A weight off our shoulders.

&#x200B;

However, my parents were getting older by that point. I didn't see how my dad was going to keep working. Every year I would ask about our legal status, and every year he'd say ""you'll get it next year."" I should have responded to his temerity with doubt, but of course as a naive teenager I held out some foolish sense of hope that it would actually come.

&#x200B;

Newsflash, it's now my final year in university and it never did. By all means, I believe I did make the most of what I have. I maintained a 3.9 major GPA. I could not do any internships in my years at college, despite FAANG recruiters reaching out to me, which was quite sad. The only things I could do were unpaid, so I found a research position at my school and grinded away in that like I did in high school. I produced a few papers that were accepted in the likes of AAAI and ICML.

&#x200B;

Then, last summer, a glimmer of hope appeared. DACA had been reinstated! I quickly filed an application with the help of my school's undocumented center (to which I owe a great deal of commendation to, as they guided me through navigating university with my status). It was the first time my family felt hope in a long time.

&#x200B;

I did my biometrics, and everything was looking good. Then, a week later…the ruling on Texas’ challenge to DACA. All applications stopped. Silence. Nothing to say, really. Just silence.

&#x200B;

It was our last hope as our immigration petition filed at the beginning of the last decade will be adjudicated in 2025, far too long, and my father will be far too old by then to work. This was a huge blow. It was such a strange feeling, going back for my fourth and final year of my undergraduate experience, and trying to make the best of it and have fun after the isolation of the pandemic.

&#x200B;

With every party I go to, or every friend I get boba with, this eventuality hangs over my head, like a dark cumulonimbus: I have no viable path after graduation.

&#x200B;

And so, in the thick of recruiting season, I still apply to jobs. Foolishly, of course. I have to indicate that I am not authorized, and that I will need sponsorship. Which is technically the case, except I can't really be sponsored since I'm out of status. Nonetheless, I do it because I don't know what else to do.

&#x200B;

I pass Microsoft's resume screen for their new grad SWE. Then their phone screen. Then they invite me to their final rounds. I grind Leetcode for two weeks straight. In the back of my head, a constant resound: ""Why?"" I know nothing will result from this process. But yet, I do it. Again, foolish hope that \*somehow\* they'll be able to hire me. I know it's not going to end well.

&#x200B;

After many sleep deprived nights grinding Leetcode, I do well in the final round interviews. Maybe more than ""well"", as you'll see in the email I got from the recruiter.

Hello \[me\]

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wanted to follow up with you as I've been able to confirm results from your interviews with us - unfortunately Microsoft will not be moving forward with an offer at this time due to your current out of status status while living in the United States. I realize this final outcome may be disappointing but know that you reached a stage of the campus recruiting process that an extremely small portion of applicants achieve.

&#x200B;

Understandably, we are often asked to provide guidance from interviews, but unfortunately, we are unable to share specific feedback. However, we can tell you that we received exemplary feedback from all your interviewers.

&#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to interview with us. We really appreciate your interest in Microsoft and if that interest continues, we welcome you to re-apply within a year. If you have any questions about next steps with Microsoft otherwise, please reach out to your designated recruiter.

&#x200B;

It was a pleasure hosting you at Microsoft and I hope that you enjoyed your time.

&#x200B;

Best of luck to you moving forward!

I guess it's cool that I basically passed the final round? I guess I did pass the resume screen, phone screen, and final round at one of the most prestigious tech companies in the world. And I knew there was no way I was getting an offer. But still, I feel…empty? Not necessarily sad, or disappointed. Just empty. Knowing that I did do all of that, and it's just this fucking thing that is out of my control. I didn't ask to be brought here before I could form sentences and be subjected to these conditions. But now, I'm dealing with the consequences of it.

&#x200B;

I also looked at PhD programs. Same deal. Research assistantships or Teaching assistantships require work authorization, which is part of the funding for the degree. This was the same answer from all T20 CS PhD programs. The undoc center and I spent a good three days talking to all of them and confirming this.

&#x200B;

I guess it's just that it was abstract before. Like, oh, I \*know\* I can't get a job. But now, it's real. Material. I got through all the rounds, and my status stopped me from going further. I \*see\* I can't get a job.

&#x200B;

My friends have asked me to hang out with them, but I don't feel like being social at all right now. I've told them as much. It feels like all the things I knew were going to be issues from the past few years are coming to a head. Oh well. That bottle of Ciroc in the fridge is tempting.",2021-11-23 05:48:12
nzuv6v,Let's stop talking about Computer Science," It's no longer relevant and really unnecessary. It creates a sort of ""class boundary"" between those in CS and those not in CS.

It also just doesn't make sense. Is programming really in the same caliber as data entry or accounting right now? I wouldn't say so. Additionally lots of people here would be pretty satisfied with a job at Target or Walmart. If you, like me, are specializing in cars, then your dream job is likely a car saleserson or car mechanic or again, racecar driver (vroom vroom).

Part of the beauty of computer science is that it's applicable to just about anything else, what's with all the focus on tech?

jhjuu1,Advice I learned or wish I knew from a college senior,"I'm a college senior and I remember reading this sub for advice years ago early in my degree so I wanted to return the favor. Some background on me: top 50 CS school, 5x internships, 4x FAANG. Below are bits and pieces of advice and things I learned or wish I knew when I was younger plus some thoughts addressing common posts I see frequently on this sub. Hopefully this can help some of you!

Regarding your CS degree

* ""I'm struggling in class. Am I not cut out for CS?"" **Struggling is a sign of learning and growth, not failure**. CS is not easy. Persevering through challenges is not only useful for your degree but for your life after. You don't need to be naturally gifted to do well in CS. I personally bombed my intro classes and it took me \~4 months for things to start clicking. During those four months I just kept re-reading the material and going to my professor's office hours to ask questions. There will be very rare cases where CS doesn't mesh with some but for most, do not give up when things get hard if this is something you truly want to do.
* In addition to the bullet above, you'll always feel like there are people that have to work way less to do well/understand the material and **that's ok**. I see a bunch of threads about how students feel that they have to put in more work than their peers/it seems like everyone else in the class just gets the material while they don't. Many of the people that were ""loudest"" in my intro classes were putting on an act because they were afraid to show weakness and look dumb. Lots of these people either dropped out or are struggling with the rest of us in the upper level classes. Your competition is not your peers but yourself. By comparing your learning and current abilities with your past self, you eliminate a ton of stress from your peers. The way that I look at it is if I am a better programmer today than I was yesterday then I am getting closer to achieving my goals.
* **Be comfortable with looking stupid.** There were times in class where I was afraid of asking a question because it was on something so basic that I thought that I'd look dumb to everyone else. Know what's worse than looking stupid? Going the whole semester never getting that question answered and performing poorly on exams/future classes that required strong understanding of that topic. You are paying a ton of money to attend class so use your money's worth and ask questions until you understand. More often than not, there will be other classmates that have that same exact question but are too afraid to ask it. This will help you in your job as well because the worst engineers are the ones that are unwilling to learn/admit their lack of knowledge.
* **Do not cheat/copy code**. You are paying potentially tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars for an education. I'm not talking about risking getting caught and expelled. When you cheat, you are cheating yourself by not learning the material. Embrace failure and use it to learn because everyone fails at things they are new at and anyone that says otherwise is a liar. If you cheat, yes you may get a higher grade, but you are paying thousands of dollars to end up exactly the same as before you started your degree. A degree/good grades can open doors but it won't get you past the technical interview.
* **Survivorship bias**. ""All my friends/peers are doing so well in class and getting amazing job offers."" Social media and LinkedIn makes it difficult to not compare ourselves to our peers. However, no one posts about the interviews they bombed. No one has a LinkedIn header of ""failed X onsite"". Behind every offer can be a story of countless rejections and failures that aren't apparent because ""hey they got the offer at X company so they must be naturally amazing"". When I got my first internship, I applied to 100+ companies and only heard back from 1 which ended up giving me an offer after only a behavioral interview. There may be a small subset of geniuses who always do well but most people still find success and are just good at hiding their failures.
* **Having strong technical skills and writing lots of code does not make you a better programmer**. Lets say person A is the next Alan Turing; they write brilliant code at 5x the output of their peers. You might think that they can get a job anywhere. Wrong. They might write code so brilliant that no one is able to understand it and it takes a team of 10 people just to maintain and refactor their code for the rest of the company to understand. While writing complex code might make you seem ""smart"", no one wants to be the person to maintain the code after you inevitably move projects/companies. An average coder with great communication skills and coding conventions is capable of being more valuable to companies than genius coders. Don't neglect writing clean/easy to understand code and non-technical skills. Be someone that people want to work with.
* **Everyone's timeline is different**. Don't be discouraged that you haven't gotten your dream internship/job yet. I was originally an engineering major and switched to CS after 3 semesters. I constantly felt behind people my year as I was stuck taking intro classes while they were taking advanced courses and using that knowledge to pass interviews at amazing companies. I almost didn't get a coding job as my first internship. I've had to push off non-academic semesters and go back to school because I couldn't get any internships. Be confident in yourself that you'll end up where you want if you keep trying.
* Learn how to improve from your failures. What usually happens to me is that I think the answer is X when it is actually Y. Then I investigate what thoughts/assumptions caused me to arrive to X as the answer and rewire my thinking/logic for the future. Create your own methods for learning from your mistakes to help you learn.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Regarding internships/jobs/interviewing

* **\*\*\*Apply to that company even if you think there's no chance you'll get it\*\*\*.** Never write yourself off from a company because you think you won't get past the resume screen or you'll bomb the interview. That decision is for them to make not you. Even if you bomb the interview, you now have data on what kinds of questions you can expect if you apply in the future to better prepare. The year I got my first FAANG internship, I was rejected/ghosted from all the other 80+ local and big tech companies (many of which were far less competitive). I was already on Christmas break expecting to go back to classes in a few weeks when I unexpectedly got my only offer. Apply, apply, apply.
* IMO the two most difficult things about interviewing are your resume and communication skills. It can be difficult to objectively critique your resume since you're essentially picking which things you wrote about yourself don't meet the bar. Critiquing your communication during an interview is also difficult because you're focused on answering the question, not seeing if you are communicating well in real time. Get your resume reviewed by a few trusted sources and do some mock interviews to find potential issues with your communication habits.
* **\*\*\*You can do everything perfectly and still not get the job\*\*\***. This is one of the hardest things I've had to come to terms with. I've had many interviews where I thought I nailed every question and got rejected after. I'd spend days after questioning myself and why I didn't receive an offer. Unless there was some glaringly obvious issues in communication or implementation, you probably did just fine. There are so many factors that are out of your control (interviewer was having a bad day, position got filled, your communication style didn't fit the interviewer, etc) that dwelling on the why can be counter-productive. Interviews are flawed by nature so don't spend too much time reading between the lines for things that aren't there. Do you best, reflect if there were big mistakes that you could improve on but move on to the next interview.
* **Getting a job/internship is a numbers game**. Going off the bullet above, you will be interviewed by people you get along with and people you don't. There will always be things you can't control that can prevent you from getting the offer. You'll get questions that you aren't strong with. Just doing more interviews increases your chances of everything aligning for a great interview.
* Learn what leetcode is and use it early (I understand there are large amounts of companies that don't ask leetcode-type questions but most competitive companies do nowadays). Use leetcode to reinforce your understanding of algorithms and the pros/cons of data structure to understand when they are useful. **Do not use leetcode to memorize questions**. Using leetcode to memorize questions for certain companies is IMO a waste of time because the chance you get that question is very small and memorizing often times does not equal understanding. If you have solid understandings of most data structures, coming up with solutions to new questions will be must easier.
* Good interviews are where you work with the interviewer to build a solution. A beginner mistake is to think you have to walk through a whole solution by yourself. Part of the interview is to see how well you communicate with others engineers (the interviewer). I always work with the interviewer during the question. When I'm making a solution I'll usually say ""I'm thinking of doing X because of Y assumptions. Does this sound reasonable to you?"" or ""I can't think of a good solution to X because of Y. Do you have any ideas where we can go from here?"". Your interviewer wants you to succeed and is there to help you and point you in the right direction if you get lost. Don't neglect the interviewer as a source of information since it also shows you're a good communicator.
* If I didn't say this before, you'll get bad interviewers. It happens, move on. Some of the advice above might not always apply because the interviewer is not cooperating or is doing a bad job. Realistically there's not much you can do to salvage this situation so just move on.

&#x200B;

This is most of what I can think of off the top of my head. Hopefully this helps! Feel free to ask other questions and I'll do my best to answer them.

&#x200B;

Edit: I forgot to add that luck plays a big part in getting a job/life in general. I have no side projects and don't think of myself as a genius coder.

13qq1j2,Money is a perfectly valid reason to study CS,"I'll preface this post by saying that I personally do have a genuine passion for my niche field of CS and for technology in general.

However, I've noticed that the comment sections of a lot of the doomer posts are criticizing people who are ""just in it for the money"".

News flash: money is a HUGE reason most people are in this field.

And that's perfectly fine. 

Truth is that this field pays extremely well compared to others, and that's what attracts people to it.  I'm a research scientist in the field and make significantly less than what I could in industry, yet it's still in the mid six figures (well above what researchers make in other fields with my experience level).

You don't need to have a deep passion for microservice architecture design, write ""insightful"" LinkedIn articles, grind leetcode and hackerrank as your favorite hobby, or be like that kid who ""dreams in code"".

Just try to be good at your job, and don't make the job of those around you harder.

17xsqsa,Oversaturation in CS in a nutshell,"A recruiter for a startup I interviewed for told me that they initially had only 100 applicants in their pipeline (me being one of the early ones), but then their job posting somehow made it onto the public Github new grad posting. In just 3 days they said they recieved over 50,000 applications... JUST 3 DAYS.

It fucked me over since she made it clear they had a lot more applicants to consider to now and filter through. so they had me wait another 3 weeks despite having finished the final round with a pretty good performance, until they reached back to me to tell me they hired other developers... 

tldr: I'm hate these fucking Github postings that everyone and their mom has on 24/7 eyewatch since it literally encourages mass applying, more oversaturation and fiercer competition in an already bad market. why do they exist, wtf?? do people not realize how much more RNG they make the process by posting it publically for hundreds of thousands of people?

On paper this is a very good position, however, I can't help but have the urge to completely destroy the company by wiping out our codebase, then the database, then the back-ups of everything etc. I've already tested the response time of my colleagues by pushing a small bug to production, it took an hour for someone else on my team to notice, which is more than enough for me to delete every thing and wipe the back-ups. I've already wrote the BASH script to do the former, which I placed on my desktop. I like starring at the icon for at least an hour or two per day because it's so captivating, the thought that a decades old companies can be destroyed in minutes, hundreds if not thousands of people will lose their jobs, and the stock price will goes to zero all because of me, it excites me, gives me thrills I can never imagine.

13ntff6,"Why FAANG isn't that great, from a former Amazon engineer","There are a lot of CS majors who aspire to work for the FAANG/MAMAA companies the same way some high schoolers aspire to get into Ivy League universities. As a former Amazon engineer who worked on the AWS Virtual Private Cloud service back in 2017-2018, let me explain to you what is wrong with that line of thinking.

The first thing you need to keep in mind about any real job is that work is normally exploitative, and big tech jobs are no exception. They give great starting salaries compared to other junior developer positions, sure, but there's a catch. They lose money on you during your first year working there with no experience with the expectation that they will make that money back from your labor later on when you know what you're doing there. Big tech companies like Amazon and Facebook often use their own, internal, company-specific tools that aren't used at other companies. For example, Facebook created and uses the Hack programming language that nobody else uses (it started as an offshoot of PHP with types added and became its own separate programming language sort of like how C++ started as C with classes and then became its own separate thing). Amazon's core services run on Amazon's unique internal deployment engine called [Apollo, which you can read about here](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2014/11/apollo-amazon-deployment-engine.html) and are built by Amazon's unique internal build system, [Brazil](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1568190805948473344?s=20). Most companies put their applications that run on servers in containers like Docker, deploy/scale their containers with say Kubernetes, and can use the AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) that handles the deployment and scaling of your containerized apps automatically. For building, they may use a common, open source build system like Maven for Java, sbt (Scala Build Tool) for Scala, or whatever build system your programming language normally uses. The problem with only using and mastering tools that are only used by one specific employer like say Facebook or Amazon is that they don't teach you what is commonly used outside of that company, so what you were taught isn't as readily transferable to another employer if you get fired or choose to leave. Essentially, there is some ""employer lock in"". You may look around at the facilities at say Amazon or Google and go ""golly, gee, there's the Super Smash Bros videogame in the lunch room as well as games and free food, wow"", but that stuff isn't just there to make you happy, it's part of the ""employer lock in"" to keep you from leaving. Once you're locked in and are acquainted with their tools and processes and stuff, they're making profit off of you. If you instead worked at a ""regular"" company using ""regular"" commonly used software tools like say (on the backend) the ASP.NET Core framework if you're coding in C# or Spring Boot for Java Spring, you will have skills that you are already deeply familiar with that you can immediately transfer over to another company. At Amazon the backend was in Java which is a common programming language, sure, but they used their own unique custom internal framework called [CORAL framework](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Why-amazon-uses-CORAL-framework-and-not-spring-boot-OPgpbvqu) which I think had some Java Spring in it but was a totally custom thing, not the usual stuff that's used at other companies with Java backends. Also, unlike with common open source frameworks and tools, there are no books on say CORAL Framework or the Hack programming language that you can buy on Amazon and read before bed the way there is for say Java Spring or Docker or whatever (which is an issue for me personally because I learn by reading technical books).

When the money supply shrinks or a recession happens causing layoffs, or your performance isn't great, you can get fired, and when that happens you want to be able to find another job quickly and be useful at that job. Sure, having ""Amazon"" at the top of your resume gets the attention of recruiters from India on LinkedIn, but once you get past that stage you have to actually demonstrate your usefulness to prospective employers on their particular system. I've had prospective employers tell me, as part of their interview/hiring process, ""build a JSON API that can be used to play a simple card game"" or something like that, where the deck of cards is represented as an array of integers. I can't build that HTTP REST API with Amazon's CORAL Framework because that framework doesn't exist outside of Amazon. Instead I have to learn some common, open source framework that is generally used, like maybe Java Spring Boot or Express on Node.js for backend JavaScript. And like if I work for Facebook and I've been exclusively programming in the Hack programming language for 4 years and then all of a sudden I get fired because there's a recession, I can't do the coding interview at other companies in the Hack language, other company's coding test probably doesn't even support it. I have to learn and use something more common that other people and companies know, use, and support. 

So definitely keep that in mind and have a second/backup tech stack and skill set handy with demo projects that use it in case you ever get fired and need to find another employer outside of the FAANG/MAMAA companies. Ultimately a job is just an exchange of your time for money and an employer is just a source of money. Some people embrace the idea of living to work, but really you should be working to live. Before you accept an offer, establish how many hours a week you will be working so you can have a life outside of work. Don't make your employer think that putting in Herculean (like Hercules) effort is the norm, causing you to get burnt out in the long run. First and foremost, watch out for yourself. Amazon is just another company, and they will put their customers, their shareholders, and their leadership/executives before you, their worker.

**Edit 1:** One person commented ""but the big concepts carry over between companies"". And they can, like common object oriented programming language features can transfer over from say Facebook's Hack language to say Python or like the concept of container deployments can transfer over from Amazon's Apollo to Kubernetes. But there's definitely a learning curve and it's not instant, and also in my case I have issues with my brain which made learning new things increasingly difficult over time. If you know what skills/knowledge you need to learn or transfer over ahead of time and put in the work to do it before you get fired it's usually not that bad, but in general I don't like any sort of specific lock-in and in some places lock-in is an intentional feature and not a bug.


**Edit 2:** Also, even though the starting/junior salary at FAANG is higher than at ""normal"" companies, if you never get into leadership, management, or anything upper management or executive, their mid to late career pay isn't that amazing. Yes, you get a pay bump from L4 (junior) to L5 or L6, but then your pay from then on is flat forever. If you used ""standard"" technology and built systems for ""regular"" companies for that duration of time you could be designing/architecting whole systems from scratch at other companies, setting the rates, and getting paid better than what Amazon would be paying you. One guy described it like this ""if the system is a car, at Amazon I was fixing the tailpipe while at this other company I designed, built, and installed the engine"". The same person, after 10 years at Amazon, could still be designing and building tailpipes while at another company they could be designing and building the engine or even the whole architecture of a car from the start. Your job title at a non-FAANG company could be ""enterprise architect"" instead of ""senior developer"" at FAANG. See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13ntff6/why_faang_isnt_that_great_from_a_former_amazon/jl1sunu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

**Edit 3:** Oh, and at Amazon you sometimes get woken up by the pager at 3AM because you're ""on call"" and something bad happened with the system. See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13ntff6/comment/jl3bgar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

**Edit 4:** Also, FAANG jobs are more likely to be in very high cost of living areas. After I left (was forcibly asked to leave) Amazon with less than 2 years of experience in total, I got a job coding for a bank at $86 an hour on W2 in North Carolina where my rent 3-4 blocks from work in the center of town was about $1350 a month. Yes, your pay at say Google is a little higher then where I worked after I left Amazon, but your cost of living in Silicon Valley (and even other locations like New York, Seattle, and Washington DC) is much higher.",2023-05-21 13:13:34

lnmmj0,The internship talk on this sub is the reason why my life has drastically improved,"I think that the internship talk does more good than bad. Before browsing this sub, I didn’t even know internships were a thing really. I didn’t know how to study, I didn’t know how to apply, I didn’t know how important they are for my career, I didn’t know shit. My school never talked much about it because it’s an average state school. Now (100% thanks to the wealth of information in this sub), I’m gonna be interning at FAANG this summer and I literally have the rest of my life set up for me (because of insanely high FAANG salaries). Obviously the future isn’t guaranteed but i’m in a fantastic situation regardless with FAANG on my resume. If internship talk was in a megathread or wasn’t allowed, I would have never been able to do this. 

As a kid from a low income household, I don’t get many opportunities to learn this much valuable information for free. I don’t want future CS Majors to miss out on the opportunity to learn that I got from this subreddit. It might get stale if you’ve been in the sub for a while, but that’s just because there is only so much you can discuss before it can get repetitive.

Whatever happens next doesn’t affect me at all because i’ve already gotten out what I needed to know, but I hope for the sake of future students that internship posts aren’t limited.",2021-02-19 18:19:27

v0ay2x,Tips for a successful internship from a FAANG intern manager,"Having mentored 3 interns who successfully got their return offers, and seen many examples of successful interns at FAANG, here are some tips for your internships which should be useful regardless of company.

1) Do what is expected of you. Firstly in order to do what is expected of you, you gotta know what is expected of you. If you're a SWE intern, most of the time you just need to finish your project by writing high quality code while not being a jerk. To write high quality code, look at how code is written in the code base and follow the conventions, directory structure, naming, use existing abstractions. Break your code into small PRs so that it's easy to review. Nobody likes reviewing PRs which are thousands of lines long. Write tests! At the end of the internship a good litmus test on whether your internship was successful is whether the team would hire you or take their chances with a new intern/fresh grad?

2) Demonstrate independence. Your intern manager/mentor/host is also a busy employee and they have their own work to do. If you run into issues, try to unblock yourself first before asking someone. Look up internal documentation, look at existing parts of the code and see if you can follow similar approaches. If you're still stuck, then ask. Post in support groups/chats and share your high level goal, the approaches you've tried and why they didn't work. This helps people to help you. It's ok to ask more questions at the start but the frequency should go down over time.

3) Take initiative and ownership of your project. Rather than waiting for tasks to be handed to you, look at the roadmap (or create one if it doesn't exist) and keep working on the next item. Break down the project and create tasks for yourself, closing them when completed. Be your own project manager and product manager. Keep a log of the work you've done. This will be super useful if you have to write a self evaluation at the end of your internship.

4) Communicate well. You should be the best advocate of your work. In large companies, peer feedback is taken into account for the internship evaluation. Tell your team what you are doing, make occasional updates about your work, give others visibility into your work and demo your work during sprint meetings.

5) Take feedback seriously. Your mentor should already be providing you feedback constantly, otherwise, you can always ask. Ask how you can improve and what you can do better. Since you'll be spending lots of time writing code, make sure you pay attention to the code review comments you receive and reviewers don't make the same comment twice.

6) Overdeliver on your project. If you're delivering your milestones ahead of time, instead of chilling and sticking to the schedule, finish your project ahead of time. This gives you the opportunity to pursue other things. You can work on stretch goals of your project, think of new ways to improve your project and execute on them. Market your project and get people to use it. Iterate on user feedback.

7) Do what is not expected of you. Of course this doesn't doing mean negative things. Do things which people don't expect interns to be doing. The rockstar interns I've seen, they completed their projects in half the allocated time, had time to help their fellow interns in their work (sometimes even helping full-timers in their work), were added to the team's oncall, helped to review the team's code, and helped to answer questions from external partners about the team's work. Not all of these will be applicable to your situation, but you get the idea. They were functioning and having impact as if they were a full-time team member.

8) Assess the company. As much as an internship is a prolonged interview of your fit for the company, it is also a chance for you to interview the company. Do you enjoy the team's and company's working style? Do they overwork their employees and treat employees with respect? Sometimes interns can be too busy with their projects to pay attention to these things but ultimately these are important factors to take into consideration when deciding whether to sign the return offer. You might not be joining back the same team but the company culture affects the team's culture to some extent.",2022-05-29 13:14:17

n9omhd,Funniest CS intern take home assignment ever,"Ok so I applied for a full-stack developer intern position at some tech startup/consultancy company in Toronto and I got a response to do an assessment and send it back in **48 hours**. I thought ok, wont be too bad maybe like a leetcode thing or a small take home assignment. I open it up the next day and its a giant whiteboard of tasks I have to do. 

I applied for the fullstack internship so I had to do both the front end and backend assessments (WITHIN 48 Hours!). So I took a look at them and the front end assessment was to make a dynamic website with music playing in the background and dynamic cursor and a bevy of other bullshit. OK fine, I look at the backend assessment and it says to make a twitter clone API with user login, unit tests for each endpoint, creating and updating tweets, the whole shabang. And the wording of it was so aggressive too. They tell you to make the APIs for the user login first and they end it with ""These APIS MUST BE PERFECT, DO NOT MOVE ON TO THE REST OF THE ASSESSMENT WITHOUT COMPLETING THIS OR **YOUR ASSESSMENT WILL NOT BE SCORED**!!"" 

So yeah exited out of that assessment real fast. The egos on these toronto startups are legit through the roof holy shit. Like get a grip on reality asking an intern position that youll probably pay 20hr for to do all that shit in 48 hours",2021-05-11 04:18:03
19c8vm8,Got a FAANG offer after 700+ applications!,"Some thoughts and reflections

- you only have to get lucky once - keep applying. The more darts you throw at the board, the more likely you are to hit a bullseye. Cast a broad net, you never know which random opportunities might work out. I ended up getting my offer in a country I’ve never been to.

- Separate the process from your self-worth and eradicate imposter syndrome. Not having an offer yet doesn’t make you underqualified or worse than those who do. Continue enjoying life in the meantime and don’t fall into the trap of grinding and being stressed until you get an offer - don’t fall into the trap of engaging in the vicious cycle of permanently treating your current life as a transition period while you wait for some big change or achievement to all of a sudden make things better. You’ll stay stuck in that rat race mindset and perpetually forget to live in the moment.

- spend hours on your resume. Read tips, check sample resumes, use a good template. This one-page document is the main way you sell yourself. You get far better return on investment when working on improving it vs. doing just about anything else. Make sure an external reader can get a good grasp of what you did through the bullet points and what you achieved by doing these things, without getting bogged down in details. Doesn’t matter how good you are at interviewing if you’re not passing resume screens. Sell yourself, embellish your projects and experience within reason, and don’t feel bad about doing it. Everyone else is, and you’re just operating at a disadvantage if you don’t. Recruiting is an exercise in marketing and you’re the product. Don’t worry about feeling like you bullshitted your way into a job that you’re under-qualified for - most people feel that way and you likely underestimate your ability to quickly pick up relevant skills on the job. 

- practice leetcode. You don’t need to be a god, but just get better than you were before. If your university has a programming challenge or competitive programming course, take it. You’d be surprised at how far you can get just with a firm handling of arrays, hash sets and a decent recognition of patterns from previously solved problems. Try to get to a point where you can solve most easiest in under 5-10 minutes and can tackle most mediums in <30 min. This is especially important for OAs.

- Talk during your technical interviews. Don’t ever sit there trying to figure something out without constantly communicating your active thought process. Interviews are professional yap sessions - painting yourself as a personable communicator gives you a massive leg up even against more technically inclined competitors. When your interviewer gives you direction or hints at an approach, they’re not failing you - work with them and interface with the ideas they’re giving you. By doing so, you show an ability to handle and act on feedback and demonstrate the abilities that are most relevant to the job as an intern or junior engineer.

- I cannot understate this one enough. If you’re in your senior/last year, are struggling to find junior full time roles, and are lucky enough to be in a position where an extra semester is affordable, APPLY TO INTERNSHIPS AS WELL. Make a second resume with a grad date that’s a semester later. Bars are lower for internships, and while a lot of companies cut down on new grad hiring during downturns, internship programs remain their primary way of assessing and recruiting junior engineers. You’ll get to come out of university more qualified, with an extra internship under your belt. Besides, you have your whole life to work full time - don’t be in more of a rush to get started than you need to be. An extra bonus is that you’ll in all likelihood get to then eventually search for new grad gigs in an improved market down the line. This also ties back to my first point - by widening your scope to both internships and full time jobs, you pretty much double your odds of successfully landing an offer. Maximize your odds of getting lucky.  As you increase sample size, getting an offer goes from plausible to probable.",2024-01-21 17:42:09

uutzty,PSA: what should you be doing during your CS degree?,"Hey!

So I spend some time over at /r/cscareerquestions and I've been seeing a lot of resumes for new grads that are basically empty. They just have a projects section which has their homework projects from various classes listed. Its really concerning to see that CS students seem to just go to class and take tests.

So I just wanted to raise some awareness and let you know about all the options you have available to you *while* you are a student, so that you can take advantage of them and graduate with a resume that will get a lot of callbacks. **Once you graduate you will no longer have access to these, so make sure to do it while you are still in school.**

As a student at a university pursuing CS, you can participate in the following:

* **Lab Volunteering**: Most CS labs need student volunteers to do various technical things. Once you get to know your professors, you can ask to volunteer at their lab if you are interested in their research. You can usually turn this into a paid research assistant position very easily since professors always need research assistants.

* **Research Assistantships**: At most schools, if you get to know your professors well, you can get yourself research assistant positions at their lab and work for them. It's usually available to undergraduates and often a paid position, but this will vary from school to school. It's a great opportunity to learn a lot about a specific niche of computer science (depending on what the professors research is in), and a great experience to put down on your resume.


* **Teaching Assistant/Tutoring:** It's usually available to MS students, but some universities allow undergraduates to be TAs as well so you should definitely ask around. You can also get a job as a tutor for specific classes, so look into that for your university. Being a TA or tutor for your beginner CS course from freshman year is a great experience to put down on your resume.

* **Co-Ops**: Most universities should have some Co-Op program for CS students. They are usually overseen by a professor and your engineering/department advisor will have leads. At my school, you would get credits for doing a co-op so instead of doing 2 electives you had the option to do 1 co-op and get 6 credits for it. Definitely do it if offered by your university!

* **Internships**: The majority of internships are available to degree-seeking students exclusively. I don't really need to explain how important internships are. Your university might have a program to match you to internships or might have career fairs where companies come in and directly recruit students into internships. All of the above experience will pad your resume enough to make you desirable for internship recruiters. Someone who's resume only has homework projects will get passed on for someone who has a research experience, was a tutor, or volunteered at a professor's lab.

* **Clubs/Orgs**: Most universities' engineering departments will have chapters of various CS focused orgs (IEEE-CS, ACM, MSDN, etc.). Volunteering at them as an officer can be a great experience, and they often have engineers from various tech firms within their network come in and give talks, and it also serves as an opportunity to network with these companies and get your resume directly passed to their recruiters.

* **Hackathons/Programming Competitions**: The orgs or CS focused clubs mentioned above will usually host programming competitions and hackathons at your school. There usually also are larger state-level competitions with multiple universities participating, depending on your area. You can grab some of your friends and participate in them. Getting top 3 at a hackathon or competition is more impressive on a resume than making the Dean's List.

* **Networking**: This one isn't as corporate as it sounds. Just be friendly with all your classmates and you'll naturally become friends. Make connections with your classmates, co-volunteers, your professors, and advisors too. You're going to make some of your best friends in college, and they will go on to work at great companies too. I can basically skip to the phone interview at any of the companies my friends work at through a referral. I can reach out to my old professors and get referral letters very easily if I decide to pursue a MS or PhD. Don't be a loner, software engineering is a team sport!



So basically, if all you are planning to do during your BS in CS degree is go to class, study, and take exams: it's not worth it and you will have a rough time getting that first new grad job. When you are paying for a degree, you are paying for access to all these things which ensure that when you graduate, you have a lot of collective experience and are a much more desirable candidate than your peers who have whitespace resumes. Most of your internships will also turn into a full-time offer if you perform well, so you can have guaranteed employment upon graduation.

I didn't go a big tech school, just a public school in Florida where FAANG didn't even recruit from directly. I worked part time throughout college as a math tutor and then a tutor for the intro CS courses. I was vice-president of our local IEEE-CS chapter and organized a lot of events and workshops for all the members. I participated in most of the hackathons and programming competitions my school had and even did a statewide competition. In my sophomore year, I started volunteering at one of my professor's lab which did AI research, and eventually got hired as a research assistant junior year. Through my engineering advisor and another professor who I knew, I joined a co-op program where I built software for a local company. Through the career fair on campus I secured an internship, and received a return offer afterwards. I graduated with a 3.4 GPA but that didn't matter.

I'm not saying you have to go and do all of these, but you should try to do 1 or 2 of them just to learn more and for the fact that it will make your life easier.

I hope all this information will inspire to do things other than going to class and taking tests, and lead to me seeing more impressive new grad resume's on the resume review threads!",2022-05-21 19:19:52

1803yqm,I got an offer! What I learned..,"I did it fam.

I got a full-time offer for when I graduate.

Job details: Data Scientist, 120k, MCOL
 
School: no name state school, not even a top school for cs in my state, state is ranked poorly for education, 3.5 GPA

For those who are still planning for graduation, I've written this with you in mind so that you can find some value in it.

I believe the first step that seeded my current momentum, was a senior project I worked on this Spring. It was a group project. Since I had no professional experience, I wanted to get my group to adopt a project that would look good to potential employers. I was fascinated with ChatGPT at the time, and it is a technology that many businesses are curious about right now, so I came up with an app idea we could build that utilized it, and sold my team on the idea.

From there I lead the project and although I found my team unmotivated to really excel in the project, I went above and beyond and really turned it into something substantial. And because of how involved I was in it from every angle, I had a lot to talk about to potential employers. 

Enter my school's very modest career fair. I put the senior project on the top of my resume and made it a talking point at almost every single employer table I went to. One company had a recruiter who thought the project was interesting and knew a business unit who was exploring how to use the technology. This is what secured me my summer internship.

At my summer internship, I had one goal, by the time I was done at the end of the summer, I wanted to have created something that would have management saying, “Wow. We really need to hire this guy.” Knowing I was skilled in making apps using OpenAI's suite of products, they gave me a really great summer project that I was able to play my strengths into and really excel in. I made sure to move fast and just do whatever I could to get as much results as I could in as quickly of a manner as I could during my 40 hours a week. By the end of the internship I had accomplished my goal. They wanted to extend my internship.

Fast forward a few months later and you might think that this is where my internship offers me full-time and the story ends, but that's not quite what happens. 

Time was dragging on and I still hadn't received an offer from my current company. They say they want me, but they're dragging their feet on the process. Unfortunately, I can't take that at face value. Things happen. So I had to continue searching for jobs. 

Enter my brilliant idea. My school's career fairs aren't that great, but I have a college with an awesome CS program just a couple hours away. I wonder if I can go to their career fair? I bet they have great companies that recruit from there. So I found out who organizes it and emailed them, and they said I'm more than welcome to attend! 

I arrived and did my usual networking with my new internship experience, and one company who is in a similar industry as my current employer ended up being impressed with my experience and resourcefulness in going out of my way to find opportunities, and invited me to interview for a competitive graduate program. 

I went a few weeks later to this interview and unfortunately, I was not selected…. but while I was there, I really connected with one of the interviewers, a lead data scientist who has himself been fascinated with ChatGPT and the possibilities of generative AI. We had some great conversations about my experience and the possibilities on that frontier for their business. 

A couple weeks later, an internal recruiter for the company reached out to me saying, they wanted to hire me directly as a data scientist, working under the lead data scientist whom I had connected with over shared interests just a few weeks earlier… and the rest is history.

I'm still waiting to see if my current company gives me an offer, but I honestly don't think it will be as competitive as the one I just got, plus I now have a great chip in negotiation if they do give me an offer.

In summary, here are the main things that I believe contributed to this outcome, and that you can use to your advantage as well: 

1. Learn an in demand and relevant technology 

2. Build a substantial project using it

3. Make it a talking point in your resume in lieu of experience

4. Go to your school's and other (better) schools’ career fairs. Drive a few hours if you have to. Talk to as many employers as humanly possible.

5. Get at least one internship and make it your goal to impress. Your goal in an internship should be to secure a return offer.

6. While waiting for a return offer, or if you don't get one, use the internship experience as a stepping stone to other opportunities with companies in a similar industry.

7. Be able to charm recruiters and decision makers (soft skills)

So yeah that's pretty much it. I didn't even bother to mention the hundreds of applications I sent in online, because truth is, they delivered 0 results for me. Everything that worked for me involved being face to face with people, with my boots on the ground.

Anyways, thats it for the long ass post. I just wanted to share with you guys that new grads are getting hired, that you can do it too, and to convey what worked for me, so that it could help some of you too. I don't consider myself particularly smart, and I definitely don't go to an amazing school, so it definitely is possible. I did it, so you can too!

Much love everyone ❤️",2023-11-21 00:36:13
1adyj17,"I finally found out how students get straight A's, have GFs and have a social life while STILL having time to become jacked","Am kind of mad that I only realized this at the end of my Uni careerSo as a fellow biomedical engineering student I always wondered how these guys (I usually call them Sam) find the time to hit the gym. I always thought that it takes a million hours out of the day.Turns out that you can actually build muscle without spending a million hours in the gym and turns out that I was studying ineffectively so I wasted so much time studying.

This was until I realized a few things. I literally became an honors student while only studying like 10 hours for each subject the whole semester(other than HW) after realizing them

The first thing is that the gym doesnt have to take a lot of time. 3x per week each 45 minutes working out can build you a decent physique. and if you still think thats a lot of time, check your screen time.

I even made something ive never seen in the fitness space before which is a huge mind map that has everything you need to know about the gym and has all the basic ideas of the gym. If anyone wants it they can comment or just send me a message

The second thing isactually focus when studying. Dont just look AT the slides. Actually think about them. Think about how each idea relates to the previous one. Be active.Most people dont do this because it is hard and takes a lot of effort, but if you do it, youre gonna save yourself so much time and get yourself so many marks  
 

edit

I made a video explaining the mindmap  
the mindmap is here i cant reply to all of u guys : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d6AznQfD2c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d6AznQfD2c)

qgk2s8,To Answer This Sub’s Most Commonly Asked Questions,"No, your internship or job offer mostly likely will NOT be rescinded if you fail a test (or even a class). 

No, doing grad school won’t *significantly* increase your starting salary, especially in terms of opportunity cost. Do grad school if you’re genuinely interested, and can afford it (if it’s a non-thesis based masters), OR you want to do a niche field (machine learning etc). 

Yes, this sub is not representative of most CS majors. 

Yes, this sub is biased towards Big N. 

Yes, school name matters, but you can still get an internship / job offer at the big N from a non target school. Work hard and you’ll be fine. 

Yes, your data engineering, business intelligence, data science or related internships can help with future software engineering opportunities. 

Yes, GPA matters for *some* companies (usually banks, HFTs, defense / anything government.) Leave it off your resume if it’s below 3.5; most big tech companies won’t ask for it or your transcripts. 

Yes, you can still get a SWE / SDE internship as a math, physics, or engineering major. 

No, double majoring is almost always NOT worth it. 

No, you don’t have to do SDE / SWE full time if you hate coding. Other high paying tech jobs you can get with a CS degree include: product management, DevOps/Cloud/SRE, and sales engineering. 

Yes, Amazon is still a FAANG company. 

No, you weren’t rejected because Amazon didn’t respond to you immediately after you submitted your internship application. 

No, you weren’t rejected because Microsoft didn’t respond to you immediately after you submitted your internship application. 

No, not getting a response after a day is not ghosting. 

Yes, alert your recruiter of competing offers.

1bs5xjw,"Y'all who are unemployed after graduating, build a startup","First of all, very sorry this happened to you and yes the job market is terrible.

But if you've been unemployed for 8 months, and only have a bunch of dummy to do list projects, I would advise you to change course. No employeer cares about tiny pet projects. They're too easy to make, they never know if you just copied them, and it's questionable how much you really learned.

If you're really into this career, just pick a problem to solve, pick a modern technology, and start building. With cloud services, you can have an actual revenue generating Saas in a couple months. You will learn a lot, things that you would also learn on the job. It makes you stand out and is a great talking point in interviews. But, it must be a published project running in production. With users.

On the side, also apply for jobs. But this way, you won't be wasting your time as much. You'll be learning stuff + maybe even making some money.

Edit: just to summarize why this works:
1) You will fill your knowledge gaps from uni and learn a ton
2) You can claim to be the founder of XYZ and look more appealing than 8 months unemployed 
3) You show initiative, self reliance and passion for your craft
4) You'll gain confidence, as you know you can build stuff yourself
5) Interviews will go better as this is great to talk about, and you can show your passion when taking about it.",2024-03-31 08:56:42

p6am7a,Here are 5 Things You Should Do After Your Internship Is Over,"Congratulations, you secured your summer internship, spent 10/12 weeks working on a team, potentially did a presentation and now its over. You might be asking yourself, what do I do now? 



No need to worry. Here are 5 tips for things you should be doing post internship.

&nbsp;

**Tip 1.** Add your team and fellow interns on LinkedIn


&nbsp;

This is the single most important thing you can do for your career. Why is this so you might ask. Well did you know that by getting referred you are 4x more likely to be hired? How do you get referrals? By having a strong network and there are no better people to add to your network than those that have worked with you.

This is especially true for those that may not have received a return offer. If you are in this category, leveraging your network can lead to a direct referral to your next role.


&nbsp;

**Tip 2.** Ask for recommendation on LinkedIn

&nbsp;

Have a colleague that enjoyed working with you? Ask them for a [recommendation](https://lisamariediasdesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/13-1280x720.png) on your LinkedIn! If they give you one, be sure to return the favor and give them one  as well.


&nbsp;

**Tip 3.** Write down the specific things that you did during your internship.

&nbsp;

Really this should be done during your internship pretty much right after you complete something. If you didnt do so, its ok you can do it now. By writing down what you specifically did, you will have no issues when adding your internship experience to your resume. 


&nbsp;


**Tip 4.** Send thank you emails to the people that helped you

&nbsp;

Leave a positive and lasting impression on those that helped you before and during your internship. From the recruiter that contacted, to your manager, mentor, and VP if you had one. Writing a simple email letting them know of your experience and how thankful you are may be what helps you get a return offer.

If you want to take it over the top, you can write a thank you note and leave it on their desk (if you are not remote).


&nbsp;


**Tip 5.** Ask for feedback and next steps

&nbsp;

When your internship is over be sure to ask for feedback from those who worked closest to you which could include your manager, mentor, or fellow devs. This is another one of those tips that you can periodically do during your internship, but if you did not get a chance the end is good too.


When asking for feedback you can ask some or all of the following?

- Did I meet or not meet the expectations for the role? How could I have met them?
- If I were to come back to the team, what next steps would I take to get to the next level?
- What things can I improve on?
- What things did you like and should continue doing?

&nbsp;

There you have it, 5 things you should do after finishing your internship. Feel free to message me if you have any questions!

rp4bkw,How to Leetcode? My 2 cents.,"Who is this for? CS students with a good grasp of basic DS & A but find leetcode terrifying or difficult.

**What's the target?** The goal is not to master all the hardest problems, rather to accurately code for medium-level (sometimes popular hards) questions in 20 mins + 5 mins explaining. Code should be easy to read, explain and debug.

**Language:** I would recommend choosing Python along with one of C++/Java. Debugging, explaining, coding are much faster in Python. That means you will learn much faster. Sometimes Python is not available so you can fall back to C++/Java

**When to start leetcode:** Starting leetcode without any background in DSA is like jumping into a wall of frustration. I would recommend you at minimum get a grasp of the following :

Array: Searching, Sorting

LinkedList, Ordered and Unordered Sets and Trees: Traversal, Add, Remove

Trees: BST, DFS, BFS,

Graph: BFS, DFS, Shortest Path

**How to build intuition? :** Tbh it's hard to have intuition at the start, so one thing you could do after reading the problem is to fix the data structure and then think about algo. It doesn't work always but it's a good approach without any experience.

**How to prepare? :** My recommendation is to prepare in 2 alternating sessions, let's call them depth and breadth sessions.

1. **Depth sessions** focus on areas you are already familiar with (new problems from known topics). It will be timed to 1 hour and within that hour you will have to code, debug and explain your thought process aloud for all the problems you have assigned yourself. Don't see hints or solutions within this period.
2. **Breadth Sessions** just pick a random problem (preferable medium and hard from an unfamiliar topic) and think about it deeply. The challenge is not the coding but the thought process. Give yourself a lot of time, if you think you are stuck unlock a hint or the expected time complexity. Then try again.

I used to do 1 breadth session daily. I started with 2 meds in 75 mins, then went to 1 med 1 hard, and now I can pull off 2 hards in an hour. Pace yourself as you find suitable. I used to competitively do depth sessions with a friend. Remember to keep 5 mins to explain the thought process aloud as if you are in the interview.

For breadth read the problem and take your time, I usually gave myself 1 day to solve it.

**Filling the gaps:** let's assume you have made good progress and can solve most problems but there are a few rare ones that you haven't seen and might trick you. Now go through the first 400 LC, that you have not solved already.

It took me about 2 months to reach this stage.

**Revising Before Interviews:** Do LC tagged questions for that company.

**How to conduct yourself in an interview:**

Initially explain a few lines on what you want to do.

While coding explain each block of code as you type. Don't go into details but give a high-level idea, so the interviewer can understand your intentions.

Once your code is completed immediately test it (dry run or use compiler) before the interviewer intervenes. If errors come after he/she takes over it counts as a negative. Find errors on your own.

Once the interviewer is satisfied with the solution, go ahead and state its time and space complexity.

This approach worked for me pretty well and I hardly ever miss an OA or interview question. Hope this approach works for you too.

**Update:** A lot of the comments say that what I am describing is too difficult to attain or impossible. Well to be frank this is my third shot at interview prep. I had done the same stuff in my junior, final year, and now doing it again as a master's student.

Further, I come from an education system where solving questions is 100% of what matters in getting a job, apart from your university. Resumes, projects, etc matter very little. So leetcode is not an option it's all you do.",2021-12-26 19:47:50
t8x0m0,"I'm graduating in two weeks, it has not hit me yet.","Time flew by so fast, it's crazy. For everyone doubting themselves if they are capable of studying cs, you can do it.

17pkr7r,I just realized applying without LeetCode is pointless,"Okay for context, I have about 50 “easy” leetcode problems, but I’ll be honest, I had to look up the answer for 80% of those.

melqp4,Tesla Job Interview,"You’re never gonna have another interview like it.
Last semester I applied for a software internship working on Tesla’s autopilot programs. There’s so much mystique around Tesla these days. Around Elon Musk. And let me tell you, he doesn’t have time for any of that in person. He’s a busy man, and an important one.

The competition for one of his internships is one of the toughest in today’s job market, and that’s saying something. I was doing technical interviews over the phone for weeks. One day, an interviewer called in the morning and grilled me for so long that I just straight up skipped one of my classes!

Sacrifices. Elon appreciates those.

At long last I made it to the final round. It’s true what they say-- he interviews everybody who will ever work for him. They flew me out to the Fremont factory in California, and my hands started shaking as soon as I stepped into the building.

I was led into a conference room. And there he was. Elon Musk, in the flesh.

We exchanged pleasantries. Our tone was light, but Elon’s eyes never left mine. I could tell what he was doing. He was sizing me up. Testing the waters. Seeing if I would crack under the pressure.

Ever so slowly, we meandered closer to actual interview territory. “So your resume mentions app development. Tell me about that.”

I had to stop a smile from breaking out onto my face. Oh, wow, Elon Musk read my resume!

“So I, uh, had to spend a little time getting used to Swift, but--”

Elon cut me off. “You an iOS fan?”

“Yes. Yes, sir.”

“Here. Gimme a sec.” Elon disappeared from the conference room.

I let out a shaky breath and collapsed into my chair. Was I doing great? Poorly? Incredibly poorly? I’d heard the stories. Engineers fired after screaming rages, careers snuffed out in seconds. Oh, god, he wasn’t coming back with security, was he? He was only gone for a couple of minutes, but it felt like hours.

The door crashed open. I sat back up, ramrod straight. Here came Elon, and there was something in his hands. It was a jet-black container, shiny and spherical. Except that it wasn’t a sphere, exactly. There was a dent near the top, and it flared inwards towards the bottom. What did that remind me of...?

Elon unscrewed the top and gently tapped some of the container’s contents onto the table. A whitish dust spilled out. He took his credit card out of his wallet and started chopping the pile into lines.

My eyes bugged out of my head. Elon glanced up.

“Oh, no, don’t worry, it’s not coke. Take a look! You don’t have to worry.”

He slid the open container over to me and got back to his work. I picked it up. The stuff inside was a light gray, so he was right. It probably wasn’t coke. But what the hell was it?

I heard a guttural snort, and I almost dropped the container before setting it down. Elon reared up from his desk with fire in his eyes. “Woah! Still kicks.”

He had a rolled-up dollar bill in one hand, and he shoved it into my face. “Your turn.”

“Hang on. What...what’s happening? What is this?”

Elon looked at me like I was an idiot. “What do you think it is? Guess. I went and got this because you mentioned iOS. I want you to guess.”

Then it hit me. That container. It wasn’t just a sphere, and it wasn’t just an apple.

It was an apple-shaped urn.

“Oh my God, are you snorting Steve Jobs’ ashes?”
Elon did another line and clapped his hands. “Fantastic, man! Not a lot of people even know he was cremated. I knew I had a good feeling about you.”

This was a prank. It had to be. This all had to be one big, bizarre test, so I figured I would play along. “Security wasn’t that tight around his grave, huh?”

“Nope,” said Elon, too calmly. “Security at Alta Mesa’s a joke. Couple of months ago I just stayed until midnight, dug them out myself.”

Elon dipped a finger into the jar and rubbed his gums. “You know I met him once? Steve. He was such an asshole. He hated me. My companies. Well, look who’s laughing now.” He smiled at me, then coughed. A grey, powdery cloud billowed into the air. I tried not to breathe.

“Steve’s grave was unmarked,” he continued. “But that wasn’t a problem. I could smell him.”

Elon’s eyes started to unfocus. “I could smell the animus that drove his soul. The energy. And, soon, it will be mine.”

Nobody spoke for a while.

“It will all be mine,” whispered Elon, and it was like I wasn’t even in the room.

He blinked. “Anyways. You want a hit?”

For the first time in what felt like forever I felt like I was allowed to speak. “...No, man, I’m good.”

There’s no way I can do this. I fought back the urge to gag. That’s a human being floating in the air right now. There have to be laws against that kind of thing, right? And even if there weren’t, this feels so deeply, deeply wrong. I might have to talk to the authorities after this. After all, I still have my character, my convictions--

“Listen.” Elon clapped a hand on my shoulder. “One little bump, and you’re walking out that door with a job.”

Anyways, I start next quarter.",2021-03-27 20:18:05
178utt3,These interviews are impossible,"Nailed the OA, nailed the Hackerrank, nailed the Leetcode questions, nailed the behavior interview, 400.000% GPA, 16 previous internships, and I still didn't get the job because of a small issue like me having killed the interviewer's entire family.

1bmppsk,[Rant] Meta just revoked my offer,"tldr: Meta doesn't like applicants who have less than a certain number of months of work authorization but don't check this until the very end of the process.

So since late January, I have been interviewing with Meta for an IC3 position (university grad). Every interview went super well and I vibed with the interviewers. About a week after my final interview, I was told that the hiring committee liked my packet and wanted to move me on to team matching. Over two weeks went by talking to different teams and finally landing on one I really liked at a location I preferred. After this the recruiter called me to discuss and finalize numbers and we went over perks etc and he gave me a verbal offer. I was told that an official offer letter would be available on the portal by the next day. Mind you I was laid off not too long ago a few months into my first job so I was super happy about this and celebrated with my friends and family. 

Unfotunately though, my recruiter randomly sent me an email the next day saying they ""couldn't move forward with my candidacy"" and the job info disappeared from my career portal. After a long week of ghosting me, my recruiter finally sent an email explaining that HR didn't approve my offer because I had less than 24 months of work authorization left (I had 22) and they had policy of only hiring people who have at least 24 months of work authorization remaining. 

Now look, I don't mind companies having whatever arbitrary policies they want to have with regards to hiring, but couldn't they have checked this before making me go through 4 rounds of interviews?? I submitted the work authorization form before my phone screen so they definitely knew this before they interviewed me. Nothing about my work authorization status had changed since before the phone screen. Going through the whole process only to let me down like this at the end left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. I hate this line of work and I hate this life. 

The only two positives to come out of the situation are: I know I am good enough to get past meta's interviews, and the HM of the team that wanted to hire me was really interested in me and sent me a linkedin connection request so I guess I was able to extend my network a bit.

But yeah I feel completely heartbroken and dejected. Nothing beats you down quite like having an offer taken from you. I hope this post remains searchable so that people who are currently or in the future doing loops with meta can look this up since Meta does not publicly mention about this policy anywhere.",2024-03-24 17:07:31
r6p1an,"""If you've seen a question before, be honest and let the interviewer know!"" Okay Meta","This was written in the email to schedule my final round of interviews at Meta.

Who in their right mind would gamble on a completely new problem when they're given one that they already know the optimal solution to?

The fact that they tell this to candidates demonstrates a complete disconnect between what they think the interview preparation process is like, and the reality of what it actually is.",2021-12-01 20:59:21

19am9q4,Got my dream offer from Meta!,"2024 New Grad. This is my first post but thought I'd share some of my experiences. There was this one team at Meta that I really wanted to join, and they had been hiring since May of last year. At the time they only hired experienced candidates. But since their tech stack felt very similar to the one I worked on during my internship, I thought I'd give it a try. I applied in May and as expected, was ghosted.

Then came the fall recruiting season and I wasn't about to give up. I reached out to an EM at Meta that I had previous connection with and asked her for a referral to these roles. She gave me the referral, but again I was rejected three days later, this time by an actual recruiter.

When the Meta New Grad posting came out in November, I thought I'd give it one last try. I wasn't expecting much because like everyone else, I was cold-applying to a bunch of other places and didn't have much luck with getting interviews. Especially being from out of the country, I really thought I didn't have a chance. Surprisingly, the next day after I applied I got a recruiter reach out. I followed through the process, one OA and one VO, and was told right after the holidays that I got into team matching.

Initially I was sent several teams, but none of them was the team I was hoping to join. Thinking that if I've come this far, I might as well give it another try, I reached out to the manager of that team directly on LinkedIn, and to my delight he quickly responded and said they were indeed looking to hire E3's! So we had a quick conversation and I was extended an offer yesterday to join this team.

I feel so happy right now because it's like a dream coming true, but I know that so much of what contributed to this good outcome was luck. I guess I wanted to share that if you know what you want and have a clear goal, you just need to keep pushing for it and have faith in yourself, and if you do luck will be in your favor!

That's it! Happy Friday to everyone and I'm happy to answer any questions as well for those of you who might be in the same process with Meta!",2024-01-19 15:56:40

I GET IT. CS IS DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW. MAYBE YOU GUYS WANT TO VENT ON HERE AND BE HEARD (I KNOW THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW!) BUT FOR FUCKS SAKE. PLEASE LOOK AT THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE.

RETAIL ABSOLUTELY FUCKING BLOWS. YOU LIKE BEING MICROMANAGED CONSTANTLY WITH SHIT PAY AND SHITTY/NON-EXISTENT BENEFITS? OH AND DONT FORGET BEING STUCK AT THE STORE PAST 10/11PM, SOMETIMES EVEN MIDNIGHT FOR THE MAJORITY OF YOUR SHIFTS. PLUS YOU GET TO DEAL WITH CUSTOMERS SO ABSOLUTELY BRAINDEAD YOU'LL WONDER IF THEIR PARENTS WERE RELATED. ALL WHILE MANAGEMENT DESPERATELY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE YOU TO DRINK THE KOOL-AID WITH REMARKS LIKE:  ""YOU COULD START A CAREER HERE! DON'T YOU WANT TO MOVE UP?""

I DONT KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I LOVE ANSWERING THE SAME FIVE QUESTIONS MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY 9 HOURS A DAY! (YES, I AM BEING SARCASTIC!)

RESTAURANTS/HOSPITALITY IS MORE OF THE SAME, EXCEPT ALL YOUR COWORKERS AND MANAGERS ARE DOING LINES OF COKE IN THE BATHROOM OR ARE ADDICTED TO ADDERALL. AND YOUR PAY IS EVEN MORE VARIED AND UNRELIABLE. DON'T FORGET NON-EXISTENT LUNCH BREAKS AND EVEN WORSE HOURS!

SUPERMARKETS ARE THE SAME AS RETAIL, EXCEPT THE PAY IS EVEN WORSE, THE HOURS ARE EVEN LONGER, AND YOU GET THE ADDED BENEFIT OF POSSIBLY INJURING YOURSELF WHEN LOADING BOXES OFF THE DELIVERY TRUCK. YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW LITTLE WORKER'S COMP COVERS. FUN!

AND DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON WAREHOUSE JOBS.

MY POINT IS, DESPITE ALL THE HARDSHIP, TECH IS STILL A LUXURY COMPARED TO THESE SHITHOLES. MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY CS IN THE FIRST PLACE. REALIZE AND APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT MANY DO NOT HAVE THE TIME, MONEY, WILL, OR PATIENCE TO PERSEVERE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE SO FAR. OR DONT.  IF YOU TRULY HATE EVERYTHING CS RELATED, THIS MESSAGE MIGHT NOT RESONATE WITH YOU. TRY TO LOVE THE CRAFT. EARNESTLY TRY.

I RECENTLY BEGAN READING AN OPERATING SYSTEMS TEXTBOOK TO PREPARE FOR MY OS CLASS IN THE FALL, AND ONE OF THE QUOTES THE AUTHOR INCLUDED RESONATED WITH ME:

""EDUCATION IS NOT THE FILLING OF A PAIL, BUT THE LIGHTING OF A FIRE""

LET YOUR EDUCATION IN CS LIGHT A FIRE INSIDE YOU. LET YOURSELF BE IN AWE AT WHAT OUR MACHINES ARE CAPABLE OF TODAY, AND THE CRAFTY SOLUTIONS PEOPLE LIGHT YEARS SMARTER THAN YOU OR I CAME UP WITH AS AN ANSWER TO THE PROBLEMS THEY FACED. I PROMISE IT WILL MAKE THINGS MUCH MORE BEARABLE.

xxj3xg,I'm a intern and got put on pip,"Can you believe these bitches? I'm 4 months into my 8 month internship. My manager scheduled a 1 on 1 today along with my team lead. Recently they had performance reviews as I got a email that I should do my self-review and my manager reviewed me. I asked for 1 on 1's in my self review since he never did that with me to ask how it's going. I thought the 1 on 1 he scheduled was him listening to my written feedback. Instead during the meeting he hits me with ""you are on a performance improvement plan and every two weeks we are going to have this meeting to see how you improve"". So far I got hard bugs I couldn't solve myself. My last story was a feature that went all the way from the database, creating a table, updating the ORM model through these series of undocumented steps, making a endpoint in the backend using this obscure way for post requests, where you don't even make the post endpoint, you add a indirection function for the new model, all the way to the monster Angular frontend with a thousand components. Just finding the component I needed to change was a doozy. It took 3 weeks and I asked my team lead for help a lot, couldn't have done it without him.

In the meeting my manager says he doesn't expect less from me than anyone else. I'm an intern bro. You gave me shitty bugs and a hard story without introducing me to the big parts of the system properly so of course I'm gonna be slow. But I'm confident in my abilities and pick up things fast, in a month I'll be shredding stories. Only thing holding me back is my knowledge of the codebase because I had a non existent onboarding.

qml2co,"Two years ago, I graduated college with one no-name internship that paid me $11/hour. Now I make 6 figures","Back when I was in undergrad, I used to read posts on here and CSCQ, and I would literally cry because it felt like I was never going to measure up and be successful. I have an older brother that makes $500k as a tech lead at a FAANG company, and that just made it worse. I felt like I would never be good enough. 

I wanted to tell my story to give some hope to the average students.

The only internship I had in college was with some tiny little no-name company, and it only paid me $11/hour. Some of my friends were making $30/hour and I was embarrassed. But I put my head down, worked hard, and learned as much as I could. The job search had been brutal, and even though some of my friends were choosing between Amazon and Apple, I considered myself lucky to have gotten anything at all. 

When I graduated in December 2019, I had a $70k job lined up in a LCOL city. Not a well-known company and the pay wasn’t particularly good, but again I was grateful to have anything at all. I wasn’t good at leetcode, but my strategy was just to take interview after interview until I finally passed one. And in the process, I did get better at leetcode. Not a lot better. Leetcode sucks.

Unfortunately, the covid shit hit the fan within a few months, and I lost the job in April 2020. No one was hiring at the time and I was in a complete panic, so I tried one of the only industries that wasn’t affected by the pandemic: defense. I signed a new offer within 2 weeks of getting laid off. Everyone always told me defense was a shitty, low-paying industry to get into. But I didn’t care, and I had a great experience working there. I made $73k in a LCOL area, management was very supportive, and I gained a lot of confidence working there. 

After a year of working in defense, I got a bug in my brain that I could be making more money, so I put a few resumes out and ended up signing an offer for $100k cash plus stock incentive (about $120k total including my 401k match). I never EVER would’ve thought I’d be making this much money. I wish I could go back in time and give my 2017/2018 self a hug. 

I get that $120k with 2 years of experience isn’t a ton of money to some people, but it’s more money than I literally ever expected to make. I’m over the moon. I may not work for a FAANG, but I have a great job and a great life.

I still do struggle with imposter syndrome and I think it’s at least partially because of subreddits like this one. My manager just told me last week that I should expect a positive year end review, and I was so relieved that I almost cried. I think part of me is still waiting for someone to figure out that I’m just some average Joe who made $11/hour at their college internship, and I don’t really deserve this job after all. 

Anyway, sorry if this was rambling. I just wanted to tell you all that FAANG isn’t the answer for everyone, that your college internships don’t seal your fate forever, and there’s a ton of living that comes after college. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself.",2021-11-04 13:52:51

&#x200B;

So yeah, deciding between a 200k Bay Area offer and a 150k Austin offer is not as straightforward as you might think.

Atlanta is possibly the worst possible city to be in because its rent is relatively high and no companies pay anywhere near 170k. Seattle seems to be the best bang for buck relative to the jobs available. If you just look at CoL and low taxes, texan cities are unbeatable, but you might be hard pressed to find a 155k TC job in Texas.

Also, assumption 4 is probably very inaccurate as food/grocery/utility prices scale with CoL. Sales tax is also high in Bay Area. So, TC for Bay Area probably needs to be higher to be equivalent to the other TCs.

NYC is unsurprisingly crazy expensive.

Instead of TC or GTFO, I propose DI (disposable income) or GTFO as the new standard.

15ndv2z,From Code to Desolation: How Majoring in Computer Science Left Me With Nothing But Regret,"Hey fellow CS majors,

I've been wanting to share my story for a while now, hoping that it might resonate with some of you who are struggling or on the fence about majoring in computer science. Let me tell you, my journey through this major has been an emotional roller coaster that has left me with nothing but regret.

First off, let me clarify that I was truly passionate about technology and coding when I started. I had this grand vision of becoming a software engineer, working on cutting-edge projects, and changing the world. The promise of high-paying jobs and endless opportunities drew me in like a moth to a flame. But little did I know that reality would hit me like a ton of bricks.

The workload, oh my god, the workload. I thought I was prepared for it, but nothing could have prepared me for the endless nights of debugging, the constant stress of meeting deadlines, and the feeling of inadequacy that seemed to hang over me like a dark cloud. It seemed like every week brought a new programming language to learn, a new framework to master, and a new project that felt impossible to complete.

And the competition – don't even get me started on that. It felt like I was constantly surrounded by geniuses who had been coding since they were in diapers. Every time I entered a coding competition or attended a hackathon, I was reminded of how far behind I was. The imposter syndrome hit me harder than a freight train, and I began to doubt my own abilities.

But the worst part? The job market. You would think that with a CS degree, job offers would be pouring in, right? Wrong. The oversaturation of the market meant that even entry-level positions required years of experience. It was a catch-22 – I needed a job to gain experience, but I needed experience to get a job. The rejection emails piled up, each one a reminder of how little I had to show for my years of hard work and sacrifice.

And let's talk about mental health. The constant pressure to perform, the isolation of spending hours in front of a screen, and the feeling that you're always one step away from failure – it took a toll on my mental well-being. Depression and anxiety became my unwanted companions, and seeking help felt like admitting defeat in a field that prides itself on being all-knowing and confident.

So, here I am now, feeling like I've been chewed up and spat out by the CS major machine. The promises of a bright future seem like a distant dream, and all I have to show for it is a piece of paper that feels more like a cruel joke. My passion has turned into resentment, my confidence shattered, and my hope for a better life crushed.

I know this might come across as a sob story, but I genuinely want to caution those of you who are considering majoring in computer science. It's not all rainbows and unicorns – there are tears, sleepless nights, and moments of deep regret. I wish someone had told me the harsh truth before I embarked on this journey.

If you're thriving in your CS major, I genuinely applaud you. But if you're struggling like I did, just know that you're not alone. It's okay to question your path, to seek help when you need it, and to explore other options if this isn't the right fit for you. Don't let the allure of success blind you to the very real challenges that come with majoring in computer science.

Stay strong, my fellow CS majors. And remember, your worth isn't defined by a degree or a job title.",2023-08-10 14:20:37

s9628x,Guy in my class faked his resume and got FAANG interviews and an offer.,"So I was talking to a guy in one of my courses about summer internships and how I’m struggling getting interviews and all that. He told me he got an Amazon offer and showed me his resume. 

His resume was insanely good compared to mine and we’re both sophomores taking similar courses. He then showed me his old resume which looked similar to mine(simple projects, school projects, hackathon..). 

Then he tells me his projects are all cloned projects off GitHub. He stalked people that got FAANG internships or currently work there and search for their GitHubs and clone projects. He even faked his volunteer experience and school clubs. I was pretty pissed off but just laughed it off with this guy.

He minimally studied the projects and hoped he didn’t get questioned about them too much for interviews. He got 3 FAANG interviews/OAs and multiple other interviews from mid-size companies. He’s a leetcode grinder so technical interviews or assessments weren’t a problem for him. 

Now that he got a FAANG internship, he’s basically set to get better opportunities in the future. He’ll eventually only have internships on his resume and he’ll probably get a return offer before grad. 

If this guy used his normal resume he probably wouldn’t get any of those interviews and would be in a similar situation as me. I’ve been fuming over this the whole day.

Anyone else know of this happening where people fake resumes? And does this happen often where people clone GitHub repos and claim them as theirs?",2022-01-21 08:25:37
16zx38i,"Offer Rescinded due to ""Vaping""","The funniest thing just happened to me and I wanted to share:

For context, I was given a verbal offer from a company but was still waiting on a few others so I asked to meet with another team member to buy myself some time. The meeting went pretty well, it was with an older woman who was pretty pleasant. I think she didn't understand that I had already received an offer since the meeting was just a carbon copy of my actual interview but no big deal.

I then scheduled a call with the recruiter since I had decided to go with another company, I was going to use this time to reject the offer. I called the recruiter today and she told me that my offer had been rescinded due to the ""use of a vape pen"" during my interview. I was really caught off-guard, I probably should've denied it but I was so shocked that I just started laughing. It's not a huge deal since I wasn't going to go through with this company in the first place but they probably think I'm crazy for vaping during my interview and then laughing about it.

In hindsight, I was drinking water through a straw lid water bottle which I guess looks like a vape on Zoom??? I'm kind of embarrassed that I didn't try and defend myself but I literally just said ""no worries, have a nice day"" and then hung up LOL",2023-10-04 20:04:05

14tesrq,just got fired from my internship,"I was participating in a data science internship at a company through a program at my school.

When I first got there, I was a bit surprised by what exactly we were doing. We were tasked with creating an API, which I thought was different from data science, but my bosses assured me that it was an important step in laying the pipelines for the project. So we create the API for the first few months, which is a few weeks behind schedule and suddenly my partner in the project leaves to go to another internship. The internship I'm doing is a two-parter, starting in the Spring and going through the Summer semester. My partner leaves the project at the end of the Spring term.

After my partner left, I was doing a lot more work on stuff I didn't understand and got little work done. I was losing interest in the project and was very confused about what I should do. I felt like quitting since I was being put under a lot of pressure to finish the project by the deadline to present our results plus the stress of taking 3 very challenging summer courses (Algo, Software Design lab, and Programming Langs).

I should note that I was not without blame. Throughout the internship, I made about 3 miscommunications which warranted some hefty emails from my bosses telling me what I did wrong and how to fix it. I should also note, that my bosses were some of the most professional, patient, and intelligent people I've met, so working under them was a great opportunity. No shade to them at all. I just don't think we were a great fit to work together. They pointed out how I didn't understand what Data Science was. I wanted to work at a lab or something with a small team or with a professor, but I think the company environment didn't do me justice.

An hour ago, they asked me to hop on a call and tell me that they no longer want to continue this internship. I felt like this relieved a lot of stress for me, but I also felt a bit down cause I just got fired for the first time in my life.

To sum it all up, I got fired because of a combination of lacking interest, losing a critical team member, and an environment I wasn't expecting.

What should I do now? Any advice to handle this helps. Thank you.

Edit 2: please don’t take my advice as law. Any advice I give is just coming from my experiences and asking a lot of questions recruiters and engineers. Your school probably has visiting recruiters or engineers too. Just bite the bullet and talk to them. Or your university alums via LinkedIn. They’re just people. 

Edit: some questions are repetitive! Here’s some repeated answers:

- I didn’t do a metric ton of leetcodes. I did a couple to refresh concepts, a couple to actually practice something new, studies some concepts on geeksforgeeks, homemade practice problems to familiarize myself more with some topics. Very adjusted towards what I wasn’t familiar with. Yes mostly DSA. Heavily refreshed my big o

- LUCK. With all the talented competition, you’d gotta be in space to think that luck isn’t in the equation.

- please stop asking about TC. 
- no more resumes please.
- I did not hear back after final rounds until I reached back to my recruiter a few weeks later. 
- I had a competing offer so that did speed things up post-final rounds
- i didn’t  graduate from an elite/pipeline school. My gpa was about a 3.3 when I applied. I have w’s on my transcript.

- I did not have a referral

- I took leadership with an academic club in my school

- 1 internship with an f500 company, nowhere near being a tech giant

- no personal projects listed. Just major projects done in uni

- iirc onsite problems were like mediums + dummy hard

-  weeks between stages. Reach out to ask about your application status if you’re feeling nervous or forgotten  

- be talkative with ur tech interviewers. They may or may not know the language you’re using. Make sure they know what you’re doing— or trying to do if your code skill doesn’t catch up. Nothing worse than if your interviewer doesn’t know what you’re doing and you don’t finish. Let them know your thinking process.",2021-06-05 09:50:36

12yb04a,Just when I had lost all hope...,"I FINALLY GOT AN INTERNSHIP OFFER!!!!!! 

Many months ago, I found out that one of my favorite startups was offering a data science internship. I had been using their app for over five years ever since they first launched and their mission is near and dear to my heart, so I applied immediately. I was super excited and enthusiastic when they got back to me asking to schedule an interview. Unfortunately, the interview didn't go as well as I would have liked, as even though I made a good personal connection with the interviewer due to my interest in the company, I was super nervous and messed up on some questions. My interviewer told me he'd get back to me soon if I am selected. 

Many weeks went by and I didn't hear back so I assumed I got rejected. However, I thought it would be worth a try to follow up, so I sent a brief follow-up email a month after the interview. Didn't hear back from that either. I continued applying to other companies but after hundreds of applications, I got only rejections and a handful of interviews/OAs that also ultimately ended up in rejection. Even after RippleMatch supposedly ""matched"" me with a company and told me that they wanted to proceed with an interview, that company emailed me afterwards saying they had actually rejected me and wouldn't be interviewing me! Like many other students trying but failing to get an internship during this year's brutal internship cycle, I became despondent. 

Last month, after getting my winter quarter grades back, I thought it might be worth a try to send another, better follow-up to the startup I'd interviewed with to let them know that I took and received in A in the database management systems class at my school, especially since I'd learned a lot of stuff that was relevant to the role. I knew the chances of it working were very low but tried anyways and put effort into the email to show that I was still passionate about working at the company. 

Days passed by with no response, so I just accepted that I wouldn't get the role and would have to try again next year. Since it's so late now and internships are drying up, I started making alternate plans about what to do in the summer and prepared for the worst. Then finally, a week after I had sent my last follow-up, my interviewer responded to me and told me he'd like to schedule ""a brief chat."" I got my hopes up, but just a little because I knew that ""a brief chat"" could just be a codeword for rejection. 

Fortunately, rather than rejecting me, the interviewer just asked me about what new things I've done over the past months since we last spoke and asked me when I could start. At the end of the call, he welcomed me to the company and said I'm hired for the role!!! I'M SO EXCITED!!!!! They're really flexible and letting me start after my finals are over which is nice because my university ends a lot later than most, and the internship is gonna be abroad in-person!!! That's a dream come true for me since I really wanted an in-person experience and it would be so cool to spend the summer abroad.

Sorry for the long post haha, I just got the offer an hour ago and all my family and friends are asleep so I just needed to tell someone about the good news. And I wanted to talk about the importance of following up and not giving up on your dreams. As dire as the situation for internships may seem rn, there is always hope.",2023-04-25 06:47:15
lvti6x,I’m a foreign student and this is why I won’t be returning to Google this summer,"I can't stand feeling like I'm being taken advantage of. My work and that of other Mexican students is being severely disregarded with Google's low salaries for interns working from Mexico.

I'm happy to announce I've decided not to return to Google after evaluating their revised remote offer and deciding their compensation is a disrespect both to my work and skills and those of fellow students.

Last year, one of the changes that we had to accept if we still wanted to work at Google was a compensation adjustment based on the cost of living in our country. It's worth noting that in 2020 Google made this adjustment while other tech companies that were still offering their program remotely didn't make any adjustments and paid the exact same amount they would've paid had the program taken place in the US, whereas Google paid about 10% of the original amount to its Mexican interns. Note that the interns have the exact same skills and knowledge as their US counterparts and that they performed the same work as well.

In other words, Mexican interns were only being paid 10% of the compensation while having the same skills and doing the same work just because they were located in another country. I've even worked at Google in the US before the pandemic and received their American salary, so it doesn't make sense to me that they're underpaying us this much because we'll work from somewhere else. The appeal of working at a place like Google vanished for me after reflecting on these facts. Because let's face it: even though it is an interesting company where you can do good work, there are a ton of other places where you could also improve your skills and learn new things, more so when salary is not a deciding factor.

I won't give any specific numbers, but the salary of a Google intern is about 3 times the median personal income in the US, while the salary of an intern in Mexico (with the same skills and knowledge) is slightly under the median personal income in Mexico.

I know for a fact that there are other companies paying the same or even a better salary than Google, some of which are Mexican, so for me it makes more sense to support a local company by working there at the same or a higher salary than working at a giant corporation that is literally underpaying me.

Let’s not forget that not even the pandemic could stop Google and they’ve become even richer than before, so I don’t see why it wouldn’t be valid to make this kind of criticism. This is not a war against Google, it’s just a demand for more equality and fairness. I’d love for this to reach the people at Google who make these kinds of decisions so they could question what they’re doing.

I know most of the people in this subreddit might be American, but if you're from another country and Google is also underpaying you, raise your voice! Demand more equality and fairness. I will personally work at another company that pays way more than Google.",2021-03-02 04:10:03

## Learning To Code

I started coding back in 2019. I wanted to make apps, so I bought Angela Yu's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) on iOS development. I checked out some books from the library — [Sams Teach Yourself iOS 9](https://www.amazon.com/Application-Development-Hours-Teach-Yourself/dp/0672337673) was really helpful, even though it was outdated and for iOS 9. I also bought Matt Neuburg's [iOS 11 Programming Fundamentals with Swift](http://iOS 11 Programming Fundamentals with Swift) as a reference, but it was extremely technical and so I set it aside.

I followed Angela's course for a couple months until I got halfway, then got straight to work building my own app. I called it **Find**.

Lots of people talk about getting stuck in ""tutorial hell"" — watching endless courses and tutorials while being unable to actually apply what they learned. I was able to avoid this by jumping right into the app dev process — I'd code until I didn't know what do and then search up a solution. I wasn't worried about efficiency or the ""best way"" to do something — you naturally learn this stuff after doing it for a while. Angela's course was useful for getting started, but to get a good grasp at what you're doing, you should be building projects.

Another thing that helped was Stack Overflow. It's been kind of dead ever since ChatGPT showed up (and also the community is not at all friendly for newbies), but I'd still recommend [making an account](https://stackoverflow.com/users/signup). You'll be able to ask questions, but more importantly, you can answer other people's questions. ""Learn by teaching"" as they say.

Anyway, it's 2023 now and Angela's course is outdated :( so I'd recommend starting with Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) or [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100). But again, the tutorials are just for starting out — don't waste your time in tutorial hell and get right into building.

## Prior Job Experience

I didn't have much going for me besides my side projects. I worked at [Hyper](https://hyper.online/), a startup working on VTubers for iOS. I got the job via Twitter — Aaron (the founder) saw me posting my side projects and noticed that I liked anime in my bio.

Besides tech jobs I worked at Rubio's Coastal Grill and was a cashier at Marshalls.

## How Apple Found Me

Remember my Find app? Someone on the Photos team at Apple saw it and DM'd me on Twitter. [Link to screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/1D8QXJ5)

I had been posting about Find on Twitter for a while. Here's the [promo video](https://twitter.com/aheze0/status/1579305528018497536) that I posted for the v3 update. Here's an [animation](https://twitter.com/aheze0/status/1573753632549281792) I made for the onboarding screen and a [swift package](https://twitter.com/aheze0/status/1574616440941948928) that I published.

I think it's worth being active on Twitter — even after Musk's takeover, there's a lot of tech bros and industry people there. People will see your stuff and reach out to you. You'll get opportunities that you otherwise would have missed out on — for example, normally you need to be in college to apply to Apple, but I was able to get around that.

## The Interview Process

In November 2022 I went to Apple Park to talk with my would-be manager. We had lunch and walked around the campus.

We talked about what a role at Apple would look like, and decided an internship would be good (since I still wanted to go to college). I remember that my manager specifically pointed out that he didn't care about where I went to school or my GPA — he said something like ""it only matters what you can do."" That day I also met one of my future coworkers, who gave me some tips on improving Find's scrolling performance.

In February 2023 I went back to campus to meet the rest of the team. I talked with another manager about old age, college, and kids. It was really chill, but this was probably the behavioral assessment — they wanted to make sure I wasn't some complete weirdo.

There was no LeetCode or technical interview. I signed the offer letter in March.

Obviously, this wasn't your normal entry-level big tech interview process. I asked some other interns about their experiences — most people had a coding problem (one of my friends got two-sum, the first question on LeetCode) and the personality interview was more important. But I'm sure that at a higher position, for full-timers, there's plenty of people who get recruited and get fast-tracked in the process. There's nothing stopping you from taking shortcuts or a different pathway when applying for jobs. Do something different, like DM'ing the lead for the team you want to join. Make them *want* to hire you, and the interview turns into a free tour of HQ, lunch included.

## The Internship

Working at Apple was more work than I expected. I thought I'd be going in, having lunch, then leaving. I saw vlogs from people at Meta showing off the rock climbing wall and bowling alley that they had right in the office. My friend from Google was talking about how she had a couple meetings per day and the rest was just free time.

Well, not at Apple. I was there from 8 to 8, to catch the shuttle. Before my intern presentation I was working up until 12 (but that's on me and my bad time management). You had to pay for breakfast/lunch/dinner and even the gym ($18/month). The prices were fair, but it's not like the free food and stuff you get from the rest of big tech.

It was really fun. I was doing what I'd been doing for several years, but this time I was getting paid. I met some really cool interns and people from the design team who were absolutely cracked.

We had free corporate housing (got to be 18+ for this, so my friend actually had to live with his cousin) in this brand-new complex in Mountain View. The doors had smart locks on them that seemed cool, but were always broken. There was a hot tub on the roof complete with pool table and everything.

About the work, I was there from June 5th to August 11, so my time was relatively short and I had to cram to finish my stuff near the end. The corporate structure was definitely way different from what I was used to, but it's well managed and gets stuff done. If you get the chance, Apple's really worth checking out.

## Big Tech

When I browse this sub there's so many posts about LeetCode, DP (dynamic programming, not double penetration), FAANG, etc... there's people sharing tips on how to ""crack the interview"" and people saying ""the best approach is repetition.""

I feel like people are so fixated on LeetCode and all these other coding questions that they're forgetting that this is just one path to getting a job. There's plenty of other ways that aren't as hard and don't require hours grinding over some dumb problem. Is it really worth grinding so much? Studying the most advanced Data Structures and Algorithms that you'll easily learn just from building? And after getting the job, are you even going to use the stuff that you spent so much time practicing?

But it's true lots of companies now just use LeetCode as their main differentiator in hiring. We can thank Google for this flawed hiring process---asking the same boring, time-consuming questions that test for proficiency in a roundabout way. Is it a coincidence that Apple was the only Big Tech company that didn't do layoffs?

The LeetCode craze is a real problem in the field. Sometimes it feels like all the high-paying jobs require it, and as a result we see all these people burning themselves out over useless questions when they could be developing their skills organically.

Eventually I think Big Tech and the rest of the industry will move away from LeetCode and shift to project-based interviews. They might give you a take-home assignment and you can show them how applicable and relevant your skills are. But until then, I'd recommend working on cool side projects and doing stuff that matters. You'll become irresistible :)

## College

I'll be going to college in September, so I can't speak much on it yet. I just know that it's not necessary and even not applicable for some roles, like iOS dev. So don't stress if you didn't learn a thing.

[How do I fix my career? I'm a Software Engineer who learned northing during college](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15swcy4/how_do_i_fix_my_career_im_a_software_engineer_who/)

## Conclusion

So that's how I got my job at Apple without going to college or doing a single LeetCode question. But I'm not saying that you should drop out or stop doing LeetCode completely — you need college for stuff like ML research and you need LeetCode for backend. It's just that I see a lot of people just trying to get a job — any job — in tech, and they constrain themselves to a specific role or profile. That's definitely not the play in this horrible job market.

zbxw1o,Wear glasses to your interviews!,"I am blind as a bat and wear contacts but about 2 months ago I ran out of contacts so I resorted to wearing my glasses again. I got lazy and never went to go pick up some more but this was a blessing in disguise. The past 3 interviews I have passed the first two rounds with mediocre solutions to technical problems. I thought it was weird that suddenly I started getting further along in the interviewing process until I made the connection that my glasses was giving the interviewers a sense that I was smart.

A quick google search confirmed my suspicion that glasses make anyone look smarter. Moral of the story is grab any pair of glasses and put them on before your interview and wait for the offers to roll in.

xa8361,Just received an offer from Microsoft. Hardwork finally paid off...!!! Here is my prep journey + compensation. Hope it helps.,"I was working in IT for 5+ years, but felt that I was not good enough for a FAANG company. Though the dream of FAANG was still in me. But I was never able to stay committed towards my LeetCode grind. I would prepare for 1-2 weeks, and then stop my prep for few months. Every time I would try to start again I would feel like I am back to square one.

But it all changed on January 2022, I found that my wife was pregnant with twins. And that was a great motivation that would change everything.

I devised a strategy to prepare more efficiently and stay committed to leetCode grind and achieve my ultimate goal of joining FAANG.

First of all I created a list of top questions asked by top FAANG companies. Then I started solving them, and decided that I will make videos of their solutions and put it on youtube. Hence I started making leetcode solution videos. Made a promise to myself to solve 2-3 questions per week.

It was tough at times to keep up with full time IT job, a pregnant wife and I had to drive uber for 15-20 hours per week to make some extra money so we can handle the financial situation. On top of all of that I had to learn extra skills to solve and understand leetcode, plus make decent quality videos.

But as the saying goes, ""Tough times don't last, tough people do"" and I kept the hustle going. I would make videos at 5:00 am, or 11:00 pm. Whenever I got some extra time.

As a result now I have solved over 85 Leetcode problems, made videos on them. That helped me clear interview at Microsoft, and landed myself an offer. The interviewers at Microsoft loved the fact that I did that. One of the interviewer saw my video before my final interview, and my recruiter told me that they loved my dedication.

Here is the list of the most asked FAANG questions I solved. Hope it helps some of you.....!!!!

1ancxw5,Got an Offer for Meta E4,"* International Student (Will be graduating this summer. May '24)
* Had 2 years of exp before coming for Masters.

 The whole process took \~3 months

**How did I apply?**

* Searched for the keyword ""meta is hiring"" on LinkedIn, where I found a post from a recruiter. Fortunately she mentioned her email in the post. I then mailed her and got a call the very next day.

**Why did the recruiter even reply to my email?**

* I suppose the timing worked out perfectly. Meta had just begun hiring for E4 roles, and I might have been among the few who stumbled upon her LinkedIn post (which had only 7-8 likes). Since not many people reached out to her yet, she probably noticed my email.

**Tips :**

* Avoid commenting ""Interested"" on posts that already has tons of comments. Instead, focus on finding posts that haven't gained much attention yet.
* Seriously, don't comment 'Interested' . It's of no use.

 

**Interview format (E4 level)**

* 1 Tech screen : 2 LC Medium/Hard questions.

You'll only be invited to the virtual on-site after passing the tech screening

Virtual On-site

* 1st round : Coding ( 2 LC Medium/Hard questions in 45 min )
* 2nd round : Coding ( 2 LC Medium/Hard questions in 45 min)
* 3rd round : System design
* 4th round : Behavioral round

Finally, team matching process. Team matching may take longer for general applications, up to a month, but for specific skill set roles, it's usually faster.

**How long did it take for my team matching?**


* I didn't have to go through team matching. Surprisingly, while I was in the process of interviews, an engineering manager from Meta reached out to me through LinkedIn and he had no idea that I was already in the interview loop. We had a call after he reviewed my resume. I got team matched even before the interviews.

**Tips :**

* Trees and Graphs are must. You ll get at least one question on this.
* Meta doesn't ask DP
* Solve last 6 months meta tagged leetcode questions. But you never know. One of the coding questions I got was completely new. No concept like bfs, dp etc involved. Logic based.
* You are not allowed to execute your code in the interviews.
* During the coding interviews, it's really important to come up with the best answers for each question they give you. If you can't solve one or provide the most optimized solution, it's going to hurt your chances of securing an offer.

**Tips for behavioral round :**

* Follow STAR method strictly.
* Mention some impactful and quantifiable work. ( Ex: Introduced an optimized scheduling system, leading to a 20% decrease in administrative workload, saving approximately $10,000 in operational costs annually. More elaborative though )
* These are some great tips from a former staff engineer at Meta : [https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/179j96a/behavioral\_interviews\_matter\_too/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/179j96a/behavioral_interviews_matter_too/)
* There's also a whole blog from the same person : [https://www.hellointerview.com/blog/story-crafting-101?utm\_source=reddit&utm\_medium=social&utm\_campaign=story-builder](https://www.hellointerview.com/blog/story-crafting-101?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=story-builder)

* Prepare for answers to general behavioral questions beforehand. Make sure you have atleast 2 answers for each question. (I panicked and mistakenly used a different answer to a question but was still relevant. Therefore it's always better to have at least 2 answers for each question)
* If you have 0 work exp, mention your projects and internship experience.

Stress can take a huge burden on your mental health especially when you are dealing with school and job hunting at once. Also, don't compare yourself to your peers. I know it sucks to hear your friends or people you know get return offers from their internships and make 100k salary or whatever and if you compare yourself to them, you will feel like complete crap and distracts you from accomplishing your goals. Also, don't go on Linkedin unless for good reasons like networking or job hunting because it can also feels discouraging when you see posts with your peers announcing job offers when you have nothing at the moment. Always keep your head up, keep working hard, and stay focused. At the end of the day, I truly believe you can get to where you need to be if you put in the work and focus.

tqgpwn,If this 27yo single mom can do it…,"…so can you. 

Today I finished my first full stack feature for a fintech internship. I did it! It took me a really long time, but I learned so much.

You’re not too old or desperate for pursuing a cs career or going back to school. I didn’t even know I wanted to pursue this until a couple years ago when I realized I just can’t become a lifelong server hating my life. 

I dropped out of high school, had a child at 19 with someone who’s turned out to be an addict, and it took me 9 years to complete my AA that I started as a junior in high school. I have felt like a failure so many times, but I’ve never let that be the final story I tell myself.

Get out there and learn from anyone you can, especially those that give advice for a living - advisors, career counselors, etc. 

Apply for internships. Work on your resume with someone in the field. And don’t stress about having a ton of projects under your belt - I literally don’t have time to have a “side hustle.” Use school projects and learn how to talk your way through them.

I’ll probably feel like an impostor again soon when the next challenge arises, but every step I make towards my goals I’m learning to stop and relish in it and add it to my memory that I’m doing just fine. 

It’s going to be ok! Go for it!",2022-03-28 19:05:56

usseds,There’s no way some people still blame ‘diversity hiring’ for their lack of a job/internship,"Just started my internship and I’m the only girl on a team of 30 people; I’m the only girl on my whole floor. I really expected things to be different at a large tech company, especially at their headquarters, but I guess not. It’s really disheartening looking around a room and seeing no one else like you.

But the small percentage of people in this sub and in this field in general that say they can’t get jobs because of diversity hiring or that minorities have it so much easier??? That’s so clearly untrue when there’s one of me and 29 of you. If it was really that easy to get hired to such a high paying job wouldn’t everyone do it? I’m also really struggling to understand how the diversity initiatives that so many companies have are failing so miserably.

Edit: I’m not necessarily saying that there should be an even split of men and women in the field; I also understand why there isn’t an even split. I’m saying that it’s absurd that some white / Asian men and those overrepresented in the field act like the only reason they aren’t getting jobs is because they’re being discriminated against (because they think companies always favor minorities over them); if this were true, workplaces would be a lot more diverse than they are.",2022-05-19 01:47:26

173hrho,Unfortunate internship experience at Google,"Recently finished an internship at Google and it was a bad experience ngl. 

Team had shitty WLB and office politics. People constantly messaging each other well after work hours. They wouldn’t even keep it subtle, my boss would directly ping people at 8, 9PM lmao (not regarding ppl on-call). Was required to go to office two times a week when literally none of my team would go in lmfao, I think I met two teammates in person 

With the office politics, it seemed a lot of people at the company were starting to distrust upper leadership (according to company-wide surveys). People were also rightfully and openly upset about the lack of bonuses and salary freezes.

Most of the other interns I knew (we were at a smaller satellite office) were working probably 60 hours a week near the end of the internship. Some of the friends I made were going into the office on Saturday AND Sunday. I really didn’t want work to comprise of 80% of my waking hours so I just phoned it in instead of burning out completely for the last couple weeks.

14yv3yj,Stay ahead of the curve with new internship/new grad postings!,"For my last 3 recruiting cycles, finding internships has been a tedious process. I am either really late applying for a job posting or have to manually sort through postings to see what I actually want to apply to.

So this summer I've been working on a project to solve these issues with the following features:

1. Get notified RIGHT AWAY when there's a new internship/new grad posting
2. Have top internship/new grad postings all in one place where you can easily sort through and filter to find exactly what you're looking for
3. Integrated salary data to job postings, so you know exactly what they pay!

If you're interested, please check out the site [sweintern.com](https://sweintern.com/)!

The job postings are collected from [Pitt CSC](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2024-Internships) and [ReaVNail](https://github.com/ReaVNaiL/New-Grad-2024) \- so if you have any new job postings you find, please add them there and contribute to the community!

I cheated on the Coinbase OA, blatantly. I looked up what they ask on LeetCode Discuss, knew the exact questions and so I wrote up answers in LeetCode Playground and just looked at my other monitor to type them into the OA. 100%.

I got to the phone round; this time, I did not cheat, but I knew what they were going to ask and prepared beforehand. Pass.

Onsite round, same thing. I did not cheat, but again knew what they would ask. And they did.

Just got an offer. The offer is $140K + $50K stocks. I don't feel bad about knowing the phone and onsite questions, personally, but I do feel bad that I just blatantly copied to pass the OA. I could have even taken the time to learn the problems they ask, but didn't because I felt lazy.

Am I morally obligated to decline the offer?

1b5yqbb,My friend (23F) Makes Fun of Me (23M) Everyday,"My friend has been making fun of me for a long time. Even recently she said she would end friendship with me if she does an internship at a better company than me this summer. 

This past week, she found out that she got SWE internship at Netflix. She also got offers from Uber, Google, Meta, and other companies. I, on the other hand, was luck enough to get a somewhat decent internship from Apple. Now she is constantly making fun of me because her hourly pay is more than mine ($63/hr vs $50/hr). She said that she can give me one of her offers (higher hourly rate than mine obviously) to make sure I can keep up with her. She also said that, if we dated, she would be the man of the relationship since she brings more bread to the table (although I bring Apple).

Every other guy (5) at school is trying to be her friend. Each of those guys got an internship at Citadel, Jump Trading, Optiver, Akuna Capital, and Radix Trading respectively. Should I just accept my failure and tell her to end the frienship? Or should I accept my punishment for being shit this recruiting season and let another guy be her friend?

Oh and she said she can't have her reputation be ruined by being friends with someone like me.

qr7qql,Unpopular Opinion: Leetcode has lifted thousands of working-class students to middle class,"I have seen so many posts on r/cscareerquestions recently about how leetcode is not the most effective way to gauge applicants' ability and thus we need a more ""fair"" system. 

However, I have to disagree. Leetcode is perhaps one of the most pro-working-class hiring system that has lifted thousands of working-class students to move up the social ladder.

No other industries (besides engineering) have given working-class applicants the opportunity in the field than the tech industry and thanks to leetcode, applicants with very little to no experience can break it into the industry. 

If you think the tech industry is unfair, it is because you have not worked in different industries before. For instance, in the finance and law field, your pedigree matters which weeds out students from a working-class background. If you want to work in politics, it is near impossible to even work as an intern if you did not attend one of the top 10 universities. (That's why most politicians are rich and I have yet to find a single politician from a working-class background)

However, because of leetcode, no matter your background, you have to go through the same trial, which gives equal opportunity to both poor and rich.

So really, IMO if you are against leetcode then you are in a way contributing to this anti-working class atmosphere.

Keep Leetcode! POWER TO THE WORKING CLASS",2021-11-10 23:53:23

10j04xv,It’s okay to not work at FAANG/HFT out of college.,"Hey guys and gals. I’m a senior at a state school not known for academics. Our CS program is nothing to write home about.

After a fun internship, I got a new grad offer at a top 50 Fortune 500 non-tech company. Fully remote, in an LCOL area. TC isn’t crazy, but my company is relatively immune to layoffs and my WLB is fantastic. 

It’s not FAANG. I don’t make 200K as a new grad. But I got a job, I’m a software engineer, and I work for a great company. 

For everyone panicking about “o noooooo I can’t get a 200K FAANG job in this market where 100K people have been laid off and I’m worthless and I’ll never make it bsjilsmtjfjckw,” don’t panic. Jobs and internships are definitely out there. As long as you land somewhere, you’ll be perfectly fine.

FAANG will always be there, but there are other companies out there as well where you’ll still make way more than the average household in the US, even in LCOL. 

Be happy, don’t stress, and keep working hard. If you land a job/internship this year, you’ve got one over thousands of other students in the US.

Good luck to all!",2023-01-23 01:23:50

qbfvrv,I asked my interviewer if he watched anime… and made it to the next round xD,"Ok so like yesterday the funniest thing happened. I was having a technical interview with a startup and was exhausted from doing technical interviews this season. I had been working on an open-source project called chrollo (you can see it on github [here](https://github.com/wuon/chrollo)) and basically built it over the weekend after finding a bash based version of it. In a nutshell, you can watch anime… from your CLI xD

Anyways, the whole conversation happened while exchanging formalities where he had asked me what I did over the weekend. I really didn’t want to do another coding interview so I just YOLO’d it and asked if he watched anime. When he said “yes” I knew it was time to take a shot and unload my weebness.

I ended up spending the next hour talking about the tool I built and demoing it to him. He seemed to really enjoy it and was interested on how I scraped the information + streamed the video. Because of our conversation, we didn’t have time for the coding problem and it just left at that.

A couple hours later, I got an invitation to move on to the next round! I found it super refreshing that some companies don’t always require a coding challenge. Although showcasing a project doesn’t work for every company like the Big N, it was super cool to see my local startup moving forward with me even though I didn’t do their coding problem.

Well, at least they know I watch anime...",2021-10-19 17:04:24

17k1lqn,I got an offer! Here’s how I did it,"Thought I’d provide some advice in everyone’s job search, specifically Entry Level/New Grad. I’m not an expert, just saying what worked for me. 

I had been applying since April this year for entry level full time software engineering positions. I probably did 50+ applications per week since then. I was still in school throughout the summer and didn’t have time to leetcode. But I noticed the interviews were never like leetcode, more like CS trivia. Therefore I created a Techinical Question CS trivia study guide as well as writing down all the common Behavioral Questions and reviewing everything before each interview. Never got any offers and was getting depressed and broke.

One day I was on a date looking out at my city’s skyline at night and realized that all the company’s in all the skyscrapers did NOT post any jobs on any job board I was on. I then, immediately after the date, went on all of their company career sites and every single one had entry level software engineering jobs posted! One company happened to be the largest employer in my state and had around 5 entry level software engineer positions posted!! All of the companies were healthcare, banking, and consulting industries which is probably why they have money and time to invest in New Grads, try to aim for these industries!

 I couldn’t believe it and applied to all of them. 2 weeks later they gave me an offer I accepted 😊 which was one of the best days of my life tbh. Anyway, just wanted to not only share my success story but also provide some insight on other ways to job search. Sometimes the answer is right in front of you the whole time.

EDIT: Just wanted to add that I accepted an offer from a healthcare company and even renegotiated my salary to a number I’m happy with! 

The key takeaway I feel like is just apply to companies that don’t post to LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, etc cause then you have A LOT LESS competition. I remember I was interviewing for a medical device company via a recruiter reaching out to me. Then they posted the job everywhere and ghosted me..

If anyone wants to know my Technical CS Trivia Questions, they were literally just basic OOP and Python questions. The behavioral questions were also just basic ones you hear all the time. Having everything written out with your answers helps ALOT when preparing. After many interviews, I simply became very good at answering them and I think the company was satisfied enough to just give me an offer almost right away without any follow up interview which is unbelievable!

Just wanted to provide a quick update that if you’re like me and you never turned things around, **it is still not too late.** Tech is such a forgiving field compared to others.

I have been studying outside of work this entire year for about 10-20 hours a week. Leetcode, system design, behaviorals, mock interviews, all that jazz.

Tomorrow I start my first day at Microsoft and I couldn’t be more thrilled! I found a team that seems really great to work with and I think it’s gonna be a good product for my career growth.

I feel like the moral I learned here is that if and when you’re ready to change something about your life, the world is waiting for you.

okjkix,F I N A L L Y i got my first internship!!! I'm starting next week!!!,"I'm so excited. I've been applying and applying to countless internships since I started college. I was just about ready to give up. I probably would've been done applying to internships if I hadn't gotten this one after the interviews. It's a small company in my home town (also small, lol). It's close enough for me to walk to (but I don't even have to do that, with it being completely virtual now).

And it all happened by pure chance. My dad saw the sign for the company on a walk, and aske the head of recruiting if they had any internship openings. She said they don't normally do internships, but to send my resume anyways and they'll see what they can do. So I gave him my resume, which he sent to her, one thing led to another, and here I am! My resume isn't even anything special. I only have a 3.3 GPA, no projects on my resume. Only other job was as a dishwasher for 8 months. I don't know what they liked about my resume, but hey, I'm not complaining!

Also, I'm going to be paid $25/hr! I was hoping for $20, but would've taken literally anything, so I'm really happy in terms of compensation!! I'm really hoping I do well, maybe even well enough to get a full time offer at the end! Last semester (really, the past 3 semesters, but this spring especially) has been absolute hell for me between the pandemic, isolation, depression, anxiety, all that good stuff. I was feeling completely hopeless and suicidal in May. But now things are finally looking up for me!

I don't mean to brag or anything, I'm just really happy that I finally have an internship and don't have to worry as much about being able to find a job after I graduate.

16lqvss,I feel like programming has consumed my life,"Today I was helping my father fix an inflatable that he suspected had a hole in it and asked me to scan every inch of it for the hole.

I started at one side and kept moving my hand over every inch of the inflatable to see if I could feel the hole when it occurred to me “this is totally like a brute force approach to this problem I’m scanning through every inch to see if I could find the value of “hole”. Then I thought since this is also like a linear search where I’m iterating through every inch/value of this problem until I find the desired value = “hole”.

I then started thinking if there’s a more efficient algorithm for this and considered binary search. “Maybe I should start from the middle and look at both sides to see if the desired value is in one or the other half? No that doesn’t make any sense”

Later today I also typed in is x ordered or is it unordered and I started thinking to myself it would be more time efficient if I typed in “is x ordered or not?” Since that would use less chars and therefore be able to be typed faster, it would make it more time efficient and o(n) since the more characters(input size) there is the longer it takes to be completed.

Look, I realize there are a lot of jokes bouncing around here but for the few that think jumping into a UPS driver position is an easy breezy alternative 

The job is no fricken cake walk. Drivers earn every bit of that 170k package through blood, sweat and tears. Literal blood, sweat and tears. UPSers are working 24/7 to get those packages delivered. Lifting upwards of 100 lbs at a time, managing ever changing and difficult delivery scenarios and working through any type of severe weather you can imagine. UPS does not care how cold/hot/icy/rainy/shitty it may be. You’re not going home at night until that package car is empty, and only if there’s no other drivers that need help after you finish. Drivers sacrifice a LOT of their personal time and work/life balance is virtually non existent until you reach the top tiers of seniority. Kiss your family goodbye over the holidays, you will have no time to do anything but work, eat while driving and hopefully get a little sleep at night. The job is hard on your body and it takes a really strong minded person to take this up as a career.

The interview was only 30 minutes long with a mix of behavioral questions, technical questions, and “logic” questions (?) I joined the call and the interviewer was 5-6 minutes late. I was a little annoyed because we only had 30 minutes to do the interview, 5 minutes wasn’t really too bad. 

The guy immediately asks me if I have a GitHub, and I tell him I do it’s on my resume and just looks so visibly uninterested. We then start the behavioral part where he asks me questions and he looks so uninterested and inattentive whilst he just kept staring away from the screen towards a window. It was clear that he was just being impatient. 

We start the technical portion and he is still just looking away from the camera from time to time. It was really questions surrounding OOP and general programming questions. But immediately after, we start the “logic” portion of the test. He asks me a question about probability and I am certain i have the answer right but he tells me I am wrong. I took a few seconds to think about it and then he says “Let me just answer this call and I’ll let you think about it”. This man’s answers another call WHILE we are in our interview. I can see him visibly frustrated and just talking to another person probably on Teams. I just give up on the question and just tell him that “I am not sure” as I pretty much just wanted to leave. Why do an interview if you were going to be so dismissive, uninterested, and then answer a call during an interview? The interview was so short and he still just pulled a dick move.

Things like GHC where companies attend that are looking to increase the number of women in software engineering are not getting unqualified women. They can pass the hiring bar. Some programs, like ColorStack, which are more selective, partner with companies for internships. But you have to apply to get into those. And the people who apply that aren’t in those programs aren’t being affected by the company’s partnership with a third party. Otherwise they would just reserve applications for those in the programs they partner with.

 Companies want to increase the number of underrepresented demographics in tech because they value diversity. When you’re lamenting about how terrible it is that these programs exist, you’re telling on yourself in a major way that you don’t care whatsoever about diversity in tech. And for people who say it should be income based, not race based, plenty of FLI programs exist for that exact reason. The goal of companies is to increase the number of certain demographics in tech because they’re historically underrepresented, and companies value diversity. Diversity in income/background is included in this (which is why these FLI programs exist). And minorities make up *such* a small number of tech applicants . They’re not “stealing” your job. 

Another major complaint is that it’s unfair that minorities have access to programs designed to increase representation. But the tech sector is *still* so sparsely populated by black, Latinx, Pacific Islander people and women of any race that clearly, these programs aren’t having a monumental impact. And you’re not failing every interview you’ve gotten because some unqualified minority stole your spot.

Then there’s the anecdotal stories that people like to throw out which they insist prove their point- about how their female/minority classmates are objectively worse than them and how they didn’t pass an interview or couldn’t get a job but their female/minority classmate did. To say that without having spoken to the same interviewer that you had when interviews are *so* variable is insane. You could say that about anyone. And, as a note, there is a factor of companies *wanting* diversity because diversity leads to innovation. People with different backgrounds and experiences are important to success. So when you have a severe lack of people with certain backgrounds, it makes sense you want to seek them out. 

If women become over represented in tech, it would make sense to prioritize hiring. If black people become over represented in tech, it would make sense to end the programs designed to bring more in. But that’s not the case right now.

Also, a lot of you guys have horrific social skills and are likely extremely abrasive or unpleasant in the behavioral section of your interviews. Factor that in.

EDIT: There is one point being brought up repeatedly which I didn’t originally address- and that is how these programs are for under represented minorities, but do not generally include Asian people. I figured that would be obvious as to why. The programs are for groups of people that are under represented in tech. Asian people are over represented. These programs are designed to get more people from groups that are not present in the tech sphere into tech. If anything, it proves that these DEI initiatives and AA are not here just for the sake of minorities, and that they are specifically designed to increase the number of under repped tech applicants. Now, an argument is also being made that it’s unfair if Asian people from overwhelmingly one ethnic background are being represented, but Asian people are still being considered as over represented despite this. That issue lies in how the US defines race and is a much deeper issue- but I wholeheartedly agree that it is an unfair categorization of way too many people.",2023-08-15 21:37:30
15jf0o4,How I got into Google,"Please don't take this as a flex. it is merely an observation I would like to share.

Spoiler: it's all luck. I believe I am the luckiest CS major alive. Every event that has led to where I am now cannot be explained from something other than luck. I am on track to graduate with 4 SWE internships (though I'm planning for 5 if possible), including Amazon and Google.

My first internship was with IBM, and that happened the summer before my freshman year of college started. I was lucky enough for them to host a 5 week paid internship program for my high school with no OA or interview required.

I'd say my second internship was fairly earned; I interviewed the best and they didn't pay that well, but at least I got a year's worth of experience from them.

My third internship was with Amazon. I only had about 30 LC questions done, but I was lucky enough to get an OA with terribly easy questions and even more lucky to only have a behavioral interview afterwards that got me the offer. I also got the offer weeks before the waitlist started, so even more lucky.

Finally as a rising junior, I was stupid lucky to have a Google recruiter select me as a candidate for 2024 SWE internship. The OA was easy, though I came more prepared. The interview was 1 LC easy and 1 LC hard, but the interviewer was nice enough to pass me.

I see so many people with a better resume, more experience, better at LC, and go to a better school than I do (I go to a T200), yet they struggle finding internships. Meanwhile easy OAs and interviews are spoonfed to me.

What do you guys think? I need to see this from a perspective from the general population.

EDIT: From people that are asking for resume, this is my anonymized resume: [https://www.overleaf.com/read/qzvvfggdxdnd](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qzvvfggdxdnd) For people who are asking for my ethnicity, I am Mexican American.

mrd0vs,"I Failed a Big Interview Recently, but I Learned 4 Solid Communication Tips in the Process","Here recently I bombed a startup technical interview. I thought I had aced it.

So I asked for feedback and the CTO scheduled a call.

>In general, we found that your answers weren't specific.

When he explained further, it cut even deeper.

>We've learned that engineers who can't speak specifically about certain experiences often don't understand them.

After our chat, I spent some time reflecting on the interview. He was right about my specificity. My failure was some mix of poor communication and truly not understanding all the specifics.

Four communication tips I learned:

1. Never assume shared knowledge. Providing context is better than assumption.
2. Think before responding. A small pause is better than a quick, thoughtless reply.
3. Be honest about what you know and don't know. Clearly define the limits of your knowledge.
4. Don't be afraid of ignorance. If you don't know something, take note and go learn it.

Hope this list is a good reminder / potentially helpful!

rlkf55,"If your school uses Gradescope autograder, hidden test cases are now a thing of the past.","FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT CHEAT


Set up a listener on a publicly accessible server with `nc -lk 1234 -vvv`. Then submit code to an assignment that creates a reverse shell and connects to your listener. This will allow you to type Linux commands into your listener and they will execute on the autograder machine, returning the results to you. From here you can exfiltrate hidden test cases. Or mine Bitcoin or whatever, there's no time limit on autograders unless your professor manually wrote one in.

This can be as simple as copy-pasting some socket code, Google for ""C reverse shell"" or python or whatever your assignment uses. Put the IP of your public server into whatever shell code you end up using (make sure the port matches the listener, and you've allowed it thru the firewall if any). Unfortunately Gradescope's AG machines don't have `nc` on them and the old bash redirection to `/dev/tcp/IP address/1234` trick doesn't seem to work.

I have a proof of concept working and was able to read all the test cases and autograder code for assignments in 2 classes, as a student, as well as fake all-tests-passed.

EDIT: My info was slightly outdated, they've added a 40 minute default limit on autograders. That's still more than plenty, though.

You spend hours working on fucking assignments at the cost of a social life. Then the hours spent just to grasp the concepts.

And the grading distributions are so bad for CS it’s crazy. Like only 20% of the class gets an A- and above? It’s so painful to sacrifice so much when your peers in humanities and social sciences have all the time in the world to do whatever they want and breeze by with As. Ofc this would all be worth it in the end if finding employment was easy. Then, all the depression, being socially stunted, eye strain would be worth it. But no, the job markets just fucked.

ss4fl7,Since many here only flex about their success,"I will start bragging about my failures now. Even if I get many downvotes, hopefully the mods won't remove this because I want this to be a reminder to myself in the future.

I did a 9-month co-op at a tiny tiny company starting 2020. First 3 months I did very well and they loved me and gave me my own customer project as an intern, but then I fucked up big time on a customer project and they held that as a grudge and did not give me a full-time offer in August 2021. I was too embarrassed about not getting an offer, so I told everyone I know that this company is actually giving me an offer, but it is too low and I want to take a risk and apply for better offers.

I knew nothing about Leetcode in Aug 2021 and fell into deep depression, and succumbed to my ADHD until October 2021. I started applying in October for full time SWE positions.

My first OA was Twitter, which every applicant got one automatically. I did not get a single testcase correctly. I started leetcoding like once per week since my best friend was doing it.

The plan was to graduate in Dec 2021, but I was failing my classes so I had to extend my visa (I'm international std) and plan to grad in Spring 2022. 

From October to December 2021: failed Roblox OA, failed IMC OA, Twilio said I did great and kept sending me emails until now, but no interview. I got Goldman Sachs Hireview interview, which I prepared for so much but failed miserably nonetheless. I got Amazon OA, which had 2 questions, I got 1 and only passed one testcase for question 2. I did good on TikTok, Palantir, and SambaNova OAs.

Jamuary 2022: I got interviews for TikTok, Palantir, and SambaNova Systems. Sambanova actually passed me to the final round, but then the second interviewer asked what is a cache, and I had no idea what that is. He then asked how are local variables stored in C, I had no idea either. Failed my first final interview, felt pretty shit, and I was burnt out. I did well on Palantir's interview, but they rejected me anyway. I had an awful interview experience with TikTok and expected nothing, but they just gave me a second interview last week and I bombed it.

February 2022: somehow Amazon gave me final round with 3x45. I leetcoded for 5 days straight before the interview. First interviewer gave me a directory and asked me to write ""maintainable production code"" on a short question. I was confused AF and wrote some class and she said this is not maintainable. I had to pretend that my wifi connection is becoming weak and I could not hear her, but in reality, I did not know how tf to write ""maintainable production code"". At the end, I admitted I did terribly, and coasted through the next 2 interviews.

Meta recruiter reached out and gave me a LC interview. Auto rejected next day. At this point, I have made peace with the fact that I am going back home after graduation with no jobs. I was sad, but I had to convince myself that it is okay. I am too burnt out to keep applying. I made peace  with the fact that I didn't get into Ivy League in 2017, so why would why I get into FAANG now? My soul is tired. I probably need to go home and rest. Bc of the pandemic, I have not met my parents since 2019. 

I got an offer last week for FAANG. If you actually read my rant, you will know which one. It felt great, but I have a deep understanding for those who are still on the grind, especially those with ADHD. It is such a soul crushing process, and I was a lucky one. I sincerely hope those who are burnt out to find the strength to keep going. If you choose to give up, I hope you find peace and accept that it is okay, even though it is so hard to do so.

I hear countless people becoming depressed being unemployed or underemployed after graduating because they did not do internships or waited to find ft jobs after graduating. Trust me.

You will slowly lose your new grad title the longer you become unemployed and it typically takes more than 4 months for companies to get back to you for interviews. It’s a tough market out there.

qpxawx,Review of 2022 New Grad Recruiting Process,"Hi guys, just wrapped up the 2022 New Grad recruiting process and thought I would share my experience with you all. I learned a lot from this sub throughout the past few years, so I wanted to give back a little.

### Stats

Let me start by sharing my stats to ground the discussion:

University: UC Berkeley (Senior)

GPA: 3.92/4.00

Past Experience:

* Sophomore year: Household name non-tech company (think big bank, retail store, etc.) 
* Junior year: Local Series-B no-name startup

Alongside the above information, I had a year of TAing at Berkeley (1 semester for our DS class and another for the Discrete Math + Prob class) and a year of research. 

### Application Numbers

Here is how the 2022 job search panned out: 

* Applied: 121
* OA received: 42
* Phone screens: 19
* Onsites: 8
* Offers: 7 (5 new from onsites, 2 conversions from internships)
* Withdrew: 17 (stopped moving forward through the recruiting process because I already had offers which I knew I would take over the company I was withdrawing from)

### New Offers

**Google (Accepted)**

Compensation: 

* Base: $131k
* RSU: $170k (negotiated up from $125k using FB, L3 standard is $100k) (33/33/22/12)
* Bonus: $30k (negotiated up from $25k using FB, L3 standard is $15k)
* Relocation: $8.4k
* TC Year 1: $217k
* 4 Years Total: $724k


Recruiting Process:

* Initial Application: End of August (with referral)
* OA: Received the OA end of Sep
 * Got 1 question completely correct (they have hidden tests but I felt pretty confident in it)
 * Couldn't figure out how to solve the other question so gave brute force solution
* Onsite: Had onsite scheduled for mid Oct
 * Had 5 interviews (1x30min behavioral and 4x45min technical) in one day
 * 2 of the technicals had 2 questions each (with followups) (all mediums), got optimal for all
 * The remaining two had 1 question each (with followup), got optimal for one (medium difficulty)
 * For the other, it was really hard in my mind since it tested combinatorial logic. Needed a *lot* of help from the interviewer to get the 'trick', after that the actual code was trivial since it was just a math problem.
 * Except for that outlier, a lot of graph/tree based questions
* Offer: 
 * After the onsite, was moved on to the hiring team 1 day later (asked them to hurry since had FB deadline pending)
 * One week later, was asked to fill form for product matching
 * One week later, received the offer, took a few days to negotiate using FB

**Facebook**

Compensation: 

* Base: $124k
* RSU: $150k (25/25/25/25)
* Bonus: $75k
* Relocation: $8k
* TC Year 1: $237k
* 4 Years Total: $721k


Recruiting Process:

* Initial Application: Mid August (with referral)

 * Had 5 interviews (1x45min behavioral and 4x45min technical) split in 2 days (typical for FB is 3 technicals, mine was 1 extra)
 * All technicals had 2 questions (with follow ups), got all optimal except for one question (needed some hints from interviewer)
 * Lots of array questions and graph/tree questions
* Offer: 
 * After the onsite, received an offer one week later (end of Sep)
 * According to recruiter, FB stopped negotiating this year (before they would at least negotiate sign-on bonus) and no matter how hard I tried, they did not budge. It could just be a negotiation tactic but even after presenting my Google offer, they still did not move (or maybe I'm just shit at negotiations lol)

**Amazon**

Compensation:

* Base: $120k
* RSU: $88k (5/15/40/40) 
* Bonus: $47.5k (year 1) / $23k (year 2)
* Relocation: $7k
* TC Year 1: $172k
* 4 Years Total: $639k


Recruiting Process:

* Initial Application: End of August (with referral)
* OA 1: Start of Sep (one week after applying)
 * Got all test cases for the first question, timed out on the last 2 tests for the second question so overall was something like 10/12 or 11/13 (forgot exact num of tests)
* OA 2: 2 days after OA 1
 * Focused on LPs and answered best as I could according to which option was closest to the relevant LP
* Onsite: Received a response 1 day after OA 2 for 1x30min interview
 * The onsite was really chill, spent first 5-10min talking about possible optimizations on OA1 solution and the remaining time just discussing Amazon culture + growth opportunities, etc.
* Offer: 
 * Received official offer 1 week after onsite, was told that they do not negotiate and didn't bother trying to so no clue if it's a negotiation tactic or not

For the remaining offers, I'll just briefly go over them since this has already gone too long and I've covered the ones most people will probably have questions about.

### Leetcode

In terms of Leetcode prep, here is my distribution of questions practiced: 

* Easy: 50
* Medium: 104
* Hard: 11
* Unique Total Questions: 165
* Overall Total Questions: 231 (since did some common questions multiple times)

In terms of practice, I started with the Blind 75, did some of the most frequent ones from the Top 100 list by LC itself, and then the remaining ones were when I grinded for specific companies using their tagged questions (using LC Premium).

With regards to the interview process, I specifically grinded for Google and FB only. For FB, LC was king: I had 2 questions in my phone screen and 2x4 questions for my onsite for a total of 10 questions (and each had a follow up verbal question). Out of these 10, 9 of them were *directly* from the most frequent FB questions on LC (somewhere in the ~ top 30-40). Hence, grinding these questions out before the interviews was immensely helpful. 

In comparison, for Google, the tagged list was absolutely useless. None of them were related to the most frequently listed ones, and not a single question I was asked in any of my Google interviews (OA or onsite) was something I had seen before (either in Blind, top 100, or anywhere else).

### Lessons Learned

Now that I've described everything, here are some lessons I learned during this interview process:

* I know some people say that referrals don't really matter, but in my personal experience, referrals were extremely helpful. I only asked for referrals from 6 companies from my friends and ended up getting to at least the phone screen stage for all 6 of them. 
* In terms of LC, here's something I learned throughout the past few months: the process is *insanely* daunting in the beginning. Throughout college, every year I would tell myself that I need to grind LC to get the good internships, but every time I would start, I would struggle so hard with just the 'easy' questions and it felt absolutely soul-crashing + demoralizing. This continued until last summer where a switch just flipped in my head and I realized I needed to do something or I would graduate without a good job and so I just started with Blind 75. I didn't think what was 'optimal' or if there was a 'better' resource etc because according to my past experience, I would research and find all these amazing LC resources but never really stick to doing the actual questions, making them moot. This time, I did a single question every day, no matter what else I had to do, no matter how busy I was (if I was really busy, I just did a quick easy question I had already done before in 15-20 min). I did it first thing in the morning right after breakfast so that I could get it done early on and stop worrying about it. After a month or two, I slowly internalized the patterns and it was insane how I started figuring out what I needed to do for specific types of questions. Hence, for anyone struggling with LC, my advice is to give something similar to what I did above a try and see if that might help :)
* Sites like AngelList and TripleByte are really helpful if you're applying for smaller scale start ups. Considering how fast the process to apply is on these sites (sometimes literally one click), I found out that I received a surprisingly high percentage of responses. They allow you to set your preferences (such as really early stage - 5-10 people - startups or established ones etc) so you can tailor it to what you're looking for. In the end, quite a few of them reached out to me through Email/LinkedIn etc to schedule phone screens and onsites.
* See if your university has a policy regarding offer deadlines: Berkeley CS has a policy of recommending companies to allow up to Nov 1st for offer deadlines. I found out that if a company gives an offer deadline earlier than that, you can let them know about the policy and they will typically respect it. I was able to use it to get an extension for Amazon and my friends used it to get extensions for some other firms as well (be aware though that some companies straight up don't give a fuck though e.g. Microsoft told my friend to confirm their decision by mid Sep or fuck off)
* In terms of negotiations, I would highly recommend reading some of the popular posts out there ([this](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/) one is quite commonly cited) since I was not aware of a lot of the subtle things recruiters due to swing the conversation in their favor. While both FB and Amazon stone-walled me with their no-negotiation policy, the lessons learned reading these posts were quite helpful when negotiating my Google offer (although I assume having a competing FB offer to match played the largest role)
* One thing I realized throughout the interview process was that your interviewer makes a world of difference. A good interviewer can literally be the deciding factor between acing an interview and completely bombing it. There were some interviews where the interviewer was so articulate, so clear in their explanation, and knew exactly the right amount of nudges to give when I got stuck that interviewing with them was a breeze. On the other hand, I also had interviews where I could clearly see that the interviewer had difficulty even understanding what I was trying to tell them, seemed completely disinterested, was extremely dogmatic by focusing on one single solution and constantly fishing for it, rejecting everything else. The worst were interviewers who were completely unresponsive, where I would try to engage with them and discuss my thought processes and feel as if I was talking to a brick wall: they would either stay silent the entire time or give one syllable answers. These interviews were really hard to get through - even when I knew the correct answer, I would second guess myself, I would be unclear about the requirements of the questions/the constraints imposed, I would be unsure of what they wanted me to return, all because we simply weren't on the same wavelength in terms of communication. 

### Mentality

Mentality is everything: one thing I realized throughout this recruiting process was that the way you mentally approach it is immensely influential. I'll share my personal experience in the hope that it might help some of you out. In my group of friends, I'm the 'dumb' one. I've never been bothered by embracing that label since I realized all the way back in high school that there is always someone smarter/better. However, it is a fact that all of my friends are much more accomplished career-wise: I remember sitting with three of my friends in our dorms in freshman year at the end of the Fall semester and each of them had an upcoming internship next semester at Facebook, Google, and Amazon respectively (literally, I'm not making it up, straight up those 3 lol). In one way this is good because it encourages you to be better yourself and enables you to struggle more to overcome your past self. However, if any of you are in this position, I would urge you caution since - at least in my case - it ended up being a hindrance as it made me believe that you needed to be an absolutely insane person to get offers from these popular companies. Hell, maybe that even is true, but the result of that mentality was that I *had already given up before I had started*. Throughout sophomore year and junior year, I didn't bother applying to these places when there applications came out since I thought there was no point and only applied really late (think March/April) since then I could delude myself into the argument that I only got rejected because I had applied so late. If any of you have caught yourself doing these kind of mental gymnastics, I would highly urge you to take a deep breath, embrace that *really* uncomfortable feeling of putting yourself out there and risking rejection, and still apply. This year, I kept track of when applications got released for popular firms and applied as soon as they came out, resulting in a response rate that is night and day from my previous one (obviously, considering how late I was previously applying). Anyways, sorry for rambling, but at the end I just wanted to share my personal experience in case someone can relate to some of it and if so, can seek encouragement from it :) 

Since we're on the topic of mentality, another factor that I think was really important and extremely helpful during the recruiting process was exercise: I suffer quite heavily from depression and anxiety (have been clinically diagnosed since freshman year) and I remember going through my FB interview. I went in extremely anxious since it was my first time doing an onsite for a company of FBs level and it ended up being this 3hr long slug fest that drained the life out of me. By the end of it, I was shaking from the adrenaline rush and just in really weird state. I decided to go out for a run and ended up just running and running until I had vented out all the anxiety and pressure and gotten back to normal. Hence, for those of you who can relate to such experiences, I would highly advise having something similar, a kind of 'vent' that you can use to release this build up of emotions during this highly stressful time, regardless of what it is. For me it was exercise, for you it could be reading a book, playing an instrument, losing yourself in a video game, whatever, have something where you can sink into the mindlessness of the activity and calm yourself down again, it helps a lot. 

### Conclusion

Anyways, I hope this insanely long post has helped some of you out. I don't really know if all of it will be relevant to everybody, but hopefully you will find some parts of it resonate with your own experiences, and you'll be able to take those parts and make something out of them. In the end, I personally tied off my 2022 new grad search by accepting my Google offer a few days ago. It boiled down to FB vs Google in my case and I found it to be quite a hard decision since working at either company was a dream come true for last year me. I went with Google because after all the constant struggles I've been through in college, I'm hoping to take it a bit easier after graduation and I heard Google has a slightly better work life balance. However, for those of you who are interested in working on really cool stuff and climbing through the promotions ladder fast, most people I've talked to recommend FB as the ideal place for that. 

Another reason why I chose Google was because I'm an international student, and I've read on Blind that FB is having some immigration issues with some law case of theirs stuck in limbo, so for international students, I would recommend doing your due diligence and making sure to pick the company that aligns with your future plans. 

Hope the post helped, please feel free to ask questions in the comments :)",2021-11-09 06:05:13
j88cdg,I got an Internship offer!,"I just got a call from a recruiter at discover and received a verbal offer!!!

Finally, after 70+ applications over the course of 4 months. I have gotten an offer! I just wanted to share my excitement with everyone here and encourage people to continue applying! I had only received two interview requests from those applications/OAs(failed a lot of them), one with JPMorgan Chase and another with Discover. And Discover gave me the offer!

Hey I may be the minority here but Ive been pursuing Cyber/Infosec Engineering and I’m in!

I’m graduating with my CS degree this year from a small no name visual arts school. Our cs department is literally a 4th floor sandwiched between gender studies and liberal arts. 

How did I do it? Sure I worked hard and tried to make sure I had relevant experience through projects and internships but what really did it was NETWORKING. Holy shit you’d be amazed at what a few strangers can do for your career. It doesn’t matter how hard you work or how smart you are if no one knows it. SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS - Meet professional whether it’s LinkedIn or in person and talk about what you like to do and what you’d done so far. Don’t be just another face they’ll forget in a hour, stand out. 

I don’t want to go on and on but trust me fam the sooner you upgrade your networking the sooner you’ll find yourself in blessed positions.",2023-11-21 17:31:25

The worst part is I was successful in building the exact product demo they were looking for - meaning if they had seen it, I'd have gotten an interview call at least.

I can still see my submission's GitHub repo - the people I added as collaborators did not even accept my invite.

You could've told me the position was filled earlier - I wouldn't have spent so much time on it 😭

This intern search has drained me. This was probably the final nail in the coffin. I give up 🏳️

ly1eq9,Rant: Getting Tired,"Background: I'm a second year computer science major at a California state school. I also identify as female.

Where my ladies at?? I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of constantly trying to prove myself just because I'm a female in computer science. My grade only has 15 women in computer science out of 100 people. There's like 2-3 other women in my courses, and I'm just tired of it always being this way. The guys almost never take what I have to say seriously, and if a guy answers a question that I actually said earlier, suddenly everyone else believes it. Constantly getting belittled in my abilities is only the start. 

This morning, we had a breakout room and they were talking about how our professor sounds really cranky over emails. Someone in response said that it must ""be his wife that sends his emails then."" I know that not all guys are sexist or misogynistic, but dang... it gets tiring when you're around the ones that are. 

OH but not to mention the ""you only got those internship offers because you're a girl."" I somewhat agree, that probably plays a little bit of a role in companies decisions; but that doesn't mean I didn't do countless hours of LeetCode, fill out 132 applications, work hard in my courses, fail coding interviews, and keep up with sexist slums everyday.

Anyways that's just a little rant, hoping things get better when I'm in industry and HR is a thing :/",2021-03-05 02:05:11

What the hell am I doing? What the hell am I supposed to be doing? I'm a junior. US citizen, so no immigrant issues. I get great feedback on phone screens and I've done plenty of public speaking events. I have leadership experience from my university's clubs - a top 30 university that everyone has heard of and where FAANGs regularly come to recruit from. 3.9 GPA. I've been doing research. I've won hackathons. I'm not perfect on OAs, though I can pretty consistently do mediums and only struggle on hards, but I've been studying from CTCI this season and I feel like I've learned a lot. I've had referrals. I'm taking graduate CS classes. I've used my university resources to improve my resume and had it reviewed by friends at FAANGs.  

I don't even want a FAANG job. I just want \*any\* fucking job so I can be done with this ratfuck hellrace. I don't care where it is. Put me in fucking Antarctica and give me 40k a year. I barely care how much it pays as long as I can pay for groceries and wifi. I love everything about this major except trying to land a fucking job with it. I get COVID makes opportunities harder, but I hear people getting offers all the time. It can't be just the economy, right? It has to be me. But what the hell am I doing wrong? 

Fuck man, I don't know. There's no way out. More apps. More OAs. More grind. More side projects. More classes. No light at the end of this fucking tunnel. It doesn't even matter how defeated I feel. There's nothing to do but keep grinding until I physically can't.

16okwpa,Either this sub raised my expectations for CS Majors or my classmates are just shit,"We had extra time at the end of class today and my professor offered free resume critiquing since a career fair is coming up soon. He asked if there were volunteers brave enough to project their resume on the screen as he would give comments about it in front of the class. Furthermore, the class as a whole could learn from this and get advice as well.

I’d say I’m a pretty humble guy. but upon observing my peers’ resumes, Jesus man. I thought I was suffering when it comes to getting internship experience, but these guys are on a whole nother level of that. Mfs are putting their library volunteer hours from highschool on there. One guy had “I was in national honor society in fifth and sixth grade” as a bullet point. These ppl had straight up ONLY bullet points; fuck it literally looked like my notes i would take for the class. There’s no way they haven’t done research for resume tips or something. Jake’s format anyone??? And holy whitespace btw. We are all 3rd+ years in the class as well. 

Aye, I’m not here to make fun of them though. It’s just I feel as though if they were to join this sub, they would feel like giving up worse than ppl here already do with experience under their belt.

Internship is approximately $120/hr, high return offer rate. New grad offer is about $450k first year, $300+ recurring.

edit 2: yes, this was a dev/swe role and I'm a CS major.

the leetcode questions ranged heavily in difficulty. Overall, they range from simple common mediums to maybe 1800 level codeforces questions (rare). Seemed like there was an emphasis on streaming algorithms and data structures, as well as DP strangely.

across all of my interviews, the biggest topics besides leetcode questions were C++, linux, OS, computer architecture, and to a lesser extent networks. These questions were mostly just knowledge-based. I crammed for these topics a lot in the past few months. I'd recommend doing your leetcode practice in C++ to at least get used to the syntax for the interviews. If you can, do your class projects in C++ as well.

I feel like interviewers were somewhat impressed when I brought up lower-level implications of the code I was writing: things like being aware of cache coherence, avoiding branches, and rewriting loops to take advantage of things like vectorization.",2023-02-08 06:41:06

\---

Edit: Thanks for the sharing your thoughts. Want to clarify a few things:

1. Regarding competing offer, I've passed HC, so I believe this delay is more of an internal headcount issue, and a competing offer will probably not have much impact in expediting it
2. Regarding recruiter changes, this is my 5th recruiter in the process, so deep down I know it is probably nothing. However, all my previous specialist recruiters are not very responsive until the current one
3. Regarding my attitude towards Google, I love the company that's why I applied. Companies have ups and downs, and the market loves a good comeback story. Think about Ballmer's Microsoft. If you locate yourself using Apple Map on iPhone, browse in Firefox to search on Perplexity or upload videos to Vimeo or receive emails from Yahoo dot com. Good for you!
4. Regarding my attitude towards this hiring process, I'm not fond of passive-aggressiveness; it's the opposite of being constructive and decisive. From my perspective, switching me back to an outsourced recruiter feels reminiscent of the PIP culture at the other well-known Seattle company, which is just passive-aggressive.

gl0841,No summer internship lined up yet? Hack your own!,"Hi everyone

We have seen a lot of people stressed about having no internship over the summer (canceled or otherwise). We are a group of advisors and mentors from major US companies (Citi, Google, Microsoft, ATT and more) who want to help out.

In real-life, developers don’t work alone. So we set up a space to match participants in groups to work on projects together. Our goal is to give a ‘real’ internship experience. As you know, projects on a resume is a critical way to get noticed for a first job.

Here’s how the process works: 

* You fill out a [questionnaire](https://forms.gle/d5hSs2RXFanseDyq7) about your programming ability, favorite languages, and technologies;
* We match you up in groups of similar experience and interests;
* We help you find a project that matches your group, interest, and professional goals;
* Our industry mentors give feedback and notes on your project idea;
* We ask you to assign clear roles (architect, product owner, scrum master) to avoid confusion on the team;
* We set you up with the tools, processes, and feedback loops that are used in companies and startups on real projects;

These initiatives tend to get everyone excited at first, but then fizzle quickly. We ask you to please apply only if you are serious about coding and adding a project to your resume. Similarly, if someone drops off of your project (that happens), we help you find a replacement with similar skills.

You can start your journey by filing the [questionnaire](https://forms.gle/d5hSs2RXFanseDyq7) and we will add you to the project. You will also need to join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/x6mAjHe) which allows you to connect with other members, share tips and resources, and more. LAstly, you can checkout our landing page at www.hackyourown.org and share it on social media.

Please also check out these similar initiatives. Let’s all stick together and beat this!

yzi2x9,Bye guys,"I found this sub at the start of my sophomore year when I didn't know what a data structure was. I'm a senior now, and there's probably been more days of me visiting this sub in the last two years than not visiting. As a sophomore I was blown away by people here choosing between multiple six figure offers, thinking I would be overjoyed to achieve half of what some of you guys here have done. It's very surreal now to be in the position of those I looked up to a few years back.


I won't miss the hopeless nights of thinking I'll be unemployed forever and the hundreds of rejections, but I'm glad I stuck with it and made it through. I signed a new grad offer recently that I'm pretty happy with, so I'll delete reddit soon and go touch some grass. If it weren't for this sub I wouldn't even have known there were such great jobs out there let alone how to get an offer.

wjbvzo,"This sub needs to stop with the whole ""take an unpaid internship"" because ""it's better than no internship"" and even worse ""you're getting paid in experience""","**It's harming the entire job market**

First off, it's against the entire industry's best interest to take an unpaid internship. Have you noticed how entry level jobs are decreasing? And even more so entry level jobs with reasonable requirements? Have you also noticed how unpaid internships are also rising? I wonder why! Unpaid internships and its rise in popularity will make it the next entry-level job. Before internships used to be purely optional and you can still land a decent paying entry level job. Now you need them to have a shot and landing any decent roles.

By working unpaid you are devaluing the work of everyone in the industry, companies will go ""why should I pay my interns when I can just not pay them?"" they already are doing in plenty of other industries. By taking unpaid internships you are making it the new entry level job. With this mentality soon unpaid internships are a must have to get your foot in the door for this career. Unpaid internships are creating a ""race to the bottom"" market harming the employees.

The narrative of ""young people are so entitled  in that they want good money"" is already shifting towards ""young people are so entitled in that they want to get paid for their work period""

albiet this is almost exclusively from old people and a vocal minority the presence of this narrative at all is scary.

**They're illegal most of the time if it's a for-profit company and unethical**

Most countries have laws against unpaid internships if it **displaces the work of a paid employee**. The [FLSA in the USA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships) says so. In Canada it depends on the provinces but most of them will only allow it if it's for school, in Ontario it's the same as well as similar standards as set in the [Employment Standards Act](https://www.svlaw.ca/blog/details/item/unpaid-internships-what-does-the-employment-standards-act-say-) like it is in the USA. As you can guess, most fail at that part.

It's also unethical because the argument of ""it's for educational and training purposes so you shouldn't be paid"" holds no merit. Most jobs out there will still pay you during training, do you think it's ethical to not be paid for that? The other issue like I said before it's more than training, you are more likely than not going to be doing the work of a paid employee. So the argument that unpaid internships are purely educational is wrong period.

**Most of the time it's a waste of time**

Saying that ""this job pays in experience"" is like beverage companies saying ""this drink keeps you hydrated"". If the best the unpaid internship has to offer is experience is the bare minimum for EVERY job out there is it really that valuable? If the experience really is that valuable why don't they pay you for it?

**The whole ""no internship is worse than unpaid internship"" is wrong, statistics show unpaid internships actually don't improve your career prospects**

According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) those who did an unpaid internship had more or less the same career prospect compared to those who did no internship at all.

[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/do-unpaid-internships-lead-to-jobs-not-for-college-students/276959/](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/do-unpaid-internships-lead-to-jobs-not-for-college-students/276959/)

>This year, NACE queried more than 9,200 seniors from February through the end of April. [They found](http://www.naceweb.org/s05292013/paid-unpaid-interns-job-offer.aspx) that  63.1 percent of students with a paid internship under their belt had  received at least one job offer. But only 37 percent of former unpaid  interns could say the same -- a negligible 1.8 percentage points more  than students who had never interned.    
>  
>  
>  
>The results were even worse when it came to salary. Among students who found jobs**, former unpaid interns were actually offered** ***less*** **money than those with no internship experience**.

Let's assume that unpaid internships are much more likely to land jobs. Do we want to live in a society like that? Do we want a society where you have to work for free while having sky high rent, inflation, and student loans?

**There are better options**

There are better options that are ethical and legal while being more valuable than an unpaid internship and even actually creating a positive impact to society some of them include

It’s not really a job but an internship at least and I’m praying to Jesus Christ (I’m an atheist) that it turns into a full time offer. 

I almost gave up hope (that’s a lie I gave up) but I suddenly decided to use a connection and apply to SpaceX and got it ☠️☠️☠️

Edit: 

The first thing was a phone screen with a recruiter. Then the technical assessment was a coding test where you had max 8 hours. Those that completed it in 4 hours were “feasible” candidates. After that it was an interview about talking about your resume and answering some questions with a technical manager. The interview was actually quite tough he was grilling me on my projects and internship and asking a lot of technical questions. I actually thought i totally failed the interview, but I guess I did fine. Remember this is for an INTERNSHIP so they might’ve been more lenient than for a full time swe job

I’ve constantly been made feel like men don’t believe in my skills. ):

Beginning in elementary continuing onto college with a professor who implied I cheated because my test scores were “too low” to do that well on programming assignments. (And He felt the need to pull up all my past grades/test scores from previous CS classes.) 
He brought them up as if my grades reflect me. Meanwhile I was battling through depression, i was barely alive those four years of college. I knew other people who copied and pasted code from GitHub, I wouldn’t do that. 
This because I was asking for another chance to take his class because the pandemic screwed me and I failed the first time. 

Mind you, it is the schools policy to allow you to retake one class as a CS major. He just decided to evaluate me to retake his class as if it was a high honor. 
It felt like such a invasion of privacy He made the semester so rough for me, I was currently dealing with PTSD. I have major anxiety, this presented itself in exams.  That’s the reason I didn’t do well on exams. I didn’t feel like I needed to disclose my person life  to my college professor so I didn’t. Also reminder to everyone, there is more than one way to identify ones skills.  

Just venting because I wish more men (and women too) supported women. didn’t have the best experience interviewing with a man recently.

1aqfznx,Learning Computer Science might be not a smart choice in 2024?(Jensen huang Nvidia CEO)," 

Interview of Jensen Huang - Nvidia CEO has some interesting insights.

QUOTE - ""It's going to sound completely opposite of what people feel. You probably recall over the course of the last 10-15 years, almost everybody who sits on a stage like this would tell you it is vital that your children learn computer science. Everybody should learn how to program. In fact, it's almost exactly the opposite. It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human. Everybody in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of artificial intelligence. For the very first time, we have closed the gap; the technology divide has been completely closed."" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUOrH2FJKfo&t=1090s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUOrH2FJKfo&t=1090s)

Regarding, he's literally an AI company CEO who will be biased to say good things for AI. Still, I think the fact that he encourages studying something other than computer science (for him, he said he'd choose biology if he went back to school, interview timeline 21:10) says something about the future of computer science. I know he's not the person to predict the future, but as the CEO of a company at the frontier leading this AI boom where Nvidia's goals are headed, their money and energy will be focused on closing this technology gap. Therefore, the future of computer science majors seems to be changing dramatically. I think CS will become like general education classes and not considered a major in the future because it will be so easy to program or learn CS with the small gap in technology.

I don't know – as a computer science major, I've recently had lots of thoughts on the future of software engineering and CS in general, and now, listening to Nvidia's CEO and where all the money is leading, I feel like I should be prepared to start studying different interests, maybe not just CS.

1aufp7y,This is the new normal in tech. You shouldn’t be waiting for things to get back to normal. ,"I believe this is the new normal in tech. Even if the economy improves dramatically within the next 2-3 years, the entry level market will still remain extremely saturated and competitive. Yes, things will slightly improve, but It’ll be almost just as difficult to land an entry level job in 3-4 years, why? 

Because the hundreds of thousands of people influenced by the “learn to code” movement will be persistently trying to break in now, in 2 years, and in 10 years. 

There are thousands of bootcamps, certs, courses, etc. These businesses need to sell their product, they will keep selling the idea that you can break in easily without a degree. People won’t stop flooding into this field, there’s nothing you can do but work harder, network more, and pray for some luck. I see too many people saying that “they’re waiting for things to get back to normal.” This is a horrible strategy to have. You’re going to be waiting forever. 

What happened here in tech is similar to the housing market. We aren’t seeing those $200k houses anymore. People have been waiting for houses to drop to $200k for the last 5 years, and they’ll probably die waiting. $500k is the new normal,  just how an extremely over saturated entry level tech market is the new normal. 

This is only 1 factor. I won’t even talk about the 10 other factors like hundreds of people switching their major to CS or the new AI wave. 

Let me know your thoughts.

18iiaps,I interviewed every level of engineers for their most important skill," I asked 7 levels of engineers (Entry-Level to Distinguished Engineer) to share the most important skill for their level. As you keep getting promoted, you become less technology-focused and more team and business-focused at the higher levels of the engineering ladder.

I'm in the Bay Area, so everyone I talked to works at a large company in California. Wanted to call this out as a potential bias, but I think the takeaways apply across company size or geography. 

**New Grad Engineer (L3 at Slack)**: 

* 🏋‍♀️ Skill: Learn from existing patterns to solve common problems. 
* 🦉 Advice: Leverage engineers on other teams who may help unblock you. 

**Mid-level Engineer (L4 at Qualcomm)**: 

* 🏋‍♀️ Skill: Efficient log analysis to identify and debug issues. 
* 🦉 Advice: Keep notes on your work so you become increasingly self-sufficient. 

**Senior Engineer (L5 at Meta)**: 

* 🏋‍♀️ Skill: Align project expectations and ensure projects benefit both the company and your growth. 
* 🦉 Advice: Build strong relationships with people you work with, helping them where possible. 

**Staff Engineer (L6 at Gusto)**: 

* 🏋‍♀️ Skill: Level up your team and ensure they internalize feedback to become independent. 
* 🦉 Advice: Learn the problems in the org by talking to many people. **Senior** 

**Staff Engineer (L7 at Instacart)**: 

* 🏋‍♀️ Skill: Instead of just doing eng work, spend time identifying, executing, and measuring impact. 
* 🦉 Advice: Talk to different stakeholders (business, customer support, PM) to identify areas where the company struggles. 

**Principal Engineer (L8 at Pinterest)**: 

* 🏋‍♀️ Skill: Effective technical communication to delegate tasks effectively and collaborate with others. 
* 🦉 Advice: Principal engineers are role models for an entire org and therefore determine the culture. 

**Distinguished Engineer (L9 at Pinterest)**: 

* 🏋‍♀️ Skill: Combine strong business acumen with technical expertise to lead large, impactful projects. 
* 🦉 Advice: Pursue the most impactful projects and navigate the company to make them happen.

# Reflections

* **Sufficient tenure is required to reach the highest levels**. The Senior Staff Engineer at Instacart was at the company for 8 years, while the Distinguished Engineer at Pinterest worked there for more than 9 years. Constant job hopping is a recipe to stay at the Senior level (or lower) forever. 
* The companies represented in the senior-most levels experienced **hypergrowth** while the engineer worked there. The number of customers, revenue, and employees all increased by orders of magnitude. This meant there were ample opportunities for impact and growth.

kdfzva,How I failed/withdraw 5 semesters in a row and somehow got a summer internship with a 2.30 GPA.,"I don't hear a lot of stories about failing nearly two years' worth of college and somehow making it back. So here's my story.

I suffer from severe depression. I barely graduated from high school but the extra credits of my AP classes pushed me over. I only applied to one college and I somehow got in 2015. I thought I was doing alright for around two years into college. I got some internships as a sophomore, got into clubs, and did the whole computer science grind life.

But my issues were never actually solved. With depression, people frequently get episodes. They do fine for a bit and then they regress heavily back to a bad place. For the next 2 years, I was in a cycle of almost killing myself, then taking a break, going back to classes, and then falling apart again. I would go to a therapist, take different medications, and nothing would change. At some point, I didn't believe I could change. Ironically, thinking so make it impossible to change.

The scariest part of depression is losing all passion for everything I used to love. For the entire time, I never changed my major from CS because I knew that's what I wanted to do. But when I fell into depression, I just lost all interest in doing anything. I didn't read about CS anymore and just coasted in my apartment watching the world and my friends move on.

I watched people who entered college after I get internships at Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. I saw my friends building careers at these companies. I remember going to the library seeing my friend study and just hanging out. Now I don't recognize anyone in the clubs or the library. I broke down in tears at the library realizing all the time I wasted and all the friends I can't see anymore. With covid, it upended everything and now no one can go to the library.

But the course for me changed. At the beginning of last year, I started to take meditation more seriously. I figured that if nothing could help me, maybe doing this would help. At the start, it didn't do anything. But as I got better at meditation, I realized that its true power lies in examining and reflecting on the thoughts that happen in my head. I had CBT done with me but wasn't helpful since I wasn't taking in the lessons. However, meditation was like taking a microscope to these thoughts and critically examining their sources and their effects. The dark cloud that robbed me of my happiness wasn't random or impenetrable. That mood was fueled by ""clinging."" (This is a Buddhist term). If I just let go of these thoughts, often they don't come back.

This process didn't lift me out of depression entirely. Meditation and reflection were more like cleaning a dirty lens so I can see more clearly. The lens of my mind gets dirty very often and frequently, so I just clean it repeatedly. Often I forget to do so and start to slide into a depression again but I catch myself and reel back from those thoughts. Meditation allowed me to handle the pressure of classes and submit assignments as opposed to withdrawing. I still struggle greatly with time management, anxiety, and feeling tired all the time but I am crawling as opposed to collapsing. 

I lost all of my financial aid since my grades tanked. I know that the only reason why I didn't drop out of college is that my parents were willing to pay for the tuition and fees. I couldn't have gotten here if I just dropped out of college.

As for how I got my internship with a god awful GPA. I applied to over 150 places, got a handful of responses, and failed most of them. I failed a Zillow interview. I failed a fairly easy JP Morgan coding question. But I wised up and practiced more leetcode, answering behavioral, and cleaning up my resume. I passed a Microsoft phone screen but I have to wait next year to get to the next round.

Another place gave me an interview. I looked up all the interview questions on glassdoor and studied them. I reviewed all the leetcode questions I have done since I write down notes in Google Keep. In the interview, they asked me leetcode question I seen before and the questions they asked were on glassdoor. The second part was a behavioral one where they asked me a set of standard questions that I studied beforehand as well. Don't underestimate these behavioral questions, they can be as important as the technical parts. It turns out in real life people don't care about GPA beyond the resume. They care about having a passion for CS and what you did.

I used this list to get much better at leetcode.

I literally have no mental energy to do this shit anymore and spend hours debugging complicated stuff. I can't imagine how some people manage to keep doing this job for 10+ years!? I am also working with a garbage stack (Magento 2) which is making shit 10x worse!

Even switching from one job to another requires an enormous effort and requires competing in a rat race... Should I just quit? and if I quit I don't believe any other job would pay the same... what to do guys I literally cannot keep my mind focused on doing this anymore! I feel it's some kind of mental slavery.. or maybe I have ADHD??",2023-11-28 16:19:24

jsjnyq,I got an offer!,"I did it! I got an offer! I got here by taking extra classes at my university so that I could graduate a full semester early. I started applying for positions in early October. To my surprise, my software developer internship fired me in late October, but luckily I started getting interviews by then. At this point, I had two companies looking at me, one of them a small telecommunications company, and the other a large well-known government defense contractor. The gov't defense contractor contacted me today to let me know that they'd like work with me and sent me an offer! I can't believe it. All this hard work has finally paid off. Speaking of pay:

Salary: $73,008

Sign on bonus: $5,000

Relocation reimbursement: up to $3,500

Miscellaneous bonus: $3,500

Benefits include medical, dental, and 401K match

120 hours of paid vacation.

It's still unbelievable. I applied to over 80+ companies, and those are the only application I kept track of. I can't believe I'm going to make $73k right out of college. That's crazy!

Wherever you are in the application process, just keep applying. Make sure you have a cover letter just in case, and modify your resume with every application. Trust me, it's so worth it. No one probably cares much, but I just felt the need to share this news. Thank you so much!",2020-11-11 23:55:48

14zzqqm,How do you deal with delusional parents 😭,"My parents are kind people, but they know nothing about CS outside of ""day in the life of a software engineer"" and ""FIRE: Retire early"" videos. They genuinely believe I will graduate with a six figure job and be able to save enough to retire at 30. Not to go into my personal life, but a mix of the going rate in my area + personal stats being mid + no real desire for tech jobs that make 100k (I have internships just not in the big companies) makes that really hard to achieve out of college. 

I would just be irritated by this, but my parents are legit planning their retirement off of me making big bucks once I graduate. I don't know how to explain this to them because whenever I tell them to be a bit more realistic they ignore me and say I'm delusional and I'm going to be rich because I'm a CS student

I have a close friend who's doing a PhD in AI and he talks about how insanely competitive it is to get a research job that he has to do the PhD to get a job and even a masters isn't teaching you to the level of competency you need to really be able to do AI at an advanced level.

I believe him but then I google Sam Altman and he didn't even graduate from his undergrad yet he somehow built OpenAI. How is that possible and how was that one guy able to acquire that level of knowledge when kn the other hand my friend js saying anything less then a PhD is lackluster?

Applied for a Python & K8s SWE role. Here is a list of everything I did for my application (there was a lot more I could’ve done, but I got rejected “early”):

- Wrote an 8 page essay, with some topics they asked for including my high school math performance, why i got into CS, and more.
- took a whack ass IQ test. Questions like “Jim is taller than Bob. Who is shorter?” And had to answer a million questions like that for an hour.
- interviewed with random employee for 30m, unrelated to the hiring team.
- 3 hour take home test in python.

Ended up getting rejected with no feedback after roughly 30 hours of direct work for this application. Emailed HM for feedback and was told my take home test code didn’t have error management, but I went out of my way to cleanly handle a large assortment of errors. Clearly, they just didn’t like me and made up a reason.

So, don’t apply to canonical. They will make you do a ton of work on the application, more than any other company I’ve seen including SpaceX, FAANG, and even some HFT I’ve interviewed at. Idek how much they pay.",2023-12-10 21:40:45

o68e02,Sober Post: Things I've learned as an industry engineer,"Inspired by [Drunk Post: Things I've learned as a Sr Engineer : ExperiencedDevs (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/nmodyl/drunk_post_things_ive_learned_as_a_sr_engineer/)

Thought I would jot down everything I've learned through college and over the last \~2 years in the industry.

Background: Top 20 CS program, high school/college internships were a mix of gov't, FAANG, Big N, defense contractors

Full time work: FAANG + Unicorn

&#x200B;

* Getting started:
   * The best time to start is now. some people start in high school, some in college, some when they're 60. Don't compare yourself to others with different backgrounds, just compare yourself to your past self. As long as you're improving and better than yesterday, that's what matters
   * Imposter syndrome is normal - use it to your advantage. thinking your entire team is smart should motivate you to get to that level, not keep you from learning. everyone starts somewhere and soon you'll have people looking up to you too
   * don't do CS for the money unless you have an extremely strong will. this field will burn you out if you do it for money unless you're somehow able to separate the outcome and your day-to-day. i would recommend against it
   * laptop recommendations get asked a lot. I would personally say get a mac product (used or new) made in the last \~1-3 years for simplicity. things will work out of the box and you have unix support from day 1. If you're more adventurous, get a pc and load linux, or get a VM or build a hackintosh. these approaches require a lot of work. Swappa is a good place to find used deals
   * Programming languages don't really matter too much - I would recommend python or java to get started with
   * College is what you make of it - you can go to a low-tier school and do great if you push yourself. You can go to MIT and be a bum. it is easier to do well if you go to a high tier school and push yourself though
   * CS is a learning experience even past college. you'll be learning new technologies, frameworks and having to brush up interview skills continuously. make sure you enjoy learning new things
   * bootcamps vs college is an interesting debate. bootcamps teach the high-level knowledge without in-depth fundamentals. that you have to learn on your own. don't expect just a bootcamp to set you up for success against college grads. you have to put in more work than the minimum. [Would you choose a coding bootcamp or a computer science related degree? Why? - Quora](https://www.quora.com/Would-you-choose-a-coding-bootcamp-or-a-computer-science-related-degree-Why) The top answer here is a solid one. Generally, bootcamp grads are extremely rare in FAANG because they want fundamental knowledge. bootcamp grads do very well at small local tech companies that might want something basic without having to worry about scale
* Once you're in college
   * Try new things. go to hackathons, try new clubs, make friends. You learn from those around you and this is an easy way to surround yourself with smart people
   * go to class. as someone that skipped a lot of classes, it's not worth it. you'll spend the same amount of time if not more trying to learn things yourself. the only potential exception is if the classes are recorded and you have enough discipline to watch them
   * GPA matters and it doesn't matter. It matters for government, trading firms, traditional companies (although they'll stop caring once you hit a few years of experience). Normal tech companies don't really care ASSUMING you can show your value in other ways. Having a low GPA and no projects is a bad combo
   * Personal projects are just another way to showcase your skills. it can be substituted with a contribution to open source, part-time work, etc.  It's better to have them than not
   * Core classes to take in college IMO are network security, databases, algorithms, linear algebra, up to calc 2, an advanced data structures class, compilers, OS. you don't need to take the highest level classes but knowing these are good.
   * Have a social life - growing as a software engineer requires soft skills. you can be the smartest person in the room but won't grow unless you're also easy to learn with
   * Be humble and eager to learn. try not to be in an environment where you're the smartest person in the room. Goes back to point 1 where you should get comfortable being uncomfortable and learning
   * Careers fairs are good but do your research. some companies just tell you to apply online, others will give you an interview on the spot. Go first to the ones that will give you an interview and go to the other ones last
   * Hackathons and clubs are a good place to find jobs too
   * [http://angel.co/](http://angel.co/) is a good place to get started on the startup hunt
   * your professors and TA's are there to help you - ask them for help
* Internships/new grad jobs
   * getting the first internship is the biggest hurdle. after that it kind of compounds
   * there's a correlation between the number of applications submitted and job offers. success = attempts x success rate. even if your success rate says the same, applying to twice as many places is good
   * failing interviews is normal. its not a reflection of you as a person or your skillset but your demonstration of that skillset given at the time and situation. learn from it and move on
   * Algorithms and data structures is the core of CS. Do leetcode and get started on these things as soon as possible
   * FAANG has specific programs (FBU, Google engineering practicum, Microsoft explorer) geared towards underrepresented minorities and freshman/sophomores. apply to them
   * [GitHub - j-delaney/easy-application: Over 400 software engineering companies that are easy to apply to](https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application) and [Intern Supply](https://intern.supply/) are good places to start
   * Optimize your internships for learning and growth. Learning means trying new things, pushing boundaries etc. Growth means jumping around from company to company. Use a defense contractor to go to Big N and then to FAANG.
   * Learning standard tools like git, docker, etc can make you more effective at internships
   * being young is the best time to take risks. if you want to do a startup over a large company, go for it but do your research. don't turn down google for a company that does IoT socks.
   * information is power. especially when it comes to negotiating. sites like [https://www.teamblind.com/](https://www.teamblind.com/), reddit, and [https://www.levels.fyi/](https://www.levels.fyi/) are crucial to make sure you're compensated fairly
   * practice coding on paper/whiteboards. most interviews expect this and will probably be the norm once covid ends
* Industry experience/new grad tips
   * Optimize your first job for (in order) learning, manager, interest in work, compensation. How much they matter should be up to you. ex - don't turn down a 100k job for a 50k job that has a slightly better learning opportunity. but a 90k vs 95k job, optimize on things other than compensation
   * FAANG is overrated and underrated at the same time.  There are plenty of smart people but also plenty of slackers. That being said, the pay and benefits is fantastic. But there are always different and potentially better opportunities. Finance for higher pay and worst wlb, unicorns for higher pay but with more uncertainty, gov't for wlb and low stress. The one thing about FAANG is, there are very few other places in the world where you can work on things at such a large scale
   * silicon valley is a good place to be when you're young, not so much when you're older (unless you're doing really well). living in a house with 3 roommates paying 1500/month is fine in your 20's but paying 2 million for a small house in your 30's with kids is not optimal
   * not all jobs are in silicon valley/est coast but a lot of them are. new york and DC are also top contenders now
   * learn personal finance. ESPECIALLY if you already have internships. Invest as early as you can so you set yourself up for a financially successful life
   * invest in a good setup if you can - ergonomic chair, keyboard, a mouse so you don't have to deal with issues later on
   * dual monitor/ultrawide screens are great for productivity
   * noise-canceling headphones are essential for office work
* General life tips
   * your health is your wealth. eat well, sleep, exercise. money, success, intelligence means nothing if you die early
   * be kind to people - you never know when you'll run into them again
   * take risks when you're young, it'll be harder (not impossible) once you hit 30ish
   * generally have a balanced life. an extreme of anything tends to be bad
   * have a good group of friends - they mean a lot once you get out of college. as time goes on, the opportunities to make new friends come by less often - people go out less often and you don't get the same interaction levels you get in college with clubs and classes. once you're late 20's/early 30's you've pretty much made your core friend group and it becomes harder to break into new friend groups (not impossible though)
   * spend time with family - by now you've spent 90% of the time you will with them so make the last 10% really count
   * money and other things in life are only a part of it. i know people worth tens of millions that barely spend time with family, i know people making a very average income that are happier than people making 300k. everyone has their own issues

I can't really think of anything else at the moment. If you disagree with anything i've said, feel free to ignore or just post a comment so others can see your point of view. i'll respond to comments/dm's when I can.

w3nafh,Internships MATTER,"Message to all CS college students/new grads. Hi everyone just wanted to pop on here and say before I received this current summer internship I'm doing I could not get any interviews. The only reason I got this current internship is because my professor recommended me. Networking is also extremely important. Connect with your professors or anyone in the field online, LinkedIn especially. Build your LinkedIn, make sure you have a good headline so you pop up for recruiters. Make sure I looks good. Add connections to people in similar fields. I have personally reached out to hiring managers on LinkedIn and have gotten interviews that way. I didn't do internships all through college until this year. I quit my job to do it because I knew it was important to have this experience before I graduated. I just can't believe how much attention I'm getting now. It really makes a difference! My internship ends in 2 weeks so I'm looking for another job and looks like I might have choices if I pass these interviews! Time to start grinding leetcode lol.

Edit: I am 31 and a female so your never too old and I'm one of the minorities. I live in a rural area where there are no tech jobs. This is a remote internship. Don't take unpaid internships, ever. Build projects and put them on github I have 40 repos so far. I have lots of bills to pay since I'm older. So it was a huge risk for me to take this internship. I had money I saved so I could do this internship. I think it was worth the risk because I wasn't getting any interviews before and now I have a ton. Even though I'm out of a job in two weeks, I am confident I will land another job, I work very hard learning everyday. Practice every single day and you will get better. Also make sure your resume is formatted nicely and up to par.",2022-07-20 14:09:25
1bqglig,AI isn't the cause of the tech hiring slow down! via Zac Wilson,"AI isn't the cause of the tech hiring slow down! There was a law that went into effect in 2022 that updated Section 174 of the tax code.

Here are two scenarios to illustrate this:

\- In 2021, you could found a startup and hire an engineer and pay them $100,000. Say your company did $100,000 in revenue too. In this case, the $100,000 in cost cancels out the $100,000 in revenue, and your business owes zero dollars in taxes. This makes a lot of sense.

\- In 2022, you could found a startup and hire an engineer and pay them $100,000. Say your company did $100,000 in revenue too. Instead of being able to deduct the $100k salary in the first year, you have to amortize the $100k salary over 5 years.  
So in this case, you'd have a taxable income of $80k for the first year. This means you'll have a $24k tax bill with no money to pay it!

Many companies were caught off guard in 2022 and 2023 during tax season and had to take out loans to pay their tax bills!

So nowadays, when hiring a software engineer companies have to think, ""will this hire pay off in 5 years?"" and the answer when hiring junior engineers is, ""maybe, maybe not.""

In the old world, it didn't matter because 100% of the junior engineers salary could be deducted from a businesses taxes!

If you're struggling to get a job in tech, please call your senator and demand that they repeal the update to section 174 of the tax code! This would immediately solve about 50% of the tech hiring slow down we've seen in the last 2 years!

qzsj5w,PSA: Complain to your recruiter if you have a bad interviewer,"Hi everyone. I just wanted to post a note about this because I see quite a few people posting about negative interviewing experiences they had, where the interviewer was a complete dick to them. And I don't think people realize that that's something they should be reporting back to the recruiter, if they feel comfortable. 

When I was a senior a few years ago, I had a *horrible* interviewing experience. The guy showed up 15 minutes late and did not extend the interview by 15 minutes (and it was only a 30 minute interview!). When he gave me my coding question, he told me to pick any language I wanted, didn't like the one I picked, and then berated me for a few minutes about how I'd picked a stupid language and I should know better. Then whenever I tried to ask questions about the coding problem, he'd roll his eyes and tell me I should be able to figure that out. 

In short...it was horrible. I complained about the experience to my brother, who's a tech lead at a FAANG, and he immediately suggest I tell my recruiter what happened. I was hesitant, but he assured me that recruiters *want* to know things like this. Their job is to match qualified candidates to open positions. If an interviewer is turning people off the job by being an asshole, then recruitment *needs* to know so they can fix that problem. And unless you write some scathing email absolutely blasting the company and the interviewer, the recruiter won't react negatively and you certainly won't be blacklisted. 

So I reached out to the recruiter. I made sure to avoid attacking or blaming anyone, didn't get emotional, and made sure to just describe the impact that the interviewer had. This was the email I sent:

>Hi \[recruiter name\],  
>  
>I just wanted to touch base about my interview with \[interviewer's name\] on \[interview date\]. I was a bit uncomfortable throughout the interview. \[Interviewer's name\] was 15 minutes late and did not extend our interviewing time, so I feel I was rushed and not given enough time to demonstrate what a good candidate I am. In addition, \[interviewer's name\] seemed very frustrated with the language I chose to do the technical portion of the interview in, and spent some time lecturing me about how I should have picked a different one. He seemed very annoyed with me throughout the entire interview, and it threw me off my game, and I don't feel I was really given a good environment to demonstrate my skills in.   
>  
>I don't know what the interviewing procedure is typically like at \[company\], but I was just a little disappointed because I really like \[company\] and felt it could have been a really good fit under different circumstances.   
>  
>Thank you,   
>  
>\[my name\]

The recruiter actually reached out to apologize and said they'd be speaking with that interviewer, and I was offered a second chance at the interview. At that point, I'd already accepted a different offer and declined to move forward. But I really appreciated knowing that there *is* recourse if you get an unfairly poor interviewer.",2021-11-22 18:46:59
pu9tyk,Kenny Talks Code List of LeetCode Problems,"Edit: Check out u/Maezzzz comment down below for some of the side problems Kenny recommended

13gy4hs,man i just wanna code for fun,"Freshman here. I joined this sub so I could learn more about computer science in general. Not see posts about the job market and sending applications and crying over being the perfect applicant. I don't wanna learn how to come up with a solution in minutes. I want to spend time with my code. I want to think about it, experiment, get things wrong, and keep doing that. I love researching into algorithms and reading about them just for fun, even though I don't understand stuff most of the time.

Just got a Google new grad offer without interning there previously. I've only done one previous internship at a fortune 500 company and one part time dev job at a local company. I go to a T100 state school with a 2.5 GPA with multiple withdraws on my transcript. Yup, you read that right.

I am not an avid leetcoder at all either. I've only solved a total of 33 problems.

Ask me questions about the application/interviewing process. Getting an interview requires some bit of luck, and I think I was able to use my available resources to full advantage. Would love to help others in my position & I hope my story inspires others.",2021-06-05 23:27:54

I’ve never taken a CS class, but I hang out in the CS building and say stuff like “wow, discrete math is killing me!” to try to fit in, and I’ve made a lot of friends this way. My cover almost got blown one time when I accidentally remembered to shower before going to the university one morning.

Nobody has said anything yet, and my friends think I’m an actual CS student too lol. 

I even went as far as joining the socialist programmers club, but they kicked me out for “being too reactionary” after I told them that their government-mandated Discord nitro idea doesn’t interest me much.

ltgl0a,"Today I learned: No matter how well you did on your interview, there are tons of factors that are not in your control","Long story short, I've been interviewing with a big company in AZ for an internship position for the last two weeks and today I just received the rejection. They had two video calls with me (all about solving technical problems) and I'm not flexing or anything but I gotta admit that those are the two interviews I really nailed in the best way that I've ever done. The interviewers told me they're impressed that I can finish the problems within only 20 minutes, and we spent the rest of time to chit chat about what projects that their company has been doing (they didn't even ask behavioral questions). I felt extremely confident after the calls and was 90% sure I would get the offer. But today I received the rejection, and the first time in my life, I emailed back to ask why I got rejected even though I completely nailed two interviews. They responded that it was a tough choice and since they had a great pool of candidates this time although they admitted that I did pretty well.

I learned that performance is not the only factor that they'll consider you for the position. No matter how well you did on your interview, if there is another candidate that just does slightly better  (or more likeable) than you, you're screwed. What I mean is, there are tons of factors that are not in your control during interviews, and other candidates' performances is one of that. Lots of the time, interviewing is really a game of luck, so the more you try, the more likely you'll score what you need. If you don't try hard, you'll get nothing, and if you already think you've tried your best, and still didn't get what you wanted, that's life, but we have to keep moving on.",2021-02-27 04:50:55

However, I’m already taking a gap semester to do my current internship, and taking the extension means I’d be giving up on schooling for the time being until 2025.

I only completed 3 semesters for my cs major, and I don’t go to any top 5 cs school.

What should I do? Is education more important? Should I do online part-time education or would that stain my resume?

What would you choose, school or internship? I’m so confused.


Edit: since a bunch of people are PMing about it, I'll just add it here. No, there isn't anything special I did to get this internship. I applied, I was selected to interview, and I got an offer. No referrals or connections. I did have a lot of tech stuff on my resume, but very basic work (open source, simple projects). The main advice I can give is to tailor your resume to the job description as much as possible - at least for NVIDIA, each internship has a specific description; try to talk about your relevant experiences as much as possible.

I got rejected. I bombed interviews. But now I'm here.

Now, to the 90% of people reading this that don't have FAANG offers like me, I assure you *this is not a flex*. That's why as a newly initiated and qualified FAANG employee, I'm here to tell you - don't give up ! Ever ! Keep sending those apps and 1 day you'll get a FAANG offer just like me! I once was a non-FAANGer too, but look at me now! Take it from a FAANGer - *you can do this.*

Anyway, now that I know my unqiue, never-before-heard advice (from a FAANG employee) is *guaranteed* to help at least one person land their dream job at FAANG, I'm going to get back to the point: I just wanted to reiterate to all the people still searching, all the people facing rejection, all of you guys who are non-FAANG but wish you were, all you guys who I dont even fucking know and have no reason to tell you this, *I got a FAANG offer (which one?!?!? hehe not telling!).* I also want to reiterate - *this is not a flex.*

Should I just drop the course?!? I don’t really want to talk to the professor 😭 it would be so awkward the whole semester if I just snitch to the teacher. What do I do, I feel stuck.

update: I didn’t really specify the work they gave me, they gave me the designing and aesthetics of the app (before anyone says, yes I did tell them I couldn’t draw and tried to object but they said it’s okay and moved on). 

I privately messaged one of the quieter guys in the group and told him that I’d like to work on the frontend with him and that we can leave the designing for later.

russ0v,The Catch of Working at Hedge Funds and HFTs - Literally Your Soul,"I've been seeing a lot of posts about HFTs and hedge funds. Many are mostly memeing it as ""prestige"" but some are idolizing it and actively chasing it. I went to one of HYPSM and got a software engineer job at one of the ""prestigious hedge fund/trading firm"" right after college. After this I realized what a mistake it was and now work at a FAANG/MANGA.

This job literally consumed my entire life. No one left at 5 pm. You leave at 7-8 pm on good days. If you leave at 5/6 pm, people literally shout at you and you're viewed as a some degenerate taking who's taking a ""half day"". The work I did was dull and most of the time I had to work with legacy code. I had to listen to traders bitch about something that didn't work, and because of this job I almost lost my relationship of 2 years since I couldn't spend anytime with my partner. I started feeling burnt out and this really affected my mental health badly. I started shouting at my colleagues and developed anger issues. Guess what? No one gives a fuck about your mental health at these hedge funds!

I started leetcoding again and soon found a job at FAANG. Now I make about less now but now I'm working on products that I like and have a nice tech stack. I leave work at 5pm and spend my time with my partner and my dog. When you join these hedge funds, you average 80-85 hours per week so your hourly rate is same as FAANG/MANGA employee. These HFTs that say ""we value work life balance"", yeah shut up. That's still around 70 hours. This industry is fucked by ex-Investment Bankers from Goldman Sachs who bring in their toxic work culture. These companies ""groom"" you with posh housing and trips through through their internship program, they overwork you when you join full-time. There's not much you can do with an extra 100k/200k when you don't have a life outside work. From being a full-timer at both FAANG/HFTs, I truly believe the tech industry provides the best compensation, career growth, and actually values work-life balance.

If you have an offer from a top tech company and a trading firm, and you value your life outside work even a little bit, do yourself a favour and join the tech company.

These classes teach you how to think and adapt your skill set. You can jump from one industry in one sector to another w a whole different job and transition with much more ease.

A boot camp could never teach you these things. They can make you a web developer, but that doesn't mean you'll be able to transition and adapt.

jumm7t,Friendly reminder: Leetcode doesn’t measure your programming ability,"Talked to a lot of students these past few weeks who expressed shame over their inability to solve problems with consistency. Just wanted to remind everyone here that Leetcode is intended to work as a standardized test, not as a comprehensive measure of your ability or intelligence. Just like the SAT only really measured how good you were at taking the SAT (if you are US), Leetcode interviews only determine how well you study Leetcode. People will dress it up, but at the end of the day these tech companies, which receive thousands of applications for a single position, needed some way to weed out applicants, and so they settled on standardized testing. It is necessary because there are simply too many applications to just give interviews to everyone, but that still doesn’t mean your success with these interviews reflect anything but the effort you put forth to master this very unique form of standardized testing. Take care everyone!           

Edit: a few people are commenting and saying you still have to practice it to get a job, and you are totally right! The purpose of this post wasn’t to imply Leetcode is a useless skill, merely that it is not the best indicator of your programming ability or intelligence, nor is it meant to be. Obviously you should work on your ability to solve these problems because it will help you in the future, but don’t let them get to your head. Cheers :)",2020-11-15 14:24:28

r59ul5,3 months ago I posted here about being rejected by Microsoft for full time after my internship. Today I have 8 new grad offers.,"Original post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/pe541i/rejected\_for\_full\_time\_return\_offer\_after/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/pe541i/rejected_for_full_time_return_offer_after/)

When I made the post here 3 months ago and it took off, I got a lot of good advice to start applying to companies immediately. I probably applied to aprox. 200 companies for new grad in the month of September.

Here are some notable rejections:

**Failed after OA:**

IBM 9/16

Stripe 9/16

Ocient 9/16

Expedia 9/26

Better 9/26

Google 9/26

Redfin 10/7

**Failed after phone:**

Facebook 10/11

Bloomberg: 10/25

Oracle

**Failed after final:**

Amazon 11/26

Qualtrics 11/15

**Offers:**

JPMorgan 130k NYC (switch to another location) Accepted

Dell 86k Austin

GM 100k Detroit

Chevron 100k Houston

Progressive 75k Remote

Caterpillar 90k Chicago

Ford 90k Detroit

Wells Fargo 74k Raleigh

First thing to note is that Microsoft (or probably any FAANG) on resume got me responses from just about every company. There were countless ghosts and rejections not shown here but I got a good shot at almost all big tech companies (except Apple which always ghosts me).

If you notice, I only got offers from companies that have fully behavioral interview loops. Yes Chevron and JPMorgan asked technical questions but they were LC super easy (Fibonacci question for example). The good news about this is my STAR responses really work. The bad news is I could not meet the bar in my LeetCode style technical interviews.

I started the recruiting season after my Microsoft rejection with 81 LeetCode solved. About 60 Easy, 21 Medium. From September to now I completed 46 problems for a current total of 127 (63 E / 57 M / 7 H).

Clearly this amount wasn’t enough. I bombed basically every DS&A interview round except the one for JPMC where they asked me to count the occurrences of nums in an array…

My strategy for the last 3 months was to fully complete and internalize this even more consolidated version of the B75 list written by the original B75 creator. It is 50 questions instead of 75:

[https://techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/)

This list opened my eyes to Tries, Heaps, and a bunch of other crucial LeetCode patterns I had not known.

At my current level of preparation, I feel that I have seen each LC pattern at least once and know about each data structure. However, I don’t feel like I’ve mastered any one topic. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about LC (at least for myself) its that time and practice are the only thing that will help me improve. Some people crack G with >50 LC solved, and I can not even understand how. This process is a painful slog and there is no way around it. I will be grinding this until I crack FAANG again and it may suck the entire time, but I will do it.

I'm excited to start at JPMorgan next year and explore a new city. Along side my new job Ill continue to interview prep for next years recruiting season. I’m hoping to apply to all the same companies again when my cooldowns come up and I can interview as a new grad around August 2022. Hopefully by then I’ll have hundreds of LC solved and be ready to give it another shot.

Please ask away if you have any questions or advice",2021-11-30 00:22:28

mzn319,Some motivation to do leetcode.,"**Donald Knuth**, one of the most prominent computer scientists in the history of algorithmics, put it as follows:


“A person well-trained in computer science knows how to deal with algorithms: how to construct them, manipulate them, understand them, analyze them.
This knowledge is preparation for much more than writing good computer programs;

it is a general-purpose mental tool that will be a definite aid to the understanding of other subjects, whether they be chemistry, linguistics, or music, etc.

The reason for this may be understood in the following way: It has often been said that a person does not really understand something until after teaching it to someone else.

Actually, a person does not really understand something until after teaching it to a computer, i.e., expressing it as an algorithm...


An attempt to formalize things as algorithms leads to a much deeper understanding than if we simply try to comprehend things in the traditional way.”",2021-04-27 12:13:28

kkxiy9,"From 2.3 highschool GPA to 80K offer without highbrow internships, coding challenges, or even close to a 4.0 college GPA by applying to hundreds of internships (with breakdown of application stats)","After a long five and a half years of CS at the University of Utah I've finally graduated with an offer from my dream company. During those years in college I saw constant pressure to practice online coding challenges and to get an internship at Google, Microsoft, etc, but truthfully I dislike the sound of either of those, I wanted to go into healthcare

By my third year I still didn't have any internships and had probably a 3.3 GPA, so without much direction I just started applying to as many internships as I could. I applied while in class, I applied during my lunch breaks, I applied at every moment I could find time. By the time I got an internship I racked up almost 230 applications (less than 5 had cover letters and I had no personal connections to any companies I applied to). This is what those applications resulted in

* Number of Internships Applied to: 227
   * Rejections: 136
   * Did not hear back: 68
   * First Round Interviews before accepting first internship: 19
      * ADM, UPMC (x2), State Farm (x2), TIAA, Southwest Airlines, Principal, CarMax, Prudential, Amazon, Bank of America, HCA, Mayo Clinic (x2), Tenet, Centene, Qurate
   * Second Round Interviews before accepting first internship: 5
      * Prudential, Southwest Airlines, UPMC, Mayo Clinic (x2)
      * Second Round interview that came after I accepted first internship: 1
   * Made first round interview but didn't want to interview for: 4
      * ADM, Principal, HCA, Statefarm
   * First Round Interviews after accepting first internship: 11
      * Centene, Qurate, Principal (x2), Statefarm, Nordstrom, NextEra Energy, Verizon (x2), Stryker (x2)

Why I think this strategy works: Assuming all CS students are good candidates to a certain percentage of internships, if you just keep applying to internships the numbers will work themselves out eventually. What did I have going in my favor? Disregarding a very average 3.3 GPA, I was a unique candidate. I was the captain of the jump section of my track team and was pretty personable in interviews. I also had a  web scraping project to my name that was complete minimum viable product.

My biggest tips:

* Get an internship even if it isn't your ""dream internship"" during your sophomore summer or junior summer if you plan on going for a senior summer internship
   * This is going to really give you some leverage for the next internship application cycle
   * If you happen to not get your dream internship the next year then you have a good backup spot and some leverage for when you apply to real jobs
   * This will give you some pay leverage whether at internships or jobs
* Focus heavily on being personable
   * I can't tell you the difference it made that the manager hiring and I felt like we had a good connection. These people are going to be spending a decent amount of time with you, so they'd prefer to enjoy that time even if you're not the most ""prestigious"" application
* You can really stand out with unique qualifications
   * By the time I graduated I spent over a year as the president of track and field at my school
* Start early (September/October)
   * I have a suspicion that many internships don't get as much attention in the first week or two postings have been up if they're really early in internship season

I used this strategy again the next year and now have a total of over 500 applications submitted, although it's easier the second time when you have an internship on your resume. Hopefully this will inspire people to stop taking leet/coding challenges so seriously and to focus more on diversifying their skill sets!",2020-12-27 04:54:40

v2hq0p,Leetcode is actually great,"In fields like law or finance, you basically have to go to a top tier school and be a top performer in order to get a top tier job.

Lc levels the playing field so hard, you don’t need to worry that others are more knowledgeable than you because they’ve been programming as a hobby since they were 8, you don’t need to worry that your university sucks… none of that.

Imagine places like google basically saying “yeaaah we’re only hiring from MIT, don’t even bother if you’re not from there” the way many law firms or high finance do.

I’m grateful that lc exists, with just a few months of effort, I landed bill gates and rain forest. Would be unfathomable for my equivalent, education wise, to land the same in their respective fields whether it be law, finance or even medicine. In university I remember thinking I’d be happy with a mediocre job, after all how could I not? Many of my peers were programming since they were kids, and there I was barely programming except in a school context.

Now thanks to lc, I can say I have a better job than most people from my uni even those who spend 24/7 programming.

ti142j,"Bartender, back to school in late 20s, to faang in 5 years. AMA","Always fascinated by programming, but wasn't great at math. I mentally convinced myself it wasn't for me. Self teaching wasn't working for me either, but couldn't shake the desire to keep trying. I eventually decided to go back to school in my late 20s and just go for it. First 2 years I heavily questioned whether if computer science was for me or not. My junior and senior year I started to find my groove.

I had one internship and then I took a terrible low ball offer after graduation in Silicon Valley, there for 2 years. Used that as a stepping stone. This week I just signed my faang offer.

As for leetcode. After some practice I got decent at the questions. I'm no where near great at it and never practiced hards. I definitely didn't live the narrative where you eat/sleep/leetcode. I just did two questions or so a day for about 2 months. Baked into my daily routine.

There were a few posts about career advice but even then most people in that subreddit were rather chill compared to the constant doom and gloom we see in most cs subreddits. There were some posts about bad job prospects as a physics major ofc but that didn't seem to be the main recurring theme for r/PhysicsStudents

t18y7z,I went from 0 lines of code to Google in a year,"I really feel like you can do anything as a CS major, and although my story isn't standard I think there's some value in it.

I went to a business school for a semester fall of 2020 and hated it. I had never written a line of code but I happen to learn the absolute bare bones of python in one of my business classes. After a semester of continuing to learn Python and researching CS/Data Science, I decided to pursue that path. My school sucked for CS, I was warned by the upperclassmen, and overall I didn't like the small school vibe so I dropped out in the second day of the spring semester.

Months with nothing on my plate, I decided to dive into projects and leetcode. Somehow I managed to get an internship at a local small tech company doing web dev (React and C# [ASP.Net](https://ASP.Net)). Honestly I think the company made a mistake in hiring me, but it played in my favor and I was able to learn fast enough at the internship to keep pace.

An important note is that when covid hit a year before, I spent a lot of time reading self help books, working out, meditating, building good habits, and I think all of that was key in keeping myself disciplined and motivated to learn without a formal academic environment.

For leetcode, I read a data structures and algorithms textbook and did a problem or two a day. Easys were a struggle at first, but eventually, I got to the point of comfortably doing mediums.

Also, I am lucky to have parents that we're able to let me grind away in my bedroom rent-free for a few months. I did keep a part-time job just for some cash flow but most of my time was learning to code and making YouTube videos. That doesn't mean I wasn't reading books, rolling a TON of Jiu Jitsu (got a blue belt in this time period), and visiting my friends to party and hangout at their schools. You can grind AND have a well-rounded life.

When internship season came this last fall I was a CS student at a large state school taking intro to CS, calc 3, linear algebra, physics, and intro to computer graphics. I applied to a ton of companies, did a few OA's, but pretty early in the process I had an interview with Amazon and I got the offer. I pretty much stopped the grind after that because classes were becoming too much to do while leetcoding heavy. I did get denied from General Motors, FaceBook, Capital One, and a couple other's who's OAs I failed.

In January I got a Google OA months after applying and went through the interview process. I did apply with a referral from someone I interviewed on my YouTube channel.  I got in. After only intro to computer science which I hadn't even finished when I applied.

There is a lot of luck in this story with the good parents, local internship, and other little things, but I want the moral of the story to be if you really grind anything it is possible. I think that the luck sped up the timeline, but that so long as I grinded it out I would have been able to make it eventually.

So thats (in very broad strokes) how I went from 0 lines of code to Google in a year (and a half-ish). I am picking Google over Amazon. The offer expired while I was in project search so that was nerve breaking.

Every one of the FAANGs is on slow hire or freeze.

With the interest rate hikes, layoffs, and overall bear market, everything is on low headcount right now! If I didn't have any return offers, I would probably go back to school for another year.

**I was not in US during interview process but this is the timeline in eastern time:**

Friday, July 16, 2:16AM - submitted application

Thursday, July 22, 4:09PM - got invited to 2 part OA (not 3 parts with debugging)

Monday, July 26, 5:42 AM - finished part 1 and part 2 of OA

Monday, August 9, 4:00 PM - final interview

Wednesday, August 11, 3:00 PM - portal update to new location

Thursday, August 12, 2:38 PM - offer letter!


**Detailed explanation of interview process and prep:**

* Part 1 of OA was hacker rank coding assessment. I got full test cases for first problem, and half the test cases for second problem. In part 2 work simulation, I tried to answer every question using leadership principles. For example they repeatedly asked would I push the deadline to fully finish a project or would I finish the core parts by deadline. I always answered finish it by deadline because Amazon has notorious culture of tight deadlines.

* I got invited to schedule the interview on 7/30 and I selected the 8/2 monday and 8/3 tuesday timeslots. They didn't even confirm my interview selection and did not reply to me at all. After 8/3 passed, they finally got back to me on 8/4 wednesday and asked me to select new timeslots! 

* 2 years ago I made it to final round of amazon as well and I crammed like 50 most frequent Amazon questions on leetcode. They asked me an objected oriented design question which is so different from a normal leetcode algorithm question, I bombed it lol. Apparently the question they asked me was 70th most frequent amazon tagged question on leetcode so I almost got to it during my cram session 💀

* This year for prep I didn't do any Amazon tagged questions because I am also preparing for interviews with other companies. Past 3 months I did around 150 leetcode problems (mostly medium and some hard) in a depth first manner. Meaning I would do 10 two pointer questions, then 10 bfs questions, then 10 topological sort questions, etc. You want your brain to understand each pattern well and only focus on mastering that one pattern. Don't move back and forth between 20 different problem types. As bruce lee said, ""I fear a man who practiced one punch 100 times more than a man who practiced 100 different punches once. "" 

* My tip for doing leetcode: After doing a problem delete the whole code and code it again. Write down what mistake you made and what key thing you learned for each problem in a notebook. When you do a new leetcode problem, code it again from scratch the next day and one week from that day. Reviewing is probably more important than doing a new problem. 

* My tip for behavioral: Come up with 1-2 example per leadership principle and in your answer use STAR format. Also drop in some leadership principle words without making it obvious for example say ""I wanted to **satisfy the customer**"" or ""I took **ownership** of the project."" 

**My tips for coding interview:**

1. First ask questions to clarify everything like is there a null input, negative numbers, are we returning the length of an array or the actual array?, etc. 

2. Write down on the board or screen how you would do an example manually using pseudocode or plain english. 

3. Optimize pseudocode and explain time and space complexity.

4. Only at the very end, code your solution and test it using examples.

edit. 

**I forgot the most important coding interview tip: Communicate!! During the entire coding question round, talk slowly and clearly. Never be silent for more than few seconds. Let the interviewer know everything you are thinking. Even if you are writing ""x = x+1"" say it out loud and explain why you are adding 1 to x.**",2021-08-14 20:02:17

I was interviewing and they gave me a problem. I talked through two solutions. They responded ""You have seen this before."" I said ""no I have not."" They DID NOT believe me. I coded the solution. The problem was fairly easy, I think most people would find it. Maybe others had been struggling with it?

&#x200B;

They gave me another problem afterwards. I did say I had seen this problem before. They responded, ""Thank you for being honest this time."" I coded the solution and it was fine.

He and the entire team really enjoyed meeting you and they were hoping to be able to make things work, but felt he could not compromise on the skill set he needs, due to the volume of work his teams has.

 

Please feel to reach out if you have additional questions. I will continue to keep you in mind for any other opening we may have that are a fit for your background.

Hi Future Coinbase Employees!

You may have seen this week that Coinbase posted an external blog post announcing our intentions to slow hiring so that we can reprioritize our hiring needs against our highest-priority business goals.

First and foremost, I wanted to communicate that we are still extremely excited about having you join Coinbase and we will not be rescinding the offers of any employees who have already signed or have received an offer from us.

We plan for market volatility, have a strong balance sheet (ending Q1 with $6.1 billion in cash and equivalents), and have a decade of experience in managing volatility in crypto. We're taking this action to ensure we're best positioned to succeed during and after the current market downturn. We remain bullish on the long-term future of crypto and Coinbase's position in the ecosystem.

For some of you, we have already set up time to speak further but for those who haven't reached out, I wanted to proactively share this information with you and I'm here if you need to talk! Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions and we can't wait to welcome you to Coinbase soon

Thank you!",2022-06-03 14:35:25

1axct3t,"It's not your fault, but its not TikTok's either","The tech market isn't oversaturated because of TikToks, and employers aren't firing devs because of AI. There's a deeper cause that's often overlooked, especially by younger devs who are being hit hard by the downturn.

I'm writing this because I see too many people pointing fingers at ""Day in the Life"" videos for market saturation. **That's not the issue.** These videos have existed for years. If they were the problem, the industry would have tanked long ago.

Other common scapegoats include bootcamps and AI advancements. I don't claim to be an expert in AI, so I can't make broad claims about whether or not AI will take our jobs in the future. But I can confidently say this: GPT-4 is not ready to run production-ready software. As for bootcamps, I believe they fill an important niche. Not every dev making CRUD apis or buttons in React needs to know what a Red-Black tree is. At my last job, my team's Staff engineer was a self-taught university dropout. Tech values skills over credentials, and fetishizing degrees won't take us anywhere good.

So, what's the real cause of the downturn? I'd like to propose that it's *interest rates*. High interest rates are driven by inflation, a direct consequence of excessive money printing. The money printed during the pandemic hasn't been distributed fairly. Since 2020, the world's 10 richest men have doubled their net worths, while average people see their purchasing power shrink due to inflation. When borrowing is expensive, companies naturally cut back on spending – including R&D budgets that support engineering jobs. And with each layoff, stocks shoot up and investors get richer and richer. The system is rigged against us right now, and there's not much we can do about it.

Young devs are understandably angry at the world because the market isn't providing them a path to a decent living. This systemic failure absolutely justifies their anger. I urge those devs to direct that anger towards those truly in power, not fellow devs. People in tech for the money aren't the enemy; they're trying to provide for themselves and their families.

For my prep, I just reviewed my schools OS course. Just know your fundamentals well. Other than that, knowing the details of your data structures and algorithms course and system courses well and practice leetcode.

z4guxr,LPT from a greybeard to CS students: dump the toxic benchmark of Big Name recruitment.,"I just read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/z3xshn/new_grad_2023_recruiting_summary). 

The post and comments were divided between humblebragging and despondent resentment over a redditor's tale of humble victory in interviewing for the biggest names in Big Tech. At one point, as the aggro grew, OP dissed someone for their tier 2, top 0.1% job, compared to his own multiple tier 1, top 0.01% offers.

Yawn.

Except: it looks like so many of you are building your identities, your sense of purpose and definitions of career success, by whether you can pass a horrible and narrow selection process to land a job in a massive corporation and make at least 6 figures, or be condemned to Looserland.

This is depressing to watch, must be even more depressing to live! 

You have, and are honing, a fantastically powerful set of skills. You get to build the very fabric of our civilisation, for good and for ill. You get more chances at good jobs (more on that next), than the vast, vast majority of humanity, even in rich countries. 

But you choose to define a ""good job"" as a zero sum game to get into a tiny number of companies which may in fact be a terrible, terrible fit for you personally. Or a great fit, but not as good as another. Or a superb, exceptional fit: but not the only one available. 

Pause. Take your eye off the telescope. Look around. There are sooooo many cool companies out there. Some are big,  some are tiny. Some are eventually going to be bought by Big Tech. Some will never even have a conversation with anyone from Big Tech. But they can offer you a chance for growth, for impact, for friendship, for quality of life, for reinvention, for diversity. These things matter a lot more than brand size!

Sure, money matters, it's nice and all. And yes, 99.9% of companies will pay you less than a top hedge fund. But have you considered the opportunity cost of that pay rise? Who will you NOT get to hang out with, learn from, as a result of spending most of your life in that space? What kind of friendships, learnings, insights might await you in less well paying but more personally aligned work? Sure you could do with 6 figures at 22. But do you need 6 figures? Will 6 figures be even healthy for you? 

I have worked in fintech. With really lovely people. In edutech. In health tech. In civic tech. I have consulted for Big Tech, and for grassroots communities. And I tell you: the wide, wide world outside big tech is messy, uneven, but so rich, so interesting, so varied. 

Literally no one cares past high school,  whether you're with the popular kids. It's a toxic motivation. The wrong reason to feel good about yourself. The wrong reason to feel bad about yourself.

Instead, my advice is: decide what kind of human being you want to be; what kind of genuine personal relationships you want to have; what kind of impact you want to have on the world. 

Measure yourself against THAT benchmark. And I guarantee, whether you get a Big Name interview and job or not, will look like a MUCH smaller problem. There will be plenty of fantastic software engineering jobs that pay you decently,  and allow you to accomplish the benchmark I suggest, often in richer, better ways than a job in Big Tech. Even if no one on Reddit has heard of that company. Even if no one outside Mombaza, or Philly, or Mérida or Geneva or Hong Kong or Cairo has.

Be your best self. Be productive. Be happy. Be decent. Be financially secure. Be excited. Be useful. Be a good human. 

I promise you that building your self esteem along the above criteria will take you further, and if you are determined, resilient and creative, will give you professional success along the way, and even recognition. Whether that involves working in the richest 100 companies, or in the 100 million awesome companies you haven't heard of yet.",2022-11-25 16:01:10

lio1tg,"600 rejections later, Got an Internship!","Howdy,

**TLDR:** Don't give up! *The grind pays off*

3 years, 600 rejections later, just got an internship from the place ***that shall not be named***.

What I think made the difference in getting responses:In the last 4 months, I added 2 new projects, that made my response rate go from 0 for 400 applications to about 7 for my last 200 application push. Not amazing, but after no responses from all my prior, I felt like I cured COVID.

My major focus for these projects were to make them either flashy/cool or useful to solve a real life problem I had and that anyone could use. For both, I had a genuine narrative of why I did the project, what it solved for me, and me going from dumb to competent in my journey of learning how to make it.One was a web-scraping project that has a discord bot to tell me when NVIDIA 30XX is in stock and runs on AWS.Other was a computer vision project that tracks social distance violations.Funnily enough, didn't know how to do either, both ended up being less than 500 lines of code. My tip, lean *heavily* on libraries, apis, and code from others. A lot of my learning (and positive interviewer comments) came from learning to connect things together, not innovating from the ground up. Not ragging on the latter; however, it's dramatically easier to make

What didn't make a difference:Any classes I took, GPA, not having internships. Actually removed a prior internship I had on my resume because I only used Excel and always got negative comments from career fair people about it.

Advice to anyone in my shoes as of 6 months ago, use awesome premade tools to make awesome products.

**Most importantly**, what I've learned and saw in myself, applicable to everyone working their heart out...  
You're not an idiot.  
You're not gonna work at the coffee shop forever.  
You're not a failure.  
And yes, yes, you're good enough to be a software developer.

Almost everyone who sits on a stage like this will say 'It is vital that your children learn computer science' and in fact it's almost exactly the opposite. It is our job to create computing technology so that nobody has to program. And that the programming language is human. Everyone in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of artificial intelligence"" - Jensen Huang

""Coding was never the source of value, and people shouldn’t get overly attached to it. Problem solving is the core skill. The discipline and precision demanded by traditional programming will remain valuable transferable attributes, but they won’t be a barrier to entry.

Many times over the years I have thought about a great programmer I knew that loved assembly language to the point of not wanting to move to C. I have to fight some similar feelings of my own around using existing massive codebases and inefficient languages, but I push through.

I had somewhat resigned myself to the fact that I might be missing out on the “final abstraction”, where you realize that managing people is more powerful than any personal tool. I just don’t like it, and I can live with the limitations that puts on me.” - John Carmack

2. Attractiveness is important. Be physically fit and well groomed.

3. Be funny. People want to hire people who will make their workday less boring. It’s hard to reject a qualified applicant, but it’s way harder to reject the applicant who made you laugh.

4. Be conversational and relatable. Have interests and hobbies to talk about.

5. Care about the company and ask questions to show you’ve done research.

6. Have answers prepared to talk about past experience. Biggest strength, biggest weakness, missing a deadline, overcoming an obstacle, directing a team, and speaking up for quiet people are stories that they will ask for in most interviewers. Be a good story teller and talk about how you learned because you’re not perfect.

12fp85o,A Guide to grinding Leetcode,"Leetcode is famous for being a perfect platform for practicing coding problems and to master coding interviews, unlike others, it is not for competitive programming, this guide will help you to get started with Leetcode without losing hope too early.

[A Guide to grinding Leetcode](https://theabbie.github.io/blog/leetcode-grinding-guide)

## Follow a list

Biggest reason why people don't find DSA interesting is because they are unable to discover good problems which are easier to solve, simply solving popular questions with no track of questions will bore you very quick. Even worse, you might try solving a really hard problem and lose motivation when it wasn't that hard, you just had to get a grip on it. That's why it's absolutely necessary to follow a list of questions, that way you won't have issues discovering new questions.

**Solving problems in right order is very important,**

you might see question marked easy which isn't actually easy, the solution will be small, but sometimes, it isn't easy to come up with that solution if you haven't done simpler version of it, thus, it will be demotivating,

[Blind 75 Leetcode Questions](https://leetcode.com/list/xi4ci4ig/)

This is an awesome list which is asked in interviews and is ordered by actual level of difficulty with prerequisites coming before harder questions, if you follow this, you'll feel interested, once you have done most of this, do problems in “similar questions"" section below each problem till you master that category.

Once you feel confident, you can use this,

[Leetcode Patterns](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)

and solve problems by category, this will help you master a data structure or some algorithm.

don't get afraid by “hard"" questions, there is no hard problem which can't be broken up, try to break it, you might not be able to solve it but you'll convert it to much shorter set of problems which can be solved with some practice.

Thinking abstract and looking at bigger picture is very important, try to convert it to a standard problem. Leetcode is addictive if you improve gradually, try it.

## Avoid looking at solutions easily

It's not bad to look at solutions, afterall, you can't know everything and learning is necessary, however, looking at solution just after few minutes of brainstorming is bad, you have to give your absolute best and try every possible ""inefficient"" solutions you could come up with.

First phase is to figure out what Algorithm and data structure will be used, if you are able to determine what data structure will be used, you can check the **Related Topics** section to verify if your assumption was correct, and if after few minutes you can't figure it out, you should still check the data structure that will be used and then try to figure out how and where it will be used in given problem.

If you are able to come up with a solution which works correctly, just isn't the best one, that's still a success, coming up with a brute force solution is a bare minimum in an interview.

You can try improving the brute force solution by using some optimizations, that might not lead you to the optimal solution, but improving a solution is a great skill. After spending an hour, if you can't solve the problem, you should usnderstand that you just aren't well versed with the given algorithm and should try solving related problems with that data structure and understand how it works.

You should avoid looking at solution, a solution you made yourself will help you much more, you should abandon the question and maybe revisit in future when you have some experience with that data strucure. That way you can also track if you made some progress with that technique and if you could solve a new problem given to you in an interview,

## Interview Questions don't come with hints

One thing to remember is that Interview questions won't tell you what data structure will be used for the problem. That's something you can only master with practice, the patterns and requirements of problems determine what's going to be used.

There is no substitute for practice, reading about algorithms will sure improve your range of thinking, but practice is what will help you master it.

## Be Consistent

This goes without saying that practice needs consistency, simply overdoing once and abandoning for months will be destructive, it doesn't take much to take out some time everyday for Leetcode, as far as discovering questions is a concern, you can use Daily Challenges to keep the consistency and maybe also earn Leetcode coins which might buy you a Leetcode T-Shirt one day.

## Turn Demotivation into learning opportunity

There will be times when you can't solve a problem despite all efforts, that's very common and bound to happen, but some question being too hard is not something that should demotivate you, every question is a learning opportunity, you can always learn it. Demotivation should be avoided and that's only possible if you have confidence in yourself and will to learn as much as you can.

## Participate in contests

Eventhough Leetcode isn't a competitive programming platform, there are contests which allow you to try out brand neew problems and even compete with others. They have categories of 1 easy, 2 Medium and 1 Hard, and solving 3 is more than enough. Once you have enough confidence on your problem solving ability, these contests will help you gain interview experience as they don't have any hints and solutions aren't available during contest. This is pretty close to a real interview experience where time is limited.

## Keep Hustling

Leetcode is an addiction and soon you'll fall in love with it, all you need to do is start, there is only one good time to start anything great, NOW, just do it and you'll sure be satisfied with your decision and be proud of yourself. That's all, It's never too early and never too late.",2023-04-08 15:23:32

1b8e7p6,School 100% matters,"People talk about the interest rates, the layoffs, AI, down cycles, etc. Not many talk about the damn nearly exponentially increasing computer science graduates. If you’re not at a top 20 ranked university or some kind of god wizard coder, think about doing something else. 

Yes they’re mostly all unqualified and this field does require you to have significant experience and knowledge at the entry level but the amount of kids spending their time doing this that will not find a job is unbelievable. 

The number of graduates dished out from top tier schools has nearly doubled in the last few years. It’s tripling and quadrupling at state schools and everywhere outside of the T30. Colleges with poor programs and little opportunity for software are happily accepting hundreds/thousands of kids thinking Computer Science is a great study for their career. Many of these students are being deluded and will have issues finding internships and jobs. Especially now.

From a job market perspective, any entry opening has too many applications to look at. Merit is meaning less and less and factors like where you went to school are meaning more in the difference between auto rejection and someone actually considering you.

I wouldn’t be opposed to bet there’s less openings currently for CS grads than the number of CS grads coming out of the top ten universities this year. By no means does going to a better school necessarily make you a better candidate, but those kids are generally more ambitious, are presented with more opportunities (better career fairs, alumni, extracurriculars, general resources), and already live in areas with great software opportunity.

I truly believe the rising numbers alone provide for more competition than most kids are going to be able to match up to. I speak from my own experience and from what I’ve read and heard. I will be graduating with a perfect gpa, two internships (startup, F500), TA for 2+ years, significant open source contributions and decent personal projects as a US citizen from a ranked 150ish university in the Midwest with zero offers and zero interviews. My previous companies are on hiring freezes with no return offers. Say what you want about my resume (obviously I’ve had numerous iterations) or my people skills (maybe i AM just a bot) but I truly believe software engineering is something starting to be gatekept by school. 

You may be able to point out exceptions and talk about passion, but take some time to look at the numbers. This subreddit is filled with doomposters and kids with 2000+ apps yet we still see “130k hybrid adobe or 100k remote Meta” from some kid at CMU. Maybe the market will come back but we know it won’t be like 2021 when a bootcamp could get you 6 figures and I don’t have the time or money to wait and find out. 

Update note: I am speaking purely on the entry level market. We all know school name doesn’t matter a few years out but this subreddit is CS majors and I am simply speaking on my own experience and thoughts. Take it how you will but I do think people should read this and at least start to think about where they stand competitively. Markets go up and down but there’s never been a massive flock to a technical field like this in a long time. 

Update 2:
My dumbass has email notif on bruh. Really riled up the community on this one. Being fr tho, there isn’t really stats backing this I’m just venting. Coming from a shit school, I’d like to think I’ve done well for myself btwn internships, gpa, etc. and boutta graduate frustrating yk.

yrpwzx,any way i could salvage this? i accidentally insulted my interviewer's wife,"I was at a restaurant a while back and this woman was sitting next to me. I was by myself (IDGAF about eating by myself because I'm not some normie) and this woman started bragging about how much money she made as a realtor last year. A few minutes later, she put down her phone and started glancing at the menu.

Without skipping a beat, I decided to pull my phone out and pretended I was having a conversation. I said how I was sitting next to this realtor who didn't know know her job was going to be replaced by an iPhone app within the decade, and how people could by houses from their smartphones pretty soon. Honestly, I hate people who brag about money. It fucking pisses me off. It made me think about the people in California who struggle to buy houses because of the real estate market. She kinda looked over with a puzzled expression on her face. Her husband came back from the restroom and she explained what happened and he confronted me.

We kinda got into it because I said his wife is more than capable of standing up for herself. He kind of embarassed himself because he was raising his voice while I was stoic and calm. Marcus Aurelius.

They ended up moving to another part of the restaurant. Before I left, I went to the maitre d and told her I wanted to pay for his wife's food to establish dominance over him. I even told the maitre d to buy her a glass of the most expensive champagne they had. Their total bill was only a fraction of what I made in my summer internship.

Anyways, the next week I had my last rounds of interviews at the Goog. Guess who it was. We went through the interview normally and he gave me the hardest fucking leetcode question. He asked me to program in front of him instead of writing down my solution on the whiteboard and I used the name of the restaurant as one of the temp variables lol. I did it in less than five minutes and provided the optimal solution. I even loudly yawned while doing it. Before I left I said ""I know freshman dropouts from the local community college who had this problem as their first lab assignment in their introductory programming class. Give harder problems unless you want that caliber of programmer to work here."" His upper lipped twitched.

Today, they told me I didn't get the position. Gee, I wonder why?

I have reason to believe he didn't hire me because of our previous altercation. Can I hire a lawyer for discrimination? When he saw me, he immediately should have gotten another interviewer because he's inherently biased.

Anyways, I'm not to worried about it. I had an internship at another FANG and when I get that I'll be making 150k easily there.",2022-11-10 19:52:58

15sftis,Diversity Hiring Myth - How it’s really done,"
I’d like to start by clarifying that I am not a recruiter myself, but I have a relative who works as one. He is involved in recruiting Software Engineering positions at a Fortune 500 Company that places a strong emphasis on diversity.

I talked to him about their approach to “Diversity Hires,” . Their actual strategies are much more complex:

	1.	Uniform Bar for Interviewees: All candidates who make it to the interview stage are held to the same standards. Only if two candidates are at the same performance level will the company choose the one who belongs to an underrepresented group (e.g., women).

	2.	Expanding the Underrepresented Pool: The company actively works to increase the pool of underrepresented candidates. This is achieved through various methods:

	•	Targeted Outreach: They reach out to specific conferences, clubs, and groups where underrepresented individuals may participate.
	•	Strategic Selection: When faced with a large applicant pool (e.g., 1000 applicants), but only able to interview a fraction (e.g., 200), they ensure that the selected pool is diverse by implementing quotas (on the pool) not on those who get hired. (Big Difference)

	3.	Internship and Early Career: For individuals at the internship and early career stages, the company does enforce %20 quota. This is specifically applicable to summer term internships and is intended to help those still in the learning phase. At this stage merit will be created. So if more underrepresented people are given a chance here, in the future it will create a more diverse pool of potential employees who meet the hiring bar. This does not mean they pick underrepresented people simply for being underrepresented. But what happens is they have 1000s of qualified applicants. They will choose a diverse set of these applicants.

I will give you a case study so you can understand my point better:

Imagine there are 1000 applicants for an internship (on average it requires you to be a 3rd year student with experience in two programming languages)

Many of these applicants will meet the criteria. Let’s say 300 people meet it. Out of those people, recruiters will then select a diverse set.

This means all selected people have met the requirements.


As a woman, it hurts when I got told I achieved what I did because I am a “diversity hire”. Since I did an interview like any else and was able to solve the hard questions that got thru at me. I studied hard, gridded leetcode. Applied early, practiced for interviews a lot. 

You should stop blaming others for your own failures, instead, try to work on your self and have accountability. Just my 2 cents and a rant on being called a “diversity hire”.",2023-08-16 04:50:25

pe541i,Rejected for full time return offer after Microsoft Internship,"Yup, it felt devastating, and worse shocking to hear from my manager that I was not being offered a new grad return offer after my internship this summer.

msj7qr,A comprehensive guide to getting big tech offers from a low ranked school,"**Preface**

I keep most of the specifics ambiguous so that I don't get doxxed but I try to give as accurate of a reading of my position as possible so that you have an idea of what's capable/likely.



**Why listen to me?**

I'm a senior graduating this semester (Spring 2021) at a low/non-ranked university. My school is somewhere between ranks 75 and 150 on [this list](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities) and also between ranks 75 and 150 on [this list](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings). I've interviewed at and gotten offers from 2 of (Google, FB, Apple, MSFT) and am going to be working at one of them when I graduate, and have gotten an offer from a unicorn that is one of (Airbnb, Doordash, Roblox, Tiktok, Square, Robinhood, Coinbase, Dropbox), I've done many big tech interviews so I'm familiar with the process, and I've been in positions where I've struggled to get interviews like many of you.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/aMIDAwB.png) is a Sankey diagram of my Fall 2020-Spring 2021 application season. Note that I have 26 OAs and only 11 next rounds. I don't think it was like this in the past (but maybe someone can testify for/against it) but some companies have started to resume screen *after* the OA instead of before. My leetcode count is 84/214/56 (easy/med/hard), my leetcode contest rating is >1800, and my codesignal is >845 so I'm pretty confident about how my performance on most of these coding challenges go and am familiar with the level of difficulty of the problems I see on these OAs. Despite this, I've only received 42% callback even though I'm confident I've optimally solved all problems in my OAs for 24 out of 26 of them (this is a pretty bold claim but if you take into consideration that the majority of the OAs are *significantly* less difficult than leetcode contests then it no longer seems so farfetched. I mean, seriously, most of these OAs are a joke. Citadel and Tiktok had notably difficult ones, most of the codesignal ones are pretty standardized and the hardest questions you'll get on these are harder meds or easier hards.)



Non-doxxable (at least I hope so) background

I went to a normal public school and did a lot of math competitions and some coding competitions. Didn't really do very much coding at all until my freshman/sophomore year of college though and any of you could probably be better at coding than high-school-me within 3 months.
Had good success at math competitions and many interviewers have actually asked me about these competitions during the behavioral portion of interviews, in addition to them being very very good precursors for developing problem-solving ability prior to digging into CS.



**Note that this isn't a guide you should follow year-to-year, but instead a general outline of progression. If you get lucky enough landing interviews and can manage to skip a year (for example, getting a SWE internship at big N your sophomore year) then you're probably familiar enough with the process to no longer need to follow a strict guide, or you can just follow the advice as a step-by-step process instead of strictly year-to-year.**






**Freshman Year**

This is when you have to be the most resourceful. Leverage any on-campus opportunities you have (other departments, IT offices, friends, family, etc.) to get any internship you can that lets you apply well-known technologies (Java, C/C++, Python, SQL, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, etc.). Mine paid <$10/hr and I wasn't doing it for the compensation; it was a great learning experience and I had supportive and helpful mentors/managers that just wanted to see me learn. Most of these interviews will only be behavioral. Just don't be a dick and you're good.


Make friends, party a lot, and have fun. You're still in college after all. Grades do matter though, so try to keep them up. You just don't necessarily need a 4.0 to get interviews.


**Sophomore Year**

Getting some internship experience and working on personal projects can get your foot into the door for a lot of companies that like to interview *a lot* of people, and most of these can be very helpful as ""feeder companies"" to top companies (name-recognizable so that recruiters have some sort of indication of your capabilities and potential - similar to how companies love to hire from HYPMS + Berkeley/CMU because the average competency of those students is high). Amazon is the most accessible resource I'd recommend since they weigh OA very highly (if not entirely) for receiving interviews and I've been able to get OAs from them with next to nothing on my resume.

Leverage sophomore and diversity internships (**especially** if you actually fit the target demographic). Many top companies have sophomore internships that have lower bars (both resume-screening and interviewing wise) and often lead to an automatic interview for the junior SWE positions. Some of these are, but not limited to: Google STEP, Microsoft Explore, Facebook University, Twitter University/Academy (?), etc.



**Junior Year/Senior Year**

Going to combine these two since they're very similar processes, but instead of applying to SWE internships junior year you're just going to be applying to ""SWE New Grad"" postings senior year.

This is where it starts mattering a lot, and where I started taking the process a lot more seriously. As a student from a low ranked school you're going to have to make every interview count. Hopefully the previous internships you have will help you get interviews for more selective companies. It's hard to fully identify whether my previous internships helped due to confounding variables (covid recruiting season) but I think they did help a lot, since my callback from top companies was much better than in the past, despite the generality of recruiting being much worse this year, especially for new grads.

Make a plan to leetcode regularly, keep track of applications via excel/spreadsheets or notion, and practice behavioral questions. The behaviorals aren't difficult to pass but you should make sure there aren't any common questions that could catch you off-guard; they're just a sanity check. Don't act like an arrogant prick and you should be fine. One of the best resources I've found that is uncommonly used is leetcode contests. They function as a time-sensitive environment (similar to interviews) that doesn't give you a hint at the topic of the problem beforehand. Often times doing random problems or doing problems off a list of topics gives you an idea of how to solve it before you even start, which eliminates some of the skill necessary to identify the approach. Grokking also saves you a ton of time by categorizing common topics and a providing built-in IDE to work with. $80 for a year subscription of it and $35/month for leetcode premium both go a long way.


Resources I've used for preparing for interviews:

* CTCI (everyone's heard of this, it's a bit outdated especially in terms of difficulty of problems, but it's a great start)
* Leetcode (duh)
* Leetcode contests (underrated resource)
* Grokking the coding interview (underused and also underrated resource)



**Miscellaneous Advice**



*Take every hint from your interviewer very seriously*

Often times if you're going down a completely incorrect path, your interviewer will try to help you out with cleverly masked hints. Make sure you're listening to everything your interviewer is saying and don't lose track of anything. It's fine to ask them to repeat what they've said or to just ask for a moment to think. I often do this and while it's extremely important to vocalize your thoughts, I'll take 15 seconds of silence brainstorming every possible relevant approach over spouting nonsense that signals to the interviewer that you have no clue what you're talking about. ""Rubberducking"" is a very useful skill when practicing problems and can help you identify painpoints and obstacles. I wish I was better at simultaneously speaking and processing everything/running through all the possibilities, but I'm not. And that's fine. (As far as I know). Just don't take it too far and have 10 minutes of complete silence between you and your interviewer; pass ideas through them if you need more time to think. You get additional time to think while they're giving their thoughts on your brainstorms.



*Quant/HFT*


This is a topic that everyone seems to be discussing about nowadays since these firms have very high bars and pay a lot. I know a lot of people that now work at these firms from high school competitions (they even start recruiting (maybe not recruiting for positions *right now* per se, but familiarizing talented kids with their names so they know to apply later once they start college) as early as high school, many of these firms came to math competitions and gave out swag/held presentations) and if your goal is big tech then I wouldn't recommend pursuing these opportunities (as a trader) unless you already have previous math competition experience or have already taken probability/stats courses. The interviews are only tangentially related to big tech interviews and you may not have time to prepare for both; they often ask leetcode but also supplement it with probability/stats brain teasers and much more. Some common topics you should be familiar with are bayes theorem, markov chains, general statistics knowledge, etc. They're also a lot more flexible with what your major is; you can major in physics, math, statistics, computer science, whatever as long as you're from a good school and demonstrate competency.



*Learn how to filter information from the Internet*

There's a lot of useful information on this subreddit and /r/cscareerquestions but I've seem some pretty egregious advice being upvoted. Some people will have their linkedin or name attached to their reddit profiles too and I've seen the same people give advice about trading firms or top tech companies while having absolutely zero experience working at or passing interviews for these companies. It's like the blind leading the blind... Learn how to filter this out. If you're hearing something for the first time then do what's in your power to find other sources that verify this information. If it's hard to find anything, it's unlikely that person is giving helpful advice.



*Don't cheat yourself*

When I'm tired or frustrated I'll peek at the solution/discuss page for leetcode problems I'm working on, but it's generally not a great thing to do unless you're completely stuck. I'd recommend spending at least 45 mins on a problem before giving up and reading the solution, and sometimes you can make a lot more progress reading the solution instead of wasting another 2 hours staring at a problem until something pops into your mind.


*Mediums are the best ""bang for your buck""*

I realized pretty early on (maybe ~40 or so problems) that easies didn't teach much, but they're a good precursor if you're uncomfortable with mediums. Easies are probably enough for most sophomore programs/internships. Mediums and easier-hards are generally what you'll face for big tech. Hards can be more common for very selective unicorns.",2021-04-17 03:35:06

1b5jymd,Top CS Schools Show Amazing Career Outcomes Even In Today's Environment,"In the current environment in which entry level jobs are harder to get, I decided to give a check of how graduates from top schools are doing. And much to my surprise, it looks like at aggregate, they are doing amazing and there's no real changes in the job market.

&#x200B;

[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html)

2023 was a rough year for many CS graduates. It was a rougher market than usual.

But then when you check out CMU CS career outcome for Bachelor's, it looks like the job market was booming.

* 13 people to Jane Street. Such an insane outcome here.
* Median salary is $135k and average salary is $150k. This implies the median graduate is getting into top tech firms because top tech firms have median salaries around this range (salary ignores bonus and RSUs).
* 16 to Amazon (13 Amazon + 3 AWS), 13 Jane Street, 9 Microsoft, 7 Google, 7 Meta, 4 Netflix, etc. All insane numbers. And this was in 2023.

And the numbers only get better for those with Master's and Doctor's at CMU. It looks like Jane Street loves CMU graduates (both undergrad and grad).

2023 again was a rough year for CS. But again, the results seem similar to CMU CS

2023 again was a rough year for CS.

But again, great outcomes.

&#x200B;

Ideally, I wanted to track all Stanford, MIT, UCB EECS, CMU and many more. But most schools don't seem to have data for 2023. However, I think the 3 schools I listed is more of an indicator of career outcomes for CS graduates at the top schools.

&#x200B;

I wanted to post this for one reason only.

If you are a high school student who is serious about Computer Science and have the academics to get into top schools, then please seriously consider attending the elite schools. The job market for those who are graduating from schools like CMU for CS is still booming and honestly seem to be doing better than pre-pandemic. Companies seem to really value graduates from top schools especially since the pandemic.",2024-03-03 15:36:02
143tfrg,I feel like I know nothing about coding?,"I was a gamer as a child and always got encouraged to study comp sci by my parents. I’ve taken AP Comp Sci A and AP Comp Sci Principles in highschool which was my first introduction to actual coding. Mainly Java, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Went to a CC for 2 years where I learned C++ and MARIE Assembly. Also enjoyed. Im now a rising junior at a 4 year university majoring in Computer Science and I feel like I’m super behind in terms of building my career as a SWE. Github is incredibly confusing to me, even after watching tutorials. I have no idea what half of the terms exchanged in this subreddit mean. I’m even struggling with the easy level leetcode prompts. An internship right now isn’t even in the question because of my lacking resume. What do I even do at this point? Take a bootcamp course?",2023-06-08 00:02:44
kh1193,How I went from no summer internship to Amazon in 6 months.,"I want to start by acknowledging that I am incredibly lucky for so much of the opportunities in my life. I come from a good suburb outside of Atlanta and have parents who have helped me get to where I am. Right now, I’m a junior in computer engineering at the University of Illinois, which has provided me numerous great opportunities to develop my skills. That being said, I worked really hard to turn around from my shitty situation over the summer.

In March of last year, I was scheduled to go to Israel for an internship program called Onward. Obviously once COVID happened, my plans for the summer fell apart, and I was left with no real opportunities. I was crushed by this reality, but I chose to use it as a motivator to work harder. During the summer of 2020, I decided to start learning anything I could about software engineering by making a series of projects based on my skills and passions, while making money on the side by delivering for Uber Eats. I started by making a Spotify web player using React. This took me about 3 weeks as I was incredibly new to both front end design, but through this project, I learned so much about what web development really is. The next project I worked on was an augmented reality app for Android that turns sample textbook pages into interactive AR demos. I had some experience with AR from a club at my university that taught me how to use Unity and Vuforia engine. This project took me about 3 weeks to make, and I ended up with an Android app and an accompanying website.

From posting about these two projects on LinkedIn, a high school friend reached out to me in late June to help work as a front end developer for his startup. This company was tiny with less than 10 employees and had no products on the market, but I took the opportunity to learn how to work with a team. Even working at such a small operation, I learned so many implicit skills that would prove to be essential in software dev. 

When I came back to school in the fall, I was able to land a position at a company called AGCO working as an augmented reality intern. AGCO is by no means a tech company, but they were trying to reach into immersing technology like AR. When I got there, I did my work to prove what I was capable of until I got used to working at an established company. Once I was comfortable, I tried to use my confidence to propose new directions to take their projects. Having proved that I was willing to work hard and think outside the box, AGCO quickly promoted me to a lead intern role, where I could use my creativity to impact larger decisions on the direction of our projects. Within 3 months of working part time at AGCO, while taking some of the most difficult classes (like systems engineering) in school, I felt like I was ready to be a part of a top tech company like Amazon.

I was shocked when I landed an interview. Even after spending tens of hours practicing LeetCode problems to prepare, I was still nervous going into my interview. During the call, I told the Amazon employee honestly about my experience. I shared what had happened to my internship prospects last summer, and what I did to turn around. I did my best to convey my technical knowledge, talking about things I knew, without trying to seem like I knew more than I really did. When it got to the coding question, I really botched my code, but I asked my interviewer for help to reach a working solution.

I received my offer letter on Friday, and if I’m being honest, I still have to pinch myself every day to make sure this is real. I honestly never expected to land a FAANG out of college or even ever, but I guess the pressure I put on myself to do as much as I can worked out. If you’ve read this far (thank you btw), my advice is to take any anxiety you might have towards your career, and use that to motivate yourself. Don’t ever think you can’t land a job you really want. You’ll have to work incredibly hard to get there, but the day you reach your aspirations, it’ll all be worth it. 

TL;DR
I lost my summer internship in Israel because of COVID, worked on my own projects, and was able to land positions at two companies over the course of the summer and fall. From working hard and pushing myself to be better, I was able to achieve an internship at Amazon.

sdqlqf,Finally got the Offer,"Hey guys, I just wanted to do this post to celebrate and give back to the community.

A year ago I was absolutely destroyed, I applied to hundreds of companies, did tens of OAs, had a few interviews and I failed all of them. Of the hundreds of companies only a few got back to me and I bombed absolutely all of them, from big to small (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Ebay, Paypal and hundreds of other companies). 

I was absolutely destroyed, I had dedicated so much time to Leetcode, to watching hundreds of tutorials online, I had read even more articles. Nothing worked, I felt inadecuate, I felt like I was just not good enough, I had even thought of changing majors. I failed so many OA that I can't even keep track, and each failed interview was more soul crushing that the last, I wasn't even accepted into GSOC, which was my last alternative, and I spent my summer in a melancolic state.

Still I decided not to give up, I got an internship at a very small startup near me, I worked on some other projects and left Leetcode for a while to reignite my passion for coding.

When this recruiting season arrived, I decided to once again try my best. I couldn't even get into the Final Round the last two seasons but I didn't want to give up. I grinded Leetcode (in a much MUCH smarter way), and used all of the lessons from my previous failures in order to give a better performance this go around.

Yesterday I finally got the internship offers from two very big companies (one being Microsoft). This might not mean much to those people who get 10 offers but to me it meant the world.

In short, I just wanted to tell everyone that is reading this to never give up, I know how hard it feels, and I know how sometimes you just wish to give up, but take a step back, relax and try your best next time and I'm sure you can do it.

13tmxh5,Hyper-practical Tips to Succeed in Your Internship,"I messed up a lot as a Meta intern, here's what i learned... Here is my humble attempt to distill 10+ years of tech experience into tactical tips that separate good and bad interns.

My experience ranges from a 3-person startup to 400 people at Pinterest to 25K people at Meta. This advice is designed for full-time software engineering interns working at a company with a well-defined intern program (i.e. at the bare minimum, you have a dedicated Intern Manager).

I'm breaking my advice into 4 sections: (1) onboarding efficiently, (2) working with your manager, (3) writing the code, and (4) working on a team.

# Onboarding efficiently

* Act with urgency to get onboarded. Internships are very short, and you need to ramp up quickly to justify your return offer.
* **Don't be afraid of ""over-asking""**: if you're polite and include context, you will be fine no matter how many questions you ask. Prefer real-time modes of help (like chat) over email.
* Don't rabbit hole trying to explore every part of a codebase or environment. There will be lots of things you don't understand when you enter a massive codebase, and that's ok.
* Aim to merge your first Pull Request (PR) or code change by the end of week 1.

# Working with your manager

* Your intern manager (IM) will play a critical role in your internship experience. **You should have a recurring 1:1 meeting with them**, ideally at a weekly cadence.
* **Make clear that you want feedback**. Tell your manager (and others) that you treat feedback as a gift, and you act on it quickly.
* Instead of asking ""*How am I doing?*"", ask questions that give you more signal like ""*Relative to your expectations of progress at this point, how far along am I?*"" You don't want to be surprised with negative feedback at your mid-cycle or terminal meeting.

# Writing the code

* As an engineering intern, **your raw coding output is, by far, the most important metric**.
* **Keep your code changes focused**. The size of the change will depend on context, but 25-250 LoC is a decent target.
* Make sure that every code change has an explanation. Add a ""context"" section explaining your higher-level goal, e.g. the goal of your intern project.
* **Attach a test plan to show that your code works**. A detailed test plan helps reviewers trust your change and also turns the PR into a high-value artifact. Bonus points if you add a screenshot or video.
* Respond to code review comments quickly (within 30 minutes) and gracefully. Keep an eye on code review notifications.

# Working on a team

* **Broadcast updates to the team regularly**, especially as you hit major milestones. Include a clear description of the problem you're tackling, your progress so far, and your request for feedback.
* **There should be at least one written update that has a permalink**. Imagine putting a portfolio together of your work -- you want to link to something. A standup update is not enough!
* Schedule at least a few 1:1s with the key people involved in the project. Talk to them about your project, but also their broader career. The network you develop at an internship can be one of the key assets.

I added a bit more detail to these points in [this blog post](https://www.jointaro.com/blog/the-ultimate-software-engineer-internship-survival-guide/) if you're interested :) Good luck to all summer 2023 interns!",2023-05-28 00:36:53
xt9e2c,120K job at 18,"Hello! I am currently 18 in community college finishing my internship. Near the end of the internship the company gave me an offer of 120K USD salary for a full time software engineering role. I thought that it would be after I finish college, but the company said I can start January of 2023. I am conflicted because I wanted to transfer to a college to get into software engineering, but the job offer I received is similar to starting pay out of college. I wanted another opinion as I am not sure if I should continue to work at the company or go to college. Also, the company is a top software company internationally.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Hello everyone, I read all the comments and chatted with some people that gave me some solid advice and I saw that a lot of people are thinking about how I am bragging about the situation. First I want to make it clear, YES I am excited to receive this offer, I know it is crazy for a person at 18 to receive this and we are in a recession, but my whole plan had been shifted as I wanted to go to community college for two years, transfer and get a degree. I also have strict asian parents, that dont understand the idea of studying while having a job. I also really had no idea.

I haven't responded yet to anyone down in the comments. I had honestly only been looking for a second opinion on this matter and did not even know the option for full time working with studying (Thank you). I know a lot of people are expecting me to be some genius, or someone who prepared super early, but the truth is nothing like that. For the internship, I had experience in working at a local company for front end development, won some awards in High School, taken AP CS A, IB CS 2, and created some personal projects that meant something to me. I did whatever I saw on youtube, making my resume better, leetcode, and reading cracking the coding interview. By complete luck through the use of mass applying, a company had been willing to take a chance on me. By the end of the internship, the company stated to me that we are extending offers, and they were opening a new department that needed more .NET developers. I know a lot of people are disappointed right now thinking I am something that I am not. I did not have a great resume with many experiences, sure I might have been above average for a person who started CS at my age, but compared to a 4 year graduate, it definitely not that good. I am sure many people are dissatisfied or disappointed and that is why I have not responded until now. I feel like it had been being at the right place at the right time as I feel like I have similar experiences to a lot of people getting internships. If anyone is interested about the specifics in my stats I will state them below.

I'm in the same boat as these people and this really sucks. Interestingly, with all the negativity in the comment sections, somehow it is actually calming in our chaotic semesters. It feels nice to not be the only person who's going through this.

But the one thing that's keeping me together is the fact that I am just waiting it out. I was a sophomore last semester and I'm pretty sure I am applied to 100+ companies, and I started early too. My friends were getting coding challenges, interviews, while I was getting rejection emails after emails. I still knew that somehow I would land an internship even though it was already February. By the time we had arrived in February, my friends had already given up. They had given up to a point where they didn't even go to the career fairs for the spring semester. I still believed so I did. That was the best decision ever because I got in touch with two recruiters, one of them moved forward with an interview and I clutched it. Right before college shut down due to COVID. I waited for the moment and when I got it, everything just started to work out for me.

The point being, it doesn't matter what's going on. By stressing yourself about what's gonna happen in the future, you're stressing yourself two times. Just wait out. You got a rejection? Who cares, apply to two more then. But just don't give up. Nothing's wrong with you or your profile. You just need to wait for your chance and then pounce like a mother\*\*\*\*\*\*.

pwvxok,Took a shit during an interview,"This is a true story and it happened to me today. I was taking a hireview interview for a summer 2022 internship. The interview was split into video responses to questions and a 30 minute mc part with 20 questions.

When I got to the mc questions I started to feel an uncontrollable rage of shit start to push on my ass and I realized it was time to go. I was taking the interview in a study room in my dorm so I had to run back to my room, blast the toilet and come back in time to finish the interview.

These interviews should be more about gauging how a candidate approaches and collaborates on a problem rather than gauging how well they were able to memorize the 500 most common interview questions.

It also just doesn’t make sense. Is posting parody really in the same caliber non-parody posts? I wouldn’t say so. Additionally lots of people here would be satisfied with just a regular post. If you, like me, are specializing in unfunny posts, then your dream job is likely being a karen or a killjoy or again, being a whiny 12 year old on twitter (vroom vroom).

Part of the beauty of computer science is that it’s applicable to just about anything else, what’s with all the focus on parody posts?

rlou6k,"My mother is NOT happy with the internship I got and will NOT stop pestering me with ""tips"" she thinks will help me get into Google or Apple","Context: I recently finally got an internship at BofA. Both of my parents are Software Engineers, neither of 'em work at like these well known tech companies, and every day when I'm home is just endless, endless lecturing about how disappointed they are that I didn't get a job at Apple or Google or some other company. I'm not an amazing student but I managed to get some interviews at some respectable companies, Intel, SAS, Pendo, Cisco, etc. I recently got an offer then signed to BofA after like, 4 months of sending out applications every day, interviewing, doing coding practice, AND going to school fulltime. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy with how my career is coming together especially since I did an internship with Infosys earlier this year 🤮 and was glad to just get ANYTHING, let alone a 130% increase in pay in a year, and the potential for a return offer at a company I would WANT to work for.

After my initial praise, my mom went back to being just as annoying as she was before. You know when you're telling people about how annoying the job search is, how you send out hundreds of applications, or you get a notification for a position on LinkedIn and in like 6 hours there's like 200 applicants? And then they reply with something like ""oh, have you tried applying to <insert like the most selective consumer-facing company you can think of>"" believing they've offered genuinely useful advice? Or better yet ""have you tried connecting with recruiters on LinkedIn?"" That's what the ENTIRE last 4 months consisted of. Sometimes it'll be more or less hostile like ""what is it that the best students have that you don't? Why can't you get a job at these big companies?"" or ""Did you \*really\* apply to Facebook? show me the email confirmation."" It is driving me insane how they'll go on rants for several hours about how when I was young they thought I'd end up being super wealthy and successful only to ""disappoint"" them with where I am now. If I told them ""if I worked at either of the companies you work at you wouldn't be happy"" which is true mind you, they'd throw a fit and consider it the height of disrespect/insolence. They constantly tell me they thought I was special and can't see why top companies don't want me, completely oblivious to the bias they're exhibiting toward their \*son\*. They got into the profession back when there wasn't really as much competition, and while they're paid decently theyI really am not loving the holidays right now and I'm just trying to be happy that I got something nice for summer while getting over the fact that nobody wanted me for spring :/ I'm happy with how I'm maturing into my career, and how I'm developing personally. I don't care if my parents don't see that or that they're kept up at night worrying that their son won't be a millionaire in his twenties, but it's annoying that I'm still dependent on them and while on break I'm beholden to this every day. I just wish they knew that with how irresponsibly they use their power in our relationship they are making it so that one day when I am wealthier I will not want to include them in my life at all.",2021-12-21 21:36:48

Basically, I am looking for some support from y'all. My internship at N\*\*dst\*om was rescinded. It hurt me real bad that I am not doing really well. I mean since I had an internship, I had stopped doing leetcode, and I was focusing on improving my other skills and this came as a bad surprise. The Job market isn't the same that it used to be. In the fall semester, I used to get OAs like anything, but now, I am not getting anything. Is it a regular thing that this happens in the spring? Or is there hope left for me? I know that I should keep applying, but I am not sure if there is the usual thing in the spring semester. What are some of the tips that some experienced csMajors folks would recommend me to do, so that I can get more callbacks? For now, I am applying to companies blindly, how should I change my strategy?

xhvj9g,Why are we not talking about Stripe rescinding return offers?,"I was a Stripe winter intern who initially received an offer, which was later rescinded in July. Last week all interns received a follow-up from their recruiters and many winter interns who originally had offers were told that they were now on a new grad ""waitlist"" (essentially rescinded). I heard that overall, less than half of the intern class (including summer interns) received a full-time offer.

For context, we were told whether we got return offers at the end of our internships in April. This came in the form of a letter of intent, which we could activate any time before October, and the moment we activate it, we had 2 weeks to decide whether to accept the offer letter. Most of us had summer internships lined up, so we waited to open the letter until after our summer internships to decide. In July, I was reached out to by my recruiter telling me that my offer letter would not be valid (rescinded) and they would be doing ""recalibration"" to see which winter interns would get a new offer with new offer terms (including adjusted compensation). We were also told that we would be recalibrated against the summer interns, inherently giving them an advantage, as they knew new grad headcount was lowered and could spend more time working on their project to receive a higher intern rating. Other recruiters didn’t even tell their interns that rescinding was a possibility, they were just told that offers could not be opened until the fall. It was only confirmed last week that many interns would be on the new grad waitlist.

The recruiters were also very untransparent throughout this whole process, not giving any (or conflicting) information regarding the return offers, even when multiple interns had other offers and was waiting to hear back on Stripe. When Facebook, Coinbase rescinded their new grad offers, they got a lot of flak for it, however I have not seen any posts talking about Stripe rescinding their offers. As unfortunate as Facebook barely giving out new grad intern return offers is, they were at least up front about it earlier this summer --- allowing interns time to re-recruit. It feels like we were blindsided by Stripe. Many interns I knew personally were not planning on re-recruiting as their recruiters made it seem like we would only get our offers ""adjusted"" (lower comp) rather than rescinded. Part of that was our fault for being naïve for trusting them, and I understand that it’s a tough situation for everyone in tech right now, but the whole process just felt very untransparent.

TLDR: Stripe just rescinded many of their winter intern offers and gave very few summer interns offers.",2022-09-18 23:31:21

jgt7ce,I Got 7 Internship Offers: A (long) summary of my 2021 summer internship search,"UPDATE: make that ~~8 offers oof~~ 9 offers, big oof

So now that I've finally wrapped up this internship search from hell, I thought I'd just yeet my experiences out there in case it helps someone else.

**About Me**

* Junior at non-target state school in the Northeast (can probably tell which one from my Reddit history)
* Double majoring in Computer Science & Business Analytics
* 3.2 GPA (it sucks, I know)
* Had one internship this past summer (see my flair), a part-time job with my school's IT department, and 2 leadership positions (VP, director) of the 2 largest CS student organizations at my school
* Two projects on my resume, a Twilio text bot and a very basic Android app that just spit out data from an API
* US Citizen

I applied between **early August-early October** and did a bulk of my interviews in September (I actually had 10 interviews in 1 week during September. Do not recommend). I also attended the Grace Hopper Conference & had recruiters reaching out to me because of that

[Here's a Sankey diagram of my search.](https://imgur.com/a/EtbF8Av) Somehow a few applications were not accounted for, according to the spreadsheet formulas I wrote I submitted 129 applications but somehow after multiple thorough counts only 121 were accounted for. I did lose track towards the end but I can assure you that the 2nd round + numbers are accurate at least. On this chart ""OA"" includes both OAs & first round recruiter screens, ""2nd round+"" includes technical screens and final rounds. I did end up canceling interviews & ignoring OAs after getting a couple of offers so that's reflected in my Sankey too.

**All of the positions were SWE internships except for one or two PM ones.**

**Companies I made it to the 2nd/final round with, in no particular order:**

* **AT&T, Vanguard, Toyota Connected, Cigna**
   * I canceled all these final rounds! Vanguard was a referral, Cigna was through GHC
   * Toyota final was sent to most people (Hirevue)
* **Dropbox**
   * Applied online, got all test cases on OA
   * My very first technical of the season. Failed it hard.
   * *Result: rejected after technical phone screen*
* **Google**
   * Applied with a referral, went directly to interviews (most likely because I'd taken a Snapshot in December 2019)
   * God I wish I hadn't messed this one up :c
   * *Result: rejected after back-to-back interview round*
* **iCims**
   * Applied online, iCims does their recruiter screen first and OA as the second round
   * For some reason the OA was a lot harder than last year & I got a 60% on it
   * *Result: rejected after OA even though last year I made it to the final round*
* **Facebook**
   * Applied with a referral & my resume was presumably given to my school's recruiter, who reached out to me
   * Thought I did alright on the technical but I guess my explanations weren't good enough
   * *Result: rejected after phone screen*
* **Salesforce**
   * Got reached out to via GHC
   * Did their final round over a month ago, and reached out every week since asking for an update -- when I said I had upcoming offer deadlines they opened the email and did not reply...
   * *Result: ghosted after final & I look forward to telling them I took another offer because they left me hanging for over a month when they initially promised a week*
* **Oracle**
   * Recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn
   * Got through initial technical & final rounds
   * One of the teams I interviewed already rejected me & the other is still thinking about it
   * *Result:* *~~half-rejected after final~~* ***offer from the other team I interviewed with***
* **Lockheed Martin**
   * Reached out to via GHC
   * They actually interviewed me for full-time because the position they wanted me for required a security clearance that'd take a year to obtain
   * Was told during the final interview that my GPA would be a disadvantage during the decision process
   * *Result: rejected after final (this is the 1 rejection after final on the Sankey lol)*
* **Goldman Sachs**
   * Applied via referral but talked to a recruiter at GHC who took a look at my HireVue (I got all test cases on the OA & did the HireVue) and invited me to a Superday
   * I was entirely out of practice because this was the last interview I did, I couldn't implement merge sort LMAOOO
   * *Result:* *~~have not heard back, oh well~~* ***offer*** *(TBD team in NYC)*
* **Wells Fargo**
   * Applied regularly, interviewed through GHC
   * Interview was objectively good but I did not click with the interviewers imo
   * ***Result: offer*** *(treasury technologies team in Charlotte, NC)*
* **JPMorgan Chase**
   * Applied regularly, got all test cases on the CodeVue, freaked out because I never got a Code for Good invite
   * They invited me to a traditional final round instead. Vibed during the behavioral, thought my technical was a bit sloppy
   * ***Result: offer*** *(TBD team in NYC)*
* **Bank of America**
   * Applied regularly and did the Hirevue, a month later got reached out to via GHC -- told them I already applied, they looked over my app & decided to interview me anyway
   * Interviewed at GHC. 30 minutes, no coding questions, very much a vibe check vs an actual interview imo
   * ***Result: offer*** *(TBD team in NYC)*
* **Red Hat**
   * Reached out to via GHC for an Integration Engineering Intern position -- basically doing infra work, lots of Docker/Kubernetes stuff in partnership with a telecom company working on 5g infrastructure
   * Interviewed at GHC, didn't connect with the interviewer that much tbh
   * ***Result: offer*** *(forgot the team name in Westford, MA)*
* **Capital One**
   * Applied online, their first round is the final round. Mine was originally scheduled for mid-September and I had to push it back twice because of scheduling conflicts lol
   * Case interview was fun! Technical was alright, behavioral I was chilling
   * ***Result: offer*** *(TBD team in McLean, VA)*
* **Liberty Mutual**
   * Got reached out to via GHC, their interview process was the most chill
   * During my final one of the interviewers accidentally muted himself until the very end but the experience was still great!
   * ***Result: offer*** *(TBD team in Seacoast, NH)*
* **Morgan Stanley**
   * Applied online, about a month after I did the Hirevue my recruiter reached out to me saying she also saw me in the GHC database & that my final interview would be happening there
   * Had a good time during the final, did a coding question & a non-coding logic question & some behaviorals
   * ***Result: offer*** *(TBD team in NYC)*

&#x200B;

Ultimately, location mattered to me a lot -- even if we're remote next summer, when considering full-time I want to be in either NYC or the Bay Area. All the NYC offers I got paid pretty much the same thing (including overtime) which I thought was pretty neat, but ultimately after talking to many former interns at all these places, **I decided to go with JPMorgan Chase.**

Since I interned at a financial company this past summer, I was somewhat looking forward to trying out a tech company, but I really did enjoy the more well-rounded experience I got during the internship -- I got to learn more about finance & management too besides coding, and since my long-term career goal is management and not really SWE, I knew that having a ton of banks to pick from wasn't really a downside. I had a very long discussion about the mentorship and professional development opportunities at JPMC with my behavioral recruiter, and they pretty much outdid my last internship in that aspect which I initially thought was impossible, lol.

I feel like this post is long enough so I'll answer questions in the comments & I can give tips in the comments too I guess. Thanks for reading all the way down here if you made it!

EDIT: added that my school is not a target & that I am a US citizen

EDIT 2: totally forgot that Goldman Sachs was via referral oop

sm4sgo,"$30/hour, zero technical questions, huge company, took me, a first-year CS student.","So, I’ll preface this by saying I am a few years older than most freshmen here. I came in with zero programming experience but with a solid amount of work experience in an unrelated field. 

I lurk this sub all the time and see people talking about getting rejected by every internship they apply for. With that in mind, I had no expectations while I applied and thought of it more as a learning experience.

I ended up only applying to one internship; to one of the big 4 accounting firms for a technology intern. And a month later, I got a call and we scheduled times for an interview. Eventually, I got it and as long as I don’t screw up big this summer, I will be able to secure a SWE internship the next summer.

I think it’s important for people to apply to companies outside of FAANG and other big tech companies. 

Don’t sell yourself short if you are older and don’t know shit about OOP, A&DS, etc. Moreover, don’t underestimate yourself if you aren’t coming from MIT, UCB, GA Tech, or the big names.

q8qbqg,I Got 7 New Grad Offers: The Sequel (and tips that worked for me!),"Hello again r/csMajors! Some of you may remember me from my [incorrectly titled post last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jgt7ce/i_got_7_internship_offers_a_long_summary_of_my/) where I received ""7"" (eventually 9) internship offers. After that whirlwind of a recruiting season, I was expecting to have a more laid-back time this year, especially with a return offer from my internship under my belt.

I submitted 41 applications (most of them as a joke) vs my 120+ from last year, sat back, and was immediately overwhelmed by the number of responses I got, so I decided to make another Reddit post.

**About Me:**

* Senior @ large state school (can tell which one by my post history, again)
* Double majoring in CS & Business Analytics
* 3.3 GPA (higher than last year thanks to open notes exams...)
* Two internships, a part time tech support job, 2 leadership positions (VP of one club, director of another) at school, 2 projects
* US Citizen

I tried to do a Sankey, but that quickly got confusing because this time around, a few of my interview processes were through the CodePath career fair & my prior recruiting contacts (I attended Grace Hopper but it only barely helped this time around, mostly because I was being selective with the number of interviews I was doing). So here's some quick facts instead.

**Quick Stats From This Year:**

* **Applications Submitted: 41**
* **Offers Received: 7 (JPMorgan return offer, IBM, VMWare, Asana, Capital One, Deutsche Bank, NBCUniversal)**
* **# of Resume Rejects: only one** (thanks Duolingo)
* **# of Total Rejections: 15** (mostly after OAs & interviews)
* **Interviews Done: 20** (including first rounds & finals)

**Notable Moments:**

* **Rejected from Hubspot after final** because it was my first ever System Design interview and I hadn't studied, oops...
* **Rejected from Microsoft after final** because one of my interviewers insisted my answer was wrong... when it was right... and the code ran with the correct output... whatever. No hard feelings!
* **Visa did 4 technical interviews, and then asked for a FIFTH one** so I finally turned them down.
* **Rejected from Facebook after first phone** because it was my first interview of the season and I hadn't interviewed anywhere in a year.
* **During my VMWare final interviews, one round was entirely systems/OS/networking questions. I'd never taken a systems class in my entire college career.** Even though I answered ""I don't know"" to every question, and had to explain why I didn't take Systems/OS to the interviewer, I still got the offer somehow?
* **Got sent the Google snapshot. I didn't do it. Recruiter reached out to me asking me to do it. I ghosted the recruiter.** I was absolutely exhausted after interviewing so much & Google's process is known to take FOREVER. Freshman me would probably slap current me if she knew though.
* **Asana's final round was the longest I'd ever done, at 5 hours & 15 minutes, and because of time zones it ended at 9 PM my time** but it was also the most enjoyable interview process I've ever done, even when it was so long & ended relatively late.

If anyone's interested I can add a list of every single company I interviewed with this fall in an edit, but since I only applied to 40 places the list would be kind of short. I also don't want to ramble on like I did in my post last year!

**Tips for recruiting?**

* For full time (or even 2nd/3rd internships), **""warm"" email any recruiters you talked to in the past.** Especially if you got far in their process last time, they'll probably be willing to take a chance on you again (make sure to re-introduce yourself if it's been a while). With Facebook I failed the first phone for their internship last year, but I emailed my recruiter this year and his response was ""I was meaning to reach out to you again, just apply and I'll send you the first phone scheduling right after"" so you literally never know.
* **Programs like CodePath and Facebook's ABCS really helped me.** Why? Because I study better with concrete goals/homework and other people, in a class-like setting. Facebook's ABCS is very well suited for sophomores & juniors seeking internships. CodePath's advanced technical interview prep class is suited towards full time since they cover a bit of system design. CodePath is especially great because their homework is directly assigned from Leetcode, and if you don't do it you get kicked from the program. Finish it all, and you get access to their invite-only career fair with 50+ companies. Pretty good incentive to Leetcode if you ask me.
* **Get your application in front of human eyes as quickly as possible.** Even if its not your actual application, visit the company at a career fair or something, and if you get the chance to talk with a recruiter, tell them you applied and are interested in their opportunities -- they're more likely to go and check at your application after. This is how I got ""un-ghosted"" -- talking to recruiters at GHC and the CodePath career fair.
* **SOFT SKILLS ARE IMPORTANT.** If you know how to solve a problem but can't explain your reasoning clearly to the interviewer, they WILL be confused. I think that's what cost me the Microsoft interview this year -- see above, I probably didn't explain my correct solution well enough. On the other hand, though, I can't count how many times I was absolutely clueless during an interview, but my communication & honesty saved me -- see VMWare above.
* **If you're job searching for the first time, get your resume reviewed & PUT IT THROUGH A PARSER.** Human feedback is definitely the first step, but after you quantify your descriptions and find a good layout, put your resume through a site like [jobscan.co](https://jobscan.co), VMock (offered by some schools' career centers), or even the few student-made parsers I've seen on this subreddit to see if it accurately determines your major/experience etc from your resume.
* **Studying for System Design? Use the** [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)**.** I didn't pay for Grokking, the primer had everything I needed to pass Asana's system design portion. If only I'd studied it for Hubspot...
* **Remember, you only need one offer.** It was definitely discouraging to me as an underclassman when I saw people picking between every FAANG and Citadel, but remember if you're starting out, all you need is that first company to give you a chance. Having choices is great (and sometimes scary) but even a single offer & nothing else can open a LOT of doors moving forward, so once you get that first offer letter, pat yourself on the back! You made it through a bunch of filtering to get there, and now the only direction you can go is even higher :)

If you've made it this far, you may be wondering **which offer I accepted** \-- I'm not gonna take up any more space on this post, so **check out my flair on this subreddit for your answer ;)**

Besides that, if anyone has questions about anything related to internship or full time recruiting/handling offers/my experiences/etc, **feel free to ask in the comments and I'll be answering as many as I can!** Since I've gotten 17 offers total in my time at college, I've pretty much done it all at this point so I want to give back and help all of you out too :D thanks for reading!

\--

Brief Edit: After signing my offer this morning I accidentally walked straight into a trash can on the way to class; the comments about trash cans are all my friends hahah

hwf0ps,"Free Full-Stack (HTML/CSS/JS, Node/Express/MongoDB) Web Dev Course","Hello everyone,

I’m Dr. Josh Bastean, and I teach web development and education courses at Coker University. With all the recent insanity, all our courses have moved online. I am in the process of recording the entire content of my Modern Web Development course, and decided to go ahead and post the videos on YouTube, hoping to help more people learn the joys of web development.

I posted about this a few months ago and had lots of great feedback, so I wanted to reach out again to hopefully help anyone who hasn't already seen it.

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fOmsPg4YcdQLREdVWi1Fb04esgmMzarL2Dcux6v27n8/edit) for a brief overview (aka ""syllabus"").

[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQSmIhc0GVPPhpBAC3y6xChtOz3RJ8abN) for a link to the YouTube playlist.

I have already uploaded about 2/3 of the total course videos, and will continue to upload new ones as I complete them. As of right now, I’ve covered all of the front-end and started on back-end with Node.js, Express, EJS, and APIs. I'm currently working on the videos that start the final project (which we build over the last several weeks of the course): a ""Yelp Clone"" website focused on the topic of your choice. I'm doing Comic Books, but pick something you enjoy. We'll be adding MongoDB, Passport, EJS-Flash, pushing our code to Github, and deploying to Heroku.

I hope this helps a few people learn to love programming as much as I do. I started by watching these types of videos, and I wanted to pay it forward to the next generation.

psteig,You're failing coding interviews because you can't communicate,"STOP LEETCODING. It's not the reason you're failing your interviews. 
I'm a former Amazon SDE intern, FB UX consultant, and 2x Google SWE intern. If you still won't take my advice, you're just on here to complain.

So many CS majors don't have communication skills to explain their thinking while they code. You have to realize what your interviewer is thinking and adjust your communication appropriately.

Illustrate your approach. Don't just solve the question:
- ask clarification first to show you're thinking about edge cases
- say what the brute force solution is to show you thought about other approaches and not just coding the first solution that comes to mind
- explain what the optimal solution is before you start coding so it's easier for the interviewer to follow along.

If you can't solve it optimally, say that you KNOW it's not optimal and say what your guess is for an optimal solution approach.

I've passed interviews without coding the optimal solution (LC hard, Google). I've failed interviews even thought my code was flawless (LC medium, Duolingo).



For the record, it's not ""luck"" I got into Google, Amazon, and FB. It's hard work, practice, and more side projects with different groups of friends than I can count. Make some friends instead of sitting at home all day.

In response to the post about school name recognition, I go to the University of Maryland. Smart, hard workers everywhere get into FAANG. The ones that don't work hard at ivies don't get in to FAANG. The dropout rate at ivy leagues is around the same as state schools because not-hard workers are everywhere, just like how smart hard workers are everywhere. Don't discount yourself :)


EDIT:
Some of y'all still aren't getting it. I'm not saying there isn't any luck involved, but ""getting unlucky"" is a rare occasion. After a long aggregate list of interviews, ""unlucky"" is not as commons as you might think. Here is where I've had technical interviews with:

wbetnf,"Don't freak out about not getting f(m)aangmula, citadel, Jane street etc... internships/new grad","I have already graduated I did one internship in Microsoft SWE intern and another internship at a no name company and currently I work at tier 2 cloud company making 134k TC remote mcol 1 yoe and was making 160k in bay area but I moved. I remember when I failed the msft explore interview and the Amazon  SDE intern interview I was depressed as a sophomore. I managed to pass the Microsoft interview the next year. I also have always failed the Amazon final interview lol. 

It's not the end of the world if you can't land one of these top internships or new grad positions. 

Multiple people have personally told me that this subreddit/cscq/blind is damaging their mental health seeing people achieve what they cant but desperately want.

News flash, even if you do no projects and just barely graduate you will find a job even if it's a crappy one. I know a guy who can barely code who got a job out of college for 80k. He can't even do a leetcode easy.

Once you get 2 to 3 years of experience at any company you can apply for SDE 2 roles at FAANG which there are way more of than intern or sde 1. I know a guy who finished his degree at 28 years old at a crappy college worked at a no-name crappy company for 2 years and now is a L3 at Google. 

You can interview for SDE 2 and they might downlevel to sde 1 but you will still make it into FAANG. College isn't your only chance to do it. Some kids in college have told me they have depression seeing their friends get these internships. Never become depressed about this. 

You are probably not even 21 yet and you have 30 to 40 years ahead of you to work and make money. If you can't get into FAANG at 20 you'll have hundreds of opportunities to get in at 22,23,24... Etc

The fact that you're doing computer science and going to college puts you at a better spot than 95% of people. My dad has 30 years of experience as an accountant yet my friend who barely knows how to code (he can't do leetcode easy) has the same salary as him at his first job. 

Anyways enjoy your college. Socialize with people and take care of your health. You're going to be grinding for another 20-30 years anyways.

Also somebody achieving one of these internships doesn't make them better than you by the way. Plenty of assholes in this industry who were not good at anything in their life except for coding/vidya that have a huge ego.",2022-07-29 20:25:58

I had 5/7 on OA1 and 1.5/2 on OA2 (half testcases passed for the last question).

ipr44h,Don't buy into the rat race!,"**TL;DR: Burning out before your career even starts isn't worth it. The pot of gold you're picturing at <Your favorite FAANG> won't last forever, so don't break yourself getting there or feel worthless if you don't reach it!**

I'm pretty new to this sub, so this may have been talked about before, but after reading people's posts on here I felt compelled to write about this topic. Whether you're still in the midst of college or if you're like me and working on finding a full-time job, the CS rat race isn't everything it's hyped up to be. It can be really easy to think from reading this sub that there are 0 jobs available and that if you're not leetcoding 24/7 to land a job at a FAANG you're gonna be homeless. This is NOT TRUE! If you're studying computer science, you have a foundation for one of the most important skills for the rest of history: working with computers. There *is* life outside the FAANGs, and there are many many many ways to have meaningful work outside of the Big Tech companies. In fact, I'd posit that it's *easier* to make bigger impacts at different companies, because you won't just be another cog in the machine. There's nothing wrong with wanting a FAANG job! But don't set all your hopes on it and then get burned when it doesn't pan out. You're a really smart individual who has a lot to contribute and who will be able to find a place where you belong and can make a difference.

Another thing to remember: *we're all at the literal start of our careers.* Please don't overburden yourself with expectations that are way past where you are in life. It's true that you have to start thinking about career stuff pretty early in college, but don't burn yourself out before you even begin the real thing! You have a ton of time to build a solid career. Don't feel like your first job is going to define who you are as a technologist and especially not as a person. Y'all are awesome and you got this!!

&#x200B;

**Edit:** I'm really glad my thoughts have gotten a lot of conversations started! A quick point about ambition/hard work: I am in no way saying that you shouldn't work hard! It is nigh impossible to achieve any kind of success in life without hard work. I wrote this post as a graduating senior at a top-tier CS school who has seen lots of friends and classmates burn out on the job hunt grind. I'm a firm believer that you should try to be excellent at everything you do, and that hard work is one of the only ways to be excellent. My issue/point is that we should be wary of what our definition of ""personal success"" is. If success for you is defined in very very narrow terms, you might be setting yourself up for disappointment down the road. In my experience, having a definition of personal success in life that isn't completely tied to things like where I work has helped me maintain a decent level of joy, particularly in the area of computing. By all means work hard (and in prepping for interviews, practice makes perfect!), but I advise y'all to not tie whether or not you feel like a successful person to a dream job or internship. Hopefully that clarifies where I'm coming from!",2020-09-09 22:50:50

16n4vul,Java is just a beautiful Language,"Here I am, working at a FAANG, and having to read all this code from python and Go, and it’s barely legible. It requires so much digging into layers and layers just to understand what something is. 

I go for a second and look at Java code implementing the same thing, and it’s just instantly so easy to follow. You get to know immediately what every variable is, what every function returns and takes in, what every data structure holds. Just amazing. 

Ironically the #1 biggest complaint is that it’s too verbose. Ultimately, the more verbosity the better. Code in large systems is meant to be read more often than it is written. It takes an extra couple of seconds to hit tab and allow IDE auto-completion to complete the verbosity you were typing, but it sakes hours and hours and hours of dev time when other SWEs come back to read and attempt to understand your code.",2023-09-19 22:50:51
v6aymn,What I wish I knew when I started my career as a software engineer,"When I got my first job as a software engineer, which I am still grateful to this day that they decided to take a chance on me, I made many mistakes. Most of which were avoidable. After my first job, I was at facebook for 4 years and now I help people study for programming interviews.  I have compiled everything that I have experienced and learned into a post for anyone who is starting out their career or may have experienced the same fuck ups.

**Read the stack traces**

I cannot tell you the number of times I would ask stupid questions because I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with my code. I would get stuck and I’d ask the senior engineer on my team for help. He would usually roll over to my desk, look at the stack trace, and read me the answer right off of it…it was just embarrassing.

It was so hard for me to read that block of red text. It felt so intimidating and I just never wanted to do it. BUT as it turns out, reading the stack trace almost always gave me info on what is wrong with my code. If would have just taken the time to read it, I would have saved myself and my team soo much frustration.

**Identify where you are uncomfortable and lean into it**

It took me two months to open a JSON file. I didn’t know anything about them and every time they came up at work I would avoid being involved in the conversation. There was some mental block that came up every time I heard someone say “check the JSON” file. It wasn’t until I ran into it one day and actually opened it that I realized how fucking simple they were. I still can’t believe it took me that long to even learn what they were.

The real lesson here is that avoiding a topic because it makes me uncomfortable hindered my growth as a software engineer. As they say at Replit: “seek pain”.

**Think about the system**

As a junior engineer, I only really thought about the specific files that I was working on. The system was all broken up into pieces in my mind and I never took the time to understand how everything came together. This mindset was fine, but what really allowed me to level up was thinking about the entire system as a whole.  I would write better code and avoiding bugs. Not to mention I became a better communicator with my team.

**Avoid Unnecessary refactors**

It was easy to write off my mistakes and inefficiencies by saying things like “this codebase is a mess”. There was a natural urge to refactor code that I didn’t write. One time, my team spent months working on a complete API rewrite to “clean the codebase”. When we finished, although the code was “cleaner”, nothing measurable had really changed. Management was confused as to why the entire team just spent months rewriting everything to have 0 measurable impacts on the business. I try now to always have a measurable metric that I plan to improve with every major refactor.

**Do not Undervalue communication**

When I was studying for programming interviews, I learned how important it was to be able to talk about my code. I contribute me getting offers at Facebook & Google to my ability to talk through the work that I just did. It was helpful also as I grew to be able to communicate my ideas. As a junior engineer I was just writing code I was assigned. But, as I worked my way up to a senior engineer, I was designing systems and delegating tasks which is where it was important for me to have strong communication skills.

Overall, just think a little bit deeper about what you are doing when you start your career. Everything you are doing is apart of a bigger picture. Don’t be afraid to ask questions (as long as you are positive the answer isn’t in the stack traces). And be confident.",2022-06-06 19:04:52

irrnsy,Anyone else feel like they're behind and never going to make it?,"This 2021 recruiting cycle has been rough. I'm barely getting any responses even though I'm a junior (and this is also my last chance to get a good internship) and I've only got OAs from the companies that send them out to everyone (Akuna Capital, Robinhood, etc) and every now and then I make it one or two rounds in but I always get rejected. Meanwhile my two closest friends have worked at Facebook, Amazon, Citadel and they pretty much never fail technical interviews. I'm out here having done almost 300 questions and still feeling like I can't do a medium in less than 30 minutes. 

I have so much self doubt and I feel like I'm never going to be able to get into one of these top companies. Leetcode just doesn't click for me. If the question is a straightforward bfs/dfs/binary search then I can do it no problem but the problems which require original thinking like ""Largest Rectangle in Histogram"" are impossible for me. I remember spending literally 2 whole days on that question because I was stubborn and didn't want to look at the answer and I still didn't get it and eventually gave up. Just thinking about leetcode and how much I have to practise is giving me anxiety. These problems are hard enough but during an interview it's even harder, I'm sure everyone has felt that.

11bqhux,Things you need to hear as a CS Major,"-most cs students graduate without an internship on their belt; internships do boost, but that’s what they are, boosts

-chances are that if you’re in this sub, you’re somewhat above average in your cs major, not as an ego boost; but don’t compare yourself to people with Jane Street/ FAANG internships, it’s good to be around this sun as motivation and seeing how processes work, but you shouldn’t feel bad because you don’t have Google knocking on your door with an offer 

-for some reason, a lot of students don’t even have the confidence to apply, you can’t let yourself be the barrier to your goal, even if you think you’re not ready enough, you should still do it. this applies to not only internships, but joining clubs/academic honor societies, etc 

-summer internships are not over. They may be scarce, but they’re still there due to offers being regened/declined for other better offers. I talked to someone about this, and they mentioned how it was like “picking up another student’s leftovers”, 100%. In November 2022, I got a rejection email from X company, saying I didn’t “meet their minimum requirements”. Just yesterday they sent an email, saying I “meet their minimum requirements”, and whatnot. My summer internship that I secured I got from applying on February and following up on a career fair. The internship scene is more competitive right when doors open, but as recruiters scramble to find replacements for those who changed their mind, that replacement could be you

pr0cly,You're probably Leetcoding too much.,"While doing a challenge of the day is fun, it's not an effective way to leetcode. Companies rarely tend to deviate from their top 15-20 questions on Leetcode, and for a great deal of these companies these questions either directly overlap or have overlapping patterns. Find the harder problems, seriously attempt them, and take detailed notes on what characteristics led to that pattern. For example largest palindrome substring is a 2D DP because palindromes are recursive problem from a given start to end index. Two variables can be represented as as a 2d Array.

q7k0fr,"This subs obsession with jobs, internships and Big Tech","Hey everyone. I've noticed that a post on this subreddit has about a 0.95 probability of either being about jobs or internships, most noticeably at Big Tech companies such as FAANG.

There's a complete lack of passion and genuine conversation about computer science. This is in stark contrast to how I and many of my peers experience the field and academic life. For example, Big Tech companies are very much frowned upon and often referred to as ""selling your soul"", even by some of our professors. 

I'd like to start a conversation about how you experience your time at university/college. Do you love CS as well? Are you just in it for the money? Somewhere in between? I won't judge. After all, you won't fool me into believing that ***all*** engineers, doctors, and lawyers are strictly following their passion and not whatever makes their bank accounts grow the fastest. 

I for example would love an academic career even if it means never setting foot in a corporation such as Amazon (which to be honest I see as a bonus) if that means I get to do what I love: CS. So what about you?

rulsz1,Quant - Some clarifications and advice,"Alright alright, I’ve got a bad reputation here, but too many people have been DMing me so I wanted to clear some things up.

1. EDIT: Don’t trust popular guides or people trying to sell you stuff

2. The best way to learn math and probability is to start with the fundamentals. I recommend Aclumus by AOPS. Create an account, set difficulty to super hard, grind until step 3.

3. Take the putnam, at this point if you find the putnam unbearable quant may not be for you. All of my co-workers love contemplating problems like these on our free time and genuinely find problems like these interesting. If you find math unbearable you’ll find quant unbearable (disclaimer: I worked at HRT so culture might be different)

4. LC is actually not that great for learning. I recommend going through the entirety of train.usaco.org (again fundamentals). The trick with this website is that it doesn’t let you progress until you solve the next problem, meaning you should be spending days or weeks on some of the harder problems. This will siginificantly improve problem solving ability and when you solve a problem it’ll give you a big dopamine kick. Grind until step 5.

5. Start doing past competitions on usaco.org. I personally got to platinum but being able to solve gold problems is enough for all FAANG and Quant interviews (and yes this is for high schoolers lol). If you find these problems fun try ICPC too

6. Do you go to a no-name school? I did too. UIUC for Math. To get interviews simply get something on your resume that’s world class. Some possibilities: Putnam score, ICPC medal, good first-author publications, FAANG internship. (I went the publications route)

7. Finally follow all your usual interview advice, smell good, eat a mint, don’t sexually harrass your interviewer etc.

8. Profit, literally. New grad TC is anywhere from 300 (Akuna, DRW, WQ, Optiver, IMC, Jump) up to 600 (JS, 2S, Shaw, HRT, Radix, Head)

9. Don’t do cocain off a stripper’s ass. Great in the movies but not great irl.

Oh one more thing, if you’re practicing quant interview problems off some book or guide you’re doing it wrong. Fundamentals fundamentals fundamentals. Learn transferable skills. If you want interview specific practice just apply to some tier 3 firms. There are so many quant funds its crazy. Also check this link but might be outdated. [[Quant internships]](https://github.com/quantprep/quantinternships2022)

Edit: Lots of debate between FAANG and Quant. Let me say this, all roads lead to ~~Rome~~ money. The point of this post is to emphasize that you need to work on FUNDAMENTALS. Don’t do specific interview prep or try to find out interview processes. If you do these things and find out you hate quant, FAANG is trivial with this skillset I promise. “Don’t build a house on sand” - paraphrased from some bible story",2022-01-02 22:52:03

ln6hv0,Let’s stop talking about internships for a sec so I can tell you this story,"So just as some context I’m on a sports team at a college. There aren’t many athletes that are computer science majors at my school so when you find someone, it’s nice to have them around. That’s what I thought.

So when I was a freshman, there was this other guy freshman who was studying computer science and I figured we could be friends. We had shared friends and we were on the same team so I sat next to him in class. This kid would not even acknowledge I was there. On my birthday, he didn’t wish me a happy birthday, say hi, or even look at me. BUT the day before a long ass project was due, he’d be like “hey what’s up?!” and then text me later that night for the entire project. I would just pretend like I didn’t start it and stuff. He then went on to tell everyone on our team that he hated me and I was an asshole with no context. I was also called antisocial by other members on the team because I studied a lot. Horrible start to college. Honestly, I was miserable.

I am now a junior. I have not talked to this kid since that class but my friends told me that he got such bad grades and failed so many classes that his parents made him quit the team and drop out of cs and now he’s a communications major or something.

I’m just saying that when people call you nerdy, antisocial, or whatever, just remember your hard work does matter and you’ll be the successful one in the end! Especially in college it can be really easy to do whatever to fit in but just stay true to yourself and keep working hard. I believe in you.",2021-02-19 04:18:47
ifxepi,Reminder that FAANG is not the be-all-end-all of CS,"I love that there are communities such as these to help CS students in their school and their careers. Lots of invaluable advice and insight can be taken from places such as these.

It's an unfortunate reality that there will be toxicity in basically any community you go to. In CS, that toxicity often tends to take the form of extreme pride and arrogance. The idea that you're a failure if you don't get that internship/job at one of the most prestigious companies, that you're doing something wrong if you're not leetcoding 23/7, and conceited and egotistical people making you feel inferior to them bc they've had an internship at a Big N.

I don't know who needs to hear this, but absolutely none of this speaks for your worth. I know the race can get to people's heads and it's very very easy to feel like you're not good enough if you're not achieving ridiculous goals. This impacts people's sense of self worth, confidence, and gives them impostor syndrome.

I know several people who work both at big tech companies and not. After you break it into industry, it stops becoming such a huge deal. I know people who make less money at smaller companies, who get messages from recruiters at Google, Facebook, Netflix, w/e, but wouldn't leave for the world, because they're happier there. At the end of the day, being a software engineer will still mean you're one one of the most well-valued professionals in the world. You'll be well off, whether you get a FAANG-type job or not.

Working in this industry isn't just about prestige. It's finding a place where you can have a good work-life balance, a place where you can enjoy financial stability, and most importantly, a place you actually look forward to going to every morning.

If you don't get the job you want right out of college, it's not the end of the world. You work in industry for a few years, better yourself, keep learning, and never stop trying. It'll happen for you sooner or later.

And please, lift each other up, help each other in this quest, don't tear each other down. You don't know the person on the other side of the screen, you don't know what damage you might be causing them when you tear them down to make yourself feel better.

No, it's not Amazon before anybody asks. But, I think it is actually better. I don't really care about the name so much and the pay is insane, over $50 an hour. 

I got extremely lucky. I am not going to end this post on a ""just keep trying"". Hearing that only hurts if you actually do fail. What I will say is that shit sucks right now. No person should have to submit over 50 applications to get a job. Especially the people on here who are all so diligent and accomplished. Good luck readers.

1866jy8,Rejected from 2 dream opportunities because of hacker rank,"Just blowing off some steam as I gotta talk about how much I hate hacker rank tests. For some background, I am in my senior year in university for CS with a minor in business, I took 2 years off school to work at a startup company making mobile apps as a full stack engineer. I am deeply passionate about gaming and game development, and I am looking to become a game developer, and eventually make my own game studio.

1. Riot software engineering internship

Spent so much time tailoring every aspect of my application and resume to get this internship, contacted 20 previous interns at Riot, a senior engineer at Riot, 2 engineers at Epic Games, and had them all review my resume/application, then applied immediately after applications opened. I even made a 3D video game where you play as one of the characters in league of legends and walk around exploring my portfolio projects in game.

This did get me past the application stage and as someone who was ignorant to leetcode tests I thought that just getting an email back was going to be the hardest step; I thought the coding test was going to be the easy part because I'm confident in my skills as a developer. I got the hacker rank test, it was 5 difficult questions that built off of each other with a 2 hour time limit, I was a fool to not practice more before hand, but, I still completed 4 questions with all passing tests, and did not start the 5th. I literally spent like 25 minutes rereading the 5th question because it was so difficult to understand, I swear they did this on purpose, I couldn't even understand what they actually wanted so I couldn't spend time thinking of a solution. Regardless, I thought 4/5 was pretty good, but apparently I wasn't even worth getting an interview, I just received an impersonal ""better luck next year"" no-reply email from hacker rank, which I cannot even do as a senior. Feels bad.

2. 2K games engineering graduate program

Damn this program looked awesome, one of my favorite game publishers, a 21 month program (full time work, paid!) where the first 3 months are hands on training in game development in unreal engine, then they place you in one of 2K's studios, rotating you in a different studio every 6 months so you get a feel of what you like to do, then they (hopefully) hire you permanently afterwards. What an amazing opportunity. The job emphasized the necessity to be proficient in C++, from my background I did not do much C++, so I spent many hours grinding and learning everything I could know about it. I got past the application stage, got my hacker rank test, it was 1 hour time limit, 7 multiple choice questions about C++, then 2 leetcode questions. I am confident I got all 7 multiple choice correct, but the struggle came from the first leetcode question. I spent 30 minutes, half of the entire duration of the test, just re-reading the god damn question, the examples that were provided contradicted themselves, it was extremely long, and all in all made no damn sense. If I was given this as a requirement in a real job, I would throw it back and ask the person to rewrite the whole thing. Once I finally understood what the output was supposed to be, I coded up a naive solution in the last 10 minutes and passed half the tests, the other half were testing for efficiency, which my algorithm wasn't. I literally feel like there was no amount of preparation I could have possibly done to have passed that test, I feel totally cheated. I sent a heartfelt email to the recruiter asking for the chance to continue to the take home test, and was ghosted. I'm pissed, and depressed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I know that I shouldn't be worried about 'dream' opportunities and should focus on getting anything, and that is exactly why I haven't stopped applying to places. I've applied to about 60 places so far, which may be rookie numbers to some of you, but I take time to tailor each application to each job. It's just a huge bummer to miss out on these opportunities that are perfect for me, and that I know I will do an amazing job at. Part of why it bothers me so much is it seems like it's so much harder to get into game development. I can hardly find any game development companies that hire early career game developers, it's always like senior 6+ year unreal engine developers, and then they just hire all their new associates from internships and graduate programs, then your opportunity is lost.

&#x200B;

**TLDR;** Spent a lot of time tailoring applications and networking for 2 dream game development internship/graduate jobs just to fail to horribly worded HackerRank leetcode questions despite knowing I will be capable of doing the job well.",2023-11-28 20:59:53
15l888x,STOP only doing web app projects,"I see ppl on this sub 90% of the time only talk about projects around creating a website. That’s fine but then don’t be confused when a SWE role that has nothing to do web dev ghosts you. Or even why you’re not getting interviews because you’re resume shows only interest and experience in web development which imo is over saturated.

Reimplement an interesting/somewhat complex algorithm, do a ROS project for you robotics ppl, implement a reinforcement learning algorithm if you’re interested in data science/machine learning. Not only will it show your true interests but also distinguishes your projects from thousands of duplicates.

176eq5e,Unpopular opinion: School prestige matters more than any other factor,"This isn’t meant to be a dooming post, but I’m hoping it’s informative for people who are trying to break into the industry and not understanding why they keep getting rejected. Too often I see people say “just do more projects/internships” when for lots of people that already have this, more of the same won’t help at all.

I’ve seen countless students with 0 projects or internships get personally recruited by top companies simply because they go to a top 10 CS school in the US. I’ve also seen countless students with incredible projects and multiple FAANG internships struggle to get interviews because they go to less prestigious schools.

It’s gone so far that on lots of job applications, there is a university dropdown selection where you can either select “Harvard”, “MIT”, “Stanford”, 5 or 6 other universities, and then “Other”. Companies literally screen out students who don’t go to top universities. 

I understand why companies do this; those schools attract top talent, and it’s an easy way for them to hire strong students/graduates without having to review tens of thousands of resumes.

Again, I’m not writing this post to complain; I’m writing this because I see so many people posting here wondering why they’re not getting jobs when they have past projects and internships.

There is a huge economic barrier for people who can’t afford to go to top schools, which makes it difficult for getting jobs at the entry level. As much as it sucks, if you’re struggling to get a job at one of your dream companies, you might need to first get a full time role at a smaller or mid-sized company, and then once you’re 2-3 years in, companies won’t care about school name and you’ll have a better shot at scoring an interview.

Also, consider getting your Master’s. People on this sub preach that a Master’s won’t help you, but if you get it at a top 10-20 CS university (which many companies are willing to help cover), you will be amazed at how many doors it opens.

TL;DR - If you find yourself struggling to get internships/new grad jobs, even with experience and projects, just know that school name plays a bigger aspect than most people realize, and you might have to work for a few years or get your Master’s before you have a shot at your dream job.

i just graduated from a big 10 school like a week and a half ago with no job offer and no internship experience. i've been applying to like 5 jobs a day and a recruiter reached out to me on linkedin for a contract for a big shipping company that seemed like a sure thing until i took the hackerrank which i bombed spectacularly.

i'm 26, it took me 8 years to get through undergrad. i failed out of mechanical engineering and the university twice because of struggles with bipolar disorder, BPD, ADHD, and addiction. because of that my overall gpa is poo and i didn't make a ton of friends or connections in CS and my last chance to do so got rona'd. my cs education has been so spotty and spread out over the years that i just feel like i don't know how to program.

my last semester i stayed clean the whole time and ended up getting a 3.5 gpa in like the hardest classes i've ever taken, but that gave me zero time to grind leetcode or read the crack book. i look at all these 20yr olds that have internships at FAANG companies and feel like i can't compete at all.

tl;dr the imposter syndrome is kicking my ass and i'm starting to worry it's not imposter syndrome and i just suck. i cried after that hackerrank. sorry for rambling, looking for advice or encouragement",2020-12-24 18:38:26

md4106,Idea for people without internships,"Last summer I got screwed over had internships cancel and drop me from the interview process because of Covid. So I had to do something to get on my resume for the summer. I reached out to a small business owner I knew and offered my help for the summer for free. I was able to get some great experience and build my resume. Now I have a great offer that ultimately was because I had the experience last summer. 

First off keep searching and use this as a backup until it gets too late for anyplace to hire you.

So here’s the idea: If you don’t have anything for the summer reach out to a small business honor and offer to work for them for free. Offer build them a website or overhaul the one they have. Offer to make them a in-house program that solves a problem they have. Find a inefficiency they have and solve it. If you really need the money you can work a second job that won’t help your resume and do this on your free time. They won’t care what hours you work or how fast your making progress since you’re doing it for free. Ultimately the cost of doing this is low compared the the return you will be able to get by having a internship on your resume with these skills. It’s essentially moving some personal projects over to job experience. 

TLDR: Help yourself out by helping a small business owner",2021-03-25 17:47:39

155ur6y,What I learned from my internship: I don’t want to be an SWE,"A few weeks left of my internship.  I got to try on many different hats from SWE,  application engineer, business analyst, product owner.  I discovered I don’t like coding all day and not speaking to people.  I kind of liked going into the field and configuring practical applications in the retail space as an application engineer but can’t see myself doing it long term.  I like working with data (sql and PowerBI), improving processes, finding out ways how to create business value using technology as a business analyst.

I loved working in the product owner role where I’m collaborating with different teams both internally (engineering, merchandising, finance, operations) and externally( stakeholders and business partners) to move things along and bring the vision to reality.  Loved working with our business partners Samsung and Apple leveraging their technology to influence and change customer behavior,  streamline operations to run frictionless and more efficient.  

What I especially loved was seeing the technology in action in the end and how it made an impact on customers, stakeholders and bottom line.

So product owner it is.  I want to build my domain knowledge in the tech retail spacd.  It’s nice to finally have a focused career goal.  

TLDR; ending internship…I came in thinking I was going to be an SWE but now want to be a product owner.

I'm 33 years old, worked in the live music business for about a decade before deciding to go back to school during covid for a CS degree. Happy to say I graduated in February 2023 and I even got an IT job about a year before that.

I was laid off in December from that job, applied to about 65 job postings, had 4 interviews, no offers. I have a mortgage and a 2-year old daughter, so taking low paying internships isn't an option.

I decided to swallow my pride and go back to my old career. I'm analyzing all the things about it that burnt me out before and focusing my effort on not only doing the job, but using what I've learned over the past few years in school and working in IT to build solutions to those problems.

Moral of the story, especially for you graduates in your early 20s, if you're not getting jobs in tech, go work for a small company and build your portfolio by building something that can help that company and therefore, YOU. The job market is shit, so make lemonade.

Also, don't rely on a salary alone. Get a reputable financial advisor who will  help you with investing. I got one at age 22, and it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.

We don’t have a lot of girls in CS classes and this makes it very hard to meet girls  compared to students in other majors. I don’t know how many of you can relate but given that we spend much of our time I computer labs, grinding Leetcode , working on side projects and so on, I don’t get exposure to more women and as a result I haven’t had a huge dating window, let  alone get a girlfriend.

If you're really driven and want an internship, then take advantage of every single application that you can to find one that sticks"" and ""if you do not end up landing an internship as an underclassman, it's okay. Internships are not the end-all, and whether you are or are not selected for an internship does not delegate self-worth.""

Most of these apps don't open until early Fall 2021. However, the earlier you have these opportunities on your radar the more likely you are to be able to take advantage of them.

Good luck to you all!

159q9od,[update] New Grad with no job -> has job,"Hi Everyone!
I was the one who wrote this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/14nwiei/new_grad_with_no_job/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2): 

I know I never responded to the comments but I read all and I really appreciated the responses, (the harsh ones hurt though). One of the comments said to get mental help and i did. I got counselling for my school and that honestly really helped.I really poured myself into job hunting. Job hunting is one of the worst experiences to ever exist and its one of the most demoralizing things to do and it really really really sucks.  I picked up a part time job. 

And finally, finally, fucking finally got a job offer today for 85k. I'm super grateful. and I really wanted to share it with everyone. 

Other new grads out there, I'm letting you know there's hope and take the necessary steps to protect your mental health. 

thanks everyone",2023-07-26 00:26:34

yvgor9,Guide: How to actually get good at leetcode,"So I've seen a lot of posts recently asking how to get good at leetcode. I see countless posts from beginners who don't know how to start and panic at not being able to solve easies despite taking a ds&a course. I see posts from those who have done 200+ questions but still can't reliably solve mediums on their own. As someone who recently went through the journey of going from zero DS&A knowledge to interview-ready in 4 months. I figured I'd write a step-by-step guide of what I did to help everyone out. This post is not intended to be a philosophical discussion on whether leetcode is appropriate for interviews, this will be an actionable guide with concrete steps that you can follow.

**Who am I and why you should listen to me:**

I have to preface this guide with my background so you can trust that I know what I'm talking about. I'm a recent mechanical engineering graduate from a Canadian university who self-studied computer science and web development and landed a software engineer role. Part of this self-study process involved learning DS&A and leetcode which took 4 months by studying 3-4 hours a day, 6 days a week. At the start of my journey, I couldn't even solve easies. After these 4 months, I'm now able to consistently (90% of problems) solve mediums in ~20 minutes and hards in ~35 minutes on my own. I also usually solve OAs (tiktok, SIG, IMC, blackrock, pure storage, c3 ai, cisco, tower research) with 100% test cases, and scored 822 on my one codesignal gca attempt (not the best, ran out of time debugging q3 lol). I've done 6 leetcode questions during onsite interviews and have optimally solved all of them. I'm not trying to flex, just trying to show that what I'm saying is credible.

**My overall strategy:**

As a preface, the goal of this guide is to deeply understand the techniques needed to solve LC problems at an abstract level and implement your abstract solution quickly. My approach is based off how technical material is taught in university courses. What they do is teach a strategy/technique at an abstract level, walk through solving guided example problems using that strategy, have students practice through assignments and practice finals, then apply what you've learned on the actual exams. My overall approach to learning is breadth -> depth -> breadth. First learning what you’ll be learning (breadth), learning those specific topics with a full and deep understanding (depth), then tying the specific topics back into the big picture and how they relate to each other (breadth). I also write summary notes after I read through a topic, I find this lets me take all the information and form a generalized abstraction of the topic along with critical specifics, and if I’m able to write a page of well-structured notes using my own understanding of what I just learned then that means I understand the topic deeply. I also re-read these notes at the end of each of the 4 steps for spaced-repetition effects or when I need to jog my memory since re-reading my own written notes takes me back to the mental state I was in when I first wrote them.

**Step 1: Learn Python (or Java or C++):**

The first step is to get familiar with your programming language of choice. I chose Python and recommend you do the same if you have time, but if you’re in a rush then just use whatever you’re familiar with as long as it’s acceptable in coding interviews (Python, Java, C++). Python is the least verbose language and most similar to plain pseudo code, and in a timed test every minute counts. It lets you spend less time on implementation and more time on figuring out the abstract algorithm which is where the bottleneck is for coding interviews. You need to be familiar with a language before you can learn DS&A so you can concurrently learn the language implementations of data structures and algorithms. To learn Python I just went through the W3 Schools’ guide on syntax and overall language specs (dynamic typing, garbage collection, etc.). The official docs are good as well but they have a lot of stuff that you don’t need for coding interviews. I also took notes on the syntax (6 pages). This step took me 10 hours split across 3 days.

**Step 2: Learn DS&A:**

With DS&A you need to learn how each data structure and algorithm works deeply at an abstract level. For me this meant visualizing a gif of the algorithm in my head, learning the time space complexities of operations the DS/A supports and why they are what they are, learning how the DS/A handles edge cases, and writing an implementation in Python. The resource I used was the interactive ebook PythonDS3 by Runestone Academy. It’s full of word explanations, diagrams, and live code in an editor that you can play around with. It first explains each DS/A at an abstract level, then shows you the Python implementation. I would go through a page/sub-section, think about the concepts deeply and piece everything together in my head, then write a page of notes on that topic. As a preface, I used Tech Interview Handbook’s study plan to figure out which topics are important and I need to take notes on, and which are not which I would only read. I also used Tech Interview Handbook’s topic-by-topic cheatsheet to confirm time and space complexities and how the DS/A is used in problems. This step took me 6 weeks, and I tried to finish 1 subsection per day. Each subsection only takes 30 minutes to read, but I would reread, think deeply about what I read, google stuff I didn’t understand, sometimes watch a youtube video if I still didn’t understand it fully, and write my summary notes which all took about 3 hours per subsection.

**Step 3: Learn Leetcode techniques/strategies (patterns):**

So here is the most important step that I see a lot of people get wrong. People tend to jump straight into practicing leetcode problems and end up having to do 300+ problems to get interview-ready. The issue with this is that LC problems are designed with particular established strategy in mind, and if you’re trying to learn the strategy from particular problems then that’s very inefficient. This would be like in calculus, trying to learn the chain rule, fundamental theorem, monotonic convergence by jumping into doing calculus practice finals, or in linear algebra, trying to learn matrix operations, finding eigenvalues, or SVD decomposition by jumping into doing linear algebra finals. You can clearly see how inefficient this approach is. Furthermore, many of these strategies came from breakthrough papers in computer science that took PhDs to come up with and have many pages of rigorous proof. Trying to come up with these strategies from scratch or induction from LC problems would require you to be a genius. Now you see why so many people get stuck at this step, they’re doing it completely wrong. The resource I used for this is Grokking the Coding Interview and Grokking Dynamic Programming by Design Gurus and Educative.io (no affiliations). These courses are paid but the information is truly worth the money, as it’s by far the best resource I’ve found for this step and the time and energy you’ll save compared to using other resources is well-worth it. If you really can’t afford it then I’ve heard good things about Leetcode Explore cards. There’s also a Hackernoon article on coding interview patterns that summarizes the patterns taught in Grokking, but they’re pretty succinct and don’t offer the depth of information that I think you need. You could pair that with the CSES Competitive Programmer's Handbook to pick out and learn the specific strategies covered by Grokking. I basically used this the same way as with DS&A. For each pattern, I read the primer, read the solutions to the first few problems, tried to solve a few of the later problems in my head abstractly (5-10 minutes of thinking) using the strategy taught in the first few problems, then read the remaining problems (each pattern has 5-14 example problems). Once I finished a pattern, I would piece together the information into an abstract strategy, the situations in which that strategy can be used, what makes the strategy more/less efficient compared to other options, common characteristics in problems where I should consider this strategy, along with its edge cases and time/space complexity, and write down my page of notes. This is probably the most difficult step of the whole plan as you’ll be flexing your brain for abstract thinking and logical reasoning. It'll likely be very difficult to think that hard but you’ll develop a very strong foundation for solving LC problems later so it’s well-worth the mental pain. I would try to aim for fully learning 1 strategy per day which took anywhere from 3-5 hours and there’s around 24 strategies total (Grokking the Coding Interview + Grokking Dynamic Programming). For dynamic programming, there’s a section in Grokking the Coding Interview but I found it confusing and it only contains 1 DP strategy, so I recommend skipping that one and once you’re done GTCI start Grokking Dynamic Programming which explains that strategy better and also has 5 more strategies.

**Step 4: Practice**

At this step, you should know your Python syntax, understand DS&A, understand the ins and outs of each strategy and should be able to come up with the solution in your head to most LC easy’s in 5 minutes and mediums in 10 minutes. The point of this stage is to actually practice the full problem from prompt to code and practice talking out loud (or whisper if you need to be quiet) like you would in an interview. The resource I recommend is Grind 75 grouped by weeks with 70-100 questions total. Go through each question and try to solve it on leetcode. Don’t look at the solution until you’re stuck for 30 minutes, meaning you haven’t made any progress in your logic for 30 minutes, making logical reasoning steps in your head doesn’t count as being stuck. To actually solve a problem, read the prompt, visuals, examples, and input ranges. Start with a brute force and solve how you would do it intuitively, typically this means start on element 0 and perform steps until you reach a solution. Then make logical deductions based on what you’ve been given in the prompt and how your brute force looks (careful, the brute force might be a red herring to the actual optimized solution). Use your logical deductions and match onto a few potential strategies that you think have a high chance of working and investigate how each of those strategies could be used to solve the problem. Sometimes you'll need to combine strategies in series or parallel. If you can’t identify any, just try each of the 24 strategies one by one in your head, even if this fails it’s all good practice for your logical reasoning skills. You can think of the problem solving process as a graph traversal, where you have your starting state as one node and your goal state as another node. You can add strategies as edges onto your starting node to transform the starting state into a new state. Check if the new state is your goal, if not then add another strategy either onto your new state or your original state and repeat until you reach the goal. Once you have the optimal solution in your head, write down your algorithm in comments above the function in 2-4 lines along with the time and space complexity. Writing the algorithm down takes me a minute, but it saves me 5-10 minutes during my implementation as it lets me focus purely on implementing my algorithm into code by referring to the text when I get confused without having to think “what was my algorithm doing at this step again?”. Initially, you’ll probably be slow at implementing the algorithm in code and run into a bunch of Python syntax errors. I’ve spent hours debugging my code in single questions at the start, it’s normal and just use this to learn the quirks of Python. After implementing, I check over my code once for silly mistakes and then run through it with one of the example test cases line-by-line, keeping all the variables in my head (use comments if needed). Then I submit and fix my code if the submission failed. Once the submission passes I go look at the solution (either official or in the comments), try to find “easy-to-understand” and ignore the one liners. If I still don’t understand the algorithm I’ll watch the Neetcode video for it then try to implement it. After around 20 easy’s I started solving them (getting the first optimized code solution which may have syntax bugs) in 15 minutes. After the first 20 mediums I started solving them in 30 minutes. Hards are usually a combination of strategies and some (mostly greedy algorithms) you just need to memorize but there aren't too many and so I can usually solve them in 40 minutes right from my first hard unless I just don’t know the trick. I did 2-4 problems a day (2-5 hours daily) until I hit 50 problems and that was when I felt confident I could solve 80% of the problems on my own in a reasonable time and the remaining problems if I was given a hint or two which is more than interview-ready.

**Bonus step: Maintain your skills:**

Given how common switching jobs is in SWE due to either increasing TC or layoffs/pip/firing, and how interviews in SWE are bottlenecked by LC problems, it makes sense to try to retain your knowledge such that you only need a week or two to prep the next time you interview. I’m planning on doing 1-2 LC problems per week on Sundays which I feel like after all this prep to build a strong foundation and deeply understand the material should be enough to retain my knowledge. My solving speed will probably drop, but I estimate next time I prep I’ll only need to review my notes and do 30 LC questions to get me interview-ready. This will probably only take 2 weeks time instead of months. 1-2 questions per week will only take 1-2 hours per week which is nothing for the reward you get by staying near interview-ready. I’ll have to try it out to see if this is enough, but it seems like it should be.

And that's the end. If you made it this far, try implementing these steps and let me know how it goes. I hope you find similar success that I have found following these steps.

1b514sl,I accepted an offer for 50K without negotiating. Did I sell myself short?,"Hi, i’m a May 2023 new grad. After months of searching, I recently accepted an offer as a Full-Stack engineer at a small company, and have been working there for a couple of months now. Overall it’s been a fantastic experience. My team is nice and welcoming, the company culture is great, and our tech-stack is super interesting and I’m learning a lot. 

Unfortunately, whenever I talk to people about my job, one thing that seems to keep resurfacing is my salary. From the start, i’ve been open about it (mainly since I don’t really want to propagate the idea that workers shouldn’t discuss salaries). But almost every conversation I have about it, whether it’s with my friends who also work in COMPSCI, or family, people always ask why I accepted for so low. Or why I didn’t negotiate, or why I didn’t ask for or get stock options or equity, etc. It’s made me feel like maybe I shot myself in the foot.

Personally, the reason why I didn’t negotiate is because the market is and has been shit for everyone (as we all know), especially new grads. And after months of LeetCode and applying with no progress, I didn’t want to throw this opportunity away. Even if I have to live with my parents for a couple of years to build knowledge and experience. Of course I wish I got paid more, but I do with what I have.

Also if I’m being honest, I was super nervous and didn’t know how to negotiate professionally without throwing away the opportunity, but my overall reason is more aligned with the first reason.

What do you think?

180rkd3,Leetcode is irrelevant for new grads this year. Change my mind,"I solved 330 LC problems. I sent \~200 applications online (big tech, Silicone Valley startups, etc); none of them proceeded me to the next round. Only companies (local + F500) from my uni's career fair gave me interviews.

Don't focus on LC if you are looking for an offer this year. Most of the companies giving LC for interviews are receiving thousands of applications. Very likely your application is not even read. Instead, focus on finding local or non-tech companies or attending small to medium, not-so-well-known career fairs (you already see GHC).  


P/S: Also, build an interesting personal project with buzzwords like AI, blockchain, etc. I know it's cliche but recruiters at non-tech or local companies act like crazy when hearing those words.

kglndo,I've been on over ~20 coffee chats the last 5 months - here's everything I've learnt so far :),"I’ve had the chance to meet tons of awesome tech professionals over the last 6 months.

I’ve been curious to find out more about their backgrounds and listen to them describe what it is that they do on a day to day basis.

The number one benefit of doing this has been that I’ve been exposed to a variety of new industries, roles, and opportunities.

I’ve learnt about *why* people have made certain career transitions, how they’ve successfully learnt new skills, and what advice they have for others hoping to do the same.

All I’ve been basically doing is going on coffee chats (over Zoom, of course). And sharing them with everyone on the internet.

Here's what I've learnt so far & I hope you can also leverage coffee chats to advance your software career.

**What is a Coffee Chat?**

A coffee chat is an informational interview where you find out more about a person’s professional experience and goals.

If there’s only one thing you get from this article, it should be the following: a coffee chat is not a place for you to ask for a job. It may certainly help you land a role in the future (and I’ll talk about this later), but if you’re going into a coffee chat with the sole intent of asking for a job, you’re doing it wrong.

Instead, a good coffee chat’s primary purpose should be to build trust and for both individuals to get to know each other.

**Why You Should Do Coffee Chats**

An obvious reason to go on more coffee chats is to increase your future chances of getting the role you want.

So assuming you want to work at Stripe on their Engineering team, you could go reach out to a engineer there and speak with them for 30min. Assuming the conversation goes well, you can continue to follow up and stay in touch for a few months.

Then, say a year later, when you apply for a new SWE at Twitter, you can get referred, and sometimes you can even skip the whole line and directly meet with the hiring manager.

Another reason to go on a coffee chat is to find out about what a particular job role or industry consists of and to get information on how to break in. Here, you again reach out to someone who’s knowledgeable in a field and then ask them questions regarding what it is that they do.

So for example, let’s say I want to make a career transition into data science. I browse the data science subreddit and read a bunch of how-to posts and come across someone who’s written about their experience transitioning from biology to data science.

I decide that this person can give me useful tips so I send them an email and end up going on a coffee chat with them. This way, I can get direct advice from someone who’s done what I want to do.

If you’re reaching out to someone to ask for a job, you’re not asking for a coffee chat - you’re just asking for an interview. And that’s very different.

**How To Reach Out**

I recommend reaching out via email over Linkedin or Twitter. Everybody checks their email, even if they might not reply to you.

When sending an email to someone you want to go on a coffee chat with, keep it short and be specific. There’s probably a particular reason why you decided to reach out to someone - be sure to mention it in your email.

Here's an example:

***Email*** ***Example:***

In my senior year of college, I wanted to get a job in tech. As an international student, I had to get sponsorship and this was quite a big issue - I wanted to chat with someone who had been through this process before.

I came across Jay's Linkedin profile and realized that he was an international student who also had a similar economics related background to me ([link to image](https://www.careerfair.io/assets_coffee_chat/Jay_Linkedin_Profile_1.png)) and had also gotten a job in tech ([link to image](https://www.careerfair.io/assets_coffee_chat/Jay_v2.png)).

So when I reached out to him by email, I made sure to mention these things:

**-------**

*""Hey Jay,*

*International student from Cal, came across your profile - congrats on the job!*

*Wanted to chat about your experience recruiting in tech. Specifically, wanted to ask about:*

1. *How you bring up sponsorship with employers (at what stage, how you frame it etc)*
2. *Your econ background & how this has affected the type of roles you've looked at.*

*Let me know if a quick 20min chat this week would be possible.""*

**--------**

Notice how I didn’t say something generic like: “Would love to pick your brain”

Being specific when reaching out also makes sure that the recipient doesn’t think you’re randomly spamming people and sending the exact same copy to hundreds of people. You’re much more likely to get a response.

Finally, realize that the worst thing that happens is someone says no or doesn’t reply. No big deal, you’re still alive. Realize that most people will ignore your email. That’s okay.

And no, you’re not being “pushy” if you choose to follow-up. Just make sure you’ve taken the steps above to write a good message.

Okay, so let’s assume you’ve got someone to respond and they’re down to have a coffee chat with you. How do you prepare?

**How To Prepare**

Well, firstly, make sure *you do* prepare in advance. Someone’s given you their most valuable asset: their time. Don’t waste it.

When I’m about to speak with someone, I spend a minimum of 1 hour going through their profile and drafting up questions I want to ask them.

I’ll look at their Linkedin profile, see if they’ve published any blog posts, or if they’ve previously spoken on any panels. I’ll compile my notes in a google doc.

If the conversation is going well, you’ll find yourself asking a lot less questions and having a more two-way discussion, but I still recommend doing your research upfront.

When preparing questions, don’t just ask questions you could have looked up. Try to go a layer deeper - so instead of merely asking “Why did you transition into X?”, ask “Given your background in Y, what appealed you to X? Am I right in thinking that given my interests in A & B, I’ll also benefit from a transition into X?”

Ultimately, though, your questions don’t need to be perfect. A coffee chat is just a conversation with another person. And as long as you’re genuinely interested in finding out about their professional journey (rather than begging for a job), you’ll come across well.

**Guiding the Conversation and Asking Questions**

As I hinted at in the last section, whilst you should have a bank of questions to rely on, you don’t want the conversation to just be a series of questions and answers.

Instead, use your questions to add structure to your overall conversation, but let the discussion itself ebb and flow. Go on tangents - if something the other person says catches your interest, don’t be afraid to ask them about it.

There is no script and there shouldn’t be.

Keep in mind, though, that your first few coffee chats *will* likely involve just a bunch of questions and answers. But as you go on more and get more practice, just like anything else, you’ll develop a habit of steering the conversation in a manner that doesn’t involve just Q&A.

Finally, I also recommend taking notes - not necessarily to remember what you discussed, but rather as a tool to highlight the important parts of your conversation and to internalize some of your learnings better.

**Final Thoughts**

Congrats, you’ve just made a new friend!

I recommend following up once right after your chat and sending a nice thank-you note.

Then, in the coming months, if you work on something cool or explore any new opportunities that are related to what you discussed, make sure to let them know!

As a slight tangent - you might be surprised at how many people end up reaching out to *you.*

After one of my coffee chats, I got a recruiter from one of the people I interviewed's company reaching out to me asking if I was interested in a new role they had.

Going on coffee chats is one of the best ways to increase future opportunities that come your way.

All they take is a bit of outreach and prep. And I hope this guide has proven to be a helpful start.

hrtmau,Books > Leetcode,"I've been trying to grind Leetcode. But almost everytime I get stuck or the solutions I come up with are brute Force algorithms with awful runtimes. Then I look at the solutions and convince myself that I understood the problem all while knowing full well that I didn't learn Jack shit. And with this comes the feeling of dread. 

If this describes your situation too, then I highly encourage reading books like Cracking the coding interview. The solutions are explained extremely well, it gives solid outlines on how to approach the problem and how to use the right data structures at the right times. It feels like I'm actually learning something and is preparing me better for tackling Leetcode later on. 

Hope this helps anyone going through the same frustration with Leetcode.",2020-07-15 18:57:49

fxxvyl,"Free Full-Stack (HTML/CSS/JS, Node/Express/MongoDB) Web Development Course","Hello everyone,

I’m Dr. Josh Bastean, and I teach web development and education courses at Coker University. With all the recent insanity, all our courses have moved online. I am in the process of recording the entire content of my Modern Web Development course, and decided to go ahead and post the videos on YouTube, hoping to help more people learn the joys of web development.

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fOmsPg4YcdQLREdVWi1Fb04esgmMzarL2Dcux6v27n8/edit) for a brief overview (aka syllabus) of what the videos will cover.

[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQSmIhc0GVPPhpBAC3y6xChtOz3RJ8abN) the link to the YouTube playlist.

I have already uploaded about 2/3 of the total course videos, and will continue to upload new ones as I complete them. As of right now, I’ve covered all of the front-end and started on back-end with Node.js, Express, EJS, and APIs. I'm currently working on the videos that start the final project (which we build over the last several weeks of the course): a ""Yelp Clone"" website focused on the topic of your choice. I'm doing Comic Books, but pick something you enjoy. We'll be adding MongoDB, Passport, EJS-Flash, pushing our code to Github, and deploying to Heroku.

I hope this helps a few people learn to love programming as much as I do. I started by watching these types of videos, and I wanted to pay it forward to the next generation.

i2o5br,Guide to applying for Microsoft's Explorer Internship,"Hey everybody! I was an explorer summer of 2019, and I've had quite a few people dming me about my experience so I thought I'd compile it & post it publicly!

**Timeline**

* Sent out an application end of August, within a week of applications opening up
* Contacted mid-September to do an on-campus interview the next week
* Heard back at the beginning of October to sign up for an on-site at the end of November
* Received offer beginning of December with 2 weeks to accept/decline

**My Resume**

Horrible. No project experience, no past internships. I had only taken a 2-semester introductory class at the time of applying. Points in my favor were that I had a 3.9GPA and I went to a target school.

**Interviews**

* First round: string manipulation and behavioral questions
* On-site: simple tree question, conceptual questions, PM-style questions, and behavioral questions

**Advice**

* Apply as early as possible. Although I did have friends who applied much later and received their offer in January/February, Microsoft does run out of spots, so I would keep an eye out for the application and apply as soon as you can.
* Focus on your resume!! The interview is extremely easy, and this is coming from somebody who had to self-study trees and linked lists and other data structures because I hadn't even gotten to it in class. If you can get through the resume screening, the rest is easy from there. I would highly recommend doing a project if you haven't and putting it on your resume. Highlight any experience you have. If you're too experienced for explore, they will reroute you for the SWE internship (or PM if you're interested in that).
* If you know somebody who is on good terms with your campus recruiter, a referral can be very helpful. Not necessary though — I applied online with no referral and somehow made it through.
* You do NOT need experience for this internship. Like I said, I had absolutely 0 experience and had to self study data structures for the interview. If you're an incoming freshman/just changed your major to CS, don't let that put you off!! This internship was made for people like you.
* You can apply to multiple internships (explore and PM, for example) but they will make the choice for you as to which internship you should interview for.


Finally, please apply for this internship if you are at all interested!! It was an absolutely amazing experience that I'd recommend to anybody. Microsoft has an awesome internship program, they pay pretty well ($32/hour in 2019, not sure if that's changed), and it's altogether a great experience. And you do not actually need to be an URM in the strictest sense. There were white male explorer interns, who talked about their socioeconomic class/cultural background for their diversity. Seriously, if you're even thinking about it, apply. Worst they can do is say no. :)

I'm happy to do resume reviews and chat privately if you're interested in learning more. Hope this helps!",2020-08-03 01:35:01
1ba737g,Received offer after I bombed the interview,"Long story short, I interviewed at this company where they had started with asking trivia questions on the tech stacks listed on the job posting which I think I did pretty well on since I studied a lot and then we moved on to do a coding question which I royally bombed. When I say royally, I mean Louis XIV, Queen Elizabeth I level, I couldn't do a damn RECURSION!! The more I realized that the answer didn't come intuitively to me the more I was stuck. The interviewers had to give me hints and I responded well but in the end, my code was close but still didn't do what it was supposed to do. I felt so embarrassed and at the end of the call, they told me to not expect an answer until the middle of next week as they still had more candidates to interview. I spent the rest of the evening dwelling and reading into the signs of if the interview went well, if they liked me, etc until 4 am... you know, the usual.

That was yesterday and I got a call today at noon for an offer from that same company. Later today, I got an email with *another* offer from another company that interviewed me 2 days ago (that I didn't bomb)! And these were the only two companies who gave me an interview. 

Just 2 weeks ago, I think I was in the deepest trenches known to men, I was so unhappy, felt like a failure, didn't breathe outside air for 7 days straight, no sunlight touched my skin for weeks and I only ate once a day when I couldn't handle the hunger pains anymore because all I did was assignments, midterms and leetcode/interview prep. But today???? Today is ONE GOOD DAY! 

I wish everyone who's in my past situation good luck (because it really matters) and I hope that this gave you a little bit of comfort! ",2024-03-09 02:48:26

Yes, interviews at those trading firms are hard, but not that far off from FAANG as far as prep goes. If you can do one, you can do the other.

Just landed an Internship offer from Amazon.

Here's a little bit about my background:

I go to a state school, have 2 significant projects, tutoring experience, and restaurant experience.  
I applied to 193 jobs. Landed about 6-8 Interviews & 20 OA's. My behavioral skills are pretty good and I've completed 97 LeetCode questions. 

  
I'm so excited to be done with the grind. I hate interviewing, networking and I really hate workday.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here are some details regarding the process:

Applied  9/19/2021

OA 1: Was sent 10/28/2021, Completed the same day. 2 LC mediums, Passed all test cases.

OA 2: Sent 10/28/2021. Finished within 1-2 days after I got it. Think I did really well on it.

OA 3: (Final Interview): I was invited to schedule an interview on 11/20/2021. It was scheduled for 11/23/2021.

 I answered questions regarding situations where I utilized Amazon's Leadership principles and then solved a leetcode easy. (this question involved regex, luckily I  know regex). I was asked the time complexity of the code and how I would approach this problem to make it have maximum efficiency. My interviewer was really nice and had exceptional communication skills.

Afterward, my portal updated my application's location to be near where I lived. 1 day later I received my offer (11/24 (today)).  


I recognize that many of you may not be as lucky with OA's and Interviewers, I've taken some L's on my first initial interviews with several companies too. Practicing interviewing with other companies beforehand had really improved my communication abilities and seemed to be a key to my success.

z3q0wf,"A Summary of My Internship Hunt for Summer 2023: Profile, Timelines, Thoughts, Application Process Difficulty Ratings, and What I Have Learned","Hi csMajors!

I have found these types of posts very helpful during my internship hunt, so I decided to share my very own internship hunting journey this season. I hope that this will be helpful to shed some light onto what you can expect of the interviews of the mentioned companies or other companies in general!

I was planning to dive into more details (wrote like 4,000 words lol but I think that is too risky and can be doxxed) for each of the application process, but I was wary of NDA-stuff so I am just going to provide the timeline for each and rate the difficulty of the process (behavioral, technical OA, technical interview, math if applicable) from 1 to 10, 1 being the easiest and 10 being the hardest. For example, a “1” behavioral question is like “Why us?” type of questions, and a 10 behavioral question is like “If you are put on Mars for a day, what kind of technology will you build (and with what tech stack and why), how would you choose your teammates, and how would you handle the conflicts with aliens?” type of questions. Likewise, a 1 technical question is like a fizzbuzz question, and a 10 technical question is like a leetcode DP hard question. Not the best way to shed light onto the application processes, but I will try my best (note that these are my personal experience, YMMV). For the offers, the compensation packages are the same as the ones listed on levels.fyi.

# Background:

**Education**: Junior majoring in honors math and CS at a T15 school (originally math, decided to add a second major in CS in sophomore year), not particularly known for its CS program. I have taken classes like discrete math, data structures, and software design along with quite a few upper-level math classes for my honors track.

**Experience**: 1 paid internship with a local startup in my home country (I’m international, so I do need sponsorship) that specializes in AI/ML products (I was on the NLP team), 1 unpaid internship with an organization that promotes the education of CS to young people (I was on the AI team with a bit of leadership responsibility), 1 paid research position at my university (leading a team that does computer vision research), 1 paid TA position at my university for 2 math classes.

**Projects**: 2 data analysis projects that revolved around video games (1 is a Discord bot, the other one was a deep learning model that I made from scratch), 1 fullstack app (a phone-calling app) using MERN, and 1 game/simulation that I made in Python.

**Edit:** Since someone asked for me anonymized **resume**, here it is [https://imgur.com/4gRBxKm](https://imgur.com/4gRBxKm). Note that it is a bit different since I slightly modified it since I applied at the start of the season.

# Statistics:

For this season, I applied to around 200 internship programs, got around 20-30 OAs, had around 10 interview callbacks, and 8 “virtual” onsite interviews. In the end, I was able to get 5 offers.

**Mandatory leetcode stats**: 124 easies, 217 medium, 18 hards, knight badge. I exclusively used Python for leetcode and interviews. I mostly used Neetcode to guide my prep.

**CodeSignal**: 843

I was able to get all test cases passed for all of my OAs.

&#x200B;

Application process for companies that I got quite deeply into the process:

# Bank of America

**Position:** Global Quantitative Summer Analyst

**Timeline:** Applied online without referral (6/21) → video interview invitation via Hirevue (7/6) → complete video interview (7/9) → final round invitation (7/20) → superday interviews (7/27) → **offer** via email (8/12)

**Thoughts:** I was surprised at the interview process because it was almost entirely behavioral (with just a few soft technical questions about my projects during the superday). This was my first offer of the season, so I was ecstatic, and it had definitely helped boost my morale.

**Behavioral:** 6/10

**Technical OA:** N/A

**Technical Interview:** 1/10

&#x200B;

# Palantir

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Applied online with referral (7/14) → Karat interview invitation (7/15) → Karat interview (7/21) → Karat interview redo (7/22) – virtual onsite invitation (8/1) → virtual onsite (8/11) → **rejection** via email (8/15)

**Thoughts:** This is one of the more “technical” interview processes that I had had so far, so I was pretty nervous. There was system design involved, and I was not fully prepared for it. It felt bad when I got rejected after being able to get to the onsite, but I had to learn to be numb to that feeling and try my best for my upcoming interviews.

**Behavioral:** N/A

**Technical OA:** N/A

**Technical Interview:** 7/10

&#x200B;

# Two Sigma

**Position:** Quantitative Researcher Intern

**Timeline:** Apply online without referral (6/28) → Hackerrank OA invitation (7/8) → OA completed (7/14) → data analysis interview invitation (8/5) → data analysis interview (8/18) → virtual onsite interview invitation (8/31) → virtual onsite interview (9/8) → **rejection** via email (9/8)

**Thoughts:** I was hoping that I can get a quant internship, so I was very nervous yet excited about this one, but I got grilled by the math questions. It was quite demoralizing and I regret not studying enough to be prepared for the core statistics, but at the same time, it made me realize the knowledge that I lack so that I can focus on studying them the next time around.

**Behavioral:** N/A

**Technical OA:** 6/10

**Technical Interview:** 5/10

**Math:** 10/10

&#x200B;

# Amazon

**Position:** Software Development Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Applied online with referral (6/24) → Hackerrank OA invitation (7/18) → OA completed (8/1) → virtual onsite invitation (8/2) → additional availability request (9/14) → virtual onsite interview (9/22) → portal updated (10/4) → **offer** via portal (10/5)

**Thoughts:** Man, this was a wild ride. This is the only FAANG that I could get an interview from (I know, I know, it’s Amazon, but still) so I was very excited and did not want to let this slip away. I still remember frantically refreshing the portal and the reddit thread to check for any portal updates lol. Very proud of myself for this one since compensation is fantastic!

# Iron Galaxy Studios

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Career fair (9/22) → on-campus interview (9/23) → **ghosted**

**Thoughts:** This is one of the booths that I came to introduce myself during my school’s career fair, and the recruiter there was incredibly enthusiastic about the company! I did not plan to apply in the first place, but the recruiter’s incredible pitch about the company convinced me otherwise. Overall a unique and fun experience, but I never heard back from them.

**Timeline:** Applied online without referral (7/1) → Hackerrank OA invitation (7/5) → OA completed (7/12) → Hirevue interview invitation (9/2) → Hirevue completed (9/4) → virtual onsite interview invitation (9/21) → virtual onsite interview (9/28) → **offer** via phone call (10/7)

**Thoughts:** This is a rather lengthy process as the gap between the OA and the interviews were more than 2 months, but it was easy to navigate overall. Was definitely very excited to get the offer, since I felt like my math preparation had paid off and that I was at least somewhat prepared for quant roles.

**Thoughts:** To be honest, this is a very streamlined and straightforward recruiting process (lowkey enjoyed the OA), although I did not prepare much for the onsite because I had already got Amazon at the time and was burnt out quite badly. Was quite surprised to get the offer, and the compensation as well as perks absolutely blew my mind!

**Thoughts:** I really wanted to get this one since I wanted to break into HFTs, so I spent a whole week going through OS and networking concepts without previous exposure to them. Got grilled hard in the interview, so rejection was expected. At least now my OS class next semester will be easier to deal with.

**Thoughts:** The interview was quite late into the season and I was busy preparing for HRT’s OS and networking interviews, so I did not prepare that much for Tiktok’s interviews. I didn’t think my interviews were good honestly and was not satisfied with my solutions, so I was really surprised that I got the offer.

Phew, what a crazy rollercoaster of emotions, especially after getting 400+ rejections last season without a single interview offer from U.S. companies! In the end, I have decided to go with **Roblox** for its amazing work culture, interesting projects and tech, great WLB, fun internship program, and incredible compensation/perks!

Things that I have learned along the way:

* The hardest part is to pass the resume screening process. I have revised my resume many times, and I settled with a resume that uses Jake’s Resume template in LaTeX. Using a simple format like that allowed me to focus my time on buffing the meat of the resume (i.e. the textual content), not the layout or design. I used the STAR method, fancy words, and numerical metrics to make the bullet points stood out.
* Previous experience is not required, but it really helps tremendously. I populated my resume with positions that I could find within my university, and they really helped.
* Cover letters are pretty useless and a waste of time
* Referrals can help indeed, but without them I could still get far into the application processes, so don’t sweat them too much
* International students have it rough, but I wouldn’t let that kill my American Dream. Automatic rejections because of the sponsorship question happened a lot, but I tried to compensate for that with a well-crafted resume with relevant work experience and personal projects.
* Applying early (mid-late June) has been the biggest factor that helped, especially in this troubling economy since many companies like Amazon and Roblox had reached headcount earlier than usual
* Behavioral interview preparation is underrated. I spent a lot of time preparing for my behavioral interviews (I legit have 20 pages worth of notes for my behaviorals and I practiced them frequently in front of a mirror lol), and it surely made a difference especially when I am not the type of person that feel comfortable talking to new people
* Neetcode is an incredible teacher and leetcode mediums were my best friends
* Rejections hurt, but I have grown to feel numb about them which actually helped a lot. Waiting for that email from a specific company every day might do more harm than good
* My GPA has tanked a bit, but that’s okay
* A leetcode a day keeps the unemployment away
* Leetcode premium is a very good investment if I can afford it
* Leetcode assessments are very good for practicing OA under time pressure
* Having a leetcode study buddy is incredibly helpful to keep myself and my motivation in check
* Getting familiar with the coding environment of the OAs helped a lot with debugging
* For CodeSignal specifically, the first 2 questions are fairly easy, the 3rd question is implementation-heavy (i.e. have to write a lot of code, not necessarily hard), and the 4th question is algorithm-heavy (to avoid TLE). The recommended 1 then 2 then 4 then 3 order of solving helps since I ended up using half of my completion time on question 3.
* I commented my code in my OAs, not sure if anyone took a look but I don't think that would hurt
* Keeping the communication going even when I’m stuck in technical interviews. Some interviewers really appreciated the fact that I conveyed my ideas clearly and continuously, and they were willing to step in if my ideas were not in the right track
* If possible, use the whiteboard feature in Zoom or Coderpad or Hackerrank to explain my ideas to the interviewer. A picture worth a thousand words as they say
* Asking a lot of clarifying questions before diving into the implementation to clear up any miscommunications and/or traps in the question’s wording. It also shows that I am engaged and thought thoroughly about the edge cases, which is always a good thing for being a good engineer
* Weight the upsides and downsides (time complexities, space complexities, etc.) of different implementation approaches before coding
* Take the interviewer’s hints and suggestions constructively, they probably know more than I do
* Try to be personable and come across as a person that the interviewer wants to work with in the future. They might not admit it outright, but subconsciously they might have more inclination to vouch for me favorably
* Ask good questions at the end to demonstrate my interest in the position. I prepared the questions by reading about the company as well as the job description of the role
* I always wear my lucky suit for my interviews, maybe it helped as I felt more confident and calm

Thank you for taking the time to read my post in its entirety, and I hope that it has been somewhat helpful to you! Keep up the grind, and don’t give up.",2022-11-24 17:41:56

xebm0h,Quant Jobs : Brutally Honest Reflections,"Just gonna make this post since I see a lot of people want to get into this industry, mostly for money. This is a collection of things in rough order of importance. I'd encourage anybody really interested to read it.

# Recruiting is brutal and will take a toll on you

I've been trying at this for like three years at this point. Finally got in this year to a place I'd wanna work for. I have like... maybe one friend and a significant other. The friend thing really is a maybe I don't go out. I don't do things. I've missed birthday parties and family stuff to do brainteasers and Leetcode. I kind of hate it and hate myself. None of these skills are useful/transferable and I did them just to get a job. I'm great at interviews at this point, but I've overdeveloped this one thing at the expense of basically everything else and it's made me miserable. I don't even know how to have fun anymore. All my hobbies are gone and even the fact that I have a job doesn't make me happy now.

I'd honestly be way more depressed than I already am if I didn't have my partner, like honestly everyone needs someone to talk to and grab you ass once in a while and if I didn't have that I would have gone insane. And this has been going on for three years at this point. Keep that number in mind.

It's also just very random. Who gets a job and who doesn't is dumb. I've been OA screened at some D tier firms and gotten to final rounds at some A tiers. It's way more luck than anyone wants to admit.

# Do not work for a company called Citadel

Ask about retention in every interview. What percent of interns get to return? What percent accept? What's tenure like on the team? A lot of quant firms treat people as disposable until they generate PnL. This includes interns. I have a lot of friends in quant, many firms are planning on cutting half the people they hire. Especially at prop shops and Citadel and some others, many people are burned out after literally three months of work, let alone three years. There is a reason everyone quits even though the pay is so good. You are not special/smart enough to coast anymore, especially not at this level. And for the people who stay, reread the stuff point above. I think a lot of them are miserable. These companies are exploiting your dreams and it is so easy for them to do because people let them do it.

This is not a hard rule. A common saying is that ""good teams"" exist at every company, which is true. However good teams have less turnover, and therefore hire less, and have even higher standards because they are good teams. Just mathematically, your odds of being on one of these ""good teams"" is low. Your control of where you are as an intern is also usually low. Keep that in mind.

This isn't true of everywhere by the way, some companies are quite nice across the board! Citadel is not though.

# I'm a bad person

Yes, me specifically, and you are too if you want one of these jobs. They exist to make rich people richer. Any arguments to the contrary are either dumb, missing obvious points, or deeply flawed. Yes this is true of tech companies as well, but at least they provide services that are for everyone that people want to have and use. This is a service purely for the wealthy. Anyone smart enough to get one of these jobs could do real good for the world and instead they're choosing to sell out in the worst way, regardless of excuses to the contrary. It's really just kind of disgraceful and I almost don't even know why I want this any more. Like most quant researchers could do ACTUAL research.

\-Common arguments to the contrary : but market makers make stocks cheaper by reducing bid/ask spread! Yep, this is true. But spreads on everything are already around a cent. This might've been a good point when spreads were five bucks, but now that spreads are a cent they aren't going any lower. You're mostly just making money. Active trading is bad for individuals anyway, and encouraging it is probably net harmful.

\-Pension funds invest in hedge funds too! Yep, true. But it's mostly the rich individuals both in terms of dollar value and in terms of relative allocation.

And more dumb stuff people tell themselves to sleep. Just admit you're in it for the money and move on.

Addendum to this point : people in quant frequently run the spectrum of personality types and backgrounds, but most are wildly privileged. These people are way richer than ""normal"" people and the backgrounds look a lot like anything else on Wall Street, just the nerdier kids. And a lot of quant people are also bad people! Always remember in life, it's very easy to be nice when your life is easy. Quant firms have the same backstabbing and politics as everywhere else, and most people don't give a fuck about charity or the 99%. It's very easy to be basically decent and humble when you're making millions of dollars a year, working 40 hours a week. I would also argue that the more you have, the more responsibility you have to do something with it other than buy a fifth house. Fuck me for being a socialist I guess.

# The problems are more interesting

Nope, try again. Actually I've worked in Big Tech before, and most people are interested in that experience and want me to do similar things for them. It's not that different from a comparable job at Facebook or Google or whatever. This is just a dumb argument. Tech stacks are tech stacks.

# Stop sharing interview questions

It reduces your chances. People usually want to interview you again if you did decent, and questions don't change much year to year. By telling your buddies what will be asked, you are hurting your own future chances. Also the people who form cheating rings for this stuff make me sick in general. Stop trading questions with each other just to get a job. You're the worst type of people.

I will say though, cheating is pretty rampant in these interviews and a lot of people I will be working with/for probably cheated their way in. Go read The Man Who Solved the Market, this even happened at Renaissance. Cheaters do frequently prosper.

x9wws6,Does anyone else wish they were born/graduating 10-15 years in the past when cool tech companies were starting to pop up?,"Sometimes I wish I was born 10-15 years earlier so I could be graduating when today’s popular companies and apps were first coming out — Uber/Inatacart/Snap/Doordash/Airbnb….  etc. Growing up, it seemed like the early 2010’s were the golden age for software development. Now it seems like every cool idea/startup/app has been created and everything now is just maintenance and adding features. Not to mention it was much easier to get into these companies. It seems like now the “innovative” startups starting to pop up are in AI/ML/blockchain —- none of which I’m smart enough or good enough at math to be in nor interested in. Maybe this seems like a rant but I’ve thought about this a lot recently.",2022-09-09 14:25:53
136wtxw,Beware of what's about to come for those graduating or soon to graduate,"I'm a new grad and job hunting is literally the most toughest and stressful process you will have to go through as a college student. I was fortunate enough to land 2 job offers for swe after hundreds of applications and blood/sweat/tears interview prepping before graduating during this sht economy. The reason for this post is to shed some light on yall on what's about to come for those who are about to graduate soon.  Maybe some of yall would have an easier time if you can get a FT return offer from your internship (if you have one), but if you don't then you better start job hunting early before you start your senior year. I did not a FT offer from my internship due to a hiring freeze and I kid you not when people say entry-level jobs are hard to get. I thought people were exaggerating when they say entry-level jobs are hard to get (in general) and they are 100% right. You will not have a problem getting ""a job"" with a cs degree but getting a high-paying or decent paying CS related job like SWE for example is extremely, extremely difficult at entry-level.  I applied literally to swe and non-swe roles and I didn't get a callback despite having 2 swe internships. Out of like  500 apps I applied to, I only got 4 interviews and the rest just ghosted me.  This entire process took me 7-8 months. Now, don't let discouraging posts of people who say getting an entry-level job is impossible. If you believe that sht, then you will never get a job period. You need to have a positive mindset because getting a well-paying entry level job is POSSIBLE because I did it. You just need a lot of persistence, motivation and hours of interview preparation you need to put in so whenever that 1 opportunity comes your way, you do well and get that job offer.",2023-05-03 19:25:12

yhuyi6,Believe in Yourself!! [Got an Offer],"Just 35 days ago I posted this with no hopes at all.

https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xnsbtk/am_i_not_a_cut_for_swe/

Even though I solved 300 problems over the year, wasn’t passing any phone interview. The current economic situation and the fact that I’m an international made it more difficult for me. 

From August 2020 I started my job hunting process. Applied on more than 500 positions for Summer’22 internship. Didn’t get any offer after just 2 virtual on-site. I kept grinding whole summer. 

Again started the full-time hunting, but this time I was more prepared and more confident. And very soon every hope was going away as I kept failing phone interviews. Some rejections were so brutal to digest. I know lots of people have felt this way at some point. People were telling me to try for less technical roles. But I knew, I can do this sooner or later. Believing in yourself and keeping up the hard-work is the key. 

Anyway, after seeing all the suggestions and motivation from the previous post I decided not to beat myself anymore over m a job. I was still applying like crazy but wasn’t getting more interviews due to the hiring freeze and economy. 

Fast forward today, I signed an offer as a Full Time Software Engineer at a pretty big corporation.

17z8z81,Average rant,"
1. CS seen as hard, nerdy, niche, geeky. Other fields like engineering, accounting and finance get the spotlight.

2. Due to lack of skilled programmers, the salaries are very high. Initiatives start popping up, funding people to learn to code.

3. More people hear of software engineers making $100k+ fresh grad in US and similar cases.

4. People who don't like CS take CS just because high pay. Bring their sibling their mother their dog. All of them get rewarded handsomely. Supply of CS grads starts surpassing demand.

5. CS becomes the mainstream degree. Sending the opportunity, bootcamps spawn everywhere, promising guaranteed high paying job or refund your money back. People start asking why don't you take CS. Unis create masters for non-STEM backgrounds to enter CS, basically also a bootcamp, and removing weeders like Advanced Algorithms or Computational Theory. People who want to switch careers start by learning to code.

6. With the ballooning of supply, companies start implementing acrobatics into their interview process to separate the wheat from the chaff. Leetcode was for juniors, soon after seniors need it too.

7. People start asking is there really a shortage of software engineers? Where are all the jobs? Meanwhile having only mandatory coursework projects on their resume that were mostly done by group mates or Ctrl-V'd the day of  the deadline. On the other hand, ultra conscientious cunts that would have collected all their trophies in Model United Nations or AIESECs start conquering GDSCs and Microsoft Student Ambassadors instead (yes I'm salty) and end up with 5 internships and 7 committee positions and 30 Hackathon wins before they graduate.

 I had one prior internship (SDET), a handful of personal projects, and a personal website, sub 3.0 gpa.  LinkedIn applications felt like a dead end, I ended focusing on Handshake and Indeed.  Most of my calls came from Indeed applications with smaller companies. My website is a super simple html template I forked from a GH repo and half of my calls started off with saying how the site was great. Revised my resume five times and had two different versions, one for SWE and another for embedded system roles .

I spent probably way to much time scrolling through reddit and wallowing in my sadness, waking up to rejection emails almost everyday.  My self-worth was really declining and decided to teach myself react/nextjs and make some projects to make myself feel better.  My family was also really supportive during this time and I had great friends I could talk to who are also in stem that I could vent too. I think that really gave me motivation to get out of a really bad mental state and take the time I had to just grind leets/ learn buzzword skills. 

The two offers actually came like one week apart, I reneged on the lower offer.

16iwf0z,Are schools like Berkeley and MIT really that much better,"I'm just wondering as someone who goes to an average state school but has a lot of friends who go to top CS schools, is there a measurable difference in the education. Obviously with jobs, the name brand carries a lot of weight. But is the content of lectures, the overall retention from these schools something which justifies the general bias of many tech companies to favor these candidates. I don't mean to ask in a rude way, I'm just genuinely curious.",2023-09-14 22:44:30
167lyak,"Everyone applying for internships, PLEASE RELAX!","I am graduating this fall with an MS and have gone through 2 cycles of internships. During that time, I have seen it all on this subreddit. Every year it's always the same fucking thing. Despair, humblebrags, celebration, then more despair. So here are a few things to calm your fucking minds. 

1) **NO IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO APPLY**. The cycle has really JUST started. Most of the super early apps were not for the general public or specialized shit. 
 
2) **STOP STRESSING ABOUT INTERVIEW TIMINGS**. Some companies like to get all the applications first and THEN interview all at once. Not every company is rolling basis. I know companies last year that like just take in apps throughout the fall and don't start interviews until January. 

3) **DON'T STOP APPLYING**. Some of you guys gonna get real sad when it's like February, and you haven't heard shit. Just keep applying. I had one company that was really desperate for an intern, the hiring manager directly reached out to me last April. IN FUCKING APRIL. And this was an established company, not a random start-up.

4) **SHITS OUT OF YOUR CONTROL**. The screening, interview timings, acceptance, all of it. If random student on this subreddit got an interview first, congrats to them but fuck em.  If your friend got an interview first, congrats to them but fuck em. There's nothing you can do about it. I know some of you fuckers really want FAANG right off the gate. But I've seen bootcampers with couple years of exp get FAANG while engineers with 5 years of exp +  cs degrees struggle to get in. Ultimately, luck is still heavily involved. And in the grand scheme of things, who the cares when you get FAANG? If you really want it, you'll eventually get in. Whether you get into FAANG at age 22 or 32, it really doesn't matter 30 years down the line. Like how stupid does it sound if in your 50's, some friend or coworker still brags they worked at Apple when they were 22? Gives off peaked in hs vibes. 

So everyone, let's take a deep fucking breath. Continue to grind and take things day by day. Whether you get an internship or not, your grinding is not in vain. That shit will help you beyond the internship hunt. As the cringe saying goes, treat it like a marathon, not a sprint. Good luck! I believe in all of you.",2023-09-01 23:00:56

17jb36k,What’s the next CS (oversaturated industry),"Everyone lately on here has been complaining about how oversatured CS and SWE in general is becoming, but this isn’t the first industry this has happened to.

It happened to real estate agents and realtors when selling houses for million-dollar commissions was glamourized, now there are tons of realtors struggling to get clients.

It happened to investment bankers, management consultants, and other finance-related careers when their high salaries started becoming publicized.

It even happened to therapists/mental health practitioners when psychology and mental health was considered the “up and coming science” and now psych majors everywhere are struggling to find jobs.

Now you hear CS majors complain about how oversaturated the field is and how it’s impossible to find entry-level jobs now. Social media glamorizing the pay, decent hours, and remote-capabilities of SWE is what caused this.

My question is, what do you guys think the next oversaturated field is going to be? Eventually something new will blow up on social media and the masses will flood there, it’s just a matter of time…",2023-10-29 19:54:45

19468yh,I DID IT! Full time internship during my first year of university!,"GUUUUYS I DID ITTT, I GOT A JOOOOOB.
As a latina student in Europe from a unknown university, I have a weird journey so if you're curious, I'll be sharing it here:

But first: While preparing my portfolio I used to come here and read all the successful stories thinking ""I hope I'll be one of them..."",  reading people with an outstanding resume, knowledge on 82928339 stacks and hella cool projects getting desesperated because they kept getting either rejected or ghosted thinking ""What if I ended up just like that :( why would it be different for me?"". 

So you, whom are now reading this might be going through the same thing. Stay brave, stay positive, keep pushing, what you're looking for is also looking for you. 

_________________________________________

> 2022: Decided I'd pursue a Software Engineering degree. While preparing for university entry exam, I also started learning how to code(Bunch of algorithms and programming logic courses) , around the end of the year I was learning HTML&CSS.

> February 2023: Started my major at an online university based on my home country. Started learning javascript the following month.

> July 2023: Took a break from uni(lol) so I could focus on more practical programming and work on building a portfolio and projects for my resume(I really wanted and needed a job in tech. Older daughter of a single mom family thing, I guess). Learned React, Vue, Node and Express.

> Octuber 2023: Had my portfolio with 4 projects deployed.

> November 2023:  Applied for a bunch of internships and entry level positions(even the ones that required experience, which I had none). After getting rejected tons of time, specially after a first round on a ideal job with an ideal team, I got too sad to keep applying on December.


1. Had a positive response from one of the interviews I had with a recruiter on November, went to 40 minutes second round with HR rep and team manager. They pretty much just told me about working hours, team environment, what attitude they're expecting from their intern and asked me if I had any questions. They also mentioned that, reading my resume and portfolio, they thought I'd fit better working with team responsible for x(not the social media, just saving the name of the team).

2. Turns out they can't sign an agreement with my university because it's not based in the country I'm in(Also, I wasn't even enrolled anymore, but didn't tell them because since it's an online university, I could comeback anytime). So they do some witchcraft and offer to pay for my studies on one of their partners school just so they can sign my internship(Big wow moment here, I didn't know I was worth that much 😭)

3. Signed my contract yesterday. Paid hybrid position on a tech company, I'll be working with the stack I wanted to work on in the future(Android developer), with a really nice manager. I'm really really happy and I feel like two years of studying non stop finally paid off 😢. Somehow I feel just extremely lucky because it was a single 15 minutes interview with an recruiter and then this 40 minutes interview just telling me about the position and the team as if the job was already mine 😭.

Now it gets really sucky: I have to be on camera 7.5 hours a day and there have to be cameras on both sides of the monitor showing all parts of the room. Then it gets worse. They have a *dress code*. I have to  wear business casual including shoes and socks that match. The dress code must have been written by a liberal arts major who could only get a job in HR. Then it gets more worse: I can't leave the room unless they give me permission. If I want to hit the head or go out for a smoke, nope. I have to message someone and wait for them to respond. They promised I would never get turned down, but it seems so childish. Then I found out I would also have to leave my mic open so they can see if I'm listening to anything. I don't know why they would care! They swear it doesn't matter what I listen to but it feels like a built-in excuse to fire me if they don't like the podcast I have on or the music is too loud. Now the worst part. I have to put my phone away during the working hours. Except for 2FA, I can't use the phone.

15dsg7u,AMA: How I landed offers in quant,"**Introduction**

The r/csmajors subreddit was really helpful for me when I was navigating the recruiting process, so I thought I’d give back to the community by going over my experience and answering any questions others may have. And in particular, I find that there’s not a lot of information (at least in this subreddit) about the field of quant and the interview processes.

I want to preface this by saying that this is certainly not the only path to success. In fact, what you’ll find is that my windy path into quant through academia and software engineering is certainly not the most efficient for those looking for the path of least resistance to getting an offer in the quant space. Instead, I hope my path can be one useful sample point to help inform your journey through career discovery, as so many posts have done for me.

**What’s your background?**

I grew up in the US and went to one of {Ivy, MIT, Stanford} for my undergrad, studying a combination of computer science, math, and finance/economics. In particular, I focused on statistical learning and numerical optimization.

Before going into quant, I interned as a software engineer at {unicorns, FAANG}. Indeed, I leaned more towards the machine learning end of things, but also had experience in web dev and systems.

I think my background in computer science and math really helped me to succeed during the interviews. They’re looking for individuals who have a very systematic, logical, quantitative approach to reasoning about problem solving, and this type of thinking is emphasized greatly in CS and math.  There is probably some selection bias here as well, as perhaps the people interested in this type of thinking more likely choose to pursue these academic fields. A majority of my peers in quant (>80%) have this background, as well.

Within the quant space, I have interned/worked in quant development at a hedge fund and quant trading at a market maker.

**How much are you making?**

The offers ranged from $250k-$500k. In general, the base was contained to $100k-$200k and the remaining was in the form of bonus, sign-on and performance. I had offers for quant research, trader, and dev, and have noticed that the dev offers tend to be skewed towards base, trader offers tend to be skewed towards bonus, and research offers depend on the function of the research group at the firm. For example, a firm like Citadel (not CitSec) maintains its edge from its alpha research, and thus their QRs will be paid a greater sum than at a firm like SIG that maintains its edge through speed and its traders, and thus their traders will be paid a greater sum. Note the difference between quant market makers and buy-side quant hedge funds, as these are two completely different business models in the finance industry, and thus lead to very different responsibilities and learnings.

**Why’d you choose quant over SWE?**

Overall, the role just fits me more. I love solving hard, open-ended problems with smart peers, and I found that I can really do that in quant. I also enjoy the intersectionality that quant provides- everyday I’m learning something new in finance or CS.

In general, SWE is great for people looking to take things slow but still get compensated greatly for it. I would say that I put in more time as a quant than I did as a SWE, but that is a product of both 1. The culture in quant is that if you’re not swimming, you’re drowning and 2. The fact that I truly enjoy what I do and work more than I probably need to.

**How’d you prepare for interviews?**

This is a pretty broad question, so I’ll organize my response into a few resources that I felt really helped me in my preparation for the interviews.

Textbooks

I read through my school’s textbooks in introductory statistics, probability theory, machine learning, and econometrics. I should note that I didn’t read these textbooks to particularly prepare for the interviews, but instead read them in parallel while taking the corresponding courses, but then brushed up on sections I felt less familiar with during the interview season. I do think this point is worth emphasizing: it’s better to pay attention during class and learn the material right the first time than to have to learn it again for interviews. One aspect that makes quant such a difficult field (both to get into and to be good at) is how interdisciplinary it is. In general, you can expect to get tested on math and statistics and probability and algorithms and finance. By learning all of that material right while in class, you reduce your review time from O(n) to O(1). This is really worth emphasizing because I saw a good amount of students in my undergrad copying answers or getting solutions from office hours, all to simply re-learn the material. All this is to say, you might as well learn it all the first time you encounter the material.

In no particular order, here are some textbooks I would recommend:

The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie

Introduction to Probability by Dimitri P. Bertsekas

The Econometrics of Financial Markets by John Campbell

Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability by Frederick Mosteller

QuantGuide

This site is basically Leetcode for quant. There’s a free database of quant interview questions that I just grinded for a few weeks. Quant interview questions can be unlike any other questions you’ve seen before, and I find that the questions on QuantGuide are great representations of questions you would find in actual interviews. I would highly recommend this resource after you get a grasp of the foundations from the textbooks.

Leetcode

This was more of a vestige of my software engineering preparation, but I still found it extremely useful for the firms that tested coding skills. I did the Blind 75 and watched Neetcode’s videos, but didn’t participate in any contests or competitive programming competitions. In general, the quant firms that do test you on your coding skill care about the algorithms and data structures and don’t ask about system design. You can expect Leetcode mediums and hards, and I found that they tended to lean into the DP/backtracking questions heavily.

Glassdoor

This resource is great to take a look at a few days before your interview to get a sense of questions people have been asked. I also used Glassdoor to find out more about the culture of the company so I could ask about it after the interview.

Zetamac

I didn’t really use this one much, but it’s basically a game to improve your mental math. I did it a few times before interviews as a warm up but never really gave it much thought, and had no problem passing the OAs of the firms that tested mental math (Optiver, Akuna, etc.). For the record, I average \~90 on Zetamac and \~95 on QuantGuide’s Quantify. I personally think people overemphasize mental math in interviews. Although mental math can be tested, I firmly believe that if you practice other areas of math, your mental math should generally improve to a reasonable interviewing level.

**What are your tips for getting an offer?**

There’s this stereotype that the only people getting offers at top quant firms are IMO gold medalists or Putnam Top 100. And although many IMO gold medalists and Putnam Top 100s do end up going into quant at some point in their careers, the majority of us are just above average students who took the time to learn the fundamentals well and study for the interviews. With this in mind, here are some tips I would love to share

Start early

There is no time like the present. Like a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, your time now is worth more than your time in the future, so don’t waste it. Take the time to really understand statistical inference and probability theory at the fundamental level. The world is inherently stochastic, so the greater you understand the underlying mechanics of this stochasticity, the greater your decision-making and predictive modeling will be.

Don’t hedge

If you want to go into quant, whether that be for the interesting problems, the exceptional colleagues, or the compensation, then go for it at full speed and don’t try for anything else. This may be polarizing, but in my opinion, the EV of quant is so much greater than other fields that every second you spend preparing for an interview in another field (like consulting, IB, etc.) is thus negative EV. It makes much more sense to dedicate 100% to getting a quant offer than 50% quant and 50% SWE only to get mid-tier offers at both. And even if you dedicate all your time towards quant and don’t end up with anything, you can always recruit for data science or even SWE since these roles’ skill requirements are often a subset of the quant skillset. This approach however does not take into account variance, which should be weighted with regards to the EV of the decision (think Sharpe/Markowitz).

Work with others

There may be times when you’re studying late at night and just feel demotivated. I find it really helpful to work with friends on really anything I’m trying to be better at, whether that be psets, interview prep, and even things like working out and cooking. And it doesn’t necessarily need to be IRL- there are several supportive online spaces that I’ve used to connect with people on similar paths to me, whether that be on Reddit, Discord, etc. 

**What’s the difference between quant trader, researcher, and developer?**

This is very firm dependent, so I will speak in broad strokes with regards to the interviewing process.

The interviewed skill set of quant trading includes probability, mathematical intuition, and statistics, in that order of importance. The day-to-day includes looking at your models and trading based on these models and your feel of the market. Thus, you need to be great at making positive EV decisions very quickly. Interview problems may include games on dice rolls, poker, etc. For these interviews, I used much more of my prep from my probability textbooks, QuantGuide, and GlassDoor than anything else.

The interviewed skill set of quant research is extremely broad, and includes statistics/probability, machine learning, and coding. Other skill sets that could be tested on include stochastic calculus, pure maths, and numerical optimization. I leaned very heavily on my statistics textbooks (particularly ESL) and my graduate coursework in statistical inference. These roles tend to be for PhD candidates because they had the time to really understand the mathematics underlying the statistics that many undergraduates cannot.

The interviewed skill set of quant development includes data structures/algorithms, systems, and machine learning. This will lean closer to the skill set of a typical SWE, but QDs tend to have more niche knowledge in areas like statistical learning or optimization. Most of the knowledge I was tested on during the interviews included LeetCode, the inner workings of a language like Java, OOP principles, and some probability/statistics.

**Now what?**

It’s up to you! My goal for this is to inform people about my own experience and opinions on the quant interview processes that were once a black box for me for so long. I hope you learned something new and can make a better informed decision on what you want to do with your career, how to go about the interviewing process, etc. Feel free to ask any lingering questions below and I’ll do my best to respond to you :)",2023-07-30 18:21:52
14vvh9y,Is it worth to do a masters if it means I get to intern at Google?,"Basically I did really well with interviews at Google this summer but my internships offer was retracted due to budget cuts, my recruiter advised me to apply for next year saying I have a very high chance of getting a position due to great interview feedback. Since I'm going into 4th year of a bs is it worth it to pursue a masters to secure this internship? 

As it stands I have one coop and one internship with a 3.5qca from an ok college. Any advice is appreciated :) 👍",2023-07-10 14:23:27
13jgm0q,A Psych major who lurks here,"For some reason, reddit recommends me posts from this subreddit (i think it believes I'm a cs major). I see so many posts here about feeling down, depressed, anxious, etc etc. I just wanted to say that even though I'm not a comp sci major, I feel for you. I have a few friends and family members in the industry and it's tough.

I hope you guys can keep your heads up. I know for a lot of you guys, coding and computers are your passion, and I seriously hope you can land a good job or position somewhere in this world where you get to live comfortably and exercise your passions in life. Life always works itself out. I know the job market for CS is super oversaturated right now and it's a sort of dog-eat-dog world, but please keep your head up.

It's easier said than done. It's not so easy to be hopeful when reality is seemingly tumbling down on your future, but there is *always* a way forward. It may not be the quickest path, the most lucrative at first, nor the best path to getting where you want. But this is how life is, you know? Life won't take you down the express lane, and I know everyone here is able to make it through the ups and downs.

Take care, with much love.

But I feel *so* bad for people who A. Don't have these events at their schools or B. For some reason can't attend them (school, work, etc). 

The reason why I feel so bad is because a lot of these tech companies are specifically recruiting from certain schools. I go to a top school, I know rankings vary from site to site, but we're top 20 in most. But we're not known for our CS program and are quite small. Either way, we always have recruiters banging down our door for students to apply to their internships, and every single time I work these events, they tell me about how they don't have open applications. Instead they choose to recruit directly from target schools so they can avoid getting thousands of applicants in a day. I understand why they do this, it makes total sense, but wow that sucks.

- Double Major CS with Math
- Junior at a top school in EMEA
- Good GPA, 4.0/4.0 (will go down to 3.9 after this semester as I'm depressed af)
- No previous internships, compensated in ECs and personal projects (or I thought)
- Pretty good in problem solving, can solve LeetCode mediums & hards easily in around 75% of the cases at least
- 845 CodeSignal and I aced all OAs that report the score in around 50-70% of the time (except on exactly two of them where I screwed up)
- Had feedback on resume from couple of recruiters & friends who went to FAANG
- Applied to two FAANG with referrals
- Applied to Research Programs with well-written recommendation letters from five professors

18geow3,I woke up 41 years old this morning.,"I just reenrolled for college towards a CS degree.  I’d been going off and on since the early 2000’s, but more so “off” obviously.

I loved tinkering around with computers and coding in the late 90’s and have always been a fan of tech, but girlfriends didn’t understand or like any of it, ya know 🤷‍♂️ 

I really wish I would’ve stuck with it.  Little did I know the power I had access to.

Now, I’m 41, been working in a warehouse for almost 21 years.  Just writing that makes me feel not-so-good. 

Honestly, I don’t know where the time went.

I’ve always had the feeling inside that I could accomplish anything (probably delulu), but I’m reaching a point in my life where I feel like I have to make one last push to make something of myself.

The reality of mortality has started sinking in.

I also admit that I was pretty gung-ho around 6-years ago with web development.  I studied the hell out of it and fell into a lot of the “you don’t need a degree and can land a job in 6 months” hype.  If I’d have pursued my degree then instead, I would’ve been finished and probably working in the field by now.

My views on “do it quick-and-dirty” are also changing.  Instead of learning something as fast as possible, I think now I’ll take each focus slow and really absorb it.  I’m also in the mindset of going to school for the rest of my life.  I like the idea, actually.

Can anyone give me comments, feedback, advice?  I’d love to hear from you!",2023-12-12 05:33:13

How to explain to relatives that I'm not just sitting on my butt doing nothing.,"I've been applying and interviewing but it's just tough right now and I've had graduated a while ago. They think I've been sitting home and doing nothing since graduating and I get ridiculed for being a failure. My dad said something along the lines of ""You got your little computer degree and now what? You're just mooching.""

Tangent:

I try to keep a positive attitude that this is just a temporary situation, but after hearing the above today my self-worth sunk to a new low. I go to sleep regretting my life's choices. I enjoy CS and did good in college classes, sure I could've been more proactive but I made a mistake by not networking early in college and not going to career fairs because of social anxiety at the time but I still managed to get an internship, CS tutor job, and a freelance gig for a local company despite almost stuttering every 2 seconds(I'm better now). Hindsight is 20/20.  I'm not a genius. I had to try very hard to get good grades I don't know how people had the time to take cs/math classes + internships.

I defintely still plan on doing LC here and there but will try avoid burnout by enjoying my summer while interning. In terms of solutions for my summer schedule, meal prepping will create more free time and I have to sacrifice some weekends.

166ciox,Applying for jobs feels like Tinder,"You’re single and want a partner so you do the most obvious thing - get on tinder.

Then it’s time for swiping and looking for prospect matches. You take your time reviewing every tinder card to make sure you and this person are compatible and meet each other’s criteria. Or if you’re one of those “linkedin easy” spammers and think of it as a numbers game, you play the running man as you swipe. 

After you exhaust yourself with constant swiping and applying for the day, you sit and hope that you land some of those matches. Heck you might even daydream about ~~working~~ *cough cough* dating some of the people you swiped on.

Finally days or a week after, you match with potential partners and reach out to them. Just for them to kindly decline to pursue you further. Worst case, or best case depending on who you are, you don’t get a reply back at all hence you got ghosted.

Sometimes you might wake up to multiple rejection emails of people you really thought could match with you. What can you do? Besides take more time to modify your resume/portfolio, apply for more positions, and grind for more matches all over again?",2023-08-31 14:22:01

14uiz3k,Listen to your intuition from someone who has graduated now,"This post is for those who are thinking of switching to CS, early on in their college career or navigating through college advisors. Here's my story. When I was a freshman, I majored in business but decided to switch to CS because I enjoyed programming. One caveat is I was scared of taking the hard math classes as a CS major. I went to my advisor one day and I asked him for advice on what I could do to prepare for the hard math classes if I were to switch to CS. You know what that cunt told me? Instead of being a good advisor that would help me set up a learning plan, the fker suggested me to major in something easy  like ""psychology"" where I would not have to take rigorous math classes. My heart did not feel right but I trusted myself that I would do whatever it takes to succeed in the major. Looking back now as a recent new grad, I am so glad I listened to my own intuition to major in CS despite the hard classes I had to take. I studied hard and was able to graduate with a BS in CS and get a SWE job lined up. Had I listened to my advisor about switching to an ""easy"" major or stayed as a  business major because I was afraid of the hard math classes, I wouldn't be as successful as I am today. Always listen to your own intuition and do what is right for you. Your college advisor may not always have the right plan for you.

There is too much focus on money rather than beauty of craft. I guess money matters to you guys because building a website or making apps isn't as engaging and unsatisfying so you use money as a distraction.

So, I've been doing a lot of thinking and planning about my future career, and after countless hours of research and introspection, I've come to a decision that I feel really good about: I want an internship. It's like, they've got everything. The money, the work, and a purpose in life!!!! ffs!

Now, here's the thing. We all know how competitive it is to get an internship. I mean, there's only so many spots, and I really, really want one of them. I'm not that good at coding, so, I've come up with a strategy that I think is going to help me out, and I need your cooperation.

This might sound a bit unconventional, but hear me out. I'm kindly requesting, for the sake of my career aspirations, that everyone here on r/csmajors please refrain from applying to internships this year. Just for this year. Think of it as a personal favor to a fellow CS major who has their heart set.

I know we're all striving to make it big in the tech world, but if you could please consider other roles for your applications this year, that would be great. There are plenty of other roles out there! Investment banking, big law, FedEx driver – the list goes on. SWE internships are just one of many.  


I appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter. It's not every day that someone gets a shot at their dream job, and with your help, I'm hoping to make my dream a reality. Let's all support each other's aspirations, starting with not applying to internships. Just for this year, please and thank you!

EDIT: They had to drop the offer as there is no feasibly legal way to bring me into the US. Which is totally understandable! I actually found out there are many people exactly like me who have gone through the same excruciating experience so recruiters PLEASE try to double check for this before sending international students through your pipelines. It really takes a toll on us. I’ll just have to keep grinding and hopefully I’ll eventually make my way into a career I’m satisfied with.  ",2023-10-09 22:44:03

Everyday I go to school I feel like my life is drained from me, the teachers are not even qualified for their job (many of them are majored into education, not tech related degrees) and the study plan is only meant to give us the basics of full stack dev, which I hate. 


I love programming and problem solving with a burning passion but school has been extremely mind numbing to the point where it has taken an impact in my personal life, as I feel like I’m not doing anything worth my time.

I tend to do personal projects and improve on my free time but even then, I don’t get any practice at school, I’m just there for the degree at this point.

I can't get a job. it's been tough. It's been really tough. I've been depressed and contemplating some really bad things. 
Context: 
I have a reslly big student loan and if I don't get a job I wouldn't be able to pay it off and would have to go back living with my mentally/emtoionally abusive parents

I've been applying to jobs everyday. I've gotten linkedim premium, on LinkedIn everyday trying to find a job. I checked out other websites as well. I have 5 internships at software companies and I none of the internships are hiring right now.Maybe I fucked up not paying earlier, I didn't realize the new grad cycle begins so early. It's all my fault. I can't get a job and I just don't know what I'm going to do anymore. I don't know what to do different to get a job. 

Everyday I wake up crying, I write this crying. I don't know what to change anymore. All my friends have jobs that allow them to pay back their loans and I don't and it's super hard cause what am I doing wrong. I don't know if I could live anymore you know. 

I've given myself by the end of July to keep going but idk. it's crazy you know. life is crazy. I wish nobody has to go through this and I feel sorry for other people in this situation too.

18mh40m,"This sub is crazy entitled, and the people complaining deserve whatever results life give them","TL;DR: If you want to apply to billion-dollar companies, make 6 figure, have good work life balance AND prestige, stop bemoaning and bitching about how hard the market is, when that is just how life works. Maybe work on your social and life view, which a lot of people in this sub lack seeing all the complaining posts.

The company tier list post really put the final nail in the coffin for me. The amount of entitled losers who think they deserve a 6 figure salary for their first job, work at a billion dollar company, while haven't contributed anything meaningful, while bemoaning how hard the market is for them, is crazy.

Newsflash, there exists other companies more than SP 500 companies, more than FAANG, more than a dozen some billion dollar companies in this country and in this world. Don't expect your life to be like a fucking Youtube video where you live in a high rise in a HCOL area, make 300k a year, and then film another Youtube video to show people why CS is worth it in your first few career years. Those videos are popular because it is one in a thousand. Can you do it? Yes, but be prepared to sacrifice a lot, and if you do, don't blame anything but yourself for your decision, which is a note this sub is woefully blind about.

I got my first (and current) job last summer at US Geological Survey as a Web Dev doing Data Visualization on water resources and pollution data. My salary is 5 figure, but it is enough for my standards. I am happy and satisfied. I applied to sub 100 posts for 2 years (a far lower number than what a lot of people in this sub showed) while doing NLP research at my university, but I got the job from a career fair, after 2 rounds of interview, where I was hired because I was able to communicate ideas well during the interview, basically mostly for social skills.

I applied to Amazon, Google, Meta, Tesla, the usual as well, but I apply with the mentality that it is a reach, and that experience and having the first job so I can feed myself and be independent is more important than prestige to flex at other people. Yeah having FAANG on your resume is nice, but guess what, spend that time to be sociable, be likable, be an actual humble human being who don't think that they are entilted to a job just because in your mind the interview went really well, and doesn't realize there are far more talented people than you in this world. Those are far more important and will make your life easier than just being some ""ex-FAANG engineer"", which you might never be.",2023-12-20 00:29:51

141tbrg,Rant: Is this career path just grounded on pure intelligence?,"I'm only a first-year CS undergrad, but I've been really considering switching career paths lately. The more I go through my CS degree, the more I've come across people who have such a *natural* knack for math and computational problem solving that it feels like however hard I study, I'd never reach their level of analytical competence. I emphasize natural here because it seems like their talent stems from something more innate than just having been coding since they were five. It feels like I've met a tonne of people who were just gifted with the 'right' brain for this career.

'Obviously,' you might retort. 'There are naturally gifted people in every career path.' I understand that sentiment, but CS feels different in that the industry depends more on competence/intellect than hard work/grit (e.g. Can you pass an interview of abstract programming problems? I could practice as much as I want, but after a certain level my brain just can't compute smt so abstract). In other careers (e.g. banking, medicine), sure you have your unusually talented folks, but after a certain baseline level of intelligence, progression in those industries seems to rely more heavily on grit (can you put in the 90 hrs/week as an investment banking analyst/surgical resident?). Wouldn't I feel more comfortable hedging my career success on my ability to work hard than my inherent level of intellectual competence?

I love CS. It's interesting, fun, and at times, challenging. I haven't struggled *that much* with the courses, and most of what I've outlined above stems from my experience with peers working on problems outside of class. I'm worried, however, that in an increasingly constricting job market (as in more applicants for fewer positions), I'd be entirely sidelined. Am I irrationally panicking here? Are my concerns valid or unwarranted?",2023-06-05 21:57:15

There were numerous instances in the second semester where I thought that my gpa will go below 3.0 and that I might be put on probation because I was almost at the bottom. I developed a special love for those subjects where I work super hard and then I end up getting a B because my goal was to learn like crazy without caring about my grades . Yes, Dad is equally responsible for instilling this in me ""Grind hard "".I remember that operating system class which made me drink oats instead of coffee and I kept thinking that there is something wrong with coffee. There were instances when I had two programming final submissions on the same day and I had already consumed three red bulls just to stay awake and I still ended up sleeping because I was completely sleep deprived and my heart was racing furiously. There was this one instance where I woke up on os final exam day at 7:30 am and thought that I missed my final exam and ended up knocking on my flatmate's door but the exam was supposed to happen at 5:30 pm. Another part that almost drove me crazy is this interview preparation .This was daunting but I am glad it worked out for me.

I am second sem sophomore (technically cause I am on gap year so would be rising junior) and had a interview for a unpaid spring internship.

160hbvq,Projects are nothing like real world swe,"I’m a recent grad and currently working as a SWE. Let me tell you that what you do in personal projects are not a good reflection of real world software engineering. I use to think by building simple crud apps I saw on YouTube videos was what software engineers do but oh boy i was wrong. The codebase is a lot more complex and there’s a lot of abstraction that goes into it. Also, you are working with other people’s code and when you try to implement a small feature like make xyz button it can get pretty complex since a small button is dependent on many other logical components in the codebase and sometimes modifying one code will require you to change every other code that is dependent on the original code. I think if you are a student currently and want to get a sense of what real world software engineering is like then try to get internships because that’s the closest you will get into what real world swe is like. Trust me when I say this, you can’t bullshit your way into getting a job because writing code is the easy part.

I filled out the application in the link on the company's website and found out that the profle had the wrong last name. I have a very unique first name so this caught me as weird. Then I saw there was already a resume attatched, and when I clicked on it, it happened to be a totally different grad student (im undergrad) who happened to have the same first name but different last name.

I realized that this referral was sent to me on accident as their is just a one character difference in our emails, and was sent to my email instead of his. shii rlly got my hopes up for no reason. This whole thing is just so funny cuz what are the chances i got a referral that was meant for another cs major w the same name, but I def think I should let this dude and the recruiter know there was a mix up.

How should I go about this so I don't mess up his chances or mine at getting a internship or job at this company down the line? I haven't changed his info from the profile yet cuz idk if it'd mess anything up cuz his phone number is attatched.

Edit::

Thank you for all the suggestions.  I just learned about VMs a few months ago, and that is the plan for the future.  

I won’t use a mac because the machine is primarily a gaming laptop.  I also feel the need to mention some specs so some people don’t misinterpret what I have said.

If anyone cares, the answer is hell no, do not buy any Acer laptop.  The engineers behind this need to be slapped so god damn hard for this one for sure.  My 3080 can’t hit limits because of the processor bottleneck.  Luckily, I can’t do anything about it because the 12900H is completely locked out from overclocking.

14p48id,Guide for cracking jobs for International Computer Science grads in states,"&#x200B;

I recently completed my master's and landed four job offers: Walmart, Ansys, Fidelity, and Ubs. I was supposed to get two more job offers, but they stopped hiring after the final rounds and kept me in a loop. I finally went ahead with the one with a ""no snow"" state and backend engineering. I am writing this article to help my other friends and grads graduating next semester. This article will be more beneficial for those with some work experience but also includes a few tips and tricks that I gathered from my other batchmates. 

1 . Law of Large Numbers 

I am a big fan of the law of large numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law\_of\_large\_numbers).

Yes, you need to apply, and you need to do too many applications. I did over 1500 applications, and I am not exaggerating at all. Of these many applications, I interviewed at some 20-25 places and landed just four offers. So, I am just another average Joe who made it work by playing this game.

Update : I received a good number of direct messages and I want to update and write more on this part of the process.I have a friend and she did just two applications at xyz and was expecting a response .It’s strongly encouraged to do crazy number of applications so if you are applying at Walmart ,you should try submitting some 20-30 applications.





2 . Leetcode 
I may be criticized for this, but I do believe in patterns. I suggest doing Neetcode and doing it again and again. There is a high chance that you will face one among those 150 puzzles, and it's a cakewalk if you have seen those puzzles in the past. I remember knocking out a 60 min interview at a place in hardly 15-20 mins, and they pasted another puzzle, and I knocked out that as well. It is super important that you revise the problems.I did over 600, but I suggest doing 200 important puzzles. It's the quality that matters and not quantity.

Note: I have no intention of promoting Neetcode

3 . System design  

If you are new to this, reading a lot is the best thing to do. You can start with the first part of the System design by Alex xu . I enjoyed the videos of these two YouTubers the most.

https://www.codekarle.com/ 

and gourav sen . There is another youtube channel that helped a lot - Hussein Nasser

4. Live Coding Rounds OOPS or Machine coding rounds

I had interviews where they would ask you to write some oops code. They want to check your concepts of inheritance and other oops concepts by asking you to design and then write oops code for it.

I used this specific channel, ""Concept && Coding"" to learn oops . I also took a course in object-oriented design in Java at my university, which helped me a lot. I am surprised that people neglect it, but it teaches you the same concepts you need to crack an interview.

5. Front-end Machine Coding Rounds (React/Javascript)

I failed most of these machine coding rounds. It used to be a 45 min round.I was asked to build something on code-sandbox, and you need to make it work . This round was a nightmare for me, and I have been able to pass just two live coding rounds out of, say 8 or 10. This round requires good practice. Try practicing at least 8-10 famous front-end coding challenges. I will not mention the resources, but a simple search on youtube will help. Some examples are building a game such as Tic Tac, Infinite Srollbar, or Nested Comments.

6 . Basic CS concepts 

Some basic cs concepts that you must know - Indexing and types of indexing , hashing, and collision,tcp vs udp, concurrency and how it works in Java or Golang (depends on the language in which you are interviewing ).

7 . Language-based questions 

They dig deep into languages, and you must code and read books. Interviewers usually come with follow-up questions, so always read a book for a language-based interview and clarify this with your hr. I had a hard time during my C++ interviews, and I wish I had been active and had read books. 

8 . Wear a good **smile**, and it helps. Most underrated and most effective.",2023-07-03 00:42:52

It includes $130,000 USD base salary. Rent I think is the biggest financial concern. I can live anywhere in the U.S so where is the best city to live as a remote worker with the following criteria? X/10 is importance where 10/10 is essential and 1/10 is disgustingly unimportant

* 10/10 spending 3K max on rent
* 9/10 living somewhere walkable where I can shop, go to gyms, meet up with other people easily
* 8/10 living somewhere vibrant/bustling with lots of people
* 8/10 other young people or new grads should be around
* 8/10 city should have lots of things to do
* 7/10 good food
* 7/10 good nightlife but does not have to be strictly bars/clubs. I want to be able to walk outside during the evening or night and see other people around doing whatever
* 7/10 good nature or parks or views to walk/see and enjoy
* 7/10 good transit
* 6/10 decent dating scene for a straight guy
* 6/10 safety (I'm a guy and I know how to act and stay alert, so not too worried)
* 5/10 prefer studio over room mating/renting a room

Some options that I am evaluating rn are San Francisco, NYC, Seattle, and Chicago. Any other cities? Also, any specific neighborhoods?

What do you all think?

EDIT: If I need to, I'm willing to spend like <2K on rent on shared/single rooms, so I actually don't think the COL matters too much if rent works out. I'm good with budgeting and can take care of other expenses. I have a bonus and equity on top of the base salary which I will be saving, so I'm not worried about COL too much as long as rent is reasonable.

TLDR: I am very excited because I got an internship offer (normal, not explorer) from Microsoft for next summer while being a Sophomore and having close to no prior cs experience.

I am a currently enrolled Sophomore in PNW and switched to a CS major last semester (second semester of my college career). I've been kind of trying my hardest to get my resume game up and fill it with experience to get at least an interview at a smaller company to get something going in the industry. I did a lot of networking and eventually got in contact with someone pretty high up at Microsoft that offered to give me a referral and a practice interview which I very happily accepted. Fast forward a few weeks later and into the first few weeks of the new semester, I start applying to a lot of small and big companies to get at least something for next summer and I apply with the referral to the general University Internship Program at Microsoft (because the explorer one wasn't open yet) and I get the invitation email for the final interview the morning after I applied!

I was really pumped up and excited but also terrified because I am just now taking Data Structures so I had no real understanding of the main part of the interview and was grinding for 2 weeks straight in prep for the interview but it went really well! A few days later after my interview my status changed and I received my offer for next summer on Monday this week!

Plus, one of my friend got selected for GSOC and it's a huge deal so I dunno people expect me too to get into some big shot this summer. I tried getting internship, no luck. Just one company hr keeps saying he'll get back and all but still no response.

Anyways, when I was in college, graduating was my top priority. Because I would hear these horror stories of people deleting themselves after failing courses, being academically suspended, not being able to graduate, or finding studies too stressful, etc. But I have NEVER heard any such stories of people deleting themselves after the graduation stage because they were unable to find a job. Something seems to always work out for everyone after this stage.

And because of this, I never really prioritized setting myself up for job hunting as much as I focused on not failing. I thought that if I make it out alive through graduation, I can later improvise and focus on the next step. How bad can it be? No matter what situation you're in, there's always a fix right?

This time last year I was starting my last semester of community college and excited about finally transferring to a 4 year and what I called a ""real college"" lol. Somehow, I was lucky enough to get a Summer 2023 internship at a defense company, but I was still worried that having Community College on my resume would hurt me, because I almost didn't get the offer due to me being there at the time. If you're in community college right now, trust me, once you're out they do not care one bit.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to fall 2023 and I was able to get interviews with Netflix, Microsoft, Okta, and a few other big tech companies (The defense to big tech pipeline is real lol). I honestly think half the reason for this was because I got lucky again in my team placement for my internship and ended up having a lot of buzzwords to do with AI on my resume. I failed the Microsoft interview early on which kind of hurt my confidence, but I moved on and kept trying.

However, this organisation is known to hire only top students from top universities and I feel inadequate as I studied in a crappy university which didn't reallt build up my CS foundations. I still struggle in a lot of operating system and cyber security concepts.

Call me negative, but I'm worried of not being able to pass the probation due to my technical skills being way below others (which was obvious during my internship).

On the other hand, i have secured a master degree spot in one of the top universities.

Would really appreciate any input/advices. Should i pursue masters? Or should i proceed with the job offer? :(

Edit:
Thanks for all the replies. Didn't expect the thread to blow up this much and hence I didn't include as much details. 

I forgot to mention that I am based in Australia, where the job climate within the tech industry is not as bad as in the US. Industry-sponsored degrees are also uncommon.

Having finished my degree in the so-called 'crappy' uni, especially through all the online classes thanks to Melbourne's longest lockdown in the world, I have been having massive FOMO for not experiencing uni life. Not only that, I think what makes uni worth going is the exposure to smart and motivated people; which my uni lacks. 

So yes, I am wanting to pursue further studies again to sort of tick of the box to feel how it is like to actually be a uni student, while at the same time solidifying my CS foundations.

&#x200B;

Anyway, let me add my own spin to this list of pros, because let's be real, it could use a little sprucing up:

&#x200B;

\- No more living off of instant noodles and cheap beer (unless that's your thing, no judgement here). You can finally afford to treat yourself to some fancy-ass sushi or a nice bottle of wine without worrying about your bank account crying.

\- You get to use big words like ""synergy"" and ""collaboration"" without feeling like a total tool. In fact, you might even get rewarded for using them. Who knew?

\- You can finally unleash your inner fashionista because you don't have to wear the same sweatpants and hoodie every single day. You can actually wear, dare I say it, real clothes. Just don't forget to iron that shirt, champ.

\- You don't have to pretend to care about that one kid in your group project who never did any work. In fact, you get to be a part of a team where everyone pulls their own weight (hopefully).

\- You can finally put those study skills to good use because you'll actually be learning things that are relevant to your job. And if you're lucky, you might even learn something that you can use in real life (gasp!).

\- You get to experience the joy of getting paid for doing something that you actually enjoy (hopefully). It's like getting paid to eat ice cream. Okay, maybe not exactly like that, but you get the idea.

&#x200B;

* I attribute this outcome to my school's name (T10), having relevant experience, and applying early and being prepared for interviews. I would recommend you try to mimic these conditions as best you can. 
* I will not share any more details about my interviews or recruiting experience, because you don't need them. Me telling you what kind of question I got DOES NOT mean you will get a similar one, and you should (hopefully) be able to have a professional conversation with a recruiter or manager. 
   * Be familiar with common LC patterns (Sliding Window, Graphs, DP), and follow a structure when doing interviews (reread the question and examples, ask clarifying questions, identify edge cases, write brute force, optimize, etc.)
   * Be able to talk deeply and intelligently about what you have on your resume
      * They are things you did, you should be able to
   * Just relax, don't stress unnecessarily about the details, doing the above well will give you the best chances at getting good opportunities. ",2023-09-30 14:29:57
14f4w3a,Manager wants me to create an interactive floor-plan that tracks employee movement in the office,"UPDATE: My manager suggests I create it using Power BI 🤡
======================================================================
I'm currently interning at a company, and I've been tasked with developing an employee location tracking platform. I could really use some guidance as I'm not sure where to begin. 

Here's what I need to achieve:

* Provide a dashboard for managers to view the real-time location status of employees.
* Ensure the system is user-friendly and the floor-plan can be edited

I'm seeking advice on the following:

* Recommended tools or technologies for developing an employee location tracking system.
* Strategies for integrating the system with existing employee databases or systems.
* Any considerations for privacy and data security while tracking employee locations.

14j0yin,Should I quit SWE/CS,"Hey everyone. I know it’s shitpost Sunday, but this is a very serious post. I am hoping to get genuine advice and serious answers. In addition, I am genuinely unsure if this post goes on this sub, relationship advice, or anything else. It’s kind of a niche/specific issue 

To sum it up, I am currently in a relationship and his family is from India. My boyfriend has been nothing but supportive throughout my entire journey of college, and computer science. I admittedly wasn’t a computer science major before my sophomore year, and it was because of him that I picked up coding and got to learn much more. He has helped me through some of my biggest challenges, and we’ve genuinely grown so much together and love each other deeply. This summer, I got an internship opportunity at a Big N company thanks to his support and guidance in helping me learn leetcode etc. 

This weekend, I had the opportunity to meet his extended family for the first time ever thanks to FaceTime (they live in India). And to put it blatantly, they might be sexist. Not only were they shocked that a woman could be attending a prestigious technical school located in Cambridge (yes I was initially just a women and gender studies major), but they were also shocked that a white woman could learn how to code. His aunt spoke some words with him in what appeared to be Hindi or an Indian language/dialect. Obviously I did not understand anything. But afterwards, he asked if we could talk in private.

He pulled me aside and basically, to sum it up, said his auntie and his family didn’t support a woman being in cs, and didn’t want me to be the working one in the family if we ever got married, as it was against their religion and social norms. 

He affirmed to me very seriously that he did not agree with his family’s sentiments and loved me very much and is supportive of me pursuing a career in tech, specifically SWE. What should I do? Should I lie and say I quit SWE to his extended family? Should I let him cut ties with his family? Genuinely lost

Edit: he booked a nice dinner for us, and straight told me he loved me and would leave his entire family for me. But at the same time I got frustrated that his brother was there the entire time yapping my ear off about how I’ll never be successful in the tech industry sadly because I’m not a man and my coworkers won’t treat me seriously. I literally threw my napkin on the table and walked out. It’s been 30 mins since I’ve last spoken to him and his family",2023-06-25 23:34:53

\+ 10-month tenure is not enough for entry-level positions (most require 2+ yoe or at least 1+yoe). Some might accept 0+ yoe... but I never hear back from them.

\+ Defense field requires security clearance which I do not have

\+ >500 applications, 0 OAs, 1 failed recruiter screening (non-technical, just chit-chat)

I have been applying like crazy and grinding leetcode (360LC with 215 being medium so far). I'm also taking some coding bootcamp to keep me in the game but honestly... I don't see much light at the end of the tunnel

If you have any advice/leads/referrals/insights or you're also going through this or you successfully made it back to the industry after getting laid off, please let me know or ping me in the chat. Feels like I'm dying every day. This is mentally and emotionally draining me. Thank you.

Edit:

\+ No, I do not require sponsorship. I am a US citizen.

\+ Regarding Defense, I tried applying for associate/junior positions at Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Thales... but no luck. Please help suggest some other defense companies

185ibnw,Life as a New Grad Software Engineer,"Hi all,

After graduating college, I am left with this empty void. School provided a structured path. Now without school, how do I make it feel that I am continuing a path of success? My life on paper is great! But yet I am so bored and depressed.

I graduated back in June. I work remote. I'm 23 making 130k as a 'Senior Software Engineer'. Salary doesn't reflect 'Senior', but that's my job title on paper at least.

I moved to a new city after graduation. I know a handful of people here but no close relationships.

I'm in a long distance relationship with a girl. I met her right before I was about to move. We've been seeing each other for about 4 months, and 3 of those months have been long distance.

What can I do to find value in my life?

EDIT:

Currently, I have a part-time job that brings in some income. My plan is to quit the part-time job and spend all of my time leet-coding, building projects, and applying (8 -10 hours per day). This may sound risky, but I want to go ALL in. I am feeling pretty lost for the once familiar structure of my life has been removed. Now, I am entering uncharted waters.

1afzitw,Did I just lose my stock offer????," In the summer of 2022, I interned at Microsoft as a SWE. Near the end of the summer, I negotiated with my recruiter to increase my total comp, which was heavily stated as being base + sign on + stock. However, the stock never was written on my offer letter. I asked my recruiter about this while on the phone with him (several times!) and he said it was fine and that that was normal. I signed the offer thinking the stock was just separate thing or something. I didn’t know better - I trusted my recruiter. The only thing I have in writing an email thread where I ask about the stock amount, to which he replies “your stock is ‘insert amount’…” and that’s it. No other details about 4 year vesting, etc. Now, I don’t see that compensation in HR, and I am wondering if they just took the signed offer letter at face value, and fucked me. I’m also wondering if my recruiter just fucked up by not putting it on there. Has anyone else experienced something like this? I find it ridiculous that I might lose out on such a significant part of my comp because a recruiter fucked up and i blindly took his word that it was “all good” and signed because they wouldn’t let me push the deadline either. 

UPDATE: after countless emails to countless people and HR (since my recruiter was no longer with the company), I ended up getting lucky and emailing some business admin higher up who was listed on my offer letter. She didn’t respond yet routed me to another individual. They acknowledged the error, and are getting me a new recruiter and offer letter. Everything worked out.

168chox,Let’s be real. We suck.,"Okay I need to say something, I’ve seen so many posts about how new grads are doomed and can’t get jobs blah blah blah. Is it tough out there? Yes. But let’s think about it with some logic the entire world is more more towards the degree we have or are getting, while the industry sucks rn it won’t forever. And even though it sucks it doesn’t suck that much more than other majors, we all just expect to get paid 120k right out of college working from home after we spent most of our college careers being losers at least that’s what I see around me. All the people in my CS classes are either just in it for the money and are kinda dumb or they are total nerds who want to build video games and watch anime, and both sides of this spectrum think they are superior but complain about how terrible the market is 24/7. So let’s be real that industry is bad but there are a lot of positions out there especially in the 50k-75k a lot of people just think lesser of those even though that’s the peak for a lot of society. I’m tired of all the doom and gloom. It’s not that bad even with an over saturated market those of us who aren’t idiots and have decent soft skills will do just fine. 

TLDR: Everyone is kinda dumb and we shouldn’t freak out that we won’t be able to get jobs when the world is moving towards our market. Check your gangster, we will be fine.


Edit: not trying to discount the struggle I just want us to be real with each other. The entire market isn’t doomed, yes a lot of people are struggling but that’s with most new grads I know. Sorry to generalize but I figured I’d give my perspective since I see a lot of people being real bummed about all this. Much love y’all, I know it’s hard rn but we can make it through.",2023-09-02 20:13:08

I've submitted thousands of job applications, and out of those, I've only managed to land interviews with two companies: Google and Amazon. I suspect that being a foreigner might be a factor, as smaller companies don't even seem to consider my resume.

Last year, I interviewed with Google for an internship role; they said they would get back to me within a week after the interview, but they ended up rejecting me after 3 months of ghosting. No feedback.

In early April, I interviewed with Amazon for a full-time SDE role; their policy is to provide feedback within 5 business days, but it took them three weeks to reject me, again without any feedback.

I've completed several online assessments for some other companies. And often scored full marks. But none have resulted in interviews.

I'm fluent in three languages (English is my weakest) and have multiple startup experiences under my belt, where I single-handedly built entire systems as a full-stack developer. I feel confident in my skills and have numerous competitive programming achievements, so I'm comfortable with both online assessments and interviews.

18wngt8,My Maths major has been completely useless,"I am a Computer Science major that took a second major in Maths in order to build a stronger quantitative background for data science.

Beyond Linear Algebra, everything I've learned seems to be weird and of limited practical use. 

I don't see how reading baby rudin and solving difficult problems related to open balls, connectedness and continuity on metric spaces is relevant at all to anything. 

When I took a class on probability, the professor had an obsession with Sigma algebras and being super rigourous with deriving everything, and didn't seem to care much about applications at all. When I took a class on Optimization, the course focused on finding clever linear algebra tricks to solve unusual problems instead of how the algorithms are used in practice.

The worst part is nowhere in my degree I can learn about basics of linear regression or other essential statistics, since there are no courses covering that from the maths or computer science department. These are only taught from electives under the faculty of statistics, but I have already hit my university's credit limit from double majoring.

I have been trying to learn relevant statistics topics by myself outside of class, but doing internships and a double major has consumed most of my time and energy, especially since maths professors seem to love setting crazy hard questions - learning the material isn't enough for them, they expect you to learn it inside out and memorize all the proofs too.

I go to a state college in the southeast US that’s pretty easy to get into. None of the CS students I know are spending tons of time grinding leetcode or doing this and that. I haven’t met anyone who has openly expressed interest in working at FAANG or other big tech companies. They have decent social lives.

Then I come here and that’s all people talk about. They want FAANG. They want to get balls deep into leetcode all the time. They have these crazy resumes that make you think they helped put a fucking rocket into space.

18j4dhs,I was humbled after finals,"Let me explain…
Final grades came out and I had a mix of emotions, both angry and upset and I kind of lost motivation to finish school. I would just like some words of encouragement to pull myself through. Or if anyone can share their comeback story I would appreciate it.

I got straight D’s for my final grades in every class I took this semester, with a percentage of 68-69 percent. The 3 classes were the infamous Data Structures (Java), Computer Systems and Programing (C), and lastly Formal Methods and Models (Discrete Mathematics). 

Now I will take accountability and say for my discrete mathematics course, I could’ve put more effort since I was dedicating my time into C and Java so I will own up to that. 

For Java and C that really had me upset, only because the amount of TIME spent on learning the material for the course, I went to both office hours in the course many times and the projects I did well on, but atlas the reason why I failed was because of the final exam (weight on the final is worth 45 percent). 

We were allowed to use a cheatsheet and I based my cheatsheet from the midterms I did well on along with notes but all in all it wasn’t enough, and it really feels like a slap in the face.

All I need to pass was a 70 percent and for my major its very rare that professors curve, so what I get is final.

So I’m at a loss, I put the work in and get slightly less than average and then the classes I need are pre-requisites for my senior level courses. 

Feeling bummed going into winter break but I’m wondering if anyone has dealt with this before…

Thanks!!",2023-12-15 16:45:33
18ccpmv,<2.5 GPA and received my full-time FAANG offer a few weeks ago,"Disclaimer that I am a 3x intern at this company and go to a Top 4 school for CS, which is why I do not think my experience is universal however I believe that GPA does not ultimately determine how good of an offer you can get.

17k85uv,Why do so many applicants on LinkedIn have Master's Degrees?,"With LinkedIn premium, you can get insights into what the applicants for a certain job look like under the job listing with the heading ""See how you compare to other applicants"". I really only started paying attention to it after LinkedIn started putting ""Over 150 applicants"" on every listing instead of the actual number, because it's the only way you can actually see how many people actually hit apply for a specific job. It has the ""seniority level"" (entry-level, senior, associate, etc.), general location of applicants, and a couple other insights.

One of these headings is ""Applicant education level"" which allegedly shows you what kind of degree the applicants have. The highest estimate I can find for how many SWEs have masters' degrees is around [23%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793568/worldwide-developer-survey-level-formal-education/) of all US developers. To me that seems high, as I can't think of a single SWE I've ever worked with that has a master's, but I suppose it's possible.

I went on LinkedIn job search and searched ""Software Engineer"" with no filters and what I found shocked me. These jobs weren't cherry picked, just the first five listings I found:

* Take [this](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3746782625/) totally normal entry/mid-level Salesforce Developer job. On site, 100+ applicants in a week. According to LinkedIn 65% of those applicants have a Master's Degree.
* [This](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3727132213) Meta position has 55% Master's degree applicants.
* [This](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3733187100) completely unremarkable on-site dev job has 52% Master's degree applicants
* [This](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3736813305) high-paying on-site job is $92 an hour, but 73% of applicants have a master's degree, so why bother?
* [This](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3745696023) job only has 27 applicants, but 76% have a master's degree. And a further 12% have a master's degree in business administration. So, 88%. 22% Have a bachelor's degree, and 3% have other degrees.

After checking the first 25 results on the first page, only 2 had less than 40% master's degree applicants. [This](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3745699789) job was the lowest with 33% of applicants having a master's degree, which is still significantly higher than the national average of SWEs with master's degrees. The average amount of applicants with SWEs was 59%. What the fuck.

I encourage anyone here with LinkedIn premium to do the same. Maybe this is just me, after all? I'll show my work in the the comments because this post is already getting long. If this is real, what does this mean for a normal guy like me (and I imagine most of you) who just got a normal Bachelor's in Computer Science? Should I go back to school? Any explanation for this at all other than ""market crazy lol"" would be helpful.

15ocb5f,Ignore the negative bs,"This sub was rough for me last semester. All the ""there's no jobs, I'm ghosted all the time"" posts made me think it was hopeless. It made me second guess myself and be worried that the job market was dismal.

Yet I managed to get an internship at a major company, despite being at a shitty state school no one has heard of with a crap CS department. I also managed to turn that internship into an offer for after I graduate next year.

I'm not some savant, I didn't grind leetcode til my eyes bled. I simply went to all the career fairs and when my resume wasn't getting me OAs I changed it til it was. When I bombed interviews, I tried to fix what I said and how I approached the technical process.

I get not everyone has the same experience, but I think it's important we start to force some requirements on these negative posts. I thought when I got my first job locked up I'd just post one of those celebratory posts, but honestly this place was so toxicly negative to me that I wanted to point this out for anyone else as scared or nervous about their future as I was.

The worst of us post our sob stories here and leave out the details. They don't mention how they may do leetcode every day but never touch their resume. How they had an internship but didn't make a single connection during it. They don't say if they're international students looking exclusively at companies outside of their home country.

***TL;DR:*** don't be like me and take these woe is me posts at face value. People exaggerate and they bullshit and if you try there's 100% jobs out here.

**Edit:** Lots of responses, both good and bad, just take a minute to notice all the people who claim how bad it is and that I'm lucky or wrong or whatever don't back it up. I made an anecdotal claim, they could (if they're being intellectually honest) easily dispute it considering how many people claim to have hundreds and hundreds of apps with not even 1 offer, but not once have I seen anything that tries to do so.

https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm

Please don't let these doom and gloom folks disuade you. Treat everything you read in these subs as bullshit until proven otherwise. How many of them actually applied to 1000 different companies?

17wg2v5,Things I learned interviewing a bunch of new grads,"There's a normal distribution in candidates, even among those who have strong resumes. A good looking resume with your tech stack is essential, that's what gets you the interview.

Communication skills are key in interviews. It doesn't matter if you can code, you have to *convice* us you can code. We're not making you do obscure coding challenges. You have to speak to the technical details of your resume. Every constituent part of an interview is based on your ability to communicate.

First, most new grads have projects on their resumes. We want *details*. I already know what you did when you say ""Developed an API for my book club using Flask"", but I want you to tell me about routing, decorators, functions, modules. Tell us *exactly* what happens when we hit your API. Tell us about having to install flask-cors. Bonus points if you deployed it.

Second, how you present yourself is essential. An interview is like a first date. We want you to succeed. Relax, smile, and never say anything negative about yourself. We heard some statements indicating a lack of self confidence. There is no such thing as a resume gap. You graduated, and it takes time to land the first job.

Third, study the tech stack in the job posting. Often times we'll ask basic questions about a framework, like React, and not even get the most essential attributes. React is a JavaScript based framework, but tell us, what exactly is a ""framework"", and what makes the React framework special? I realize in college you spend a lot of time studying complex algorithms and doing fun things in C++, but it's just not practical for a lot of dev jobs. We're going to quiz you on the tech stack. Read the docs.

Finally, *the most important attribute of any employee anywhere*, is that they are nice. It doesn't matter if you're the most talented developer in the world, if you're an asshole, we still hate you. A lot of companies *don't* have toxic environments, and a lot of companies *will* terminate their strongest engineer if he's an asshole. All things being equal, we hire the nice guy/gal every time.

Good luck!",2023-11-16 06:24:47

These are just what people say. I have my own opinions. But what do you all think, is this really a safety net? There’s a ton of people about to graduate with no job in CS.

Here are the rounds (each round can get you eliminated):

1. Apply and fill out the hiring assessment (competency questions about how you work and what you would do in different situations)
2. 3 weeks later: Contacted by recruiter giving me information to schedule a live technical through Karat. The live technical was around a week later. Interview was 1hr long consisting of 6 questions on 2 topics of your choice. I chose OOP and Testing I think. Live coding was 45 minutes long. I had 2 med-easy questions. IDK if they were leetcode as I have never seen them before. I finished the first one pretty quick. First you are asked to explain your approach. Then you type some code and debug. I explained my solution and passed all the test cases in about 15-20 minutes. The second question was harder. It took more thinking. My first approach didn't account for some edge cases so I didn't have time to finish. I explained my new approach that actually worked (I tested this after the interview). I would have been able to write the new code if I had about 5 more minutes.
3. Next Day: Got the email saying I passed and I needed to schedule the final behavioral interview. The behavioral was also a little over a week after I was notified I passed the technical. I interviewed with a Senior SWE and he was really nice and chill. Probably one of the nicest interviewers I have ever had. It lasted a little over 40 minutes. He asked 3 questions. They were technical and behavioral at the same time. You needed to talk about the technical side and it was also assessing your soft skills.

133xqah,How with deal the fact that I’m going to end with a C+ in Discrete Math.,"I just want to talk to someone about this…cuz I just need to get it off my chest.

This class has been the bane of my existence for the past four months. It has honestly robbed me a lot of inner peace, time with my girlfriend, time with my parents and friends, and overall just trying to enjoy my first year of college. I tried everything with this class, watching Kimberly Brehm on YouTube and taking notes, talking and working other students in my class, and working with a tutor every now and then to help me review for exams…even then I was only able to muster up a B- heading into finals week. 

However, due to amount of shit I had due, attending an awards ceremony for my girlfriend, and just feeling so burnt out from college, I only have 3 days to study for this fucking final and I just want to give up so bad. Most if it is not even cumulative, with a lot the test testing on shit we did after Test 3, which covers Relations which I do not get at all no matter how hard I try. 

Every single fiber of my being just wants to curl up into a ball on my bed and let this pass. I did the math and I can will pass the class with a C+ if I completely bomb the final. On top of that, I gotten A’s in everything else my freshman year, so it won’t hurt any of my scholarships. 

At the same time I know, employers will look at this, they want people who can think logically and algorithmicaly. Plus, my own brain will blame me for getting a C+, stating that it’s cuz I spent way too much time with my girlfriend that I got the C+. Even though it’s complete bull and my gf had nothing to do with this. 

Has anyone ever experienced this before?? If so how did u get ur brain to stop thinking like this and just fucking study? Am I just being too hard on myself or not hard enough?? 

I know this is just a rant but I needed it to get it off my chest, thx for reading anyway!







Edit: I’m blown away by the response…I honestly thought u guys where going to make fun of me for feeling this way and honestly looking back on it, it is really silly and stupid for all those hours and days I wasted throughout the semester worried about this class.

Regardless, thank you so much for the responses, it’s just hard figuring out a major that nobody in ur family has ever gotten, and understanding what employers want out of me when I graduate has been a black box for me. 

I do now understand that I am tying my own self worth to my grades and that is not the way to go. Especially when things get harder along the road, I understand now that this is just a grade and nothing more. I’m still going to study, but with a lot less pressure on myself and accept whatever score I get. I also now know it’s more important to build meaningful side projects, leetcode, and overall just life a happy life as a college student than stress anymore about this stupid class",2023-04-30 17:25:39
12dksyb,Can teachers be jealous of their students?,"I was given a take home project assignment for the mobile development class. The project was really basic. Since I had some experience doing mobile development on my own, it was a peace of cake and kind of boring, so I decided to implement extra features that would make it a bit more interesting.

I thought the teacher would be happy and encouraging to see one of her students really motivated to do her assignments. But none of that happend. First, she accused me of cheating, I didn't know how to respond to that so I started explaining the code to prove that understood all of it. Finally, she was convinced but this time she thinks, her words, what I did was ""too advanced"" for the project she had given. Somehow she sees that as a negative thing, so she refuses to give me a grade for the project.

Personally, I don't give a shit about grades, as long as I can pass. But this was really frustrating. I stayed awake multiple nights doing the project and hoping I get a simple recognition, but this is what I get. 

I don't know what was the reason behind this , was it her being jealous? Or did I break the ""don't outshine the master"" rule aka being a smart ass or what?

I really would like to hear your input or similar stories from your own experience.

Edit:
A lot of the comments focused on the jealousy part and forgot everything else. I'm not confirming it was jealousy, although believe or not it happens. Right now, I think the most logical theory is that the teacher was trying to teach me a lesson for not following the instructions, like I'm a fucking processor or something. I don't have problems with following the spec I was given, just not in a university setting. I see university as an opportunity to experiment, make mistakes and eventually learn. It just doesn't feel right to turn a creative field like computer science into this dull instructions-following process.",2023-04-06 13:43:30

It's hard to gauge how well I'm doing. Problems will randomly be way, WAAY harder even within their own medium/ hard tiers. There's no clear way of knowing if I'm improving and it's really unsatisfying when I have to look up a solution.

There's always a problem every time I open leetcode that I just don't know how to solve. I'm all about the 'if I put in the effort, I will see visible progress/ returns every other week', but this leetcode thing doesn't follow this pattern. Yes, I have the discipline to leetcode every day, but it's hard to leetcode properly when I just don't care about it. 'Why try when I'm going to look at the solution anyways?'

I finally found one that perfectly aligns with what I’m studying but my department has refused to sign my work authorization to let me work this job.

1595rwt,Fired from Undergrad Research,"Hello all -

So I am going to be a junior this upcoming fall and struck out on internships this past school year. I was thankfully hired at a university lab at my school and worked for the past 8 weeks. However, I recently got fired for incompetence/lack of productivity.I am discouraged right now to tell you the truth. I feel as if a big reason as to why I did not get an internship this past school year was because my resume was/is blank and this research project would've given me something interesting to put on there. So my question for csMajors is, although I got fired - is it still worth it to put this research experience on my resume despite of what happened? Now that I have the rest of this month off before I go off to school I am grinding leetcode day and night, coding more, practicing version control, etc. It was good while it lasted.

Update. For those that want more details (I don't really use/like Reddit so pardon me for the 1 day late edit): 

I would not get my work done before the deadlines. I would oftentimes get stuck on a problem, try my best to figure it out on my own, then oftentimes I would struggle A LOT and wouldn't feel comfortable asking for helping. When I would ask for help, my boss (the PHD student) would just go off on me how I am getting paid and need to get it done ASAP, he needs a problem solver on the team, etc. I was tasked to learn Git/Github, but I never really did. I don't mean to make excuses/blame my CS department, but at least at my school (B1G university) there is such a huge emphasis on never collaborating with anyone/working with other people because a lot of people in CS at my school get hit with academic dishonesty reports (depending on the prof and assignment, they can fail you for the assignment you cheated on. Some professors just straight up fail you for the entire class. Getting multiple can result in expulsion). It's not even like I'm an antisocial deeb either, I'm in a social frat, have a gf, can easily hold conversations with people. Communication is not my issue in my personal life. I also need to come to terms that the classroom and the industry are obviously going to have there differences. I did end up writing nearly 700 lines of code in python at my time there so I guess it is worthwhile to put on my resume????

17280az,Microsoft SWE Intern Interview Results,"Hey yall,

I wanted to share my recent experience with the Microsoft interview process. This is an update from my previous post. I applied online, submitted my resume, and, to my surprise, I received an email congratulating me on reaching the final interview round without any technical phone screens.

# 

# My Background:

I got a lot of questions asking how I got pushed to the final round, here are my qualifications:

* Previous internship at defense company
* Athlete in college
* Technical Military experience
* Minority

I go to a liberal arts states school that is no where near ranked. I also have a very mediocre GPA at 3.1 but I seclude it from my resume so they wouldn't know. (they also never asked)

# 

# My Prep:

I scheduled the interviews around 3 weeks from the initial email. For preparations I never took Data Structures and Algorithms before so a lot of my time was learning DSA. I took a Udemy course by Scott Barret called:

[Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises](https://parsons.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/)

I was able to access this course for free due to my previous internship's Udemy Business account. It was incredibly helpful, especially because of the animations explaining each data structure and the coding problems after each lesson.

I also used Leetcode, where my Leetcode Premium subscription allowed me to pinpoint the types of questions Microsoft asks. The Microsoft Explore Card had every question asked to me during my interview except one.

# 

# Interview Day:

On the interview day, they scheduled a 6-hour block of time. In the morning, a recruiter brought everyone into a Microsoft Teams call to introduce everyone and answer questions. This person would be the one delivering the offer letter or the declination email.

In my first interview, I initially thought the interviewer wouldn't show up because he was 5 minutes late. Eventually, he arrived, and after introductions, he asked me a couple of questions about my resume. Then, he pasted a Leetcode Medium problem about Linked Lists into the Teams chat, which was also on the Microsoft Explore Card. He asked me to walk through a solution. I got most of the problem right, except for a crucial part about the data structure. After that, I asked him a series of questions I had prepared until the next interview.

For the second interview, it was a similar experience with the interviewer being about 5 minutes late. This interviewer seemed disinterested and preoccupied. We didn't exchange introductions; she simply went over my resume and asked questions about my previous internship. Afterward, she sent a Codility link where she presented three coding questions, all of which were relatively easy. I made a mistake with the first question because I didn't fully understand it. She allowed me to try again with some more common questions about Linked Lists, which I answered flawlessly. Once the coding was done, I attempted to ask her questions, but she said she had to leave after just one question and suggested connecting on LinkedIn if I had more. (She did not connect back lol)

&#x200B;

# Results:

Exactly a week later, I received an email from the recruiter informing me that I did not pass the interview. However, I am not giving up. I plan to take the lessons from this experience, learn from them, and come back stronger. If any of you have questions, feel free to ask. I'll do my best to answer, but if they're too private, I might not be able to.

Let's turn this moment of setback into one of motivation and resilience.

Thank you all for being an amazing community.",2023-10-07 14:43:16
16yl32h,I am this close 🤏 to giving up on CS -- applied to ~500 applications over 3 years and have gotten almost no where,"\[Background\]

I'm currently a third-year student at a top 50 computer science school. My journey into the world of programming began in 8th grade when I started experimenting with Python and building simple websites. The real spark for my computer science journey came in 9th grade when I took an introductory CS class, learning Python and Visual Basic.

Throughout high school, I worked on various projects, from solving homework problems to automation and web scraping. In 10th grade, I got into data science with a project on estimating asteroid collision families in the Kuiper Belt using kNNs. In 11th grade, I started to use deep learning on a project on arrhythmia detection in ECGs using CNNs in PyTorch.

During the summer before my 12th grade, I secured a research internship at a university and even got a paper published on ResNets. In my senior year, I continued my research by attempting to convert heart sounds to ECGs for arrhythmia detection and developed an app using Flutter with a fastAPI backend.

&#x200B;

\[Early Internship Struggles\]

After high school, I shifted towards software engineering and learned React with the MERN stack. I had an unpaid internship at an Airbnb knockoff and another internship at a startup, where I trained YOLO models for defect detection.

The real challenge began when I started applying for freshman-only software engineering internships. I was desperate and even attempted to scrape companies using Workday to reverse engineer their API for internship listings. Despite applying to around 140 internships, I received only one interview, which I managed to secure at a manufacturing company.

&#x200B;

\[Continuing Struggles\]

In my second year of college, I was determined to secure an internship at a tech company. I applied to approximately 120 internships but faced rejection from all of them. I tried to obtain a return offer, but it didn't work out. I ended up with a grant for research and a heavy academic workload over the summer.

In late April, out of nowhere, I received a call from the manufacturing company where I interned previously, and I accepted the offer. 2.5 full-time commitments

&#x200B;

\[Transition to New Grad Roles\]

Originally, my plan was to graduate a semester early, but due to the summer semester, my plan was to graduate in three years. This left me looking for new graduate roles. I read a Reddit post suggesting that following up with recruiters after applying increased response rates significantly.

I created an auto-emailing script with Python using the Apollo.io API to that reached out to around 10 university recruiters from around 60 tech companies , sending around 600 emails. Surprisingly, only about 35 recruiters replied, resulting in a 6% response rate. With this strategy, I began applying for new grad roles and following up with recruiters. However, despite my efforts, I received mostly rejections and very few interview invitations.

I tried to shift gears and also apply for internships as if worst comes to worst I could at least take an extra semester and the retry again next year for new grads.

&#x200B;

\[Frustration and Current Status\]

I've now applied to around 200 internships and new grad roles with zero offers so far and only two interviews, one of which led to rejection. It's incredibly frustrating as I've been preparing for an ideal job at a good-sized company for the last 4.5 years (admittedly I haven't grined grined leep code, but have done a good 50). I have four professional experiences, including three software engineering internships, and a collection of side projects I've worked hard on.

Over the last 3 years I applied to around 500 roles and have gotten almost no where (with 1 offer). I legit feel like I am somehow blacklisted.

&#x200B;

I've tried different resumes, creating seven custom ones in total, but the struggle continues. It just doesn't seem to add up, and I'm feeling lost and discouraged.

Any advice, similar experiences, or insights would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

TLDR

Worked really hard for the last 4 years of my life to get into a good tech company but looks like I'm gonna fail.

11auqbp,A step-by-step technical interview playbook I made for myself after hundreds of interviews,"Technical interviews are tough, and they made me feel nervous like nothing else. In my first interview ever, after hours Leetcode and feeling prepared, I froze up the second I was asked an LC-easy problem. This didn't stop - on phone screens or zoom interviews, I found myself underperforming even though I knew I could solve the problem afterwards. Even in interviews in which I ""solved the problem"", I was met with rejections without much feedback.

I took a step back and realized that grinding leetcode was only the start. So I made a technical interview playbook for myself after collecting insights from every resource I could. It was by no means a script that I could follow robotically, but rather a mental model of checkpoints that I kept in my head to give myself confidence to ensure smooth interviews. It's a collection of what I think are best practices during interviews to proficiently highlight the four skills on which I was getting evaluated on:

1. Problem solving
2. Coding
3. Debugging
4. Communication

Everyone has a different approach when it comes to interview strategy, so this is only what worked for me - but, it's been helpful to my friends who've asked me for help on interviews previously.

There are a million resources on learning to code solutions to DS&Algo problems, so I won't reinvent the wheel on that topic. Instead, I hope to provide at least a template of a playbook you could create for yourself with concrete steps to make sure that your problem solving prep can shine through to the interviewers.

If you prefer to consume the same info using visuals & audio or follow along with a video, here's a link: [https://youtu.be/V0kT9mLYPa0](https://youtu.be/V0kT9mLYPa0)

## 1. Clarifying questions

Kinda cliché, but as a software engineer, you need to start solving problems with the right assumptions. Asking clarifying questions is doing that but at the scale of an interview.

**How**

When the interviewer gives you the problem, start by asking questions to fully understand what you’re being asked to solve. For example, if they give you a problem on arrays, ask about the data types of the elements inside the array, sorted/unsorted, or the min/max size of the arrays. All these things will shape how you should approach the problem.

**Why**

Even if you think you’ve solved the given problem before in a practice setting, it’s in your best interest to make sure that you have all the right assumptions laid out, and that you clearly communicate to the interviewer your ability to spot out the details and embrace ambiguity with confidence and curiosity.

And this is a great first step to invite the interviewer in to your thinking process. An immediate feedback I got from my mock interviews was that interviewers should leave the interview knowing whether or not they want to work with your or not. People prefer to work with colleagues who can get the job done AND communicate with them.

## 2. Walk through different examples WITHOUT code

Make it explicit that you're going to run through some examples.

**How**

Even if the interviewer does not provide a set of example inputs/outputs, make sure to create some basic examples to confirm the expected behavior of your solution.

Create edge cases you can think of - for example, the weird corner cases of empty arrays, arrays with a million elements, or nulls and zeroes.

**Why**

This heavily leans in to you signaling to the interviewer that you’re extremely thorough; that you can test/debug things and hypothesize expected outcomes even before coding.

It's also an opportunity to catch your own misunderstanding of the problem not in the middle of writing code on a white board, where you can so easily panic because you totally missed out on some important pieces of information.

Walking through examples also brings the interviewer a step closer to you; you’re really trying to maintain a nice communication channel throughout the entire interview.

Doing all of this without an explicit solution in mind will prevent you from falling into traps or optimization paralysis while becoming malleable to different solutions and approaches.

# 2.5 Feel free to take some time to think for yourself

It's ok, and encouraged, to explicitly ask for some time to gather your intuition for a few minutes. Take that time and shake-off the nervous jitters.

# If you feel stuck...

**Speak out loud and don't sit in silence**. If you can't wrap your head around a certain part of the problem and the intuition isn't coming to you, let the interviewer know what you're stuck with: 

""I'm struggling to figure out how I can ...""  
""I've got this part down, but I'm not sure how to best proceed with this other part.""

They might give you a hint (which is better than just being stuck) or give you some pointers to help you move.

Also - if you're really really stuck and you can't come up with anything, that's ok. Start the intuition step by creating ""brute force"" solutions. That way, you'll have started solving the problem at least rather than not having anything on the board.

## 3. Outline your solution

**How**

I personally like to use pseudocode at this stage to outline my solution because it’s a lot easier for the interviewer to understand clearly what I’m doing.

For example, say the problem is to return the index of a target element in an unsorted array;

function FIND(target, array):  
  \# for index in array:  
\# check if target == array\[index\] -> return index if so  
  \# return -1 if not found after looping all the way through

Afterwards, verify with the interviewer if it looks good.

**Why**

You might be wondering, “Well isn’t it just better to use all of this time to just write the solution to solve the problem given that I only get 30 minutes?”. Actually, I’ve found that I save so much time by writing outlines and just filling in the gaps. It allows me to iterate on my solution quickly and catch easy mistakes I would have otherwise made - compare to having to reconstruct an entire code block from scratch.

Also you get to simplify and organize your solution, which makes it so easy for the interviewer to understand what you’re doing. Having this organized skeleton of pseudcode makes it possible for you and the interviewer to be on the same page, and this can save your interview if you somehow missed a crucial piece of information.

You can also display proficiency in methodical problem solving and clean code by writing different helper functions too via pseudo code - huge brownie points.

It gives you an opportunity to mention if you think there’re optimizations you can make to your solution. This way, you also saved time on not coding up a slower or a more spacious solution. You should directly ask your interviewer if you’re good to start writing code to fill in your outline.

## 4. Coding

**How**

Your outline should be enough for the interviewer to very clearly understand your solution. The way that I look at it, this should really be the easiest part, where it just comes to you naturally and automatically after all those hours prepping on Leetcode.

## 5. Check your solution

**How**

Be extra proactive about testing and debugging. As soon as you finish your code implementation, you don’t wanna let the interviewers prompt you to test your code. Do it immediately. Ask them, “hey is it alright if I run through some examples to make sure that I didn’t forget anything.”

Run through the example inputs/outputs you set up earlier through your code. And if you catch any mistakes, great, don't panic. You've just demonstrated the ability to debug your own code without the interviewer catching it themselves. Take your time to think through what the mistake is and fix it.

**Why**

In software engineering, thorough testing prevents sevs and unexpected behaviors. By replicating this at the scale of an interview, you will look trustworthy and professional.

## 6. Time/Space complexity + further optimization

**How**

O(n) notation. Explain why you've come to that conclusion by walking through each piece of your code and how it contributes to the time/complexity.

For example, ""Because we loop through an unsorted array at most once without altering the state of the array, the time complexity is O(n)""

**Why**

When you work on problems at scale, saving resources (time/compute/storage) is the name of the game. This is an excellent opportunity to mention any optimizations you could make.

For everyone who made it to the end, something I cannot emphasize enough is to find a buddy or two to do **mock interviews** with. Practicing to communicate technical concepts to another person in the room is very different from typing away on Leetcode, and it will take you so so far. You’ll get less and less nervous with more mock interviews under your belt.",2023-02-24 15:58:56
18jacbk,Interviewed at a large corporation…,"Hi everyone, 

I had a final interview at a massive international chemical corporation (revenue is 60B USD) 

They had me create a 10 slide PowerPoint showing my skills and answering questions that they sent me. So I did that, and then presented this over teams to the recruiter and manager for a cybersecurity and cloud computing internship. I then answered questions. This whole interview lasted about an hour. 

Fast forward a week, and the recruiter emails me saying “Good morning X, sorry for the late response. Due to budgeting, we’ve removed this position and so you will not be receiving an offer, feel free to apply again in the spring.” 

This was for a 1.5 year internship that was supposed to last until I graduate and then I’d receive a return offer for the cloud team.

16pn4en,It will be okay,"Everyone in this sub has seemed a million times more stressed than usual, which is impressive, and I want to offer some solace to the everyday people if I can.

Last year, end of summer after my sophomore year, I started applying to internships and taking OAs for this summer with

NO prior internship experience,
NO massive/impressive personal project,
NO leetcode grinding,
and NO tech-wiz school.  

I go to a tiny liberal arts college. The CS department here is the only thing they have thats remotely close to engineering and we have around 30 students total graduate with a CS degree every year. Im a decent student, but even in my tiny classes not close to the best by a long shot.

I still ended up with a solid internship and recently accepted a full-time offer. And you know who my coworkers were? A lot of kids like me and a lot of leetcode geniuses with incredible schools and past internships. We were all in the same place in the end. 

And this is the type of story I see and hear over and over from a lot of CS people at my little school. 

You do not have to completely sacrifice living your life, being with friends, and enjoying college to be become successful in CS with a well paying job with good work-life balance.

I’m not saying don’t work hard. I did, and I particularly worked hardest at formatting/constantly tweaking my resume and building/nailing behavioral answers with the help of my university’s career center, friends, and the internet so that each application I made mattered (quality over quantity). 

Don’t lose yourself in all of this. There should be more to you than your major, your career, leetcode, and ending up at a tech giant that’ll lay you off in a year because the internet and this sub says that’s what you should be doing.


Edit: applied to 75+ internships, got interviews with 4 of them, offer from 2.   I prepared my behavioral interview answers based off of amazon leadership principals. All my answers involved either athletic or class experience since I had no internship experience. I even used stories from high school. 

Everyone has experience. Even playing video games can be turned into good interview answers if they, in some minuscule way, taught you some important life lessons like how to work with a team.

Also, I forced myself to network. I tried to catch the eye of and connect with people in the industry any chance I got. Be genuine with people, have a heartfelt reason for wanting to work there, even if you have to really dig for it. I talked with a fast food corporation and they were like “why here?” and I told them “because [insert fast food place] has brought my friends and family together ever since I was little and a corporation that does that for people is one I could get behind working for”. Did I really want to work there for that reason? No, honestly I just wanted any internship I could get, as Im sure many can relate. But I convinced myself that that was actually why I wanted it so that I could sell it in the talk because that’s the stuff that’ll set you apart.",2023-09-22 22:13:46

Keep your heads up guys and keep applying.

I had premium for a little bit so i did it a ton but i did this mainly for positions i was really interested in or defense contractors. if you have to, use chatgpt- it’s not that deep. there is a possibility that two of the interviews i got was because of messaging recruiters but i can’t be certain.

Does anyone else have/had this problem and how do/did you cope with it?

Edit: since a lot of people are asking why did I even pick this major, I will just say that my passions/interests weren't much taken into consideration when picking my degree. I chose CS, because it was the most practical choice given my circumstances.",2023-07-21 18:12:12

However, I popped in to say that you guys should not be sleeping on those medium size tech companies. I mean those ranging from a few hundred to few thousands of employees, especially if it is in a decent tech hub location. These companies generally are the most stable, have a good wlb, and usually have good benefits, along with one or two outstanding benefits to attract talent. And for you international folks, they will generally sponsor H1B. 

My company has generally the most friendly and helpful employees, unlike in big tech where everyone seems to be at each others' throats. They also have free lunch, good benefits etc., and has laid off less than 7 people over the last 5 years combined. 

In a world of chaotic faang layoffs and inherent start-up instability, mid-tech companies seem to strike the right balance. If given the choice between a big-tech and medium size company right now, I would choose mid-size companies on most occasions, for long term stability, especially as an international student.",2024-02-08 07:23:18

17n6e8e,Are lower division course now weed-outs,"I got a CS degree 25 years ago and my daughter is just starting hers as a freshman now. I am wondering if things have changed?  When I went the major had about the same wash out rate (I think abound 75%) but I do not remember lower division courses being very hard. I think people really started dropping when they hit the 300 level algorithm courses.

My kid is in CS 210 (fist required course at UofO) and it seems kind of brutal. She is easily pulling A's in her other classes and a C in the CS class which she spends all her time on. I do not think it is just her as I saw the professors email with the class results and the average is a D-. This is after about a quarter of the class already dropped. The class is not curved and you must pull at least a B- to continue.  I also saw the midterm and it seemed way harder then mine were 3 weeks in.

So I am curious, are they just trying to weed people out early to not waste everyone's time with people who would have eventually dropped anyway?  If you get through the first year courses, do you have a pretty good chance of not washing out, or do the classes just get progressively harder?

&#x200B;

Edit - Thanks for all the replies. Sounds like it is supposed to be hard, and some fellow old people are telling me it always was. I think one of the following is my case:

A. I have forgotten the pain of the first year.

B. Although my first year test questions were much simpler, I am understating the difference in me doing it in C++ and my daughters class using Python and open notes.

C. My school was just weird. ",2023-11-03 22:04:54

All the other developers seems to be sooo busy and rushing to meet a deadline in a way that I wonder if I'd even be able to get a small simple task to do or not because I might delay things :( Everyone is nice and they told me I could count on them, but on our first team meeting I got a feeling that they're way too busy to deal with an intern. The internship program was idea of a new HR manager, so I don't get a project or something to dedicate myself because even tho they don't hate me, I'm sure they are not super excited about having to teach someone or prepared.

It's an one year internship, I'm still learning the tech stack, and even tho I already know how to code and have experience with complexes projects(so for me it's really just a matter of checking the documentation for sintaxis), since we're dealing with payment and sensitive data, I don't even know if there are small tasks for me to do.

Edit: I felt like I needed to add the fact that the reason why I even resort to chatGPT in 3) is because I am a really slow learner, as was evident even in high school.

Seems like there’re more than 1 LC questions they prepared but I only finished 1. 

3. After 9 days, got second/ final round interview invitation. It was half technical half behavioral. Totally verbal, no coding required. Was asked about GitHub, Git, Team collaboration besides self introduction. The interviewer was really nice, after this meeting I wrote recruiter a thank you email.

4. Now waiting for result. 

Good luck everyone ;)

199geqx,Graduated May 2023 + Still Unemployed,"So I graduated in May magna cum laude from a top liberal arts college with a CS Major. I had 1 prior internship (summer before graduating) doing front end work at a mid size company. I took the summer off due to burnout and have been applying since september. I have also been working on masters applications so a lot of my energy has been spent there. When I was applying very rigorously it felt frustrating and was difficult to get any responses from companies, I had only 1 interview, and I didnt move forward after 5 initial rounds. Also, I didn’t apply to 2023 new grad stuff during my senior year bc i was applying to grad school then too and then it just didn’t work out. 

I have moments where I feel like I chose the wrong career and maybe I am just not cut out for this. I feel like my resume is good on paper but maybe my technical skills aren’t that strong.",2024-01-18 03:30:58
16g8w0n,Never realized how important connections were until this year,"For the past two years of internship recruitment, I didn't reach out to anyone I knew in the field for a position. As a result, I had to apply for a lot of different positions to get offers. I wasn't too worried about it though, since I still had plenty of time to prepare for the new grad job search.

However, since I'm graduating this year, I've been worried about where I am going to be working after school. In the middle of the summer, I was scrolling through my emails and found a conversation from last year that I had with a recruiter from a company I had applied to the previous year. They told me that the position had been filled but that they were impressed with my application. My reply consisted of me thanking them for getting back to me and that I would be applying next year as well.

Although it was almost a year later, I decided to reach out to the same recruiter who sent the email and ask if they had opened their new grad positions. Surprisingly, the recruiter emailed me back quickly, informing me that, coincidentally, they were just about to open positions in the upcoming weeks. They essentially told me that they loved the persistence and would like to proceed with the interview process (which led to an offer).

It's crazy how much connections and luck play a role in getting offers.

I have gotten one interview this whole season after 150+ apps. My takeaway from this season for new grad, is that it looks like a lot of competitive companies are still hiring. But it takes more luck and skill to get an interview. My only interview came from a company that closed their applications in less than a day. I was lucky enough to get an OA but didn’t pass the on-site.

17fgrqj,My experience and advice to aspiring software engineers,"it seems like most of the cs subreddits are filled with doomer posts about how the market is bad or unsympathetic posts that basically show off nice cushy jobs to make people feel better about themselves without any insight that new cs students could benefit from. This post aims to be neither of those things. I just want to share my experience and hopefully its relevant to some people and will give them some sort of inspiration or knowledge. i will briefly go over where i was, where i am now, and most importantly, how i got there. I think all sections are relevant but if you just wanna skip to the part where I actually started programming, go to the discovering programming section. also i was born in 2000 so if you wanna know which year im in the math is easy.

**Early life: 0-12 yo**

I wont go too much into detail about my early life because its personal but to sum it up it was kinda traumatic. I was introduced to computers when a friend of mine had an ipod touch and i was hooked. since life at home as bad, computers became my escape where i could get away from the bad stuff happening at home and just tinker with them. i saved up and bought an ipod touch when i was about 8 and was on it all the time. around the same time, i found an old laptop in the basement that wasnt working but i was obsessed with it. my mom said if i can fix it, i can have it. and thats what i did. since i was 8 yo, it took me a long time to fix it but i eventually did. after that, relatives started asking me to fix their old laptops and computers and thats how i started fixing electronics. Even though my childhood was pretty rough, my mom always wanted me to be happy (along with my sister) and did everything she could. On my 11th birthday, my mom got me an xbox 360 with a copy of battlefield 3 (came out the day before my birthday). this meant the world to me especially since she didnt have much money and i played on it everyday after school.

**Teen years: 13-19 yo**

I was hooked on videogames and made friends with like minded people in high school. one of them said he built his own pc, a new concept to me. I said ""wait wait hold on, you actually built your own pc?"" He then explained it and I instantly wanted to do that myself. I had money saved up from summer jobs and made a budget of about $600 iirc. he walked me through it, gave me a parts list, and i built my first pc when i was either 13 or 14 i dont remember exactly what age. whenever something was wrong with it id troubleshoot it myself and fix it. when i was about 15 or 16 my online friend told me to join their bitcoin mining circle where we use our machines to mine bitcoin and buy games for eachother. I never heard about bitcoin before but i was intrigued (foreshadowing).the 16-18 years arent all that special and i hated school. i just wanted to go home and play videogames. but i am pretty smart, especially when it comes to anything STEM related. I would skip classes all the time and miss assignments but i would ace tests and this drove my sister and classmates crazy lol. my junior year i missed 35% of my classes and in my senior year i only WENT to 35% of my classes but still managed to graduate with a 2.8 GPA (iirc) and a 26 on ACT (33 on STEM part and 19 on english and reading iirc). I didnt study for the ACT but wanted to get a better score so i studied for it and took it again and ended up getting a worse score. After graduating high school i was pressured by family to go to college. I went to the University of North Dakota and majored in mechanical engineering. i didnt even want to major in this but i thought it was the best option, not even knowing cs exists \*facepalm\*. to make a long story short, i didnt do well. I was addicted to weed, alcohol, and videogames. not a good combo. then covid hit at the end of the year and schools werent prepared for online learning and the education was the same about everywhere so I left UND and enrolled in a local community college in my hometown and lived with my dad. my dad got me a job through one of his friends in construction and i spent my summers installing cabinets and science lab equipment. this was a turning point in my life as it gave me work ethic and exercise which i definitely needed.

**Discovering programming: 20-21 yo**

In community college i took a class called ""intro to programming"" that was a hands-on course where we did assignments in java. I loved that class and spent the most time in it and i programmed in my freetime. i was good at it too, good enough that the teacher gave me an honors A and offered a job as a part time tutor. I took the job and enjoyed helping other cs students with programming. during this time i got really interested in blockchain tech and crypto. I began messing around with smart contracts on ethereum and NFTs AKA ERC721/ERC1155 standard contracts (i know these are controversial and they deserve the hate they get. but if you look past the money hungry influencers and circle jerk communities, you can see their applications). I joined an NFT discord for a project that i was most interested in. The NFTs had various traits in a collection and there werent many data resources at that time to simplify the data into a digestible manner. so i made a python script that mined all the data for the collection and put it into a spreadsheet. I used those data to trade NFTs and made a decent profit every day. This was my first experience programming without it being a school assignment. In November of 2021 (21 yo) i went to NFTNYC, an NFT event in times square. this was one of the coolest experiences of my life. I met a lot of aspiring entrepreneurs who were looking for software engineers and we had a lot of interesting conversations. A lot of those people i met had software engineering work for me that they paid me for. One of the people i met became good friends and we talked for awhile and we had an idea to start a business. Eventually he convinced me to drop out of college and pursue this business idea with him. I agreed and in August of 2021, I dropped out of college and, although it was very stressful at the time since my family wanted me to go to college, it was the best decision of my life. I sold all my NFTs in November of 2021 (when there were whispers of a recession. luckily this was the top before the crypto crash) and only had 5 figures to work with. For the next year (August 2021 - september 2022) i worked my ass off, learning as much as i could and spent 80-100 hours per week building for our business along with freelancing to get money to fund it.

**Getting my first software engineering job: 21-22**

Around september/october in 2022 i ran out of money. I began looking for jobs as a software engineer while grinding leetcode. The first month I sent out 150+ apps, and got less than a dozen responses and only a handful of recruiter calls but never got an actual interview. I revised my gameplan. For each (yes, each) job post i applied to, i made a resume tailored for it and kept a spreadsheet of ones i applied to. I was confident in my skills and my passion and I knew if I could just get past the recruiter and get an actual interview with a tech lead (or whoever conducts interviews) where i can show what I know, I'll be set. After about another month, 50+ apps, and dozens of resumes i got a few responses. Since I was super nervous during recruiter calls, i took a couple shots of whiskey beforehand. I really dont like relying on alcohol but i wanted an interview bad. and the strategy worked. I had a recruiter call from a fintech company and then moved on to the interview. they asked questions about javascript (crushed this part), sql (absolutely bombed this part), and blockchain (did great here). After it was over, i felt like i did pretty well. After a few hours, i get a call from the recruiter with an offer and i couldnt believe the offer. it was well into 6 figures base with stock options and they allowed me to work remotely in the midwest. I took it instantly. I still work for the same company and i absolutely love it and im really good at it. There were 2 layoff waves. one was in the spring and didnt effect engineers much. the second one was in late summer and mostly effected the engineering department. Everyone on my team was laid off (including the lead) except me. im still on the same ""team"" and working on the same stuff and i have much more freedom than before. Im efficient, so i usually dont need to work a full 8 hour day so i have more time to improve other aspects of my life (like fitness and mental health).

**Looking back + bits of advice**

I love software engineering and wouldnt want to do anything else and the best advice I could give to anyone is to find what you really love to do and try to find an opportunity to make money off of it whether it be starting a business, going to school to hone your skills, or getting a job. The ""if you love what you do you'll never work a day in your life"" saying is true but only partially. It forgets to mention that if you love what you do, you have the potential to be great at it, maybe even one of the greats (dont assume i think that of myself, im def not there lol). When I think of what it takes to be a software engineer, or any profession in general, there are 3 factors to consider (this is a big simplification):

* how smart you are
* how much you like doing it
* how hard you work (your work ethic)

If you only have 1 of these things, its going to be very VERY hard to get into this field. unfortunately a lot of people are in this category because they have money on their mind as a priority and social media doesnt help either. If you have 2 of those things, you can easily become a software engineer. if you have all 3, you could be very great at it like the mythical ""10x engineer"" and have a high potential to be a tech lead or higher. As for school, you dont need it. but if someone is paying for your schooling and you can do it debt free, absolutely go for it. if you are taking on debt to do it, its not worth it imo. Just follow your passions and interests. **If you are in a job search as a new grad or for your first job** (I had to put this in bold because i think its super important), build a bunch of projects that are in line with your interests. You like fishing? Make a program that scrapes DNR survey websites to find the best lakes to fish for X species. You like art? Make an editor or implement an AI API into your project to tweak photos/drawings/whatever. these are just ideas to use as an example. Slap these projects in your resume and you WILL stand out because not many people will share your exact interests. There are millions of people making calculators and to-do lists, dont be those people. Bonus points for making a dope portfolio website to showcase your stuff. Also, use AI to assist you after you get the basics down. This is where college lacks a bit since you could get expelled for using AI but companies (like mine) are now starting to require the use of AI to boost productivity and efficiency. Last bit of advice i can give is to be confident in yourself and your skills and dont be put down if you get rejected. have the mindset that its their loss for not seeing your potential and move on.

i hope this is helpful to some of you. and if you have any questions ill try to respond to as many as i can. If you read this far, thank you.

Edit:tl;dr (thank u/psyberbird\*\*)\*\*:

OP had a rough early life, didn’t discover CS until age 20, now has a cushy CS job but also is the only engineer in their dept who survived a recent layoff wave.

According to OP, the three factors that go into making a good candidate for a career in software engineering are intellect, passion, and hard work. 1/3 = not enough, 2/3 = enough, 3/3 = potential for excellence.

Build projects and get involved in opportunities that relate to your unique individual interests, because everyone has calculator apps and to-do lists and these don’t stand out on a resume.

I've also been caught struggling to use pointers, structs, and references properly. I feel like a fraud who oversold my skills during the interview or something. I've used all of these concepts in projects I listed on my resume before and have completed a bunch of school projects in C/C++ but I feel like I forget everything the moment I take the final exam for a class. I genuinely don't know how I made it this far in my degree and I feel like I let my team down because they definitely expected someone better given my year standing and number of internships I've already completed. I've been told by my friends that struggling with basic programming concepts during an internship this far into my degree and 6 months into my job is abnormal and I genuinely feel so guilty because I'm wasting everyone's time and money. They gave me a return offer after I graduate but I don't even know if I'm going to accept it cause I'm scared I'm going to be put on PIP and laid off, I don't even think my manager knows I'm this bad and probably didn't even consult my mentor or other team members that I actually work with. My team members are way too kind and I feel like they deserve someone better.

Scrolling through this subreddit I’ve found that many people are struggling to find jobs for computer science. This is a shock to me since I thought this industry/ job market was growing at such a pace that they’re weren’t enough workers. So my question is: in your experience what is the most common reason CS grads can’t get jobs or even interviews.

15b6f6e,Palantir: Pros and Cons,"Using a throwaway for privacy reasons.

I've been working at Palantir for a few months now, and with the new grad / intern recruitment season coming up I have seen a lot of questions about the company, so I thought I could provide some input for what its like to work here in case anyone is interested!

First with the pros:

\- Benefits are very comprehensive. Free food. Office spaces are cool as well.

\- The work seems interesting (so far). I am a SWE not a FDSE so the work for that role could be different.

\- WLB is pretty good so far. Again, this will vary if you pick the FDSE role.

\- Comp is great. Just under 250k first year and 200k recurring for new grads, with an exceptionally high base / cash salary for a new grad. They beat out multiple FAANG+ offers I had. Intern pay is good too. They also pay the same regardless of which office you're at, from NYC to Denver to Seattle, or any of the other ones.

\- Hiring bar is high (albeit not as high as it once was from what I ascertain), and coworkers are mostly really smart.

Cons:

\- Since most coworkers are smart and many have strong credentials (i.e. top universities, worked at top companies) some people can feel impostor syndrome here. Just know that other people feel it too and you're not alone :)

\- Growth isn't as streamlined or ""on rails"" like it is at FAANGs. It's on you to determine your growth and your responsibilities. Some people become team leads in a few years. Some people chill and remain more stagnant. The downside is you have to be a lot more proactive about setting your own boundaries and growth path.

\- The company's public image is garbage sometimes. They do not make much of an effort PR-wise to deter blatant misinformation about us online. Stuff like ""Palantir spies on citizens,"" ""Palantir deports immigrants,"" ""Palantir collects data"" and ""Peter Thiel runs Palantir"" is reported so much by journalists because it is a ""cool"" angle to report and gets more clicks, and consequently that information is propagated by people on reddit forums and other places online, but is most often completely untrue and at best heavily misconstrued. I have worked at 2 faangs and can easily say that Palantir is more ethical than both of them - we have a lot of productive ethical discussions and trainings, yet we have a significantly worse image because the company doesn't really care to address misinformation, which is quite annoying. Internally it is a total meme at this point.

\- We do work with the military and government though. Personally, I am alright with this, but if you have a problem with Western imperialism you should either avoid government teams on Palantir (we have plenty of work in commercial industries) or you shouldn't work here at all. I would keep in mind that companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google work with the military too, which some people seem unaware of.

Overall it has been a great experience so far, and I have enjoyed working here over the past few months!

I gave him a clear high level overview of what I was optimizing for (which I had intended to in case I was asked to elaborate) without going into the implementation. Rejected.

Emailed him with a thanks, and asked for feedbacks on how I could have done better. He told me I did well for the interview, aced his coding challenges (I almost instantly solved them) along with all his other technical questions.

Wtf? I literally signed an NDA? I told him that the method I had implemented was unconventional and according to my bosses, rarely used by competitor firms.

For anyone feeling super sad and dejected and all sorts of despair - ‘Take a deep breathe’ 

I really mean it. 

I just wanted you all to know that surviving the pandemic and ‘going’ to school in those years, adjusting to the new normal and then graduating in this market - yes we all see you and really do sympathize that it has been a tough 4 years for people from the batches of 2022-2024. 

You have seen a lot and also achieved a lot. Pat yourself on the back for it. And congratulations on that degree. 

You have cried so many times in your room alone and gone to school the next day and given that exam you dreaded or overcome so many other obstacles that now seem so trivial to you, because you’re already over it. 
So will this one be in some time.

Acknowledge that you’re a human being, and you will make mistakes in interviews. IT IS OKAY. Don’t beat yourself up for it.

Scores of scores of people will tell you that sometimes you don’t always have to be 100% right to be successful. It’s a lot to do with timing.

17smk1u,Why are people obsessed with FAANG?,"I genuinely do not understand why so many people on this sub are so infatuated with FAANG. People always describe a role as either “FAANG”or “not FAANG”. There are tons of good companies out there that have advantages over FAANG in some (obviously not all) aspects.

As an example, hiring transparency - companies who hire by team instead of just posting a general SWE position on their career page which you apply and hope to get assigned to a team whose job you’re interested in. It feels to me like you’re getting a ticket to a yacht but don’t know where it’s taking you to. If you’re lucky, you may end up in Hawaii. If you’re not, Antarctica.

Other motivations I can think of are 1. Money 2. Prestige 3. Their “grand” missions.

Sure, they do pay well but there are others that are on par with them. 

Sure, everyone recognizes their names. So you just enjoy the feeling of superiority?

Sure, they all do something that’s really cool but do you realize you’re only going to be working on a very, very minuscule part of it (during early career).

It seems to me that most people are just blindly following the “big names” that everyone else talks about, completely lacking their own free thoughts.


Edit: FAANGs are great but I’m just confused since I’ve seen so many high schoolers + freshmen/sophomores who just started exploring their interests and are overly obsessed with them, and seem to “look down” on other opportunities.

* Apple - better return offer rates, better name value on resume (?)
* Meta - better location, better new grad pay, tighter community with other new grads within Meta campus

While CS enrollment has gone up at an exponential pace, it wasn't a Shock to the workforce as much the cut in jobs and hiring. However, it seems that people on this subreddit more commonly blame tiktok (influencers promoting programming jobs) as the cause for their troubles. Why something so specific and peculiar? The majority of people here are only in CS for the money + cozy working conditions + high availability of jobs, the exact same things that influencers promote. Isn't it selfish / hypocritical to be against that if it's attracting people who are the exact same as you, especially since you've probably learned of being a programmer from a similar source? I won't deny that the general gold rush around CS in popular media for the past decade hasn't brought a huge amount of attention and new CS graduates, but I still find it weird that this is what's blamed for the recent entry level struggle.

13vlhpe,Starting School for CS in my Early 30’s,"As the title suggests, I’ve decided to start school in my early 30’s. I was a smart kid growing up and have always been into computers and building them. Currently, I work at one of the largest travel companies in the world, but not in an engineering, IT, or technical position. 

2020 was a hellacious year for me (and for everyone globally) but at the same time, was eye opening in a sense to realize that I just do not like it anymore; and want to get into a better career path than just writing emails and attending meetings. 

I have zero experience with coding, and due to only having a GED and being away from any formal school for 15 years I would need to take remedial math to start with. Is there anyone in the community who decided to take the plunge at an older than average student age like me and enroll to major in CS? I would be lying if I didn’t say I’m terrified but I honestly do not know what to expect. Would a certification be better to jump in with (1 year program) or an AAS?",2023-05-30 09:28:43

188ty7x,"Just passed my first technical interview, invited to round 2. With Bloomberg!!!","Hey all! I'm a freshman at a decent (T50) college for CS, but nothing crazy. Honestly, I was surprised to even get the opportunity to interview given my school year! Let away at a company like Bloomberg. I Just kinda wanted to share my mini success. I know that I still have more stages to go, but I just had my first ever technical interview. The night before, I was absolutely terrified and couldn't sleep. 

In the morning, when I joined the interview, I was immediately relieved and super thankful to notice my interviewer was a very personable guy and we got along pretty well. He even talked to me to get a grasp of my knowledge to give me an appropriate question.

We went through a LC medium level question and I was able to solve it. For the last 20ish minutes of the interview, my interviewer and I just chatted about Bloomberg and just got to know each other a bit more. He told me that I was moving onto the next technical round, which I'm in the process of scheduling!

I just don't have many places to share this news of success so I just felt I'd post it here :)",2023-12-02 02:59:08
161xpll,Hiring International students has significant costs,"I have seen a discussion yesterday, most of the people are taking about significant costs but didn't mention what they are.

# Hiring an international student on an F1 Visa OPT comes at no cost to the company.

Sponsoring an H1B visa, on the other hand, involves financial expenses.

The initial registration fee for the H1B visa is $10. Employers usually engage attorneys to handle the required paperwork.

For the registration process, attorney fees is not very much.

In the registration process, a maximum of 85,000 applications can be selected. This year, out of 758,994 valid registrations, only 85,000 are chosen.

**If application is selected**, The overall expenses associated with H1B sponsorship include:

\- Standard Fee: The base H-1B filing fee stands at $460 for the I-129 petition. This fee is also applicable to H-1B transfers, refilings, amendments, and renewals.

\- American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) Training Fee: This fee amounts to $750 for employers with 1-25 full-time employees, and $1,500 for those with 26 or more full-time employees. Some exemptions apply, such as non-profits affiliated with educational institutions and governmental research organizations.

\- Fraud Prevention and Detection Fee: A fee of $500 is required for new H-1B petitioners or those changing employers.

\- Public Law 114-113 Fee: Companies with over 50 employees and more than half on H-1B or L-1 status need to pay an additional fee of $4,000. However, USCIS may provide exemptions for this fee.

\- Optional Fees: Premium processing, which expedites the H-1B visa process within 15 days, is available for $2,500. This service requires form I-907. Another optional expense is if family members apply as H-4 dependents using Form DS-160.

*The Public Law fee is applicable only if over 50% of employees are on H1B or L1 status.*

*Premium Processing is optional and can be covered by the employee.*

&#x200B;

If company has an in-house attorney :-

 If the applicant isn't selected, the cost is $10 per year.

\- If the applicant is selected, there's a one-time expense of $2,500.

Factoring in attorney costs of $2,000 to $3,000 for filing or $1000 for registration (typically around $2,000, with an additional $1,000 if an RFE is required), the expenses break down as follows:

\- If the applicant isn't selected, the cost is approximately $1,000 per year including attorney fees

\- If the applicant is selected, there's a one-time expense of $4,500 to $5,500 including attorney fees

Many discussions emphasize the substantial paperwork involved.However, companies engage attorneys to navigate this process, which contributes significantly to the associated fees.

The most important thing is the **probability of getting selected is less than 20%, this year it's less than 12%.** It doesn't cost as much as you think, it does.

Yes, if it's $60000 per year, then $4500 is significant but if it's $100K, then no, it's as much as relocation costs or yearly bonus or a signup bonus. People are saying it's a hassle but that's why you're paying for the attorney.   


I know the market is bad, and there are a lot of qualifying citizens, so companies prefer to hire them. I just wanted to rant about this ***Significant costs*** part.   


At-least give us a chance, for every 25 citizens, try to give a chance to 1 international student. The H-1B is designed to make them stay with you. They don't have the freedom to jump ships.  


 You don't need to sponsor them, they can work for 3 years without sponsorship. Put a field stating we will only sponsor if we feel you're worthy enough.

&#x200B;

Edit : The chance I mentioned is not the job but an interview opportunity. For every 25 job applicants who said “No” to sponsorship, consider one applicant who said “Yes”. If it’s not worthy then again 25 “No” resumes and one “Yes” resume. 

I’m not asking for reservation as to there should be one job reserved for international for every 25 local jobs. That’s ridiculous. 

Don’t auto-reject everyone without even giving any chance to “Yes” pile of resumes.",2023-08-26 15:09:14

13g9564,Depressed :(,"I know this is another post in a string of already depressing posts in the sub Reddit. I just want to let it out. 

If this is not the appropriate place for this, please let me know and I’ll remove it. 

I’m an international grad student in the US. A year ago I had an amazing (and well-paying) job. The job was so good that I was getting paid in the top 1% of what new grads earn in my home country. 

And then, my gf moved to the US to do her masters and I saw her and thought to myself, “Moving to the US may not be such a bad idea.”  

Plus I was interested in international startups so I figured it would be worth it. 

But here I am, today, with zero job offers/interviews. I’ve applied to countless places and not even a single call back. 

I even aced OAs with perfect scores, and I still get rejected. 

Mentally not doing great. 

Seriously, it’s frustrating. I am confident in my abilities and I have proof of that. I’ve won a slew of international hackathons. Anybody who knows me will almost definitely vouch for me as an excellent SDE. I don’t know what to do. 

I’ll take anything that comes my way at this point.

173h74l,Unpopular Opinion: Doom around the Sub is Exacerbated,"This will sound insensitive, and I apologize for it in advance; this is just something I was thinking about and wanted a larger audience. 

I know the market is bad with big tech not hiring, increased competition, and SWEs being layed off. However, the crazy stories of applying for 500+ applications with no interviews across here and CSCareerQuestions are mostly from a common reason: international students. Since these stories get the most traction, they skew the perception of the difficulty of getting a new grad role. Trust me, it is *certainly* more difficult to get a job than two years ago, but the doom on Reddit is exacerbated. 

Sure many new grads are not making that 150K+ out of college anymore, but local companies in tech hubs and non tech hubs are still hiring and giving new developers chances. There even still is some big tech + HFT that is hiring at a standard pace.

Anecdotally, all my peers, international or not and across multiple universities, have jobs lined up for graduation.   

EDIT: if you are a sophomore or freshman, this does not pertain to you. It was already hard as a sophomore or freshmen before the market downturn, so sending out 200-300 apps is normal.",2023-10-09 02:44:31

13knys9,How long before you understand wtf is going on at your internship?,"I just got started as a QA/Testing intern at a startup (15ish developers, less than 50 total people). It's just my first week, but I feel completely lost and unproductive. I'm writing UI test for their angular frontend using a deprecated testing framework.

My biggest problem is that they have barely any internal documentation I can reference, and all I can do is read through other (uncommented) tests and trial and error until I get a tiny bit closer to testing a single part of the UI. I have been asking my supervisor and some of the other developers lots of questions and I'm slowly starting to figure things out, but I get the impression that my boss could probably do in a day what is likely to take me a couple of weeks.

What have other people's experiences been getting onboarded during an internship or as a new grad? How long does it normally take to start being productive, especially if working with a legacy codebase or some older tech? 

TLDR, Is it normal to be lost for the first few weeks of an internship and have a long and slow ramp up process?",2023-05-18 04:06:45

13jjuvw,Insanely Proud,"I started learning SD when I started college in 2018, but was slow to learn, never had any projects, and had no direction on how that could lead to a job, I thought just having the degree in CS would be enough and that I would learn on the job.

Wasn't until about late 2021 (after failing a decent amount of classes) that I discovered about internships, and how helpful they are in finding a job, and I realized I was violently unprepared for the job search. Because of this, I decided to restart, I pushed back graduation from fall of 2022 to fall of this year (2023) and began my journey. I joined a student organization that helps students get internships, and began working on projects. Eventually I gained a leadership position at the organization, which helped me get a job creating AR apps at a school lab. I kept working, improving a little almost every day, and found out along the way that I really enjoyed programming.

Fast forward to late 2022, and I began searching for internships. At this point I had a couple solo projects, a group project in which I was sort of a manager (I also worked on it but had a sort of ""mentor"" role) and a large project at the job I had previously gotten. On top of this I spent everyday practicing DS&A, applying, and improving my resume any way I could.

After hundreds of applications, a lot of rejections, and even more ignores all together, I'm proud to say that I landed a SWE Internship role at Microsoft, and to say I'm excited is more than an understatement. My family came from a communist country with nothing and had to work to set me up to be as successful as possible, and to be able to pay back that sacrifice with an opportunity like this just makes me really happy and proud.

also my resume is just my [solitared.com](https://solitared.com) stats, like not to brag but my i can clear a solitare board in ariund 15 minutes and around 400 ish moves, which i know is almost chess grandmaster level but i spent many summers working on my skills.

1) you cant get them because all of them are reserved for me, and yes I can share the spots for like $13 (I want to get some food but left my wallet at my dorm)

2) If you degrade the recruiter and manipulate them into thinking that they need you, and that their life has not meaning unless they can get you a job at the company, it wont work and you will probably get auto rejected from them, but it would be really funny and in this market a comedic releif employee is basically considered a diversity hire so they are also sought after

  
Take from this what you want, I just want to see everyone succeed (and also make $13, I was serious about leaving my wallet at my dorm)",2023-12-07 17:18:36
184s6ry,I want to dropout of college.,"I'll try to keep this short:

I've been borrowing tuition money from my parents (I don't make enough), failing classes (because I've been working), and my depression is the worst it's ever been. I'm in my freshman year and everything I know about programming is purely from independent learning (I've only been able to take one CS course, which was super easy). A lot of people (including upperclassmen) have commented on my programming skill and all of the CS professors I've met have recommended that I take their higher level courses.

This makes me wonder, what the hell am I paying for? I'm drowning just so I can take (pardon me) f\*\*king Intro to Rock Music. There seems to be only two positive things I'll get out of college: networking and a magical piece of paper that stops employers from throwing my resume out.

I've looked around and I like the sound of teachyourselfcs.com or FreeCodeCamp. I'd much prefer to learn at my own pace and build a resume of projects than to do a bootcamp. I guess my main concern is that employers won't even bother looking at my application without a degree. I don't want to spend 2-3 years building my skillset only for a computer to throw my resume in the trash.

So, what do you think I should do? Do you have any advice for someone like me? Am I going to have a tough time getting a job?

Thanks.

159fum2,Is rescheduling my Google Interview (Intern 2024) a terrible move? I'm burnt out and not sure what to do.,"My Google interview is soon and I have 0 idea how to solve a graphs or dynamic programming problem, and I'm rusty on LC in general. They said they'd prefer I schedule it before August 1st which is why I scheduled it so soon, and I kind of wanted to get it over with.

Also, I scheduled it two weeks ago cause I figured I'd take time to study, but I'm honestly incredibly burnt out from Leetcoding. I practiced on [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io) up to trees since at the time Google wasn't getting back to me and no other company I applied to tests on Graphs/DP, so I grinded away at the easier things so I could ace my interviews while simultaneously working full time at my internship. I did ace my interviews for the other companies, and then around a month after the dust settled Google got back to me.

Now I've got this interview in two days and I cannot/could not muster up any energy to get more Leetcode done. I enjoy developing things but I fucking hate Leetcode, and I don't know what to do. A month ago if I was in this situation I'd be salivating over Google and studying as much as possible. I'm sorry to say since I know so many people here would love to be in my position, but I just don't have the energy to care at this point. This in addition to my personal life and internship is too much.

I'm burnt out and kind of just want to get it over with, but the other part of me thinks if I reschedule to a month from now maybe I could reignite whatever dedication I had (plus my internship would be done), and then there's another part of me where I'm thinking rescheduling would not only delay things (including my stress) but get me rejected anyways. I was even considering straight up cancelling and saying I'm going with another company cause I don't want to get blacklisted by showing and not knowing how to do shit/don't want to deal with the stress right now.

How do I compete against all the young overachievers and people who may have ten years of experience outside of the field but who actually at least have something to contribute? I have absolutely nothing to contribute except curiosity. Should I just give up and resign to living on disability for the rest of my life?

Since then I spent 6 years in the air force and excelled in my career. After leaving the military I started at a community college, I am currently in my second semester and have maintained a 4.0  GPA so far with a 98% or higher in all my classes. 


Once I get my prerequisites done, I am going to apply to transfer. Every test I have taken and every person I have talked to tells me I am extremely intelligent. I am sure I would do really well in a high end school but I am concerned there is no way I will get accepted due to my poor high school transcripts from almost 10 years ago. What can I do to better my chances? Or is it hopeless? I took the SAT in high school and I did average, I don't remember what I got. Would I need to take it again? 


When I say high end school I'm referring to Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Berkeley etc.


Edit:I should also mention I am not looking into getting into one of these schools purely because I think it's necessary for a successful career. It is also because I am looking for something challenging to reach my full potential. So far everything else in my life has been very easy and I want a challenge.

I would be assigned tasks that would have to be done in a week or so , tasks would be like bug fixes or making a new page if it was a frontend work. BUT here it seems completely opposite . These peeps think I am some sort of an architect  or something and want me to build a whole new product by myself right from designing the architecture to writing the code . ONLY ME and no one else  . This is worrying me as I don’t have that level of knowledge and experience . In the interview I did not oversell my self , nor did I fake and make stuff up .

Womp fucking Womp. You’re in a field that is indeed competitive. But there’s a reason SWEs are still getting paid well. Companies are still hiring. You just need to figure out where you are lacking and find a way to become added value to whatever company you apply for.

And when you get a lot of denials? Cool. You can’t control what companies say, but you can control what you offer. The bitching and moaning is absolutely insane, and if anyone can explain to me how it helps, *im all fucking ears*. If you can explain how *your* situation is so special and everyone should pity you and how you’re perfect and the tech world is out to get you specifically, please say.

I got my internship in 20 applications. 2.9 GPA, mid school, little leet code. I got it because I was able to explain smart pointers and the other applicants couldn’t.

I talked to a recruiter for a bit and her first comments were how most applicants lack social or communication skills. And if my classes mirror a lot of you guys, I would deny your applications too.

If you’re only problem in life is application problems, you’re fine. You’re not living in Donetsk. You’re not getting shot at, you’re not a homeless fentanyl addict(I hope). I would rather do 100000 applications than relive my worst day in the Corps.

I'm graduating this June and I was lucky enough to secure a new grad Google SWE return offer and I got even luckier to secure an offer at Meta (Production Engineer, NYC). I have a Google deadline on **April 3rd** and at Meta on **April 5th** and I have to make a decision soon.

Google beats Meta 1st year comp by around 22k, however, what's making this decision REALLY hard is that I always looked forward to living in NYC someday, I have a couple of friends moving there too and overall NY seems like a better location. I've also heard that it's significantly slower to get promotions at Google whereas at Meta you can expect to be promoted relatively quickly. IC5 comp at Meta is AFAIK higher than L5 at Google. The team at Meta also sounds pretty exciting (AI Infra related).

I also loved interning at Google, though, I know what team I'll be placed in if I go back and I know for a fact that I could keep up with the pace and engineering demands at Google, and I know that although the Bay Area would be a pretty boring place to live for the early years, I could get used to it pretty quickly.



* What would you all do?
* If you lived in NYC before, do you think it's worth the hype?
* Am I too crazy for considering joining a completely different company at a completely new city?
* What else should I consider before taking a decision?
* If you've both worked at Google and Meta, what's a better company to work at mid term?

* **July 10, 2023:** Conducted back-to-back 45 minute technical interviews
* **July 17, 2023:** Notified by recruiter that I passed technical interviews and would move onto project search phase
* **Nov 30, 2023:** Received an email that project search had official begun and that intern hosts would reach out if they were interested in my candidate profile
* **March 8, 2024**: Reached out to about host matching interview
* **March 14, 2024:** Had host matching interview in the morning, and received verbal offer later that day

1bl839o,"I hate coding, love Big O and theory of Cs. Should I quit the major?","Hii. I am a cs student in the 3 semester. I find really hard to programming and hate it in the last year. But then i got a summer internship and loved to work(at morgan stanley brazil). However, i did nothing. I always had to ask for help and in one month i did 100 lines of python with a lot of struggle, most of them with the guys resolving the real problems. The team, the company and all the enviroment was amazing and cozy, i fell in love again with the career.
In my university, we have to code everyday using agile methodology. It is very practical and seems a real company, but i dont like work in groups all day and hate coding. The internship was a execption.
I thought i liked coding until i started another degree at same time, in Letras(in my country, is something like literature), with a focus on linguistics. I found it cool and worthing pass a life struggling, even though it has almost no jobs. 
Just linguistics(which i love) isnt enough to get a job, but cs and linguistics has more opportunities to work. 
So, i like cs theory, hate programming, but like things like NLP(mainly because of linguistics). My dream would be follow academic path in linguistics, but there is no founds for reasearch in my country in this area, so it is not a option.

1bmw1p5,Should I lie to my parents about the salary in Big Tech?,"This probably seems like a non issue to some of you, but I'm legit not sure what to do. 

I figured other cs majors might have dealt with similar issues of family dynamics being disrupted by a sudden high income summer internship before graduating and becoming financially independent.

**Tl;dr:** **I will make a lot of money over summer, but not enough to pay for college. My mom will ask me for money if I tell her my salary, but if I don't she will assume a fortune.** **I will be living with my parents (divorced) to save costs. If I live with my dad, he doesn't try to take my money, but my mom will be upset at me for not spending time with her. If I do visit her she will continuously ask me for money.**

So I managed to land an internship at a big tech company that pays 2.5 times more than my last internship. Thing is, my parents are obviously gonna want to know, and when they do they're gonna want to know the salary. Especially since I will be working in my parent's city, and probably will be living with them.

Now I'd prefer to live alone, and I can afford it easily on this salary if it were after graduation, but since my dad is still supporting my education (3 month internship can't pay for school and living expenses), I can't justify moving out since I'd be spending his money basically. 

Thing is, my mom got super weird about money when I got an internship last summer. First, she wanted me to live with her and help pay her rent. So I said cool, I'll just live with dad then, since I'm still saving for my education (mom doesn't financially support me at all). Then she got upset because I was spending too much time with dad, she kept calling me to stay over, but if I did visit she'd try to get me to pay groceries, take her out to eat, buy her clothes, etc etc, while making odd remarks like ""omg that's more than mommy makes! You know mommy has it so hard..."" Now if I didn't have school to worry about I would be ok doing these things just to be nice, but I can't afford to be spending so much right now, and for some reason my mom can't get that idea through to her head. When she sees that my monthly income is more than hers, she assumes I'm rich and should start repaying her for raising me.

So my options are 

1. Tell her outright, but she will start telling me how much she's struggling and I'll feel bad. I'll have to deal with a whole summer of being nagged for money even if I decline every time (she never gives up)

2. Refuse to tell her, but because of company name she will probably suspect a large number anyway

3. Lie and tell her a lower number, but idk how much to say because she's gonna be suspicious if it's too low, but I wasn't make that much last term and she was already like this

4. Lie about which company I'm working at too. But then that'd be super awkward if I slipped up.

5. Live with dad and give mom an ultimatum. But idk if this is worth ruining my relationship with my mom over. I do want to spend time with her, just wish she wouldn't be like this.

6. Give her some money as a peace offering. (Worried she'll start asking for more)

I have an ok relationship with my mom other than money. She'd be really upset if I lied to her about what company I worked at. 

But I'm so worried about how to tell her the salary that I've been telling her I can't find a job a month after accepting my offer. I can't hide it forever since I'm working in her city so I'll be flying over soon.",2024-03-24 21:29:30

* Step 2: Learn the art of javascript: Javascript is often compared to a samurai sword, Dangerous in the wrong hands, but lethal if handled by someone who knows what they are doing. By mastering javascript I hope that I won't just know how to use it, but become one with the tool itself. It's no longer a tool... it's me. I am javascript.

* Step 3: 50 github projects: Github is not a project sharing website, it's more like a reflection who you are as a human being. There is a saying which goes: ""Eyes are the window to the soul"", which I think is just completely made up garbage, in reality your github profile should be the window to your soul

* Step 4: Jerk off 8 times a day for cognitive benefits: I mean this is just obvious, I don't think it needs any explanation 

* Step 5: Master the AI: AI will soon ai the ai while having ai doing ai could eclipse ai without any of the ai. AI will exponentially ai and the singularity ai so that all the ai could ai. ai

1baamkh,"2017 Grad, 7 years of gap with no experience. Do I even bother?","Hey guys, first post here. Hopefully I won't get hammered lol.

So here's my situation. I graduated in 2017 with a bachelors in computer engineering. I have no internships, while in school I helped run a family business. After graduating, I realized having no internships kind of ruined my chances of landing a job. 6 months in and I couldn't get job in the field. A family member of mine reached out and offered an opportunity to further expand the family business and took them up on that offer.

Fast forward 7 years, I am done with business. It's just not for me and I am extremely mad at myself for taking this long to realize. Over the last 3 months I have decided to go back to what I started and pursue the this field. I landed 2 interviews right away but I was clearly not ready and I have been brushing up on my skills since. Practicing and leetcoding.

I know going into this decision I would be at a significant disadvantage especially with how the market is. Given such a lengthy gap in my resume, do I even have a chance in landing my first job? Part of me is saying to not give up and keep trying but I feel as if no matter how well I get with leetcoding and practicing interviews, I will never be given the opportunity since it has been 7 years of wasting away.

I guess I want some insight into what you guys think given what I wrote here. I really do enjoy the tech industry. It has always been a dream of mine to do this as a career, but if there is 0 chance, I might as well just go back to school and start over with doing something else.

Thanks in advance.",2024-03-09 05:56:22
1b9go7d,Should I just switch out of CS,"I’m a freshman rn. I just saw this post get cross posted into this sub. This shit is actually terrifying. Something like this would take me 2 months minimum to develop (I started coding 6 months ago) and this AI did in two fucking minutes based off of one prompt. I’m actually considering giving up after seeing this. We’re only maybe 3 years into this AI boom and it’s already this good. Imagine how good it’ll be by the time I graduate. (2027). Realistically can humans really even compete with this? I just feel so fucking lost. I’m early in my college career so a switch wouldn’t take off that much time. I suck at coding to begin with (but actually enjoy learning about it) and this shit ain’t making me feel any better. Should I just give up?

1b4y35i,Feeling so unmotivated in my last year of university,"Final year student, have my grad job lined up.

I've always been an overachiever, but since the start of this academic year, I've felt so tired.

I don't want to work on my final year project, and I don't want to study for the exams.

I just want to start that grad job 😭 at least I'd get paid to work

I know that part of the reason I don't want to work hard in my studies anymore is that no company cares that I have the equivalent of a 4.0 GPA in the USA (I'm in Europe and we call the highest grade a First Class Honours). And the fact academics don't mean anything in today's world.

I honestly can't tell if I'm burnout or just lazy. I only need to average 50% this semester to still graduate with top grades but I honestly am on the verge of dropping out ☠️

Edit: I'm not saying that good academics is the only metric for getting a job offer. I'm not looking down on my peers, I know they work just as hard as me. I'm saying I feel like everything I've done so far in my academics feels absolutely worthless to me because I could be barely passing the degree and still get a job... And that is why I'm so unmotivated this semester.
Of course everyone works hard to strive for our goals, but personally, I'm so tired and fed up, and I honestly just wanted to rant!
Thanks guys!

Edit 2: Can't believe that I'd be fighting for my life on reddit on how I'm not looking down on people who has poor academics. I'm literally agreeing with comments that say academics don't matter - my post is about me realising academics don't matter, and that's why I'm so unmotivated in my studies this year. I see people with poor grades thriving, and I'm glad it worked out for them, so that's why I think everything will work out fine for me as well even if I don't do that well in my studies this semester... 
After reading so many nice comments and some criticizing comments, I've decided that I'm just gonna give it one last push but if it doesn't work out, then it is what it is.

Good luck to everyone in their studies and job search!! 🍀",2024-03-02 20:38:22

When I’m in school, and I’m given a project description, I will happily work on it as there is a clear description of what needs to be done and if I do a good job I am rewarded with a good grade. 

When I am outside of school I don’t think like this. I have no inspiration to come up with the next big idea and start doing it for fun. I need a laid out description of what to do. I don’t just come up with things. People say make something that you would use. I can’t think of a single thing that I would need to use in my life that I could build. I don’t care about making things for fun. The only thing I want to make is money. I will build something that gives me a job, I just need to know what it is. I know this isn’t good for my career, and maybe it’s a sign I should have given up on this long ago. My passion for CS is dying.

I have issues with a lot of aspects of my life and everyday the pain just keeps growing. I am disappointed in myself, disgusted at my behavior and just wanna it to end.( It's an alt account because I don't want people to find me. )

I immigrated from my home country when I was 7 years with my family and since the permanent residency in the US takes so long, I am still considered an international student and that means it will be significantly harder to find internships, and jobs. Just thinking about internships and jobs makes me so stressed out.

I am not doing good in my classes either, CS has just been rigorous for me. I am just sliding by with a 2.9 gpa. I got a 40 on my discrete math 2 exam and I keep fucking shit up. I don't skip class. It's just really hard to focus for me, I get easily fucking distracted and I am embarrassed because everyone else is so much better than me. Everyone around me juggles so much stuff and they still end up with better grades and a better life. I feel so empty. I keep making so many stupid mistakes and at the end I cry over them. These days, I cry at least once a day. To save money on rent I commute from home and my total daily commute is over 2 hours and I just get exhausted before I get to class and it's just year 2. I got 2 more years with even harder classes and just thinking about that gets me stressed and dizzy.

I know my problems. I know exactly what is causing my issues but every time I try to change, I do for a couple days but then go back to normal. The years of doom scrolling and TikTok during COVID-19 ruined my fucking brain and it just makes my life 10 times worse. I hate myself for it. I have a passion for cs and I love to make my own projects but these social media just got me addicted like a drug and I keep just eating valuable time away by just scrolling.  My parents are working so hard and spending thousands of dollars just for me to fuck up miserably. I feel so disgraceful. I want to make them proud, especially since I am the 1st one to go to college in the US in my family.

I disappointed myself, I disappointed my parents and I disappointed everyone around me. I feel like worthless idiot who uses cheap sources of entertainment to feel good about myself for a bit. Everyday, I have thoughts about ending it all and it just gets louder and louder.

I tried going online/school job board. I’ve haven’t heard back from a single one. I’ve gotten these online assessments from a few, passed all the test cases and don’t hear anything back from them. Meanwhile I’m taking a full course load at university with a 2h one way commute while having to manage house chores like groceries, cooking, cleaning, fixing shit, while also having to create new projects because I guess I’m not a good candidate yet.

1boxi9t,From Tech Layoffs to Finding My Tribe: A Summer of Resilience,"It's the summer of 2023, right in the heat of July. I'm sitting in a cold, air-conditioned office in the fanciest building in Montreal, staring down an ancient Cisco phone that looks like it's seen better days and a Windows computer that’s so slow, I swear I can see the hourglass mocking me. Just graduated from Toronto, I'm in this new city, not because I want to be, but because the tech world is cutting jobs like crazy. After a year of endless interviews, the only decent offers I got from Netflix and Bloomberg slipped through my fingers—no Canadian citizenship, no job. So, here I am at this finance company, where my paycheck is a sad reminder that it's the best offer I got in Canada, but it doesn't even come close to 1/2 of what I used to make as an intern.

My manager pulls me into a meeting room with a view that makes you forget you're about to do mind-numbing work. He lays it out for me: fill seven giant Excel sheets with data from the Bloomberg terminal by the end of the month. As he's talking, I remember laughing at a friend for doing what I called ""dog's work"" at a consulting firm, filling out Excel sheets with no real skill needed. And now, here I am, the joke's on me.

A week goes by, and I'm trying to blend in, but it's tough. I tried to make a good impression, waved at our team manager behind my boss’s back, hoping for a nod or maybe a chance at something more interesting than data retrieval. Big mistake. My boss drags me back into the meeting room, not for a pat on the back, but to lecture me about professionalism and how tech guys like me are a dime a dozen, and I should feel honored to work at the financial arm of the company. The next meeting, he’s on my case about taking long lunches. Then, it’s my casual shorts, too many bathroom breaks, not staying late enough—you name it, I'm doing it wrong. My paycheck, already a slap in the face, feels even more like a joke.

Two months in, and I can't take it anymore. I decide to quit, but not before the company dinner—I'm not passing up a free meal. When I tell my boss, expecting maybe a hint of regret, he hits me with, “You know we were gonna let you go, right? Just pack up today.” Walking out with my belongings, I’m trying to piece together where it all went wrong. Was moving here for this job the biggest mistake of my life? My savings are drained, I didn’t learn anything, felt miserable, and I'm questioning my worth.

That's when my phone buzzes. It's Daniel, an ex-Amazon intern and one of the few friends I've made in this corporate maze. He tells me to wait downstairs. As the elevator doors open, there's Danny, Henry (that ex-Meta intern), Jay, and a bunch of others. They decided to ditch the company dinner to grab a bite with me. They're all fed up with the toxic culture, ready to jump ship too.

As we sit around a too-small table, sharing fries and stories, I realize we're all in the same boat. We've been knocked down, sure, but we're not out. In the weeks and months that follow, we lean on each other, sharing leads, prepping for interviews, and finally, one by one, we land on our feet in better places.

Reflecting back, this story isn’t about a failed job—it’s about finding your tribe in the least likely places. It’s about the laughs, the late-night pep talks, and the shared dream of something better. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the worst experiences bring out the best in us, connecting us with people who light the way to new beginnings. And for that, I wouldn’t change a thing.

I remembered just maybe 10 years ago bulge bracket banks (i.e. Goldman, JP morgan, Morgan stanley, Citi) were among the biggest PERM/H1B sponsors. Nowadays the banks have almost completely stopped hiring international students. Current job listings from them typically specify the requirement for candidates to be eligible to work without the need for sponsorship.

I feel we may be seeing this same ""phase transition"" happening in tech. Could this become the next big thing? That the tech industry will also stop sponsorship and explicitly require GC for hire, as an industry-wide reevaluation of sponsorship practices. Or do you think the PERM processing freeze is just temporary and everything will be back to usual?

How do you think this could impact education industry, particularly master programs that have so far relied on huge amount of students from India and China? In the past, a large majority of these graduates were able to stay by just becoming SWEs, including those whose major field of study lies elsewhere.

I got internship offers at Walmart Global Tech and NASA! I'm wondering which would be better for career growth (not so much for return offer). I'm aiming for a FAANG offer next year, so I mainly want to choose the option that will help me most in recruiting for next year. Any thoughts about which option I should pick?

**Walmart**

\- Better location imo (Sunnyvale, CA)

\- Better pay (not a big deal for me rn, but a plus)

\- Tech stack is probably more similar to what FAANG uses & looks for (I will probably learn a lot)

**NASA**

\- Offer is for a more niche tech area that I have extensive prior experience with (I'm not sure if I will learn as much, fewer transferable skills)

\- I've heard that a NASA internship might be more prestigious (better resume boost)

\- I already have some prev experience with NASA on my resume (not employed by NASA though)

1bqdwvd,Sophomore CS major with a 2.07 gpa. Is it over for me? ,"It’s just what the title says. I was never a coding kid but was interested in learning computer science. While applying to colleges I couldn’t see myself in any other major so computer science felt like the perfect choice but the moment I became a freshman, the imposter syndrome hit hard. I never coded before while half my peers already had their own websites they coded from scratch and literally did coding as a hobby. To have a community, I made friends with other cs majors who were total beginners and somehow got through freshman year with the help of friends and chatgpt. I was barely surviving (Bs and Cs) and lost a few friends in cs bc they changed majors after second semester’s OOP course

Then in the first semester of sophomore year, we had DSA and it was dubbed the actual weed out course of our major. It was and it did. I failed that course and my grades in other courses drastically dropped too. Most of my friends switched majors again, i literally don’t have that community anymore. 

While I was trying to survive in this major, go to clubs, network, find internships, hangout with friends and have everything together, two years almost passed. I’ve failed until now and am left with no experience, no good projects and a painful gpa of 2.07. 

I can’t seem to find any internship or research over the summer bc of my gpa. I want to be in computer science and go to grad school but I’m so lost. My transcripts are so bad that I don’t even want my advisor to look at it. I’m scared that I’ve already ruined my chances to bag a good internship, do research or go to a top post grad program. My professors will only consider a student for research if they have a gpa of 3.5 and above. Even if I get a 4.0 in every semester from now, I might not hit that mark.

I feel like my resume has a lot of cool projects through that experience (I was on the mobile team and we added a tap to pay feature using stripe, a document scanner that i integrated OCR into during a company hackathon) and 1-2 more great improvements to the app. I also have a side project that I did for my cousins - built him a website for his photography portfolio that allows booking and purchases of his prints. 

I’ve gotten interest from big companies here and there, like Stripe, PayPal, Nokia, DropBox, unfortunately none of them ended up in offers, but when I see people say they’ve landed interviews with almost all FAANG companies I just wonder how? For me Stripe and PayPal prob reached out because of the payment processing I’ve done in that personal project and during my internship experience, but is there some specific experience or project that really helps get noticed by MOST FAANG companies?

1bbngbi,Should I give up on a career in computer science?,"Hi, while my grades have been alright and I come from a top 30 university in the US, I have never been able to land any kind of prestigious internship despite my efforts over 3 years. I did get a decent internship last year but I didn't get a return offer unfortunately. Most people at my uni and some at lower ranked unis have had more prestigious internships than me - I couldn't even land an internship at Johnson&Johnson whereas I've seen many freshmen get them. I have nothing to do this upcoming summer and am about to graduate without a job.

I think I'm relatively passionate about CS, I attend random lectures for fun when I can and because it's a good time pass. I have also been a teaching assistant for three CS courses. Also I'm in a grad-level CS class for fun this semester. I participate in class. But I'm not really motivated to read magazines or browse Java, C++ journals and books in my free time and deep dive into all the latest happenings in the industry.

I did 170 leetcode problems over the past summer but landed nothing. I have no motivation to practice anymore unless it's for a structured course. I was recently admitted into a masters program but it's probably useless. Masters is just delayed unemployment. The same problems will persist and I won't be able to clear interviews because I can't solve hard problems or answer in-depth technical questions. I've found that in interviews, how much I study doesn't really affect my performance unless I don't study at all. I spent 40+ hours preparing for prestigious internship interviews and still failed.

I've finally received an interview call from **Google** after submitting over 900 applications. It's for the preliminary screening round, and I'm feeling both thrilled and nervous. The role requires a minimum of 2 years of experience, and I realize there are some technologies I need to refresh my knowledge on.

From what I gather, the first round typically involves two coding questions, but I'm uncertain if they delve into other aspects of the resume as well. It's been a while since I've dabbled in leet code, and there are certain topics like graphs and dynamic programming that I've never really touched upon. It seems like I have a lot of ground to cover, and with just 9 days to prepare, I'm feeling the pressure.

I'm contemplating whether I should focus solely on brushing up my coding skills on platforms like LeetCode or if I should also allocate time to revisit the skills and technologies listed on my resume. If anyone who's recently gone through a similar experience could offer some advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. I really want to make the most out of my preparation time. Thanks a ton in advance!

Edit: Its Google First Round

Update on 19th march: Postponed screening round to 10 days later. 😅",2024-03-16 23:33:13

1bd6vfb,Devin AI Software Engineer,"https://twitter.com/cognition_labs/status/1767548763134964000

This is actually scary good. If some random company can build this, I'm willing to bet that companies like Google are already trying to create their own versions of this so they can layoff more engineers.

At the moment it can solve 13% of issues by itself with no other help, and this number is only going to get better. It can understand foreign coding languages, it debugs using print statements, it can lookup, read, understand, and implement documentation by itself, and it can make its own ai. Super similar to human engineers.

I'm sure there will still be need for people who understand code and systems, but I've seen people completely change their career paths after seeing the demo. I'm still expecting the real version to run into issues because they only advertise where the model finds success.

We're going to get to a point where dev teams are replaced by a singular good dev. Thoughts?

1b4hrv0,Meta vs AMD offer,"Hello guys, I need your help in deciding going to Meta vs sticking with AMD. So a bit of background, I have recently started at AMD, Austin, TX as an SDE 2 in February. My current comp is 125k base + 25k bonus + 50k stocks over 4 years. However, I also received an offer from Meta for the family of apps division in the Menlo Park office. The joining date is in May.

I am confused between staying with AMD vs going to Meta. While I know that the work in Meta will be somewhat better than AMD but the downgrade to SDE 1 is something that I am hesitant on.

1banyn1,Some advice to current CS majors from someone who wishes they majored in CS.,"My Background and Context:

>!I graduated in 2014 with a humanities degree and started trying to break into tech in 2017 for the non development project roles (QA, PM, BA). Back then, it was tough. It took a year for me to get in. I humiliated myself in interviews. Then when I was laid off it took another year and two job hops to get back to where I was at pre layoffs. !<

>!It was difficult because I had no technical background. I was halfway through my humanities degree when I took a logic class and I considered switching to CS then because everything clicked. But I didn't because I thought it was too late, because I was halfway through my degree already, and this was back before CS became a known moneymaker. !<

>!I always regretted that, because from 2014 to 2017 my field was competitive (and still is), offering 70k to people after masters or 30k to people like me with a bachelors. I watched tech salaries soar and I was getting a raise from $12 to $15 an hour after working at my nonprofit clinic for a year. No chances to buy a house, no chances for a career, at this point I hadn't figured out the recruiting game. I thought there was no way I would be able to get in, because we're taught from a young age that whoever works harder gets paid more and whatever role is more valuable pays more, how am I qualified for a job that pays 3X what I make? I did get in eventually, failing at and tweaking my interview answers until they worked, and started watching people from day one at the office. !<

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here is some advice for people who are currently studying or considering CS after seeing all the layoff posts, on recurring themes and common traits I've seen watching successful people in this field:

\- **They have resilience and consistency.** The hardest part for most people is to keep applying and trying in the face of rejection. It's hard threefold 1. It makes you feel like shit. You don't want to keep applying and interviewing because even the strongest person will start to lose hope that it will do anything and question their capabilities. Applying every day with no responses. Interviewing to get rejected. This can go on for months/years on end. 2. This shakes your confidence and when you interview you can seem more nervous and less capable. Especially when you're unemployed for a while and it's high stakes now. 3. When you get laid off in a bad market you might have to take a step back in pay, title. This is very discouraging and some people get stuck here permanently or exit tech at this point instead of going backwards.

Anytime you apply for a new job you will encounter these again. It's arguably the worst for new grads, but I'm here to tell you, it never goes away, even after you get experience. I get rejected all the time. People offer me what I made my first year.  It is completely normal, don't let the rejections determine your capabilities. If you're applying and struggling, keep telling yourself, I only need one job to make it. One.

\- **They see opportunities, and they jump on it.** Timing is everything in tech. In 2019, data science was incredibly understaffed. 250k mid level roles and they couldn't find anyone. Entry level someone would snap you up too. Now it's not even 4 years later and it's saturated. Entry level is just as bad to get in as entry level development. Now, Cloud architecture, AWS are the new trends. But how fast can you learn it before the trend fades and you need to learn something new? Speed to market applies to both the products we're engineering and to ourselves. If you see something rising, you need to learn it right away and you need to learn it faster than everyone else in order to establish yourself as an expert by the time it gets saturated with entry level. Or keep learning the newest trend and switch to that. Even if you go the expert route, you probably have to switch at some point, all tech is eventually outdated.

To thrive in tech, leave the what ifs thinking behind. By the time you get over your analysis paralysis, that opportunity is already gone and your peer who took it despite the fear got it.

\- **They don't let themselves get golden handcuffs.** This happens more at mid/late stage career but still happens at entry level especially with a big salary. I got in thinking I can go all out ramping up for four years and settle down somewhere with my accumulated knowledge. The reality check I've had recently with all these layoffs is that four, six, ten, 20 years is nowhere near enough. I’m going to have to continue forcing myself to ramp up until I retire, or be in the vulnerable position of being 50+ and having worked on one tech stack at the same place for 20 years competing in this kind of market. Ageism exists in tech.  Every year since I started I force myself to apply and interview even if I'm not looking to leave. Got lazy last year, going to fix that now.

\- **They are creative.** At the core of every project I’ve worked on, no matter what project role, you can have all the tools, you can have nothing, you can have a framework, but you need to figure it out. A lot of places do not set you up for success. There may not be mentorship, or documentation. The people who are successful in tech take whatever shit hand they are dealt with and throw different solutions at it until something sticks.

\- **Soft skills, office politics, recruiting game, and luck.** Learn the rules for these and keep practicing. You can't avoid it unless you're a 1%er. Don't fall into the trap of thinking ""if I work the hardest I will get the promotion."" Whoever your manager and higher up leadership like the most is going to get it. Luck is always going to be involved.

So my post is two fold.

First, **if you read the list and you're not sure you can commit**, especially if you're someone who got onboard with the trend when it looked easy and now you're roped in, **it's not too late to switch** for many of you. For some it will be if you're in your 3rd or 4th year. But for you 1st years and 2nd years, seriously evaluate switching if you're having second thoughts after having a look around at the current environment and expectations. I always regretted not changing **to** CS, thinking it was too late for me because I was 2 years into my major, and suffered for it as I had to play catch up compared my IT or CS major peers. **In retrospect, spending 2 extra years finishing a degree I was never going to use was a mistake for me. I was in such a rush to get** ***there*** **when a gap year for me to figure out** ***get where*** **would have been better.**

Second, to say that **if you love CS or if you read through and you are willing to make it all work regardless of passion, don’t let the market and the doomsday phase you.** Tech is cyclical. It’s always bad for entry level. It’s worse right now than 7 years ago. When it’s hot all the big companies FOMO and overhire and and any idiot that already has mid level experience can get a job. When it’s bad they copy each other and you’re suddenly dropped and scrambling against the people who did upskill during the hot market. You need to be ready for this at all times, stack up savings and experience when the times are good, don't get complacent.

Despite all the negatives, I am still committed to tech. Not because I love tech, but because *I understand the reality of what other jobs are like if I don't and I choose to make the sacrifices because I have to.* Getting in changed my whole life and I still see it as a field where despite the all the cons I listed, the possibilities are infinite.  If you made it through such a long post, thanks.

1bbhilx,You guys are on the right track,"I've been constantly seeing CS students asking for ways to switch to different majors such as electrical-computer engineering. And yes currently market is quite tough and it is one of the hardest times to find a SWE job or internship. But you guys shouldn't forget that you are playing for extremely high-paying positions and the career outcomes for any non-CS major is quite terrible in the US.   


Yes, there is going to be oversaturation but this does not affect the best students. And you are unaware of how terrible the job market is for other STEM graduates.   


The worst SWE-oriented job is still better than other technical jobs. In this high economy, only SWE salary is enough to cover expenses there is little chance for any engineering major to earn those crazy FAANG-style salaries/bonuses by just doing their engineering job.  


You guys are lucky to be studying CS. As an Outlander who came US to study Computer Engineering, I highly regret my decision. Yes, doctors, engineers, teachers are important and I think they are earning less than their actual compensation but due to the current situation of the US. Only software is lightly regulated, sky is the limit and it is the most lucrative product or service that can be done in the US.  


So please DO NOT switch to any other major and keep going in your Computer Science degrees. The future of any other majors including Computer Engineering is quite terrible in the US.

1bd221h,Salesforce or Meta,"Salesforce or Meta SWE Intern?

Hi everyone! I currently have a return intern offer from Salesforce and an exploding offer from Meta. Considering my chances of getting the return offer first and foremost, then long-term career benefits.

SALESFORCE:

*Pros:*

* Extremely high intern conversion rate. I don't know anyone who didn't get new grad last year.
* Culture fits (ethics, company values, big volunteer culture, etc.)
* WLB is great.
* Friendly team that mainly deals with infrastructure.

*Cons:*

* Less long-term benefit than Meta.

META:

*Pros*

* Bigger brand name
* Good benefits
* Product impacts
* Better talent

*Cons:*

* Don't know the team yet.
* Would have to renege Salesforce.
* Lower chance of intern conversion.

Pay is near identical. Ideally, I would pick Meta, but the chance of not getting a return offer is what's stopping me. Best situation would be if I could push one to fall.",2024-03-12 16:50:43

1bs6qa4,You will get what you want in the most unexpected way possible. Just keep at it!,"I'm an international student pursuing my MS in the US. The struggle was real. 400 Applications, a few automatically sent OAs and 0 interviews.

Amidst all this, I was also DMing my CV to a few people on LinkedIn who had made posts about openings in their teams. When I was expecting it the least, I found a DM in my LinkedIn inbox saying the team lead likes my CV and the kind of projects that he's planning for the Summer are quite similar to a project I had on my CV. I got an invitation for a Phone Screen. After the phone screen and a few technical interview rounds I had the offer from a Fortune 500. The stipend is great too! I feel immensely grateful for what happened. Especially when a reject hits my inbox from the applications I made before I got this internship in Feb last week.

But here's the thing that I want to share the most - Based on a very quick look at the JD that the team lead had posted, I absolutely did not figure out that the particular project that caught the lead's attention would even be remotely related to the JD. I DMed him my CV only because it was one of the companies on my bucket list. I genuinely forgot about it the day after, because to me, my profile was in no way relevant to the JD. But there you go! I already told you what happened next! That tells you you just got to take your shot at every opportunity that comes your way. You shouldn't be the one deciding if you fit the JD or no.

**1. Apply local.** In this market, cold applying to jobs is not going to help you when those jobs themselves are getting hundreds of applicants. Applying local increases your odds as it puts you in a smaller subset of applicants with similar background. Some random company is more than likely gonna hire someone from the area instead of someone halfway across the country. If your local area is the Bay Area or NYC, then RIP I guess.

**2. Apply to non-tech companies.** Right now the job market in the tech industry (companies whose main product is in tech) is a shit show rooted in a layoff culture problem and bad leadership (another post for another day). However, we are fortunate enough to have a skillset that is applicable to any domain and any industry you can think of (which is why we are able to send out 100s-1000s of applications in the first place.) These jobs still do very much exist in these fields (banking, utilities, hospitals, government, manufacturing, etc). Is it sexy? Probably not. But who's worried about sex when you're starving?

1bp7czz,less than 3 months left for college to end and no offer in hand - but i can clutch this,"CTC - cost to company (base pay + HRA + Equity+ etc)
NOC - No Objection Certificate

after months of applying, begging for referrals and willing to take the shittiest CTC 

i had a decent offer after 3 coding rounds, the final being 2 lc medium and hard and the CTC was GOOOOOOD (better than faang without equity)
but they required a NOC from college as they wanted immediate joining and i confidently bullshited that my college will provide one once i show them the offer letter.

well. my college didn't. 

so whatever i get ghosted after not sending the NOC because my university values 75% attendance more than the students future and mind you even the highest placed students (2) CTC was not what i was offered. 

and today i gave the college's on campus interview (different company) again went to the final round and ACED it. access modifiers, DP, centering a div, system design, where do i see myself in 5 years, why is Kanye kanye - EVERYTHING - answered everything to my satisfaction except about echmascripts and a silly reverse string (i forgot the python syntax but clutched it in JavaScript) 

now what pisses me off is not getting rejected but seeing the ones who did get shortlisted and just how fuck all universities can be

I'm not jealous/envious or hating on them, they're my batchmates and sometimes not so boring to be around

but how the fuck are resumes with more than 40% just dead white space, left panel with hobbies and interests (not the programming kind) and an absolute fuck all experience in Marketing get shortlisted over me??????

I'm sorry but what the fuck

i have less than 3 months and am doing a bunch of things to not be a bum

- gsoc (will be applying to 4 organisations 2 of which I've been trying to contribute to and the other 2 are very niche and don't have repos )
- building huge projects in AI and web3 because of personal interest and hype cycles (money)
- building a really futuristic human computer interface device (passion project so i don't forget why i started cs) 

I'd love your input on what else can i do to find a job
things i plan
 - go to yc co founder, revamp my twice rejected yc account and find someone and go big or go home (job)
- networking events + printed out resume + on my best American psycho charming self
- switch careers ( pimp )

I did my first internship at a small company and I was able to achieve quite a lot (at least in my opinion!).

* We barely had any CI/CD, so I created CI/CD workflows and new deployment pipelines which saved a total of 10 hours of work weekly. (it removed like 30 minutes of weekly work for 25 developers, so it should be 12.5 hours but I rounded down to 10 hours)
* There was code that was written by a previous intern that I was able to make faster by 15x (it took 30 seconds, I reduced it to 2 seconds) consistently. We benchmarked it and everything.
* I was also able to reduce our AWS cost by $5000 per month by moving things to AWS Lambda and implementing a tool that throttles resources on our product when it is not in use.

As an intern, these achievements obviously look extremely unbelievable. I've often seen here that people will throw out resumes with achievements that are crazy like ""reduced runtime by 20%"" and mine is 15x. So if 20% if already not believable, then 15x is for sure going to get my resume burned on the spot, no?

So I'm thinking of making the CI/CD thing 30 minutes per week, the reduced runtime by 10% instead of 15x, and reduce AWS cost from $5000 per month to $500 per month. Is that better? Should I make the achievements even worse? Should I make them better? Should I just keep the original with what I actually did?

Those bullet points above are not how they are presented on my actual resume btw. I wrote them out like that for the post to provide additional context and whatnot.",2024-03-24 15:26:03

1. They contain all the GitHub repo postings + **so much more**, honestly feel like the jobs on the repo either aren't enough or are posted late.
2. Jobs are constantly being added, almost always on the same day they open.
3. The Internship subreddit contains postings from all seasons.
4. It's **strictly** for software engineering new grad roles and internships, so there will be no irrelevant jobs which should make your job search much easier :)

I hope this will be of benefit to you guys. Thanks!

1bilnha,Landed an Internship!,"I applied to about 20 companies and sent in a little over 30 applications. I was extremely nervous because most companies had already hired interns since I waited so late due to Mr taking a class that would help me prepare for the job search. The class helped boost my resume and practice interviewing. I had also gone to a career fair at my college to help boost myself in their system that way.

Well I got an offer! I'll have to relocate a bit but I'm not too mad at that and it pays $22 an hour for making, populating, and maintaining a database to store locations of documents in a warehouse.

1bg2g4g,You won't loose jobs chill tf out ,"
What's happening right now has already played out during various historical moments like the Industrial Revolution, automation of manufacturing in assembly lines, the rise of textile mills and the Luddite movement, computerization and office automation, the Y2K bug scare, the emergence of solar panels, the growth of e-commerce, and the era of steam power and railways, among many others!

The impact on jobs has always been a mix of losses in certain sectors and the creation of new opportunities in others. So, it's essential to be ready to pivot. Personally, I think the next big thing might be quantum computing. ( Ofc this AI shit will be here until companies end up having solid foundational models which I think would take atleast half a decade)

During COVID, we've seen around a 15% inflation rate compared to what would've been about 6-7%, plus a massive surge in hiring. The Biden administration also opened up immigration like floodgates simultaneously ( The most idiotic move ). So, the job market's flooded right now. Half the candidates are puffing up their resumes just to get hired. It's a mess, kind of like what happened during the Y2K bug scare. Remember how even folks with a third-class degree landed jobs and then ended up as immigrants with green cards lmaooo. And we all know what happened with the layoffs a few years later.

Just fucking pursue whatever makes you happy man :)
And be happy that you're privileged

1ba2dmy,Countless Interviews Failed,"Hi, 

I wouldn't call this a rant, but I wanted to share it here in case it helps or connects with anyone.

I finished my bachelor’s with just one SWE internship under my belt, at an a-okay hardware/software company. It’s not super well known or anything but the pay was decent (like 45/hour). 

BUT, I failed the rest of my other technical interviews. Yup. All of them. I’m currently doing master’s degree now and just failed the 2 tech interviews that I made to the final with Apple and Meta. 

I’m turning 23 and I haven’t even secure a full time SWE yet. Some of my classmates that graduated around the same time as me have already been working in the field for like 2 years or so now. I’m actually thinking of switching career at this point but there is nothing else I like doing besides coding. 

My point is CS is the only thing I like and can comprehend to a certain extent, and I still suck at it, so bad that i failed almost all of my tech interviews, for some reason. 

I know there are so many people out there who are struggling. Please know that you are not alone. For those of you who want to give me a reality check with your words, I’m happy to hear them.

1b64tue,Four years into college and not sure if I want to do CS,"Alright, so I guess I’ll just summarize my current position. Initially, I was planning to major in psychology since it was the only subject I was passionate in and I had a good class in high school. However, I had heard about how bad a bachelor’s degree in psychology was, so I quickly switched to computer science. 

My first year of college (2020-2021) was all online. Majoring in computer science I was given the option to participate in an accelerated program called STEP/FyRE for incoming undergraduate students. The first semester was perfectly fine and I got through it with not too much stress. However, the accelerated program ended up recommending that I sign up for 18 units next semester. Against the advice of my parents, I ended up arrogantly signing up for all 18 units, which ended in total disaster due to the insane workload and weekly schedule, as well as literally the lack of time for me to take any lunch or restroom breaks in between. Due to all this, plus a particular bad professor and my lack of familiarity/passion for it, this ended up causing me to crash and burn out and fail most of my courses for the semester. 

The next year (2021-2022, two semesters, now we were back in person) was me switching to biology and retaking my failed courses in order to fix my GPA and academic record. I thought about perhaps becoming a physician assistant, and eventually a medical doctor. I did decently well in biology, it was really the chemistry courses which gave me a bit more trouble (I did not take OChem, I switched out before that), but after a bit of soul-searching, I realized that I didn’t want to do that, especially with medical school, etc. 

So I ended up switching back to psychology because I felt like I wanted to do what I loved/was passionate about and me wanting to maybe go into therapy/psychiatry/mental health advocacy and the like because that was what I’ve always been passionate about doing. However, I did acknowledge that I would need at least a master’s. So currently I’ve been in psychology for two years now (2022-2023 and 2023-2024), and I have about a year’s or a little over a year’s worth left of major requirement courses to take before I can graduate with a BA in psychology. 

However, lately, I’ve been kind of caught up really thinking about my future and everything and what I want to do, and I’ve been rethinking about how much people say a bachelor’s in psychology isn’t great for finding a job and everything, as well as how much time and effort will have to be put into doing a master’s program, as well as the years of trying to get licensing and certification, etc., and me worrying about the cost and the eventual salary of the career. Lately, I’ve been considering the very real possibilities of the alternatives of going into computer science again, perhaps taking a much less strenuous workload than I did my first year of college or going into tech or nursing. I’ve heard about how great and reliable these career options are and have been seriously considering them again. My gripes about computer science include the difficulty of the field, the sedentary lifestyle, the math, etc. and about nursing is just the level of day-to-day responsibilities in taking care of the patients, as well as the process of becoming one.

I’m kind of stuck in a rock and a hard place because I’ve already spent four years and thousands of dollars on tuition doing kind of a variety of things and no work experience. I feel the pressure to graduate as quickly as I can and my parents are sick of my indecision and me wasting time and their money not knowing what I’m doing.",2024-03-04 07:16:58

I am East Asian and ESL with a heavy accent.

All interviews I had were software engineering intern positions, except Forescout.

Every time after the first round of interviews, I didn't pass any single company. It's starting to feel a bit disheartening. :(

&#x200B;

In my interviews, most of the interviews were mainly behavioral, if not they still contained behavioral questions.

I just needed to write this down somewhere. I'm starting to feel super depressed dealing with this internship season :(

&#x200B;

1. For live interviews: Paycom, HPE, Hedral, Viavi Solutions, CSC, PayPal, Daktronics, Forescout
2. For phone screening: CSC (passed), Fidelity Investment ( recruiter said he would send my resume to the hiring manager and the manager would review my resume, then rejected), United Wholesale Mortgage, CMU (rejected because of not having citizenship, the green card was not enough), Spotlight.
3. One-way video recording/HireVue ( some are automated ): Prudential (I think they send everyone), Bank of America, Lumen (they send before resume), Sabre ( I got 2 positions, received 1 and 3 days after application), SiriusXM ( 2 positions ), PSCU, Citizens Bank (after hackerRank), Humana (pre-screening)
4. Not passed any interview, except CSC phone screening

In live interviews,

Paycom: my first live interview, I didn't do well in both behavioral and technical ( couldn't implement 1 feature)

HPE: I got the question of whether I have a prior internship, then discussed my software engineering experience and my desired field. ( lasted 15 minutes while it was 45 minutes behavioral interview ).

10 days after the interview, I received HackerRank OA, but I couldn't pass all the test cases. (I am not sure whether I passed the interview because I see the person who passed all test cases also got rejection. )

Hedral: very small startup, my avaliable earliest start date was 4 week later their desired starting date, none of my tech stack met their requirements. 

Viavi Solutions: The interviewer asked whether I have prior internship experience. Also as the starting date was not posted, the interviewer asked whether I could meet their starting time after he gave information for the starting date, as I need relocation, I said I am available 3 weeks later than the desired starting dates. He asked whether I have experience in GPS/Hardware programming, Robotics, etc which I don't have and I didn't put on my resume.

CSC: The first 25 minutes were technical, the interviewer said I communicated my thought process well, but the flow of the interview was not good with behavioral questions. (They asked similar questions multiple times then the interview went short. )

PayPal: The interviewer asked whether I have prior internship experience. When I said, no, he asked again whether I had an internship in summer 2023, I said no and this would be my first internship, then he asked about my software engineering experience such as projects. (Probably as I answered a tell me about myself question, he didn't like my response, based on his body language.)

The interview lasted full but was rejected the next day.

Daktronics: The interviewer asked me to ask about myself a question. He said I have an impressive background. He asked whether I was also interested in embedded programming ( my applied position was the position that uses C# and not the embedded.) He asked what would I improve or add features in Java if I had the ability. Also, he asked how would I handle the task that require learning new skills. Also, he asked how would I handle a large codebase.

Forescout (QA intern): The interviewer asked whether I had prior internship experience during the summer. I said no and I mentioned my project. Then she asked for details about my project in my resume and whether it was a personal or school project. I answered it was a school group project. ( I listed 1 personal project, and 2 school projects in my resume ). The interviewer asked which framework/library I used for unit testing, I said JUnit. The interviewer asked, what I knew about types of testing beyond unit testing, and I answered load/regression/integration testing. And then, the interviewer asked whether I knew acceptance testing, and I said no. After that, she asked whether I had experience with shell, scripting. I said I had experience with bash during system programming class but I am not an expert yet. She also asked about my proficiency and experience with Linux. And then, she asked Linux and Windows OS, which OS was more comfortable for me, and I answered Windows. After that, she asked whether I have skills in Python ( I didn't put this on my resume in the skills section). During this question, I asked to repeat the question as I couldn't understand the word ""Python"" due to the accent of the interviewer. ( It sounded like Pyteung) answered that while I am not yet proficient with that, I have brief experience with Python during system programming class.

Interview lasted 22 minutes out of 30 minutes, and no behavioral questions like tell me about time.

No updates yet, 1 week passed.

1bqjeez,Some thoughts as an experience dev,"Hi, CSMajors!

I lurk on this subreddit often and I have been meaning to write this for a while now. First of all, I understand how most of you feel in this terrible economy with the lack of jobs and rejections. I graduated 9 years ago from a very prestigious university. There were plenty of new grad opportunities around that time from all types of companies, yet I botched all of them because of how terrible I was at interviews. I couldn't get past phone screens for all of the prestigious tech companies. My peers were super smart, and I used to feel like a failure when I heard them getting 4-5 offers from FAANG and unicorns. They were also much better than me with their GPAs and extracurriculars. I remember getting kicked out from one of the onsite interviews in the second round. They had a policy of eliminating candidates who were not good enough to advance to the next round. I cried my heart out sitting alone in Central Park, thinking if I should quit my dream of becoming an SWE. Somehow I composed myself and ended up getting one offer from a startup in a tier 3 city in the end. I was probably the last person amongst my peers to get a job and definitely with the lowest salary.

After a couple of years in my new job, I felt I wasn't learning much. I started applying for companies in the Bay Area because career opportunities in tier 3 cities are limited. I improved my game, passing the phone interviews for big tech; however, my onsite performance was weak. I remember the humiliation at one of the coding rounds where I almost cried. I eventually got an offer from a startup in a tier 2 city and accepted that job. I was honestly shattered and thought I'd never be able to pass the interviews for these big tech companies. This job turned out to be a game-changer for me. I got a really smart mentor who taught me so many good things about writing good code, TDD, refactoring, ownership, and software craftsmanship. He was direct about how bad my code was and would sit with me explaining how I could make my code better. If I wasn't happy with something, I would always ask him how I could make it better. I got better at my craft and felt confident about my skills. I applied again to big tech companies and got 3 offers then :) I have interviewed on and off after that, joined another big tech, and today I can proudly say that I love my career as an SWE and wouldn't change it for anything.

Why am I sharing this story? I hope to help those who want to work for these big tech companies for whatever reason - opportunities, peers, money, status, but they cannot because they suck at interviews or the bad economy severely limiting the opportunities. You can learn and grow at some of the unknown companies and apply again when you gain some experience. Interviews are a game of luck, and all you need is one good day. My interview success rate is 3%, i.e., out of every 100 opportunities I get, I pass only 3 interviews. **I have failed numerous interviews to know that none of the interview questions, especially LeetCode style questions, reflect my ability to be a good SWE.**

I hope you all get a good job and become amazing developers! Software engineering is much more than interviews. I want to share a few things that have helped my career a lot:

1. When you start your career, always ask your seniors how you can write your code better. Don't be afraid of getting some harsh feedback. You're just new to the industry and you will get better!
2. Don't let someone who went to an elite school or prestigious company intimidate you. The best mentor I had and the best intern I worked with went to a no-named university.
3. Regardless of which company you join, always find opportunities to make something better. You'll be surprised how disorganized big tech companies can be. In one such company, I found a build time that was taking an hour and I brought it down to nearly 5 minutes by learning some docker, Django, and Jenkins even though I was part of the product team and not infra/platform.
4. If you learn or know something, share it with your team. Some treat institutional knowledge as ""job security"". IMO a good developer should never be insecure about their skillsets.
5. Proactively reach out to your junior engineers and ask how you can help. Many juniors are intimidated and afraid they will look stupid by asking questions.
6. Do not be afraid to take on ambiguous problems or problems for which you lack expertise. These types of problems help you get out of your comfort zone and help you grow your skillset.
7. Promotions can become hard for you after reaching L5 (senior). You may be better off interviewing for other companies than fighting the bureaucracy.
8. Finally, always be empathetic when interviewing. Do not ask questions that are needlessly difficult just to show off how good you are at LC. I do not ask algorithmic questions when I interview (unless the company has a set of questions which I have to follow, in which case I refuse to conduct coding interviews completely).",2024-03-29 07:37:05

1b8iy3f,My take on the doomer posts,"Hey everyone I have been following this sub for a while and have noticed alot of doomer posts. I am in my late 20s and I have worked in oil/gas and mining (I will refer to this as the resource industry) for the last couple years and have grown up in an area where these industries run the economy. Additionally I myself am halfway done a CS degree that I am taking remotely while working in mining. 

In the resource industry I have witnessed frequent downturns where every couple of years a commodity tanks in price and mass layoffs ensue. Senior people have issues finding entry level jobs and everyone who spent stupidly on boats, houses, and RVs can't make ends meet. You will than see stories on how ""insert commodity here"" will never recover in price and how it is a dead industry. Eventually after a year or two the commodity rebounds and than mass hiring happens again and the cycle repeats and you will even hear ridiculous stories on how a janitor somehow secured himself $120k a year for a fly in fly out job. 

I think this is applicable to the CS industry because even though from what I see crashes are more infrequent than the resource industry they seem to be more intense when they do happen. Everything will recover it is just a matter of time, maybe it will take 6 months for it to start in stride or two years nobody knows for certain.

 I don't really have advice for what to do in the now because if you happened to graduate now that is just unfortunate but I do understand as somebody who graduated the first time into a super bearish economy for my field.  Even though now is a bad time to graduate it is likely a good time to start.

I have a near perfect GPA (although I doubt that it rlly matters) and have several personal projects I worked on school clubs.

I applied to 200+ internships from last September for Summer 2024 and have received no offers. I received several automated OAs at the start of the recruiting season and did reasonably well on most of them (most of them with all test cases passed), but have not even been given the opportunity to have an interview. I did get an interview with one relatively well known tech company (2 rounds) 5 months ago and got great responses from both my interviewers and recruiter, but I've been ghosted every since.

It is frustrating how I applied to 200+ internships (with referrals to some companies) and completed the OAs reasonably well but haven't even been given the chance to prove myself through interviews.

I am at the stage where I don't know what more I have to do. Since I'm probably going to spend the Summer jobless, I don't know what more I can do... I can't really improve my job experience with internships and the only thing that comes to mind is that I should work on my personal projects over the summer.

Please give me your thoughts on what I can do. Is the internship recruiting season normally this difficult?

Edit: I am a junior so this is my last chance for a summer internship",2024-03-27 03:10:52
1bjv7lv,Apple final round,"A recruiter reached out to me for a position and I had the first round call today with the manager. A few minutes after the interview is over the recruiter says they want to move me onto the final round. Any ideas on what to expect? I was expecting at least 3-4 rounds of getting obliterated with questions and difficult problems. The first round was just them asking me things about my resume for 30 minutes and no leetcode type questions and this second/final round is also 30 minutes.

Out of the hundreds of apps I've sent to Apple I've never heard back for one so I was surprised when recruiters reached out to me for roles I never applied for. I have others offers and final rounds I am doing so I really only agreed to start a new round of fresh interviews due to the rarity of Apple responding. Any advice is much appreciated!

I thought of sharing my rejects. 

So basically I've been applying for internships/jobs since I fall of 2021. I came to the US with a dream to work in a decent tech company, understand software engineering, and then maybe after gaining tech experience start something of my own. I somehow got an internship in a local IT company, not converted to full-time, and then have been applying to tech jobs for full-time roles since fall 2022. In 2023 I made a New Year resolution of keeping track of all my rejects so that maybe one day after cracking a good job I'd post it as an achievement but I am 1200+ rejects and still applying sometimes with just hope.  I then somehow got a job at another local IT firm in 2023 March and they said after my graduation they'd keep me a paid intern for a couple of months and then hire me full-time and guess what, they laid off all of us interns who were promised to be converted, then I got in touch with some marketing agencies that automate and apply for any jobs by consolidating all the experience into one targeted skill and since I had close to 3 Yoe including internships and all in different skillset I thought of trying this approach and got into another below avg IT company in another city where I feel like I'm doing something but I'm paid so less that there is no motivation.

&#x200B;

Lately, I've been following advancements in AI and how people are making things in AI so now I think I'll do more leet code and make AI-based solutions that may or may not be a hit but I am done applying every day before going to the office after coming from office. I think I came to the US which might be the right place but I came at the wrong time :(  


Maybe I was a terrible programmer or had horrible luck only time will tell but at least for now, I am done with the dream to work in a big tech company. I think I'm not built for that. Maybe I'll try building my project and see if it goes well, if not then when the time comes (when my F-1 is expired or I get laid off again lol), I'll go back to my country and figure things out.

1bihx75,I am exicted for AI software engineers and you should be too,"People think a career in SWE is supposed to be all about coding, using code to solve business problems. That is the tedious uncreative work in SWE that sucks. 

It is supposed to be about attending, scheduling and participating in meetings. Myself and many SWEs are guilty of working on code through meetings. When we should have been suggesting setting up a meeting to make sure we have an appropriate number of meetings. This will also free us from dreaded work emails that should have been meetings. 

With AI software engineers we will finally be able to focus on the actual collaborative creative work in Software Engineering, meetings. When was the last time you did something creative with code compared to your contributions to a meeting? 

CS degrees will then be properly able to help students prepare for the industry, by focusing on buzzwords and lingo for meetings. However, CS students will learn to take the reins of the meeting to deep dive making them even more valuable to the company. This will make us even more highly paid. Trust me, your compensation has always tied to your participation in meetings, not your technical skills. 

The people who are not passionate about meetings will finally leave the field. AI is not here to replace anyone in SWE; unless you're no fun in meetings. Without needing to code we can finally find time to take showers and groom ourselves, so we can turn our webcams on now!",2024-03-19 11:25:05

1bjgw1m,What’s going on?!,"As an AI researcher, I've noticed a trend where many individuals are enthusiastically embracing the field of AI, driven more by its hype and financial opportunities rather than a genuine interest in the mathematical aspects. With the rise of deep learning, there's been a surge in paper publications and public presentations, often garnering significant attention and approval. This stands in contrast to more traditional research fields, such as computer science, where thorough research can take months, involving ideation, implementation, experimentation, and paper writing.

In the AI field, it seems that some individuals are leveraging deep learning models and university resources to quickly produce papers that are accepted by major AI conferences. While I don't question the efforts put forth by these researchers, the rapid pace and apparent ease of acceptance raise concerns about the integrity of the process. During my graduate studies, I observed peers who seemed disinterested in attending classes or delving into the mathematical underpinnings of ML, yet managed to publish papers and secure prestigious internships. This discrepancy leaves me wondering about the true value of paper publications in academia.

Is the sole aim of being a PhD student to churn out papers, or should there be a stronger emphasis on mastering the fundamentals and investing in mathematical understanding? It's frustrating to see individuals gaining recognition and opportunities based solely on the quantity of their publications, rather than the depth of their knowledge and understanding.",2024-03-20 15:57:42
1bdzm3n,Going to med school after CS major,"Hello everyone,

I'm  currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and will be completing  it in two years. While I'm genuinely interested in continuing a career  in a field related to my major, I'm increasingly concerned about the  future impact of AI on software engineering, particularly for those just  starting out in the field. Given this uncertainty, I've been thinking  the idea of studying medicine after I finish my computer science degree.  Both of my parents are surgeons, so I've always had a connection to the  healthcare field.

I see two main  advantages to this path: (1) I could potentially leverage my CS  knowledge to develop  tools in healthcare, I think studying medicine and  working with doctors could give me a unique perspective on this, and  (2) If everything in tech really goes bad I could pursue a  career as a surgeon. I have doubts that AI will completely replace  doctors, as the profession involves critical decision-making and  life-saving interventions that require a human touch. What are your  thoughts on this? Am I overthinking things?",2024-03-13 18:58:50

1bqyx44,"Incompentence is incompetence, and why AI won't replace us (Yet)","TLDR: AI doesn't fix a bad developer. A good dev is good, and a bad dev is bad.

# Intro

I had a bit of a revelation the other day. I'm currently working on a group project as a 4th year computer science student, which is forcing me to confront the ways other students choose to resolve problems.

Our project is pretty complex and there are a lot of moving parts. One of the members of my group, Jimothy, Is an extremely nice guy, and very personable, however the code that he writes has to be some of the worst code that I've ever witnessed. Having to revise a number of his pull requests I oftentimes found functions that didn't make sense, completely unused, massive blocks of code, and genuinely some of the worst, and most confusing architectural choices I've ever witnessed. There's little cohesion in his code, it's hard to work with, it's hard to understand, and generally, it doesn't really work very well. It is hard to oversell how genuinely frustrating it has been to work with his code, and has led to various massive headaches due to errors with it.

Whenever he has an issue when programming he generally tries to resolve it himself, however, he often gets stuck for hours at a time and can't seem to resolve the issues that he is facing. On multiple occasions he's reached out to me for some help, and of course I oblige, as we're ultimately in a team together and I do want to be helpful where I can.

On multiple occasions, I've managed to help him resolve these issues that he's been stuck on without too too much effort; oftentimes it was an aspect of the code he had overlooked, or a missing value, or another mistake that isn't too uncommon, but he kept missing it. The mistakes, in themselves, weren't too heinous- everyone makes the occasional silly mistake when programming, but he just didn't seem to be able to resolve them.

# His Approach

Thinking maybe he just wasn't as skilled, or was unfamiliar with the language, or he just wasn't very organized, I thought hey, it happens, sometimes people just aren't the best at things. That was, until I sat next to him in the library, and I saw him trying to resolve an issue.

He was having a problem where on runtime, in a function, an object's values that he was accessing didn't exist. Instead of doing the natural thing, which is to verify that the object exists, the attributes are set to the correct values, and checking the inputs and outputs of the function, he proceeds to open up ChatGPT, copy the block of code in, and ask it what was wrong.

After ChatGPT gave some generic response on different things to check to verify why this issue is happening, he asks it to generate some code to fix the issue. ChatGPT then proceeds to come up with an entirely new class that would change how different attributes within the function would be handled in accordance to the framework that we were using. Quickly looking at the block of code that was generated by ChatGPT, I could tell that this was an overly complicated initial step to resolving the issue. It had multiple new imports, tweaked some parts of the underlying architecture, and was generally very long and convoluted for a mere NullReferenceException.

Still spectating, I watch as Jimothy proceeds to copy the entire block of code that ChatGPT gave to him, and copy it right into the file he was working on, without having as little as a quick skim through what he was copying.

Obviously the issue was not resolved after his attempt. Frustrated, I tell him ""hold on let me try to help you out,""  and have a look through his code. It turned out, he had forgotten to set the value he was accessing in the object's constructor, and was therefore getting the NullReferenceError when using the value elsewhere in the code. Instead of checking the values, inputs, and outputs that he needed, he simply offloaded the entire task to the AI.

Suddenly my headaches with his previous code all made sense - half-written functions, confusing architectures, and no real vision in what he was writing. This guy, instead of genuinely writing any code, or trying to resolve issues in any direct and straightforward manner, would just try to ask an AI and be sent around in circles whilst trying to solve a problem. His code, as a result, was terrible to work with, and honestly, I think I spent more time resolving the issues that he caused instead of saving time by having him work on those features.

After I helped him resolve his issue, I went to sit somewhere else. I wasn't gonna put out those fires anymore.

# My Point

This has been pretty long winded, but my point is that AI, or transformer-based models, are not replacing us any time soon. Thinking he could rely on them like a crutch, this guy used them for literally everything. This made both our group's working and his work slower and worse. Giving ChatGPT to a shit programmer isn't going to make a good programmer, it's just gonna give you the same shit code, and more of it. It's like giving a baby a shotgun.

If you want to stand out you have to put in the work, and if you do that, replacing you will be hard. I use ChatGPT as well, but I understand the code that I write, I plan ahead and design my programs deliberately, and I'm more effective because of it.

Don't worry about the AI. At least not for a while

1bm1hm4,Apple interview prep,"Hey everyone,

I recently made it through the online assessment for a Software Engineer position at Apple, specifically for the Apple Watch team. Despite feeling like I lack experience in this area, I’ve been scheduled for my first-ever coding technical interview, and frankly, I’m pretty nervous.

I’m concerned about my level of preparation. I’ve been hitting LeetCode and brushing up on my fundamentals, but the thought keeps creeping in that it might not be enough.

I could really use some advice on what to expect during the technical interview, especially from those who’ve been through Apple’s hiring process or have interviewed for roles related to hardware like the Apple Watch. Are there specific topics or types of problems I should focus on more than others? How do Apple’s interviews compare to other tech giants in terms of difficulty and emphasis?

Moreover, how do you handle the pressure of performing well in such a high-stakes environment? Any strategies for managing nerves or making a good impression, even if you stumble on a problem?

I understand that failing is a part of learning and growing in our careers, but I can’t shake off the feeling that this opportunity is slipping through my fingers before it’s even begun. Any words of wisdom, resources, or personal anecdotes would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to your insights!",2024-03-23 20:05:46

Personally, I failed about 12 coding interviews before I passed my first (and only) one. What really helped me were mock interviews, but getting a friend to interview me for one hour was hard to arrange.

Right now you sign up then for free and pick one of the questions to practice with.

Its supposed to be like an actual coding interview, so you can ask for hints, ask questions etc. Our AI is even supposed to nudge you after time goes by, comment on the code you have submitted, and ask for the Big O.

1brpj0p,Advice for those looking for internships… ,"Hey all. 

I’m 25 years old, working as a DevOps Engineer ever since I was 21 years old. 

Granted, during my time of finding internships in college, the field wasn’t as saturated as it is now. However, I do have some friendly advice when it comes to obtaining an internship that may or may not have been mentioned here already. 

Keep applying through the traditional job application methods. Don’t stop…. BUT - find smaller to medium sized companies and find out the contact information of top level executives at that company. Whether it’s an HR person, Engineering Director, CEO, etc… Find their email and reach out saying you’d be interested in working for their organization and if there are any openings! Maybe there aren’t any on their website, but you still reach out… 

My own example is when I was 19 years old - I reached out to high level executives from some local companies and a CEO wound up getting back to me… he didn’t have any openings BUT, he said a “good friend” of his is the CEO of a large cyber organization and said he would reach out on my behalf!

Then when I was 20, I reached out to the local WB Games division by me. I found the lead directors email and reached out… and they wound up offering me an interview and an offer after! 

The point I’m trying to make here is you need to take the backroads when the main roads are clogged and there’s a lot of traffic. Don’t give up! ",2024-03-30 19:04:58

But yesterday I got another offer from a Big N company to start in May and it pays ~80k more so I accepted it and plan to renege the insurance company.

I’ve never reneged on an offer so my question is do I just email the recruiter and make up a family emergency? Or should I be up front about going with a better offer?

Also do I renege now or wait until the background checks for the Big N company clear? Or renege only in May after I start at the Big N company?

1bru74x,anyone take 6+ years to finish degree?,"in my case, my university's course options and scheduling are limited and  i decided on taking up an internship, with a company that can offer me good experience and is a good name overall, during a semester where i should be taking courses instead and so this pushes my grad a year back making it 6 years and grad ceremony is on october of the year. has anyone else done this? did it work out in the future? did you regret your decision? as stupid as it sounds, im just sad that other new grads that started uni the same time as me will already have 1-1.5y more exp than me as a new grad vs me at the same age with one good internship but 1.5 year behind in the full-time eng process.

taking this summer internship though i will have 2 yrs of work exp as a swe intern but it doesnt mean anything if it doesnt translate to a new grad offer. but i suppose if i graduate on time by not taking this internship, my new grad offer prospect will be the same if not worse.

maybe im just worrying about petty things but idk why the 1-2 year age gap between me and my graduating class is making me sad",2024-03-30 22:24:50
1boszwz,Life update: see my last post (tl:dr I didn’t give up),"Last fall, I posted a rant about how stuck I felt with recruiting. I did end up accepting the said mid-size insurance company’s internship position, but I wasn’t exactly satisfied with it. Even though I felt super lucky to have gotten a position in a market that is this competitive, I felt like I was “settling”, if that makes any sense. I kept studying over winter break to give more interviews a try. 

Two months ago, my first week back after break, I accepted a SWE internship with Fidelity.

I can still remember how I felt the day I got the offer call. As someone who wants to go into fintech post grad and had Fidelity as one of their top companies that they wanted to work for, I was on cloud9. 

Reading back on my last post, I wish I could tell myself to keep my head up no matter how lost I felt. I wish I could tell myself that no matter how difficult the process is, and how much it weighs you down emotionally, the worst thing you can do is to stop trying. 

Fidelity was the third company I applied to when I first started applying for internships in September, and I honestly thought my application was done since I didn’t hear back from them for months. I am incredibly lucky for my offer, and everyday I feel a bit guilty about how there are so many more people out there who are way more qualified than I am. 

I am writing this post hoping that it helps anyone else who is going through what I was going through last fall. The market is tough, but you can be tougher. Just keep going at it, and you’ll get there.

EDIT: I wanted to say thank you for the people who commented in my last post. The comments meant a lot to me, and I hope things are going well for you guys.",2024-03-27 04:14:29

I’m Jimmy, a former Microsoft software engineer who has spent the last 3 years preparing students for the Leetcode style coding interview. I get a lot of questions about how to prepare, which topics to focus on and the order to follow, etc so I thought I’d write a detailed guide breaking it down.

This guide splits the study process for coding interviews into four sets of questions, for a total of 75 questions. Each set is meant to achieve a specific learning goal.

Set 1: Working With Algorithm Patterns (13 qs)  
Set 2: Data Structures (24 qs, 16 high priority, 8 lower priority)  
Set 3: DFS and BFS (21 qs)  
Set 4: Greedy vs Dynamic Programming (11 qs)  
Misc: Other Topics (6 qs)

**How did I come up with this guide?**

My teaching experience, combined with breaking down the questions on the [Grind 169](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=28&hours=6) into categories, which you can find [here](https://visualleetcode.notion.site/d46d383b06874349b22ff9e469666606?v=f35b4780b54a49beb2bdd7bc425c9101&pvs=74).

There’s definitely a lot to cover! So I’m also linking some of the ***free*** resources I’ve been working on at [HelloInterview](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code) to make the learning process easier.

# Set 1: Working with Algorithm Patterns

This set of questions **focuses on learning how to use algorithm patterns**. Algorithm patterns are crucial because once you understand the fundamentals of a pattern, a whole class of related problems suddenly become *a lot* easier to solve.

## How do you study algorithm patterns?

To learn the fundamentals of an algorithm pattern, start with a simple example problem that demonstrates why the pattern is useful. Use that problem to understand the basic structural components of the pattern. Then, apply what you learned by solving a few follow-up questions on your own.

I’ve broken down the fundamentals and created animated solutions for the follow-up questions for the following algorithm patterns, which are a great place to start because they don’t require additional knowledge of data structures beyond arrays.

Make sure you understand the types of questions that are a good fit for each pattern (covered in the fundamentals page for each pattern).

## Why are algorithm patterns important?

&#x200B;

* Let's say you get a question which gives you a string, and asks you to return the longest substring within that string without repeating characters.Since this is asking for a substring within a string that meets a certain criteria (no repeating characters), you know this question is a [good candidate](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/sliding-window#when-do-i-use-this) for the sliding window.
* You know that the sliding window pattern involves using two pointers to represent the current window, along with a data structure to store the contents of the window. You can immediately start thinking about the appropriate data structure (a set or a dictionary are good choices for this problem!) to use.
* Now you’ve identified the structural components for this problem, you can begin to translate them into code, using a [template](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/sliding-window#template) for the sliding window as a starting point.

This is why algorithm patterns are important: once you’ve identified that a question is a good candidate for an algorithm pattern, you have a structured foundation from which to solve problem solving from.

# Unit 2: Data Structures

This set of questions will teach you the **data structures you are most likely to encounter during the coding interview, and recognizing the types of problems that are best suited for each.**

Start by understanding the operations that each data structure supports, as well as the asymptotic runtimes (Big-O) of each operation. Then, work through the sample problems to get a sense of how the data structure simplifies each problem.

I’ve written up a guide and animated solutions to the follow-up questions for the Stack data structure. The rest are coming soon!

Knowing which data structure to use is often the key to solving a problem efficiently. They are either the basis of a solution, or a building block for a more complex problem, such as [Meeting Rooms II,](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/description/) which involves sorting intervals and using a heap to process meetings as they end.

&#x200B;

# Set 3: DFS and BFS

This question set covers the depth-first search and breadth-first search traversal algorithms. These show up in so many interviews that **if you’re short on time (and already familiar with thinking in algorithm patterns), I recommend focusing on this unit.**

(The HelloInterview resources for this section are coming soon)

&#x200B;

**Binary Trees**

These questions will get you comfortable with recursion and visualizing how a recursive depth-first search algorithm behaves on the call stack. It will also help you understand the types of questions that are better suited for DFS and BFS.

**Optimization Problems**

Next, these questions cover optimization problems, such as finding the maximum profit in job scheduling, or finding the best time to buy and sell stock. “Greedy” algorithms and dynamic programming are two different approaches to solving optimization problems.

Understanding the pros and cons of both approaches will help solve these questions. If you are faced with an optimization question, you can start by trying a greedy approach. If it doesn’t produce the optimal solution, that’s often a sign that a dynamic programming approach is necessary.

1bcp58j,It would be a good time to switch jobs if it wasn't for the layoffs,"I commute 45 minutes to my 56K a year QA job (started at 54k). I am an aspiring developer and have been at my job since May of 2022. My boss doesn't seem to have interest in moving me to development even though I think I would do fine at the company given some time to get used to the job. I make automation tests and PRs for the company anyway. If it was normal times, it would be a good time to look for other jobs, but with all the layoffs and a potential recession, I am kinda stuck at the moment. After taxes, insurance, and 401k contributions, I make about 850 a week. After rent and student loans, I'm lucky to save 100 bucks for Emergencies.

&#x200B;

Half the people I talk to say I should switch jobs and the other half say I should stay.

1blk4s8,Google SWE Internship,"I’m a sophomore studying CS and though I’m definitely privileged in some ways, it hasn’t been an easy journey. My parents are middle class, but they are immigrants who have no relatives here in the U.S. So they don’t have a great idea about college admissions and internships, since they never experienced it. 

I grinded my way into a good magnet high school, then Princeton. I applied to ~400 internships this season, and Google was the only technical interview I got. It was also the first ever technical interview I’ve done. After around 200 leetcode problems (100 over winter break), I passed the technical interviews!! Of course there’s a lot of luck involved, but I’m proud of how far I’ve come.

1bc4dih,What field in computer science is the most employable?,"Uk student here, I’ve got several offers to study Comp Sci at some prestigious uk universities however I’m worried about job prospects after graduation both in the UK and US. Are there any fields that are still employable like computer engineering or AI, or should I take a gap year and reapply to do another degree like economics or actuarial science (or another if you have any suggestions)?

I’d rather take a gap year and wait another year to start university then to regret majoring in CS for the rest of my life.

1bray20,"Grinding Through CS, But Is the Finish Line Shifting ?"," I'm a sophomore computer science major, and I've been really grinding with my studies. Between coding questions on platforms like LeetCode, keeping up with coursework, and trying to learn new skills like data science and machine learning - I've been putting in a ton of effort.

*I'm not in it only for money* \- I have a genuine interest in CS and want to make a positive impact in this field. However, with all the *noise around generative AI, the market recession, layoffs happening,* etc., I can't help but feel anxious. *It makes me wonder if all my hard work will pay off in the end ?*

I know I'm still early in my journey, but the current conditions make me question whether I'm on the right path. Is specializing in an area like AI/ML still a viable long-term option? Or will roles be significantly impacted by AI ? I don't want to spend years mastering skills that could become non existent.

Has anyone else been grappling with similar concerns? I'd really appreciate some perspective from other CS students and professionals in the field. Am I overreacting to the headlines, or is a career pivot something I should be seriously considering? I'm determined to follow my passion, but feeling a bit lost on the best way forward given the rapid changes happening in tech.

You know how community colleges can be(meaning that I have been taking general classes since I got in, like bio, psychology, edu 101, political science and so on). This is my last semester(sophomore, 2nd year)and so far, I have only taken one C++ class and now a Java class which I won’t lie, I don’t get much from it but thanks for prior knowledge on Python. Even the C++ class was for a semester and I only know the basics and that is because I know a bit of Python from self study before I got into college. Same for HTML too(self study). So I would say I love Python so much and I want to develop my skills in Python. I’m currently learning Django framework(very beginner level). 
I have been trying to apply to internships, I don’t have any prior internships or maybe an actual job in the tech field. Can I pull an internship at this academic stage with my projects?

1bhr8hy,What are your honest thoughts on the future of the field?,"I have been working as a software engineer for the past 8 years, all of them within the .NET world.  
I have a master's in computer science from a respected European university, and have taken new professional challenges with pretty good pay bumps 3 times.

At my current venture for the past 3 years, and I just keep getting offers for better paying positions all the time.

However, the current AI craze has been getting all my friends and co workers in a complete frenzy. I have people leaving extremely well paid positions, with the intent to learn a manual trade. I fully understand that, as I would do the same if I truly believed we have no more future whatsoever.

**I continuously follow Microsoft's development and \*huge\* investment into .NET and just can't wrap around my head the fact that all of this may be gone and obsolete in 5 years.**

So, I would like to understand what all of you are doing and thinking regarding the ""inevitable"" loss of software development jobs.  
To start an healthy discussion, my questions are as follows(some are personal, some are wide open for debate):

* Am I crazy for not actively preparing an exit strategy and keep investing in this industry?
* What is your real expectation of an AI takeover for a significant portion of dev jobs?  

   * Considering latest NVIDIA CEO statements, and continuous development in automatic system generation?
* What options would you consider for staying in the industry and keep being valuable?  

   * Specialise in ML/AI, IoT, Edge computing? Or are you considering other areas?",2024-03-18 13:52:03

1b9dcte,First ever internship interview experience - College Junior,"Felt like sharing this because I honestly don't know how to reflect on this experience and or if I approached anything wrong.

I was reached out to by a company I applied for a bit over a month ago for an interview for an SWE internship position. The only available time for the meeting was within 24 hours and I agreed. I spent the rest of the day and the following morning reviewing basic technical questions, general behavioral questions etc. I felt pretty confident going into the interview. One thing to note was that when I went to re-read what the position was that I was applying for, it was taken down and I couldn't access my application as it was locked, which was a bit concerning.

It was a 30 minute zoom interview which was scheduled with the manager of the department I was applying for and 3 other engineers on the team.

Because it was a 30 minute interview, I assumed it was just a screening--which it was, but since it was over zoom I still obviously dressed well and turned my camera on etc. I join the meeting a minute before the start time, and slowly waited for people to join. Took a few minutes, but before we started I realized I was just staring at myself and no one had their cameras on. Again, this is my *first* ever interview, so I don't know if this is normal? It felt extremely awkward from the get go.

They ask me some background about myself, why I'm interested in their company, which I genuinely was; it's an aerospace company, and I actually did my first year of college in aerospace, so it's something I'm relatively passionate about.

After finishing that, it was just dead silent for about 30 seconds, and then ""Well, okay, can you explain one of these projects on your resume?"" Which I then proceeded to do, and explained the lifetime of the project, its goals and outcomes, challenges I faced and how I solved them etc.

For context, the project was a real-time album art displayer that was built with python and JavaScript which used an LED matrix and a Raspberry Pi, synchronized with Spotify through the Developer API. (There's more to the project, but that's really the only software integrated with hardware project I'd worked on so far, everything else is just purely software).

I expressed a lot of interest in this project and was genuinely hoping for some reaction to it but again there was no visual cues as to what was going on, so I just sat there waiting for someone to ask something, which after a while was only asked if I'd worked on anymore projects with physical hardware implementation which I reluctantly responded with ""No, this was the first experience I'd had with it"" etc.

I then explained another project I had done which was a website I built for my photography portfolio (side hobby / job of mine) using HTML, JS, MySQL, PHP and CSS. This was only responded to with, ""Well it's good that you also do your own projects too.""

After that, I was asked ""What's your favorite and least favorite part about Computer Science?"" This felt so... broad? I genuinely tried to give a good answer, saying I really enjoy building things with software that you can then interact with physically, but stumbled on what my ""least favorite part"" about CS was.

Then I was asked, ""Do you know any legacy languages"" which I do not. So I responded with ""No, that's not something I've delved into myself, and along my college career we've only used more modern languages"".

Awkward pause, then turned it to me to ask questions. I asked some things about what it's like interning for them, what kind of tasks you take on, how do you work as a team as an intern, and if there were any projects that they'd worked on that they found interesting (not sure if I should of asked the last one). Basically, the manager had to keep ""poking"" them by saying things like ""Do you guys want to chime in and answer?"" to which I got pretty bland responses like ""Yea we work as a team and there's always people you can talk to"".

After that it wrapped up, I said thank you etc. and they said ""Alright, well that's about it. Bye."" and left.

I know this is an extremely lengthy post but I just cannot get it off my mind. It just felt so awkward, like they really did *not* care at all, and I really do feel like I had to have messed something up. They didn't ask *any* technical questions, and said they mostly work LabVIEW and... don't really program much so that was interesting.

I don't know how to feel in all honesty. Just felt like getting it off my chest because I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since the meeting earlier today. I don't really expect to hear anything worthwhile back, and it was a good learning experience, but man I really just feel like I somehow flopped.",2024-03-08 03:03:20
1br2025,Mentally out of it,"For the last 4 months I have been applying to PhD SWE intern role, made it to team matching for Meta and still got rejected, I was so sure I was going to make it past team matching, but I guess not. I spoke to three team who liked me and I liked the last two teams but still got a reject. It took me 2 months to grind leetcode, along with being a TA(teaching assistant) doing research and all of that. After the rejection I was totally out of it, discouraged, but some how I managed to keep applying and got one interview call back for stripe. I just finished the 3 round(onsite) and I feel I didn’t do my best for the integration part (ML integration) I ran out of time, I panicked but I knew what I was supposed to do but couldn’t do it. Now I am thinking if I would even make it past this round and get an offer. 

I didn’t know it took this much mental strength for interviews, those who applied and finally got an offer how did you encourage yourself to keep pushing?

Just to add, the meta role is for a PhD intern, and meta requires all PhD intern be matched before they extend an offer and as such many people get stuck at team matching. ",2024-03-29 22:52:16

They scheduled 4 rounds of online interviews with me virtually for the 25th and 27th of March. So, cut to this morning, I get a call exactly one hour before my interview and the recruiter tells me that I don't have enough experience for this role as they require 2-5 years of experience and all the interviews will be canceled.

1bi52bs,"Jobfair Pre-Interview, 2nd Round and now Final","**If anyone has advice for the final round PLEASE PM me**. I interviewed with Jobfair for a SWE intern role, first did the pre-interview audio thing which was easy. Then had my second round, which I had mixed feelings on as it relates to my performance. Below are my random notes and observations

*Pre-Interview*

* Pre-interview was audio only. probably did 7 takes before realizing that the more i rehearsed the worse it sounded. ended up sounding like i was reading from a teleprompter. tried it again the next day
* Prompts changed every hour for me
* Recruiter reached out to me 10 days after i submitted

*Second Round (with Recruiter)*

* Zoom call started with recruiter, then she brought an engineer onto the call and dropped off
* Recruiter was nice, gave me an overview of the company story, gave me basic details on their react/django stack, talked about the internship duration and hourly pay, also mentioned there are small stock awards as well but this seemed mostly symbolic
* Recruiter asked me about some of the projects from my resume, asked if i was comfortable using GPT, mentioned that they weigh heavily on this
* She brought on the next guy and introduced us, then dropped off the call for the part 2 to begin

*Second Round (with an engineer)*

* This was really chill at first, even more casual than with the recruiter. Just seemed like talking to a cool guy and didn't feel pressure. We talked about college and cs in general, talked about where we think tech is going, AI, etc.
* We started talking about chatgpt and he began delving more into the role, explained that GPT is expected to be used to check our code before we relay it to them.
* Almost out of nowhere, he asked if I had the paid GPT-4, and I said yes, and he asked me to share my screen for a little exercise. Was caught off guard because recruiter didn't mention there would be a technical component
* I started getting pretty nervous but really he just wanted to see how i'd approach an issue. He sent me a block of code and showed me in his local environment an example of a bug on their site. He asked me how I would approach this and he had me diagnose the issue in front of him to present three possible solutions.
* He seemed really interested in how I wrote prompts for GPT. I was playing it safe the first couple times and he urged me to just pretend he wasn't there. I did eventually ease up and gave him what i thought were the top three solutions.
* He asked me why I didn't choose another possible solution and wanted me to justify
* After all of this it went back to being casual and he thanked me for being a good sport. We chatted a little bit longer and I got to ask some questions. Then he said the recruiter would be in touch. I have a call scheduled with the recruiter this week
* After the interview finished I felt like I didn't do that great, but the recruiter emailed me the next day and said she got good feedback. Don't know yet whether i made it to final but I'm trying to be hopeful

I'm really curious about if anyone has done a third/final interview with them and what that entails. Again these are just some of my notes and insights so go easy on me",2024-03-18 23:10:55
1b6j06g,How bad did i just screw up?,"Just had my OA for security engineering intern yesterday. All were pretty easy. Last question was a little hearder. Got 300/300 on the first 3 and 100/300 on the last one. I would’ve had time to do the last one, but I accidentally misread question 3 to be a more challenging question than it really was and wasted time… i have cybersecurity research experience but these questions didn’t really have anything to do with that. Feeling like an idiot. I have a very high gpa and some projects but I feel dumb.

Edit: Is it worth telling the recruiter why I screwed up? Basically I interpreted something to be a different problem, so I wasted time (thought it was a much harder problem with DFS but was low key easy), and now I feel like a dumbass.

Edit 2: I see your point. The recruiter def doesn’t give a f*ck. Thanks for taking the time to reply. Just feels crappy and I’m trying to not be mad at myself. My bf told me I’m still smart even tho I did a stupid lmao

1bo8it9,Would majoring in CS be a good fit for me?,"I'm 19 and I'll be starting college soon. I decided to major in exploratory studies as I'm battling between two career paths I want to take.
 ----
Career 1:

The first path deals with medicine. I've been interested in becoming a PA or a psychiatrist for many years and have said I would go down this path for most of my short life.

However, recently I noticed there would be issues with this path. I was diagnosed with PTSD and chaotic environments tend to trigger it. Thus, I think an office environment of sorts would work best for me. This is not to mention the debt I would have to take on if I go down this path. I would have to work for several years to be considered for admission into a PA or medical school, only to come out with a ton of debt. I've also heard countless statistics and stories from medical professionals about the grueling, disheartening nature of the field.

The reason I chose this field was due to my interest in science, my want to help others, and my interest in repairing the human body. 

----
Career 2:

I was debating on going into Computer Science, specifically cyber security and it's digital forensics field. I believe this would be a good option as I've tried my hand at programming for a few years (mostly with making games) and I find it interesting/fun. However, this skill isn't by any means good, I would say I'm an absolute novice. I also have an interest in true crime and understanding the criminal psyche, which makes me gravitate to this field more.

The downside of this field is that I've heard CS has become increasingly more competitive job wise and cyber security isn't a field you can automatically go into after graduating with a CS bachelors degree. Additionally, I feel behind as I don't know anything substantial about programming or computers to feel like my grades would be safe in this major.

----

I'm mostly looking for help understanding which career, if both or neither, are best for me. If you have any insights on the fields or have a suggestion of a middle ground, that would be highly appreciated!",2024-03-26 13:56:29

1bio9gn,What is a CS Degree? SWE Perspective,"Howdy everyone. I just wanted to pop in and share some thoughts and advice from the perspective of a ’21 grad, mid-level SWE. 

First I see a lot of doom and gloom surrounding the rise of AI/ML tools. Writ large, our world is changing rapidly along with how we do our jobs and what our responsibilities are. I want to share something I believe to be true of our field: we are not programmers. We are computer scientists. We are problem solvers. What we do as engineers, is take in a set of requirements, interpret them in the broader context of our technical architecture, company bureaucracy, customer demands, relevant legal frameworks, etc. Then design and implement a cost-effective solution. Those without a CS degree will have an extremely difficult time doing this, especially given that the prompts you’ll need to do your job are steeped in the language of computer science and require an understanding of the code output. 

Another thing - if you aren’t able to get an internship, c’est la vie. I supplemented my resume with technical clubs (software person on the engineering team most of the time) and volunteer work (tutoring CS to K-12 at a local library, working at hackathons). What matters (as someone who reviews resumes) is that you have something useful in there. All I want to know is - do you know the technologies I’m hiring for? Do you have problem solving skills?

Finally, your first job out of University does not need to be an SWE role. I started as a “support engineer” at a tiny company doing tech support for industrial equipment. My CS experience was EXTREMELY helpful in this field, and it helped develop a lot of corporate soft skills I was lacking. You are not wasting your time with a CS degree. You’re learning abstract problem solving skills which will serve you well wherever you end up. 

I hope this is helpful and/or motivating to y’all. Best of luck! :)",2024-03-19 16:21:36

1bpjsyk,Information from the Google Insiders event.,"**Bold:** A question asked by a attendee.

1. **Are there any drawbacks to not being a U.S. citizen and requiring sponsorship during the recruiting process at Google?**
   1. *We are not immigration experts as this varies so much depending on circumstances, but if you receive a job offer, we have a dedicated team to help and answer any questions. Once you’re working with a recruiter, they are your first POC when it comes to visa related questions.*
   2. **what would be the elegible requirements for relocation assistance?**
      1. *if you are relocating 50+ miles*
   3. **If I'm taking Data Structures and Algorithms next semester, can I add it on my resume and update it here on Google?**
      1. *If you take Data Structures & Algorithms before the internship starts that would be fine.*

*Italicized:* The direct answer from Google.

1. *Looking to grow your technical skills, take supplemental coursework and prepare for interviews, check out our Guide to Technical Development at* [techdevguide.withgoogle.com](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/)
2. *Applications open around mid June.*
3. *We do a holistic review of each resume so be sure to include the work you feel is the most impactful. For students earlier on in the career, we understand they might not have as much work experience so we really value seeing their work via projects! Feel free to add courses on your resume if the courses are relevant - For example, Data Structures & Algorithms, Intro to CS or similar Classes*
4. *For the interview, you can code in Python, Java, C, C++ or JavaScript. It's important to be language agnostic so it doesn't hurt to continue learning new coding languages.*
5. *It can be hard to decide what to keep or eliminate. I would highlight the projects you are most proud of, are relevant to the role you're applying for, and demonstrate the breadth of your skill sets!*
6. *we do not offer corporate housing for the summer but we do offer relocation assistance for eligible interns*
7. *For the SWE Internship, you need to currently be pursuing a bachelor's degree in CS or a related technical field. You also need to be continuing your studies after the internship finishes*
8. *to be eligible you would need to be graduating in 2025 for this particular internship*
9. *To be eligible, students need to be continuing their studies after the internship finishes. So if a student were to graduate May 2025, they would be ineligible*
10. *If you take Data Structures & Algorithms before the internship starts that would be fine.*
11. *Step is for 1st and 2nd year students who may not have as much experience. SWE is for students who have a bit more experience and requires you to have taken, or currently be taking, Data Structures & Algorithms. STEP does not have a Data Structure & Algorithm requirement.*
12. *when evaluating experience we are looking to see what you worked on, your impact, etc. vs evaluating the size of companies from previous experiences*
13. *We do not prioritize one University over another.*
14. *recruiters will look at your application holistically so they will review across your resume and transcript vs anchoring on just one.*

Not formatted: Paraphrased answer from the presenters;

1. Recruiters look for data structures and algorithms courses. Recommended to list these courses on your resume if you taken them. If you've taken a course/s that covered that covered this content, but wasn't named ""Data Structures"" or ""Algorithms"", write the corresponding subject in paratheses. For example: ""Intermediate Computer Science"" (Data Structures).
2. Links to GitHub are recommended and personal websites are nice. The non-technical recruiters said that they love personal websites since they're easier to understand.
3. Let your recruiter know if you're at the final stages of interviewing at another company, or received an offer.
4. During the 40-45 minutes long technical interview, you can expect 1-3 questions. The first five minutes will be for introductions and the final five will be for questions.
5. One SWE Recommended the cracking the code interview book and to practice LeetCode.
6. Common missteps of interviewees:
   1. Not asking questions about the problem for your interview, ask for clarity if it’s needed. Make sure to demonstrate how you got from A to B. If you get stuck, think of the problem's base case/s, then build back up (important for recursion and DP problems). Don't forget to think about the edge cases.
   2. Framework for solving problem:
      1. Clarify question
      2. Design a solution
      3. Write your code
      4. Test/explain your code
   3. It completely ok to start with a brute force solution and then build upon it.
   4. Make sure to talk about performance and big O notation
   5. Leave enough time to walk the interviewer through your solution, and explain the expected output.
7. It’s important to tailor your resume to the application. When detailing your previous experiences, use the star format.
8. Being a TA in a Data Structures or Algorithms course is a great experience.",2024-03-28 01:56:04
1bm649d,International Student's Journey: From Nearly Giving Up to Landing a Potential Internship,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share my recent experience as an international student pursuing my master's degree in the USA. After months of relentless job applications, rejections, and moments of almost giving up, I finally received some positive news last week.

I've been actively applying for internships since September 23rd, hoping to secure a position before my final semester this fall. However, despite numerous applications (almost 800 jobs), I faced a series of disappointments, from ghosting to rejection after initial rounds.

Just when I was about to lower my frequency of applications due to the discouraging outcomes, I received an unexpected email last Tuesday. It was from a company I had applied to in the same city where I'm studying. The recruiter informed me that I had been matched with the company and requested a 20-minute telephone interview.

The interview went exceptionally well. The recruiter thoroughly discussed the job requirements, delved into my resume, and inquired about projects I've worked on. Interestingly, their tech stack includes PHP, and my experience with PHP during my bachelor's in India caught their attention. I received positive feedback during the interview, and the recruiter mentioned that she would pass my details to the manager for further review.

Two days later, after sending a follow-up email, I learned that the manager wanted to proceed to the next round. This next round consists of a 1 hour 40 minutes coding session and 20 minutes of Q&A and behavioral assessment.

Here's where I need some guidance from this wonderful community. With my finals approaching, I haven't had enough time to prepare adequately for this crucial interview. I have three days until my second round, and I want to make sure I give my best shot.

Any tips, advice, or strategies on how I should approach this final preparation would be immensely appreciated. Thank you all in advance for your support and valuable insights!",2024-03-23 23:22:08
1blfa4y,Need Advice on Summer 2024 Internships,"Hey everyone!

So I am in a very fortunate place given the current market, but I wanted some advice. I am a master's student studying computer science and specializing in machine learning (aren't we all). Before this, I worked as an academic researcher doing computer vision and other cool ML stuff for around 2 years.

After \~250 applications over the last few months, I got 2 internship offers that I am very excited about! The first is at CVS Health as a data science intern, and the second is at Apple as an apple music operations intern. The first role is more technical and probably what one would expect to do after a CS degree, but the second is more of a program manager role, where I'm not sure how much I will code. From the interviews, I think they need someone to act as a voice of the engineering team to product managers.

I want to know what is good for my career in the long run, because while I enjoy coding, I am not sure if I would like to do that 10 years from now- I would want to move into something more managerial.

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!!",2024-03-23 00:46:53

1bnqlq5,Formal Languages and Computability is the worst class I've ever taken. (Rant),"I am a junior in the computer science major in university. I have a 3.7 overall GPA and a 3.5 major GPA. I've been accepted into early grad school and am very blessed to have been able to get where I am. For every class I've ever taken, no matter how difficult it was, I could always push through to a good grade.

But this class, Formal Languages and Computability, is perhaps the worst time I've ever had in a class. I nearly failed the first test and the tests are 70% of our grade. The teacher reads off powerpoints in a thick accent that I cannot understand even when I sit next to him and ask questions. New information seems to be brought into existence mid-problem without any explanation. Basic ideas are obfuscated by obscure mathematical notation. I spend hours on one problem in an attempt to better understand the content and never feel like I get anywhere. I have never tried so hard to pass a class and not felt like I made any progress.

One of the worst parts is that I was supposed to have an amazing professor for the class, one that many say is the best in the department. But he got switched, and now I am stuck with a professor that everyone hates because of his lack of teaching. I have yet to have been told how this is applicable to the major I am studying, how regex is ever worth using over basic, non-complicated notation, or why I am needing to understand all of the content. I 100% know that it must be necessary for something, I don't doubt that, but my teacher has never said a thing about it.

Most of all, I am disappointed in myself. I felt that I was good at taking initiative and understanding content. I had what everyone, teachers and students, claim is the hardest instructor in the whole department for data structures and algorithms last semester and got an A. But it's over halfway through the semester and I don't feel like I can get this. I've never believed in saying ""just get by"" for a class, as I feel like that's how losers think. I do not know what else to do.

Anyways, sorry for the rant. I just needed this off my chest. This class may be the reason I am kicked from grad school and I just want to be a good steward of what I am given, but it feels like the odds are stacked against me.",2024-03-25 22:06:05

1bluxc0,Is a bird in the hand really worth two in the bush?,"Hi. I am in a bit of a tough situation, and am curious what others think/would do.

Currently I am in between returning to Chevron in Houston as an AI/MLE intern, and going to Amazon in Seattle as an SDE intern. I interned at Chevron last summer and really enjoyed the area and the company culture, and the WLB was amazing. I made a lot of connections in and out the office and built a support system. So much so, I was able to get a return offer as an AI intern under the head of AI operations at Chevron (which is normally exclusive to grad students). This route would likely result in me receiving a full time offer.

On the other hand, my Amazon offer would pay (way) more than double what I would get at Chevron, and I think having Amazon on the resume would open more doors for me in the long run and I think I’ll grow more as a SWE. The risk is that I don’t know anything about what team I’ll be placed on, nor do I know anything/anyone in Seattle, and I’ve heard experiences vary HEAVILY based on the team they are assigned to, and almost across the board I hear bad things about the WLB of SDEs at Amazon. Not to mention I think receiving a full-time offer will be a lot harder here than at Chevron. I am also Black and the black population in Seattle is ~6% and I do not plan on staying in Washington past this summer. Any advice? I’d really appreciate it, and I’m willing to to answer any questions. (:

1bd2y3s,This might sound unethical to people but hear me out,"Did u guys check out devin ai by cognition labs? Its still in preview but what it does is something we spend so much time on if we have to build literally anything.

It uses a browser, terminal, code editor, etc. our tools basically and keeps iterating to solve a problem given to it, also has capabilities to read blogs articles and stuff, this could be a breaking point for many people pursuing a CS degree. Computers are incredibly efficient at doing anything if they pull this off successfully even in the next decade its scary.

There was a time in the last century where light bulbs had become so evolved they could last forever, many companies formed a cartel and reduced the life span of these light bulbs.
Now this particular example was done mainly for profits, but there have been other industries doing planned obsolescence for decades now.

We can make the best thing, but we choose not to so as to maintain jobs, economy, profits and whatnot..

But AI it scares me now i have seen other llms hallucinating and believed that good things like these were atleast a bit far away, but if a AI becomes sufficiently smart enough and has access to tools like Devin AI does it could become a near perfect creation which could cause this entire industry to change forever.

There are a very few things developers can do anything to stop corporates from reading our code or scraping our websites. You could add anti bot protections and what not but if ur page can get read by a web crawler someone might as well feed it whole to his Enterprise AI  Model.

Other industries still follow practices like planned obsolescence so why can't we??

We should also take active steps to add characters, implement a technique so we can self poison our data(by adding keywords and stuff)so that when a llm reads it will hallucinate horribly but its hidden from a normal user and doesn't change the resource much.

This has good ramifications, these so called Enterprise models have to manually sift through terabytes of data to avoid major hallucinations if they irresponsibility use data to train on without the authors explicit permission, nobody yet knows how to completely avoid these backdoor attacks, etc..

I think we also have a right to think about ourselves.

Tbh, didn't even want to take cs but didn't have any say.

Now, slowly I started to develop interest although I struggle a lot in the courses, I try. The people in my course are the cream of the crop in the country, so obviously relative grading got me good.

But now all the people around me are studying stuff like ML and data science. My friend here one day says he is taking up a ML course and another day he is studying data science. Virtually 70% of people I meet are saying something about DS/AI.

I am just feeling I am lagging behind, I am lacking. I have learnt peanuts compared to them. I know I shouldn't think about what others are doing but coupled with other things in college life, this is weighing on me.

Please advise me on anything, to improve.

1bbwrln,"Mechanical Engineer transitioned to CS, should I go back to engineering?"," 

So I graduated university with a Mechanical Engineering degree 2 years ago. I got a job right after as a designer at a small manufacturing company. I did not like my job at all, the hours were long the work wasnt particularily interesting or as innovative as I was hoping. Just basic AutoCAD & Solidworks design for the machine job that made our products. Anyways, after a year I was let go, I didnt like the job and it was starting to show in my performance. Before I was let go I was looking into coding and picking up a few lessons that I did in first year intro to programming. I really liked it, decided when I was let go from my job why not take this opportunity to go back to school. There was a online program at a local university where already existing university graduates could go back to school to get a 2nd accelerated 1 year (3 semesters) degree in comp sci. Im currently in my 3rd semester. About to finish my program. And it seems like the job market is so bad I may as well go back to being an engineer.

I've applied to about 50 positions, i've made a solid resume showcasing my strengths, languages frameworks databases etc. I have a few personal projects that im working on and a few projects that I can showcase through my coursework. I have yet to get even a single interview. I have no work experience with coding and I did an accelerated degree at a fairly low tier school. I feel like my chances of getting a job are slim to none. I'm planning on putting my full time effort into applying once I officially graduate but as of now i'm considering looking for another engineering job for maybe a year whilst working on a few side projects to bolster my portfolio and hope maybe in a years time the job market isnt as ruthless.

A CS related job is what I want to do. As the work is what I enjoy doing. But right now that just doesn't seem like a reasonable option. Any thoughts or ideas of what I should do in my position?",2024-03-11 06:34:52

Been seeing a lot of cracked resumes around here lately. You've seen them, FAANG internships and plenty of side projects. It would be pretty discouraging for me if I were applying to internships and thinking there would be no chance for me because my resume sucks. But that isn't entirely true. Here’s my resume that got me an internship at a household  name F500 company, and from that I also got a FT return offer.  
[https://imgur.com/a/HvIzy58](https://imgur.com/a/HvIzy58)

It’s bad. There's a lot of fluff because I did not have ANY professional experience or side projects. And yet at the time I was fortunate enough to get 5 interviews in 37 applications, 2 from career fairs, the rest from Handshake (an online job board). My only offer was from Handshake.  
I can definitely see how doing side projects, having internships to get other internships, and work experience can improve your chances. But also, it’s not completely over if you don’t have those things. Plenty of CS students don't have those things. It's equally important to practice your soft skills and know how to market yourself in interviews. I know the job market is rough, but don't give up and keep looking, all it takes is for  you to get lucky once! Just make sure that you are actually prepared when the opportunity does come up.

1bq7rhm,Microsoft NYC corporate housing for interns (Summer 2024),"Hi all!

Is anyone familiar with Microsoft corporate housing for interns in **NYC**? I've got a Microsoft Research internship in NYC this summer for 3 months, and I'm stuck between opting for corporate housing or taking a $10,000 allowance (taxed). Most advice on the internet is about Redmond and Seattle, but there's little info about New York.

I am most interested in the following.

1. **Location:** How far can the corporate housing options get from the main office? I don't drive and don't want to bike in Manhattan.
2. **Facilities:** Will there be at least a small fridge and stovetop? I was told not to expect a full kitchen, but I can't imagine living on take-out for 3 months, it's insane.
3. **Community:** Do they usually house Microsoft interns together, or is it random? Given that the housing is outsourced to some company called 3Sixty, they likely would be managing interns from many other companies. I'm curious about the social aspect and whether I'll be in proximity to fellow interns.

Also, if you've stayed in Microsoft's corporate housing in NYC before, how was it? Any major issues? Notable perks? Given the choice again, would you stick with corporate housing or take the allowance?

Thanks for any help!

I am a 2nd year Computer Science and Engineering student at UCI. It took me many years of doing nothing w/ my life to realize that I want to take my life and career more seriously. However, my 2nd quarter (of 3 quarter system) has ended and as I approach the next quarter, I feel that I am incredibly behind compared to my peers. I want to get into research for spring quarter to get some experience, but it's unlikely that I will get one since I should've ideally started the searching process weeks ago.

I want to get an internship during my junior year (and if not delusional, this year's summer LOL), but entering internship hunting season, I have absolutely no technical experience to make myself an appealing, competitive applicant.

1bdgzsl,Please network more!,"I'm currently a junior, and I've been on this sub since my freshman year of college. Since last summer, I've seen so many people who have 1000+ applications not get a single offer, and as a result, people believe there is no future for them in CS.   


I know the market is extremely unforgiving right now, and cold applying doesn't help your case, especially if you have no experience. I personally believe that networking is the easiest way to land your first internship/job. Reaching out to recruiters through LinkedIn or Handshake (if your school has that) is extremely effective. Also, cold messaging multiple engineers (I'm talking 30+. to even get a message back) at a company to set up a coffee chat is an easy way to get yourself a contact and a potential referral. You could also leverage this meeting as a chance to look over your resume and receive input on it. 

I'm making this post because networking helped me land both my internships and allowed me to achieve multiple offers in both my sophomore and junior years. If anyone is curious, I worked at a Fortune 50 Insurance company my sophomore year and will be at a Big Bank this summer. I wanted to remind everyone that it's not hopeless and that you just have to learn to play to your strengths. I'm good at talking to people and building connections, but my technical prowess is ok, so I made a conscious effort to network as much as I could.

I had a SWE internship freshman-sophomore year, and a less technical architecture role junior year. I feel like I’m a goner for my last summer before I graduate.

1b97jyk,Hello All Cs Majors,"Hello Everyone of the sub, I am a current CS Major, and I do read this sub a lot. So I am here to just here to ask people in cs related jobs and students how they feel. Not about the job market, or if your school is good, but rather more mellow questions. I feel almost everywhere (within this sub and other social mediums) there is a constant pessimistic and loud echo chamber that is very daunting to read every single day. So Id like to use this post as a way to spread positivity and calm the masses.

CS Workforce:
- How has life post graduating been?
- How do you feel your  school is compared to the workforce?
- Is this workforce as scary and intimidating as you imagined it whole in school?
- What study habits have you developed since being employed?
- Tips for dealing with stress or other factors when transitioning to the work force?
- If you could have gone back into school as a CS major, what things were you proud of (achievements, accomplishments, events you atteneded etc), and what things would you wanted to have done differently (priorities).
- If you had to give one piece of advice to current graduates and soon to be graduates, what would you like them to know that you wish had been told to you.

Current Majors:
- What sort of things do you feel proud about (grades, career fairs, projects)?
- What habits have helped you learn and succeed in your classes
- What opportunities are you looking forward to?
- Do you try ignore the negative stigmas of the CS career, and if so how do you deal with it?
- Do you feel confident in your ability to transition into the workforce?
- If you had to give advice to incoming freshman and current highschoolers, what kind of uplifting things would you tell them?

All in all, I believe that we as a subreddit have all struggled and experienced the highs and lows of Computer Science. If we werent so quick to seek out negativity, I genuinely believe we can change this negative notion of CS. We are a group of people who are all trying to become successful and achieve our goals, so why don’t we aid in others journeys as well. I personally would love to hear what everyone has to say, because something like this isnt black and white, there are millions of different point of views and notions we all have.",2024-03-07 22:31:54
1bs3wme,Should I take the co-op,"I was recently offered a 3.25 month co-op out of state by GE Aerospace. Here's my backstory:

\-Sophomore

\-Would have to break lease since I am off campus (1550 fee, repay month I got for free) and get storage for furniture as well as find short term housing at co-op.

I have taken Intro to Python and taking OOP and Discrete during the summer while self studying dsa.

\- Was planning on taking DSA in fall before receiving offer. ( May be able to take online )

\- One IT position and currently transfer student at state school.

\- 24.50 a week/250 weekly stipend

\- Built good connection with other recruiter (alumni) and was already guaranteed interview for 2025 role

I've asked around for advice and everyone is telling me go for it with the exception of my mom so this feels like a no-brainer but would like outside advice. Would you guys recommend DSA online during co-op or wait until spring junior year for in person? And would this be worth going for despite having to move and push back graduation a semester as well as DSA possibly ( was originally going to graduate early)?

1bn5amy,Very demotivated student,"As a CS major (Sophomore) I had to take a computer organization class for my degree. I passed it with a B, which was surprisingly well for me. I decided to take the second class because I thought it would be similar, and while the concepts are alike, I couldn’t have been further from the truth.

I hate this class with a passion. I go to class to look at some bare bones slides of images that were ripped straight out of my textbook with ZERO explanation on how things work. My instructor doesn’t do notes and just talks as if I’m already supposed to know everything. I’ve learned nothing from attending these lectures and instead have to go home and study all day just to try and put the pieces together.

Every test I’ve taken so far, I’ve bombed. The average test score is around a 60% which is what I would usually get, but even so, that is awful. I just don’t get how I can go to class everyday and have to listen to this teacher preach about god knows what, just for me to inevitably fail at everything I’ve tried to do.

And what’s really got me worked up is this project she assigned us. It was worth as much as a test grade, so I wanted to do well on it. I worked on it every single day for over a week, asked her questions, went to Reddit/ dicord for help, and at the end of the day, I really thought I succeeded. I get my project graded a week later and I don’t even get a 50% on it.

I don’t want to give up on comp sci, but this class has made me hate my life. Should I even attend classes anymore? At this point I’m just trying to hang on until the end, but I don’t even know if I can manage that.

In 2022, I realized sales is not my calling, so I transitioned back to CS by doing a free bootcamp, where I learned a lot, made 2 full stack projects that I was passionate about, and even did paid a paid freelance gig by developing a website for a client.

Although, I acquired all the skills and knowledge to be job ready, the market timing was unfortunate for me, and I haven't been able to land a job despite all my efforts in job search. I was contemplating to do Masters, but when I sent my scores to WES, they evaluated my scores, and my GPA came out to be 2.37, which is extremely low. So to raise my GPA above 3.0, I would have to take several courses at community college before applying for Masters in CS. But I am afraid the amount of effort and time I will be putting in to finally graduate would be too much. I really don't think I have that much motivation to study for another 3 to 4 years.

1bit89w,"(Autistic) Comp sci lack of motivation + Constant irritation
","
Hey everybody,

Last year or so I made a post about depression and being stuck in a rut during university (find it on my reddit username page). Good news is that I'm in my last semester and will graduate in the spring time. Yeah for me. But this had been one of the lowest points of my year. I don't have much of a goal or aspirations outside finishing school besides getting a job and moving out from my parents. But even that is over whelming and causes me much anxiety due to fear of rejection and thinking that there's so much to do just to even get a job is so much for me that O get tired and unmotivated before I even begin. My Dad says I lack drive and I don't try which I think he is partially right about that but most of my Trying is based off of fighting my own depression and anxiety on a day to day basis. I sleep in late as that's the only thing I enjoy and it causes me the least stress. I also watch intense movies as that helps with distractions.

It's just my main problem is being passionate again in comp sci and doing something to move me forward. I still feel stuck in a rut.

MOST IMPORTANT: I have constsnt irritation and ocd like tendencies like intense intrusive thoughts. They plagued me me all day and small things can cause big devastating feelings for me which really bothers to no end. Like just recently I was scrolling through Instagram and saw an old post from my follower and accidentally liked it. I quickly unlike it but now I feel embarrassed and stupid and the damages are done and it'll ruin me. I also wash my hands obsessively which leads them to dry out and have cracks and cuts from the cleaning. If I touch my ears I get irritation so much I must wash my hands. If I spill something or make a mistake I make such a big fuss in my head that I can't take it anymore.

I can't even go on car rides as I get ocd thoughts of grabbing the wheel and crashing the car or just jumping out and hopefully be run over.

1bio99p,What is a CS Degree? SWE Perspective,"Howdy everyone. I just wanted to pop in and share some thoughts and advice from the perspective of a ’21 grad, mid-level SWE. 

First I see a lot of doom and gloom surrounding the rise of AI/ML tools. Writ large, our world is changing rapidly along with how we do our jobs and what our responsibilities are. I want to share something I believe to be true of our field: we are not programmers. We are computer scientists. We are problem solvers. What we do as engineers, is take in a set of requirements, interpret them in the broader context of our technical architecture, company bureaucracy, customer demands, relevant legal frameworks, etc. Then design and implement a cost-effective solution. Those without a CS degree will have an extremely difficult time doing this, especially given that the prompts you’ll need to do your job are steeped in the language of computer science and require an understanding of the code output. 

Another thing - if you aren’t able to get an internship, c’est la vie. I supplemented my resume with technical clubs (software person on the engineering team most of the time) and volunteer work (tutoring CS to K-12 at a local library, working at hackathons). What matters (as someone who reviews resumes) is that you have something useful in there. All I want to know is - do you know the technologies I’m hiring for? Do you have problem solving skills?

Finally, your first job out of University does not need to be an SWE role. I started as a “support engineer” at a tiny company doing tech support for industrial equipment. My CS experience was EXTREMELY helpful in this field, and it helped develop a lot of corporate soft skills I was lacking. You are not wasting your time with a CS degree. You’re learning abstract problem solving skills which will serve you well wherever you end up. 

I hope this is helpful and/or motivating to y’all. Best of luck! :)",2024-03-19 16:21:26

2: technical writer intern, not so well known but its a software company, local, $30/hr

i already accepted an offer for internship 1 a couple months ago but i just got an offer for internship 2 today. the thing that has me reconsidering is that 2's company has pretty good swe & other full time tech positions, its closer to family, but the intern position isnt really software focused. im thinking about interning there just to have that connection and maybe apply to be a swe afterwards (idk if having worked there would up my chances a lot), plus its close to family.

on the otherhand, for internship 1 the experience of being out of state and meeting new ppl/being in a new area for a bit sounds cool, and the position is more tech focused.

However, it is in a location where I don't want to be post-grad and I feel like I would not learn a lot, as it is not a tech-focused company.  
I am considering a re-recruit for the following reasons:  
\- I will be more prepared for interviews compared to last cycle where I messed up a few big ones  
\- hopefully the economy will be better? (idk lol)  
\- My resume will be stronger compared to my resume last year, so I can hopefully get more interviews

\- I heard that getting an internship --> return offer is a lot easier than trying to land a new grad role directly

My main concern is if it looks bad to graduate a semester later to employers, and how the new grad job hunt works if I can't get a summer 2025 internship. Although it is somewhat unimportant in the grand scheme of things, it would suck to not be able to graduate with my friends.

I have not had an internship yet, I have applied to around 90 internships so far, even messaged recruiters and engineering on LinkedIn after and have only received an OA from TikTok (did not go amazing). That's it. I have only been consistently applying to internships starting at the end of January.

I have attended multiple hackathons, career fairs, & have a solid group of projects that are not very basic on my resume. I think what is holding me back is not having an internship already which seems to be a requirement to get a first internship nowadays.

1bn5pl0,Title: Is a Bachelor's Degree (in Computer Science or Otherwise) Essential for Entry-Level Software Engineering Jobs Today?,"**Abstract:**

Historically, software engineering/coding bootcamps have been touted as viable alternatives to a traditional computer science bachelor's degree. Yet, the conversation has seldom explored the necessity of having any college degree at all for entering the field. For example, would a bootcamp graduate with no degree at all have a comparable chance of employment as a bootcamp graduate with a Bachelor's degree in an unrelated field? With [shifts](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1bmm97t/my_company_just_decided_to_stop_hiring_self/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in the current job market, the debate seems to intensify: Is a CS degree now a critical requirement? This poll aims to discriminate between the differing options in the context of the current job market. Anecdotes and data-backed opinions are highly welcomed in the comments.

**Scope / Assumptions:**

Please assume candidates for entry-level software engineering positions in the 2024 U.S. market, without any prior related work experience. Here, ""Essential"" is defined as significantly influencing a candidate's chances of securing a job within 6 to 12 months of graduating / initiating a job search, assuming diligent preparation in relevant skills - including mastery of data structures and algorithms /. LeetCode problems, resume building, and soft skills development. Comments on the relevance of apprenticeships or internships are also appreciated.

That said, I know CS majors need to make personal projects, perform in hackathons, are more if they want to stand a chance in such a competitive field. But since I'm not remotely passionate about the subject and can't see myself doing any of those things in my spare time, I wonder if it's counter intuitive for me to even consider majoring in CS to begin with.

For those still doing their degree, take the non-faang internship, gain experience, you won't suffer, it won't be the cash grab you imagined but it's still very good. No matter how many new ""AI that will replace SE"" come in, as long as you're doing your job, you won't be replaced. There's still factory workers even though those jobs are redundant and replaceable.

1bedv34,2030: Knowledge Breadth vs Depth,"With all the exponentially improving AI systems and sub-systems, we are entering interesting times which undoubtly will introduce significant changes to what skills are required. 

However, noone knows exactly which skills will be replaced/automated to what extent and when exactly.

2030 Scenario Summary:

* AI's Expanding Role: AI agents will become commonplace in most knowledge-based jobs by 2030.

* Human-AI Collaboration: Humans will focus on communication, supervision, and quality control of AI-generated work.

* Economic Uncertainty: The impact on the size of the workforce is unclear – more workers or fewer might be needed.

* Adaptability is Key: The pace of technological change suggests adaptability will be crucial. This might favor those with broader skillsets and comfort navigating shifting environments.


Based on those insights, maybe the BS + MS and/or BS + MS + PhD path may become less popular over the next decade and more people may go the BS + BS or even BS + BS + BS path.

Focusing on specific areas may become increasingly risky and having broad foundational knowledge in a set of fields (let’s say biology + economics + computer science) may set oneself up for a better future in 2030. 

AI and automation handle more specialized tasks, leaving humans to manage more complex, creative, and cross-disciplinary challenges.

Thoughts?

1bbitxm,Confused!! Seeking Advice for Enhancing Profile for Internship/Full-Time Positions,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently in my second semester pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering in the US and will be graduating in May 25. I'm feeling a bit uncertain about my profile and prospects for landing internships or full-time positions in the future. My profile lacks substantial projects, with only basic ones under my belt. Prior to starting my Master's in fall '23, I worked for a year in testing after completing my bachelor's and then took a year off before starting my current program.

I wanna focus on SDE roles in the future.

I'm seeking guidance on what's required to secure internships or full-time roles, particularly in terms of projects and skills like LeetCode. I'm comfortable with C++, having taken a course in it during my first semester, but I'm open to learning new languages.

Here are my specific questions and concerns:

Project Selection: I've noticed that many students around me and professionals on LinkedIn have a plethora of projects listed on their resumes. How do you decide which projects to undertake? It seems like many people recreate existing projects found online. Is this approach acceptable, and would it still be considered a legitimate project? I used to believe that original projects were necessary, but if recreating existing ones is common practice, I'm willing to go that route.

Types of Projects: What types of projects are considered good or impressive? I'm unsure of where to start in terms of using various technologies and languages. Are there specific types of projects that stand out to potential employers?

Learning New Languages: I'm willing to learn a new language, but I'm unsure which one to choose or where to begin. What languages do you recommend for someone with a background in C++, and what resources would you suggest for learning them effectively?

I appreciate any advice or insights you can offer. Thank you!",2024-03-10 19:35:06

1b7yozn,2024 Nontraditional Internship Search,"These are my results for the 2024 internship search.

A bit about my background, so you will get why I call this search nontraditional. I originally didn't want to go to college and I just wanted to be a freelance developer using the programming skills I picked up in middle/high school. That wasn't really an option in my Chinese family, so I just decided to speedrun school to compensate. I arranged my credits so that I graduated high school a year early, then I moved my college graduation date forward by 2 years through AP credit and CompSci community college credits. So technically I'm in my first year of college but I just applied as a 2025 grad.

Since I was new to internship hunting, it took a while to get a hold of the ropes. The first lesson I learned was that applying on LinkedIn had a really low hit rate, and the recruiters seem to read resumes submitted on Handshake way more often. So I just spammed every new application on Handshake, and my hit rate on there was a solid 10% whereas on LinkedIn it was much lower. I also learned how to interview and network on the fly, at the expense of fumbling the second round at my top-choice company. Eventually everything paid off and I landed with a few offers. I'll be interning at a F500 non-tech company this summer.

The main thing that made me pick tech over any other field is the degree of freedom that developers are given. The only entry credential that you need is a bachelor's degree, and there's less bureaucracy compared to other fields and more opportunities for remote/hybrid work. My parents both stayed in school until their late 20s, and while that had its benefits, to me that's not a very free way to live. I wonder if freedom was a big motivation for others to enter tech as well.

1b5soq8,Syntax and confidence while coding vs. Logic in FAANG internship Interviews,"I recently had a final internship interview, and I'd love to get some feedback on how it went. I've been mostly using C and C++ at my school, but I've been practicing Leetcode problems with Python. During the interview, I encountered some difficulties with Python syntax, and I'm wondering how much that could impact my chances in a FAANG interview.

Here's a rundown of what happened:

1. **Function instead of a method:** When asked to ""write a method that"", I  struggled because I was thinking in terms of classes instead of functions, but not have much experience with OOP. I choked a little because I couldn't remember how to define a class in Python but later on figured out the interviewer just wanted a function with def.
2. **Test Case Implementation**: When asked for test cases, I used print() statements instead of asserts, which the interviewer corrected. Additionally, I provided test cases within comments rather than executing them properly.
3. **Logic Errors**: Despite catching some logic errors myself during the interview, there were still instances where I struggled with the logic of the problem.

How heavily do FAANG interviews weigh syntax and smooth coding ability versus logical problem-solving skills? Did my syntax errors significantly impact my performance, or is it more about demonstrating a strong understanding of algorithms and problem-solving techniques? First interviewer was a manager of 4 teams (which was behavioral and he liked me), and this one was with one of 4 managers that I will be placed in, an internship mentor/manager).

Or, is it only possible to get an only one of them. (Like getting rejection for interview, but getting cfg invitation or vice-versa).

I know cfg is separated application for software engineering internship (so need to apply with separated application) but just 1 HackerRank result will be shared both cfg and internship applications. 

As I know, unlike full-time position, I've heard that code for goods is final round interview for internship.

1bqydwt,How to not be dumb in interviews,"hello all

I had my first technical interview this week and completely bombed it. Everything went great, I talked about my projects and overall vibed with the interview until they sent me an lc problem. I have been leetcoding for a while and have gotten quite good at solving medium and some hard questions. I feel comfortable with questions on dp, sorting algs, trees, data structures, recursion and what not. 

The problem they sent me however was marked easy. I started doing it, overcomplicated it and didn't even get to test it since I ran out of time (i only had 15 mins). The interviewer even had to step in and start asking me about runtime and basically telling me my approach was wrong. When I looked at the problem after my interview I realized how to fix my approach and finished the problem with no sweat. I honestly don't know what happened and hate myself for bombing so hard during the interview. 

This was the only interview I got this round and I honestly can't stop hating myself for screwing it up so hard. Does anyone have any advice on how to not bomb under pressure?",2024-03-29 20:12:48

The Team overview was cancelled, they said they’ll do it if the team decides to move forward with me.

Job history - first half went pretty well. Second half a coding question was asked and I didn’t do really well. The interviewer said “Today didn’t really go well, it’s okay best of luck for your future interviews.” 

Post that interview round, I got an email from them saying that they will reschedule the technical interview 2 and Team overview interview to some other day if the team decides to move forward with me.

**About me**:

* 3rd year (5-year program) in a fairly average school trying to target quant-dev for Summer 2025.
* 5 internships: Backend role (unicorn), 3 ML Eng roles (Major bank, F500, major cybersec. company), and one data eng. role (analytics startup)
* My roles consisted of cloud enigineering, data pipelines, model orchestration, and DevOps (Go, Spark, Databricks, Pytorch/TF, Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, bash). My C++ exp is limited to formula-SAE programming and class projects.

I spoke to some Junior Quant dev friends who mentioned a lot of these companies hire for infra roles, data engineers, ML engineers, etc. that I should consider targeting. I don't understand what the landscape is for roles like these across different types of firms (HFT vs prop. vs hedge funds).

**Questions**:

1. Which of the quant firms hire those roles? What do they look for in a candidate? And how does it vary company-to-company? Is it just the same as regular infra/dev-ops people in tech companies?
2. If so\^, what are the most worthwhile action items to take right now?
3. Aside from that, is it worth it to go full-send on C++/OS learning to try to crack into some of those more common roles?

1bm9mfx,"Bio Major + Data Science minor, can't find job, can I do SWE long term?"," Hello! As the title suggests, I'm a recent grad having trouble finding work in tech. I recently graduated from Stanford with a BS in Bio and a minor in Data Science.

When I decided on this degree combination, I was told by all my friends (in FAANG), that as long as I knew what I was doing coding wise and could pass interviews, I could get into a SWE role (obviously easier said than done, but I was under the impression that my degree wouldn't be an issue in and of itself for landing SWE roles, especially being from Stanford).

The minor in data science got me machine learning skills (python, pandas, sql, etc), and CS wise, I took intro CS, as well as Data Structures, and I fully self-studied/audited upper div CS courses like operating systems (my university's courses) . In this process, I learned Python, Java, C, and Go, and got a ton of experience with data analytics, not to mention tons of really useful class projects for my resume.

In terms of internships, I got a role as a data analyst at a startup (not a notable one, but it let me use all of my skills and got me something on my resume). My plan was to get a job as a data analyst and pivot into SWE at some later point. From what it sounded like, I was gonna be fine, I even personally knew people with JUST bio degrees who became SWEs in the long term. Currently also interning as a Data Analyst.

Now this market has been rough, I've applied exclusively to data analysts jobs, and have gotten a few interviews (after dozens of applications), but nothing came of them. I'm starting to read more online that to get into SWE recruiters are going to start soft requiring a CS degree and that I'm cooked.

I want to get a masters in SWE and/or CS but I feel like that's gonna be difficult, as, to be honest, I did really poorly in my undergraduate coursework. This wasn't due to difficulty, but I just didn't have the time or discipline to do my coursework. Additionally, I had tons of family and financial issues during this period that made me receive non-passing grades in multiple classes, a lot were in technical/CS coursework. I didn't think it would impact job hunting, as tbh nobody has ever once asked me or anybody I know for a transcript, but in order to get a masters I don't know what I'm gonna have to do. I know there are online masters programs at top schools I could enroll in that are traditionally much easier to get into, but am I still able to do that given my non-passing grades? I have a 3.0 btw.

Pretty much, I'm here because I'd love some more insight on what I can do moving forward, what jobs can I realistically land, are data analyst roles still on the table? Can I pivot to SWE from there without a masters? If I can, will I still be able to get into a masters in SWE program given my grades? I just took the GRE recently and got a 333 total, 167 quant, 166 verbal, which I'm very happy about but don't know if will make a difference.

1bh8w2o,AI/ML PhD: Is it Worth the Investment for My Situation?," I'm torn between pursuing a PhD or not. Currently, I've been accepted into a master's program at a top 10 university in the UK. After completing my master's, I'm considering pursuing a PhD in the US, but I'm really struggling to make a decision. I've read various opinions on Reddit about doing a PhD in AI/ML, but it's left me confused. Some people argue it's not worth it due to financial reasons, others suggest that a PhD can overqualify you for many jobs, while some claim that certain roles like 'research scientist' or 'ML engineer' typically require a PhD and are well-paid. Here are my reasons for considering a PhD:

&#x200B;

1. Financially, some say a PhD isn't worth it, but I live in an Eastern European country where software developers are paid very little. Pursuing a PhD in STEM, especially in hot topics like AI/ML, could open doors to obtaining a green card. There are visa options that can lead to a green card without needing sponsorship from a company. Since I earn very little here, the opportunity cost of spending 5 years on a PhD may not be as significant for me. It might take me a maximum of 3 years to cover that opportunity cost, and afterward, I could potentially start earning significantly more. Additionally, I believe I have a good chance of securing full funding for a PhD at a top 15-20 colleges in the US.
2. I have a genuine interest in research and AI/ML topics, much more than in building web or mobile products. I find building web or mobile products repetitive and unfulfilling. On the other hand, the idea of conducting research, exploring new ideas, and developing innovative AI/ML algorithms excites me. Alternatively, the prospect of working in academia at a university, conducting my own research alongside a group of young researchers, and being my own boss is very appealing.

Given these reasons, pursuing a PhD seems reasonable to me. However, I have concerns due to what I've read online. Some argue that a PhD can overqualify you for many jobs, and that jobs in research or AI/ML are limited and difficult to obtain. I value the idea of conducting research, but I also need to make a living. While I don't necessarily aim for extravagant salaries, if I can't find a job because of my PhD, it would be a problem. So, what do you guys think? Should I go for it or avoid it? And why? Thanks. ",2024-03-17 21:16:15
1bh3ejl,Apple MLE Intern Interview (Ad Platforms Team),"I just got reached out for the MLE intern position for the Ad Platforms Team, and I was wondering if anyone could give me some details on how the interviews go and tips, from maybe someone who interviewed for this team before. In general, how many rounds are there, are there LC style questions, etc.?

If not, any insights from ppl who interviewed for any team would be super helpful too.

Also, I saw somewhere that MLE position interviews harder, anyone know if there's any truth to this?

1bs1kbh,Majoring in CS next year and need to know what to expect in college and after graduation.,"Hello everyone! 

I am aspiring CS student who has recently been accepted to UCSB and Cal Poly (waitlisted from Berkeley but praying).

I am writing this post to dip my feet into CS community. I want to ask a couple of questions so I am more knowledgeable within this area, be prepared as to what I should expect in the coming years, and what steps I should take to improve/succeed.

1. What should I do my freshman year to succeed in college and in obtaining an internship?

I have only took a beginner CS50 class offered by Harvard online but sadly, for personal reasons, I did not complete it. I did like the class and I plan to continue and finish it this summer before my college freshman year so I can be a bit ahead and have more of a clue on what I should expect. 

2. How do I find internships and prepare for them and what should I expect? 

As of now, I know little to nothing about internships other than it being a pathway that many students In order to find jobs after graduation and gain experience.

3. What are the most important things I should do during college so I can guarantee landing a job with my degree within 3 months or less after graduation. 

I currently just know the basics of excelling in class, gaining experience, find internships, have connections, and having projects but I would like to know what else I can do and what specifically is the best thing I can do.

4. Projects, what kind? 

Projects can mean many different things, I would like to know what types of projects would be the most beneficial for me and my future. Should I collaborate with classmates or should I do them by myself?

Thank you for taking your time to read my post, if you would like to give me any tips and advice that can help me strive for success that is very much appreciated.

1bruvos,"WGU - Software Engineering C#, worth it? Trying to make more $$ and branch out.","  

I've been working as a software developer for 5+ years for a construction company. I work with in-house tools, Appsheet, MySQL, PowerApps, Power Automate, Apps Script, Python, and just about anything else I need for ad-hoc solutions to get a particular task done. I'm a one-person department in a company of a few hundred people. Basic IT needs and enterprise-wide applications are handled by an external IT department, while I handle anything urgent, niche, or complex. I deploy applications, workflows, solutions, etc., for hundreds of people and handle all the support and troubleshooting myself.

I've gone to college before but didn't finish my degree, I probably have about half the credits needed for a bachelors. It was 5+ years ago that I last attended, so maybe even less will transfer now. I stopped attending due to time constraints and costs. 

I'm severely underpaid for what I currently do (less than 75k USD yearly), and given my lack of a degree and lack of experience working within a larger team of software developers I've been unable to break into the job market in a more traditional coding or software development role. Given that I'm a one-man operation, and for a construction company no-less, my organization doesn't feel any sort of pressure to pay me what I'm worth or even truly understand what my job entails. I report directly to the leadership of the company, I don't have anyone in an IT capacity that could be my advocate.

I've already beaten the dead horse to death many times over trying to resolve this within my company, so I need to find a way to change my situation.

I'm currently looking at WGU for software engineering because it appears to be the most relevant to what I currently do and seems to be the easiest to get through. I'm still quite busy and time/effort/cost spent is a huge factor.

If you've made it this far, I appreciate you. Here are my final clarifications and questions.

I have 10+ years in IT

5+ years in industrial construction management, 10+ years in the construction industry

5+ years in software development

Will getting a B.S. in Software Engineering be worth the time and effort to try and break into the industry at large? Or, at best, will I just (potentially) be giving myself some more bargaining power with my current company?

At the end of the day I love the type of work that I do, I just want to be paid a fair wage based on my experience and level of expertise. Right now I'm fairly confident that I'm getting railroaded and my salary has been the same for several years. With inflation especially, I need to focus on bringing my salary up.

I'm in the US. ",2024-03-30 22:53:57

1bqv94k,JP Morgan Quant associate intern vs Veeva Systems SDE Intern," Hi everyone,   


I'm currently a MSCS student and received offers from JPMC and Veeva systems for summer internship. Salary details given below.   


Keeping salary aside, I've already worked at Morgan Stanley for few years and don't like going back to banking sector, but I'm pretty sure that JPMC will give me return offer.   


On the other side, Veeva systems looks like a decent company and pay is good for full time(although intern pay is peanuts).  My long term goal is to get into faang so veeva seems like a decent starting place, and also since I have Morgan Stanley on my profile I feel like adding JPMC might not add that much value compared to a tech company like Veeva.  


Also my role at JPMC is of a Quant and I don't think they get paid enough for their work life balance. form what I heard 4-5 yeas of experience will get you a base of around 150k in NYC whereas you can get up till 200k in Veeva or 300k in other tech companies.    


Let me know what you guys think, as of now I'm leaning towards Veeva because I care more about full time pay rather than intern pay.  


Offers: 

**Veeva Systems**   
location: Pleasanton, California   
Intern Pay: $40/hr   
Full time offer: $120 base + 30 stocks + 20 joining  ($170K TC)  


**JPMC**  
location: New York

Intern pay: $72/hr + $3500 relocation

Sorry, a bit long post ahead.

I need advice for forming a plan to get into a big tech company (say Microsoft, Google, Nvidia and similar ones). 

I have a dream (since a long time) to work in a ""big tech"" company. I'm from a developing or a third world country and that just makes it more difficult to get a job at such a company (i think from my little research).

I'm 21 years old, male. Have been working for almost 2 years as a web dev (dotNet, Angular and Sql server). I'd say I have a pretty good grip of the tools and the tech stack i use at work. I'm a nerd and absolutely love to learn new things about tech. I'm in my second semester, doing Bachelors in Computer Science from a well reputed uni (but I'm always learning stuff on my own and am not reliant on university that much).

Now i think that i have to start making a plan and then start to prepare (for applying and the prep for interviews). I know that me being only in the 2nd semester might be a roadblock but I think if I start right now to prepare and learn about the interviews and the hiring processes then I might have a shot at securing a job when i pass out from university.

Could anyone, maybe a former or current employee at such a company or anyone else :) give me some advice or mentorship to point me in the right direction. The learning I'll definitely do on my own and will work hard for it but if someone experienced could please help me in making a plan and could give me helpful tips, that'd be awesome.

I thought I was good enough, but apparently I am not. 

200 job applications, mostly targeting new grad/junior roles, got around 13 OAs, 7 interviews, 1 verbal offer (later told me the role was cancelled), and currently not a place to stay but moving around relatives' homes. 

Maybe I am not in the right mental place for job apps since I do not have a stable home, but the whole process is so draining and tiring as I can now barely hide my jealousness as my friends gradually started to receive job offers. 

I just simply DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY. I prepared for my behavioral questions, I was able to answer most technical questions (besides Tik Tok that shit was hard), and I thought I had a decently good personality, but somehow all I have received were rejections.

I’ve been doing pretty well in my other classes (even math which I usually suck at) but my two compsci classes have been ass.

All in all, I’m very disappointed so far and I feel like I could’ve learned so much more. How was your guys’ first year?

1bow9mj,Should I worry about my concentration?,"So I go to a college that requires you choose a concentration with your computer information systems degree. Either programming, networking, or cybersecurity. Initially I was going to go the cybersecurity route as this is what piques my interest the most, but it also requires the most courses, an extra 3 classes that would force me to take an extra semester. (19 more classes/57 more credits) This wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that I took a gap year and had some trickiness with credit transfer and am itching to graduate already (I should be a graduating senior at this point, technically). Going cybersecurity will put me at another 4 semesters in college, however, looking at the path for networking I could graduate in 3 (16 classes/48 credits) all while not worrying about overloading myself. It has some basic cyber courses, cryptography, intrusion detection systems, digital forensics, with a few basic network classes as well. Anyways, my point being for all of this information, does a concentration in this case really matter if I want to go the cybersecurity route post graduation? I know networking definitely is wrapped up in cyber, but would a hiring manager for a cyber position see my networking concentration and overlook me?

1bolwxl,Getting internship as sophomore who's very behind,"Hi,

I am a 2nd year Computer Science and Engineering student at UCI. It took me many years of doing nothing w/ my life to realize that I want to take my life and career more seriously. However, my 2nd quarter (of 3 quarter system) has ended and as I approach the next quarter, I feel that I am incredibly behind compared to my peers. I want to get into research for spring quarter to get some experience, but it's unlikely that I will get one since I should've ideally started the searching process weeks ago.

I want to get an internship during my junior year (and if not delusional, this year's summer LOL), but when I enter internship hunting season (start of next yr, I believe), I do not have enough technical experience to make myself an appealing, competitive applicant.

What should I do right now? What should I give up on? What should I plan for the future?",2024-03-26 22:55:48

anyways a few of my cs friends and are going through this. some are thinking of switching majors already and this scares me. i had to reevaluate everything and asked myself why do i still want to do this despite all this and when i see individuals who create cool projects that are applicable in the world and do this while contributing with a team of likeminded people it makes me really intrigued to doll want to do something like cs. i follow a lot of cs content on tik tok and often times i’m amazed by what others are able to create and think to myself if i can acquire these skills i can to do these things.  when i see people who attend hackathons i think of how fun and rewarding could that be to do.

In highschool, I messed up in my Physics Chemistry and Maths exams but aced in computer science. I really want to take CS but having second doubts because of my Physics Chemistry and Maths marks. 

And if I decide to not take CS then I don't know what I can do. I might end up doing something else like CA or law or MBA because I really don't have interest in anything else. Not mechanical or electrical. I hate them. 

So my question is should I take CS or do something else. Are core subjects like physics, chemistry and maths required for CS.

1bl6hvo,Wha would you do in this situation?,"TLDR: I really like the company and how they operate, and their offer is extremely generous, but they want me to start before I deliver my thesis and I don't think I could do both things at the same time, plus it's not in the exact field I want. What would you do?

For background I am a Masters CS student finishing his thesis in ML - I have until the last day of May to deliver it and I haven't started writing anything, just pure coding and have not yet evaluated my methods, which should only take around 1 week I think.

I started applying for jobs mainly in ML, which is what I have the most experience in, but have not had much traction mainly because almost all jobs ask for 2-3+ years of experience. I then decided to broaden my search and decided to apply for roles where ML was a ""bonus"".

I managed to land a SWE position this week, but they want me to start in the beginning of April. Turns out almost no project uses ML at all so yeah that sucks, but the offer is very generous - it's the equivalent of a regular 4-5 yoe SWE position in my country (I was extremely lucky and this is honestly more than I deserve, hence why I am considering it, even tho there will almost certainly be no ML).

I talked about the possibility of starting part-time until I finish my degree and they will see if it is possible, but even then, I don't know if I should take it because what I think I enjoy the most would be working on ML and not on traditional SWE stuff - won't this look bad on my CV if in the future I want to do ML related jobs? Most of the jobs I see ask for years of ML experience, not regular SWE experience...

Ideally the interview process would be much longer and I would have a longer time to apply for ML positions (maybe it's too early for non FAANG companies in my country), but their speed caught me by surprise... I have also been told that the company hires all year round, what do you think would happen if I reject the offer? Would I not be able to try and interview with them again? Would I even need to (I already passed their interview process and only rejected the position due to bad timing)? Is there any chance they could put me in a queue and contact me once they need new people?",2024-03-22 18:35:30

Earlier in both of my internships, they wanted to retain me but both the startups that I worked in were very small and didn't have any team also the pay was very low ( $ 24.04 a month in the first start, $ 96.15 a month in the second startup) so I didn't take their offer.

My goal is not to stay in the defense industry so I'm hoping by riding it out and getting this clearance it'll help me in the future. This would be for a new grad role (are there many roles that require TS/SCI that are new grad?). Thanks yall.

Also what tech companies to look out for that hire for TS?",2024-03-19 04:34:32

1bi7r0n,We need to stop freaking out about AI,"I'm honestly so tired of seeing so many borderline nihilistic posts about how the job market will never recover and ""AI is gonna take all our jobs!!"" when that is not going to happen for literal decades. Don't get me wrong, companies are going to take advantage of artificial intelligence, but those who continue to create and learn should probably be fine. Obviously I go down this rabbit hole too form time to time, but just freaking out about it doesn't help you at all.

Source? The company I intern at makes $50+ billion USD a year and they have ""banned"" use of AI assistance (specifically chatgpt and copilot) on work projects. I am one of 5 engineers working on the project (not counting dev ops (1 guy) and the principal engineer plus our manager... our project is a few years old but has (like most places) the strangest legacy code and there's no way for a free or paid AI service to work through all the muck. Clearly they are happy with how things are since we keep getting awards, and there are tons of other teams working on projects like us. We don't make the most money but my Manager drives a tesla and her kids go to private school, so..

There are so many non-tech companies that are wayyyy less tech savvy than where I work that have no idea what it takes to actually design, develop, and maintain software. We should be fine for a while.

edit: I read this the next morning and gee I sound a bit condescending lol. My point is that we should try our best to focus on what we can control, and honing our skills/gaining experience etc. People are going to try to scare you for whatever reason, but adapting to change and continual learning is what makes a good engineer.

1bi1hbi,Should I take Linear Algebra Asynchronous or Synchronous?,"I’m planning on taking linear algebra in the summer semester, so it is a 5-week course. Because I’m not the strongest in math, I’m worried about how difficult the material will be. 

The professors teaching it have a 4.1/5 and 5/5 rating on ratemyprofessor. The 5/5 professor is teaching an asynchronous class and the 4.1 is teaching a synchronous, zoom class. I am still debating on which class I should do. Is it doable to learn linear algebra in 5 weeks self-study or would it be better to just do a zoom class? 

Additionally, I will be doing an internship during the summer. It starts halfway through the asynchronous class and ends at the later half of the synchronous class. I will also be traveling a lot during the asynchronous class, so that is something I am a little worried about (although if I try hard enough, I could get it all done before I travel).

1bgj20s,Suggestions for Internship?,"International student here. Currently I received some summer intern offers from midsized companies. They seem quite nice, but there are some differences between these jobs and I would like to hear for any advice on where I should go.

1. Midsized US Company (ML Data Science on Ads): this role is very intriguing since I am doing much ML stuff and publishing papers at the moment. However, the only thing is that this is a DS role, and since I only have 1 previous SDE internship like 3 years ago in 2021, I feel like this might be an issue once I start applying for SDE intern the next summer.

2. Midsized US Company (Machine Learning Engineer Intern): this role is very similar to the first one, and one that I would like to go as much as I wanted to say. However, it is NOT located in the United States. Technically I have work authorization and it shouldn't be an issue to start working, but I would like to know if this would impact my chances once the recruiters saw that this isn't a US internship, although the company name is very much recognizable.

3. Foreign Big Tech (Frontend Dev Intern): The best thing about this one is its brand name and job title. However, doing frontend stuff was not really on my career path and I do believe I got the offer because of previous web dev projects instead of what I am currently doing. But this IS an SDE intern role at a big tech. So it's very difficult for me to throw it easily. And even more, if it ends up boosting my chances to get full time opportunities because of this, it might even worth more.

Regarding ddls, fortunately these emails all literally came within the same month so there is some space for negotiation. But I would like to know your thoughts.

Oh almost forgot, as much as I would like to do machine learning, I do think given the current job market it might be a good strat to focus on SDE at the moment and later transfer to doing ML, so that's where all the hesitation comes in to play. Thanks for any suggestions, cheers :)

When I applied application form stated the pay rate starting from $38 up to $48. They offered me $28.85 and a $3k bonus (Pittsburgh office). When I asked them the pay rate was stated different the recruiter acted a little weird and she said the pay rate is the same for all the interns. As this is the only offer I have, although it means I need to relocate, I'm accepting anything especially in the current market I am happy I will at least get an experience.
I am wondering if anyone else received an internship offer with the same pay rate or is it because I go to community college (I will be transferring after this semester).

Additionally I'd appreciate any tips to get a return offer from previous interns.

1bcu1lu,Path to get into machine learning / ai career in Australia,"
I'm looking to get into the field and live in Australia currently with permanent residence now and am working in an intense sales career. I have an economics  bsc degree with heavy math focus and some MIT intro to computer science and data science courses, but that was a long time ago so need to do a bunch of prep courses again.

Previously I considered prepping for then applying to the georgia tech online masters computer science while working, but now that I have permanent residence I may consider looking at local options ideally with a placement or industry project component that I can do full time as a domestic student, ideally sydney based as that's where I'd like to be long term, though I'm able to move for the best option. If there is a good non university option I'm also open to that if it's less than $20,000 or has funding / placement.


Does anyone have any recommendations of how to transition into the field in Australia and the best places to study?",2024-03-12 10:32:07
1bckaag,Question AI/ML + Grad School,"Hello everyone. I would like to gain some perspective on pursuing AI/ML.

It's my junior year and I'm going through my Tech Electives + some other courses. I'm in an AI course now, and I find it interesting. However, I only have a little information on what it looks like to pursue a particular topic in the field. What I know (or have at least heard from the grapevine) is that most serious positions require a master's degree at the very least, if not a PH.D.

However, looking at my chances, I won't be accepted into any graduate school program immediately. I only have a 3.34, I've not done any research with a professor (I'm not too sure if any of my professors actually *like* me), and I don't have much outside of college besides an upcoming internship. This is to say (albeit a bit dryly) that based on my accomplishments and current status, I'm not a catch for any Graduate Program. I've discussed it with a professor who basically insinuated the same thing. I'm not trying to be negative or imply discouragement; I'm trying to be pragmatic about my chances.

In any case, I would like to hear your thoughts, especially those doing graduate school right now. To condense it into a few questions:

1. Should I bother applying to Grad School straight out of college with my low chances? Or should I focus on getting employment right now?
2. What are some interesting topics you are currently interested in/learning in the field? Though I lack research, topics like deep learning and neural networks in general would be fascinating.
3. This sub might not be as suited, but what does the process of working for a few years and then going to graduate school like? Specifically, during these years, have you been working on getting into AI positions or just doing regular jobs and gathering knowledge/experience/perspective on the side?

I know these questions may be naive (looking at #3), but I hope you can look past them. Thank you for considering the questions. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",2024-03-12 01:08:14

1bb83i7,Please help a random PhD candidate in Physics chart out a plan for self study,"Hey everyone! TL;DR at bottom.

I am a PhD student in theoretical physics who is slowly trying to move away from physics for a lot of different reasons. I am currently in a situation where I have enough results to defend my thesis but I still have a lot of time left on my contract (roughly a year), so I am trying to figure out what my next steps should be (my advisor is chill with me spending time on this transition).

Why CS? Because I just love it. I have been coding since my high school, although most of it has been very small projects relevant to my coursework or research. But apart from that, I have a little more exposure than an average physics student I think. I learnt assembly for 8085 series processors when I was in high school. I took theory of computation as an elective in my early years of undergrad (and I absolutely loved it). I self studied DSA and I think I am comfortable with most basic algorithms that one learns in a DSA 101 course. In fact during my PhD, the most enjoyable parts for me were the days when I had to code for numerical work.

Then what is the problem? I am honestly worried that I might be overestimating my capabilities, and there might be some ego at play. I tried straight up picking up a book on compilers and obviously I gave up very quickly because I could see that there were huge gaps in my knowledge.

But also, I think there is just general cluelessness. When it comes to physics I can clearly figure out what I am missing and where to gain that knowledge. But somehow in CS I just can't seem to figure out where the gap is. It seems like I have a huge gap in applying my basics to more complicated areas. It is like I know the words, I know the grammar rules, but I still cannot form a basic sentence.

What are my strengths? Anything mathematically complex. My PhD is in string theory, so I can handle very abstract mathematics. What are my weaknesses? Like I said, ego.

TL;DR, here's the help I need - Is there a way for me to really figure out what my actual standing is right now in terms of basic knowledge? And from there how can I chart out a plan for self study to cover what a CS Major would know at the end of their undergrad? I would say that I am personally more interested in more theoretical topics, like compilers, advanced algorithms, machine learning, and such.",2024-03-10 11:20:37

I have not considered doing a master's immediately after graduation but should I consider doing it?

From what I understand, headcount is due in February, and by then it should likely be decided whether or not each department can bring in L4’s. If this is the case, shouldn’t all inclined interns receive notice by now whether or not they can extend an offer? I have seen a few recent posts on this sub saying that they’ve gotten an email from Student Programs regarding a rejection, one post anecdotally saying a batch of interns received return offers last month, and another saying they’ve been externally hired. This coupled with the notion that they’re taking interns for the summer again.

Right now i've pretty much gathered what might be considered as basic stuff that i saw in every institution i've visited, such as:  


\-- Computers

\-- Arduino and Raspberry

\-- Routers, Switches, Hubs

\-- Circuit Boards, Diodes, Capacitors...

- Advanced Lab Chemistry - Most entertaining for me because I love experiments and having something to apply to real life. Chem is my favorite type of science.

- AP Biology - Medium difficultly in my school. Would be entertaining and I want to do an AP class to look better for colleges

- AP Physics - I'm bad at math. If I'm successful it would be very beneficial but if I'm not it will tank my GPA which I range from a 3.8-4.1 and I want to maintain.


Math Options:
- Pre Calculous - Just pre calc.  If I chooses in order to get into AP Calc I need to do summer work.

- Honors pre Calc - No summerwork but harder class

Intuit

* Toronto, ON
* $44/hour
* Hybrid, 2 days in office
* Free food on office days

* Free food on office days
* 16 weeks
* I interned here last summer. I'd rather try to come back full-time directly instead of coming back for another internship, but not sure how possible that is.

1Password

1b7bd2v,Advice for ML research interviews?,"Hi everyone,

I am a Ph.D. student, and time and again I have been fucking up some really good opportunities that I got especially in this competitive market. I am very grateful for having got those chances. But, I know that preparation is definitely low for me, and I only start a full on prep right before the interview.

My even bigger problem is that I don't remain calm and out of nervousness I really just eat my words and I do see myself slipping. You guys have to trust me that I have blown some really good opportunities, in interviews with good people (and in some cases big) from research divisions of Twitter, Lyft, MSR, Uber, Two Sigma, Amazon etc. Tbh even before Ph.D, during admissions I was at a waitlist of two top schools and I fucked up that interview because I got intimidated by the interviewer.

I guess apart from being a rant, I am really looking for:

1. Some form of a reassurance, that if I fuck up by talking to staff research scientists with a lot of connections, I can still somehow try and get into those circles in the future.
2. Of course, preparation tips, especially for open ended ML system design questions: I am reading Chip Ngyugen's book and making a note of concepts by looking them up. But the topic list is overwhelming, lasts beyond the book. I also don't know how to navigate interviews and inherently lack confidence (academia has truly humbled me).

I am really beating myself up for having lost some truly good opportunities. :'(",2024-03-05 17:42:12

Here's a bit about my background: I enjoy software  engineering and low-level programming for microcontrollers, but I'm not a  fan of the more theoretical aspects of Computer Science. I've already  taken two courses related to the AI field, but I haven't delved deep  into signal processing and computer vision due to my aversion to  extensive math without hands-on exercises. As I see it, the Neural  Networks and Deep Learning Course seems like the better choice. It's a  hot topic in the industry with limited academic content, and I believe  compilers, given the abundance of information and courses, are easier to  self-teach if needed. However, I've heard that learning compilers can  provide a deeper understanding of coding and compiler messages. The  challenging project also seems valuable.

1b5pm4g,How did you find your path?,"I graduated out of the pandemic with a degree in ecology and evolutionary biology and I currently work in production. My original bachelors degree kinda flopped on me. I’m 32. No student loan debt. I also have an associates of the arts and am a licensed cosmetologist. I am struggling to make a living and find a career path.

I’m thinking of going back to school for CS because with work, I need some type of challenge and work that is mentally stimulating. I’m currently struggling in my present job because of the monotony. I’m considering computer science because of the job prospects. I think it would be neat to eventually get into cybersecurity. I’ve been learning python on Sololearn and also have been using brilliant for computer science fundamentals. After some research I found bootcamp too good to be true.

Since I already have a bachelors degree, I have found CS programs designed for people who already have a bachelor’s and are making a pivot, which seems like it would be good for me. 

BUT 

With my prior experience getting a bachelors degree it didn’t seem to do much for me. I’m not sure how much of that can be attributed to the pandemic and distance learning, but w/e.

I guess I’m wondering how people figured out their niche in this field and if the curriculum in the programs helped you determine and pursue the particular branch of computer science? 

I’m looking at online programs so that I can hopefully get my foot in the door somewhere while attending school. I’m eager to get a career going but I don’t have any prior computer experience that would lend itself to finding employment.

1brxafh,Choosing between internships,"
Hello,

I am a 3rd year CS student at a small private school in the midwest. I have ambitions to do my PhD at a top program, and I have been grinding research and papers for a couple of years now.

I'm fortunate enough to be offered two summer positions at different national labs. I am torn between the two.

Lab 1:

Pros:
- gets me a level 2 security clearance 
- research related to artificial intelligence for autonomous systems. In this case, path generation and forecasting
- many interns working together in one location to collaborate and build and whatnot
- potential to be reinvited and get grad school funded. Not quite as important since most phd programs are fully funded

Cons:
- more ""military."" My work might be used for drone strikes
- may result in publication, but I'm unsure if the work is classified or not
- Area is kind of dangerous 


Lab 2:

Pros:
- related to ML tasks on one of the world's fastest super computers
- program is more research-focused. I had to reach out to a specific group and ask the leader to take me in
- Area is safe
- work will likely result in publication. Useful for grad apps
- likely working closer with the research group, but there's only 1 or 2 interns as opposed to dozens with Lab 1 (maybe a con)

Cons:
- less pay
- project isn't quite as aligned with my interests as Lab 1 is
- no security clearance. Possibly less connections?


If I accept Lab 1, I'll likely upset the researcher I've been coordinating with at Lab 2 to get me on board. I.e. he's had to do a fair bit of paperwork.

Thanks!

Given two regular languages L1 and L2 over alphabet Σ, we define the operator RQ(L1, L2) = {w | there exists a word v in L2 such that wv is in L1}. The task is to determine the smallest language class among Regular, LL, CFG, and DCFG that certainly contains RQ(L1, L2).

So, I started with the most restricted of the languages I mentioned, which is Regular. But the problem is that I don't really have a formal or actual definition of RQ, or L1 and L2 for that matter. The only thing I know is that L1 & L2 are regular and then I know the definition of RQ. So, how can I use the pumping lemma or DFA without the expression for RQ to for example prove or disprove that it is a regular language? I am drawing like boxes of models for DFA like in here:

[https://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/GREGGJ/CMSC515/chapt01/Regular.html](https://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/GREGGJ/CMSC515/chapt01/Regular.html)

But I didn't get anywhere. I have no clue how to solve this.

1brdfeh,Need help choosing courses,"These look good to me:

* **Big Data Engineering**
* **Machine Learning**
* **Concurrent Programming**
* **Data Networks**
* **Continuous Optimization**

These are the other options btw just in case something stands out as more important:

* **Introduction to Computational Logic**
* **Operating Systems**
* **Convex Analysis and Optimization**
* **Image Processing and Computer Vision** 
* **Cryptography** 
* **Complexity Theory**

I need to pick 2 out of these, maybe 3 or max 4, after that it would just be extra work which wont count towards my actual degree.

Initially I wanted to do machine learning modules only but after reading up a bit and some retrospection figured its a bad idea. I mean just 2 months ago I was 200% sure visual computing is what I wanna do. I figure its best to try and get a well rounded degree first and then figure out a niche.

There's just so many options and I couldn't really find any definitive answers that weren't just ""Yep do it"". I'd really appreciate any help. Thanks!

(**P.S**. For more context, the degree (BSc CompSci) has some fixed courses (**Functional and Imperative Programming, Math, Basics of AlgoDat, Theoretical CS and System Architecture**) and we get to choose the rest of the modules. I wanna try and do atleast 1 of the choice modules this sem. The modules will alternate each semester. The interesting ones next sem are:

* **Software Engineering**
* **AlgoDat**
* **Information retrieval and data mining**
* **Security**
* **Optimization**
* **Distributed Systems**
* **Database systems)**",2024-03-30 09:01:21

1bra92s,Which offer should I take if I want to get into software engineering in big tech?,"Hello fellow cs majors, I finally got two offers after looking for more than a year! (Graduated in May 2023) I’m wondering if anyone has any insight for which offer I should take if I want to get into software engineering in big tech.

Offer 1:
Solution Analyst/Software Developer at Deloitte

Offer 2:
Mobile App Developer at small company

From what I’ve read online, it’s not a guarantee at Deloitte if I get actual dev/engineering work depending on the project, but going there would get the big name on my resume. Not sure how much that matters tho considering they’re not necessarily known for tech.

For the small company, I’m just not sure if doing mobile work will pigeonhole me. I like doing system design and working with backend services, databases, etc., and it doesn’t seem this company’s product does much of that. Without getting too much into it, it has to do with creating a network with multiple hardware devices and controlling all of them.

All advice welcome. Thanks!",2024-03-30 05:34:40

I am graduating soon with a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics, and I have decided that I want to pursue a masters degree next year. I am looking for advice on what to go into based on a few factors.

Firstly, I think I’d prefer going into something that is less CS heavy and that incorporates human aspects, or maybe management or business or anything that isn’t 100% CS. I saw stuff online about Human Computer Interaction Masters going into UX, but that’s the only option I am aware of and I would love to hear ideas for other multidisciplinary masters degrees with some (or a lot) of CS involved. 

However, given the economic climate, job placement rates post graduation is my priority, would it be best to forget about my preferences and focus on getting a Masters in CS, Data Science or SWE?

1bqhbko,New Grad: PLC vs Fullstack ,"I am an MS ECE grad student (international) who just switched major from CS because I like to work on software that interfaces with hardware. I have a previous internship in a US startup as a full-stack developer. I really enjoyed the work because I was building a streaming application that takes in hardware sensors data and visualise them on front end.
I received an internship offer this summer for PLC programming in a small manufacturing company. While I’m really excited to get a hands on programming experience with hardware, I have close to zero knowledge on PLCs and circuits. So I will be learning them for the next few weeks.

My concern is, I am graduating in Spring 2025 and need to get a full time job within 150 days after graduation. Should I invest most of my spare time in learning more PLC and circuits and aim for control engineering job or should I double down on full-stack and cloud skills?

Most of my projects are already in full-stack dev but the job market is cut throat right now in this area. But I also dont have the basic EE knowledge since my undergrad is in CS so I think finding a fulltime controls engineer role would be difficult too.

I was thinking about just solving it in like 2 seconds with chatgpt and asking them to please give me something more challenging, which I will also use gpt to solve. If they want to test my critical thinking they can give me something that can't be solved in 1 prompt and I can then show them how I problem solve by using investigative prompting.


The goal of this is to show my ability to effectively utilize productivity enhancing tools. Ie, I can solve the same problem as somebody else in a fraction of the time.


Edit: do you guys feel so strongly against using Google as well? Do you strictly use information stored in your memory for technical interviews?",2023-07-05 14:36:50
17dcuff,You know what half the job coaches at my uni want to say to international students?,"We can't do anything for you. We can't change the fact you're at an unknown university. We can't change the fact you have none or bad research. We can't change the fact all the companies you worked or interned are not prestigious. We can't change the fact your grades are mediocre. We can't change the fact your English skills & American etiquette make the average interviewer discontent. 

This matters because we can't change the fact you need a visa. 

You can't rewrite your resume or learn enough interview skills in a 6 month period that make's up for everything I listed. There is not ATS trick or leetcode that makes up for the fact it costs hundreds of thousands to just get the chance to hire you. There's no amount of nagging and begging our offices that can fix the fact you're competing against fucking geniuses and PhD grads.

We know it sucks, but don't take it out on us. We know you're 100k in debt. We know you're gonna lose the nation you've grown attached too. We know you'll be a failure to your family. But don't ruin the fun of CS contests for students because 'I need to win'. Don't line up at career fairs for companies that say 'we will not be sponsoring' for the nonexistent chance they'll change up for you. Don't tell a student who's proud of their internship ""You only got it because you're a citizen"". We all know. 

Every room you walk in, every interview you start, every event you attend we can sense the desperation and anxiety. I don't know what to say. I know it sucks. I know it's a terrible systems. I know it's bad, but don't make it our issue.",2023-10-21 21:24:34
189cvjy,"[AMA] I'm Mark Benliyan and I wrote my first line of code as a freshman in October 2021 . Since then I did 6 software engineering internships at companies like Figma/Netflix & graduated in 2 years. Happy to answer questions about my journey, replicating these results, or any other career advice!","Hey everyone! I'm stoked to be doing an AMA on here and appreciate the mods support with making this happen.

My name is Mark Benliyan and I started my CS journey at UCLA roughly 2 years ago. I grew up in an immigrant household knowing nothing about coding, the tech industry, or software engineering careers. I entered UCLA as a Psychology major planning to pursue Big Law, then switched to Business Econ to pursue Investment Banking. I learned about CS and the tech industry while at UCLA which pushed me to switch my major once again to Computer Science and Linguistics with dreams of becoming a software engineer.

Since then things have turned out far better than I could've ever anticipated. To help drive this AMA, I'll  include a list of all my previous experiences, chronologically, that I think could be of interest. Please note that I'm not doing this to boast in any way, I can still vividly remember having imposter syndrome myself and being unsure if I ""have what it takes"" to be an engineer.

Here is that list:

* SWE Contractor at Clever (Saved Passwords)
* SWE Intern at Tinder (Backend Recommendations)
* Flown out to San Francisco by Salesforce for Tech Equality Summit
* SWE Intern at NASA JPL (Internal Tools)
* SWE Intern at BitGo (Developer Relations)
* Got offers from Figma, Netflix, Amazon, Gusto Microsoft, Atlassian, and Slack. Also went through processes with Google, Dropbox, Lyft, LinkedIn, Two Sigma, SpaceX, Palantir, and a few others during the recruiting season (dropped out of most, failed Lyft and SpaceX, didn't get Google team match)
* Flown out to New York by Jane Street for FOCUS program
* SWE Intern at Figma (FigJam Core)
* Flown out to New York by D.E. Shaw for Nexus Fellowship
* Participated in Palantir's Launch Program (remote)
* Participated in Two Sigma's Seekers Summit (remote)
* Flown out to Massachusetts by Harvard Business School for Summer Venture in Management program
* Kleiner Perkins Engineering Fellowship (2023)
* Neo Scholars program (ended up as a finalist)
* Graduated 2 years early in June 2023
* SWE intern at Netflix (Productivity Engineering)
* Just returned to Figma as a New Grad

I've spent a ton of time helping thousands of students and new grads land their dream software engineering roles. Some of you may recognize me from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markbenliyan/) where I've been posting 2-3 New Grad / Internship roles every day. I also have [a YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClY-zGNyP9RZvX4ZZC5_nIQ) where I share everything I've learned along the way to help other students on their journey. I'm making this post today to give everyone a chance to see this and start asking their questions. **I'll be answering them tomorrow, December 3rd, from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM (PST)**. Let's do this!!

***Edit (10:15 AM):*** Good morning! I just finished reading through most of the comments. I certainly didn't expect this to be so polarizing but I welcome the criticism and don't blame those skeptical of me. I'll be editing this main post with responses to common questions/criticisms that I see as I start working through the AMA.

There's been a lot of debate surrounding the authenticity of my background. Everything I've shared in the post above is true. The list above, as well as my story into tech, is merely a compilation of facts. I don't expect folks to accept this at face value, especially on Reddit, so **I've compiled a google drive with redacted evidence for everything I shared in the list above, as well as my tenure at UCLA. You can access that below.**

[REDACTED LINK POST-AMA]

***Edit (11:58 AM):*** Hey y'all, since the morning my replies to questions are currently requiring manual mod approval due to insufficient karma. This slows down how quickly things are appearing. Reached out the mods to see what we can do.

***Edit (12:26 PM):***

***my comment replies are still not showing up for viewers pending this mod-review process. only edits to my main post appear, but I'm assuming mods will approve at some point soon.***

There's been lots of questions relating to overlapping timelines, so here's a breakdown of what the timeline looked like!

*note: UCLA works on a quarter system, not a semester system*

*note-2: I entered UCLA with 61.5 school credits, a mix of AP classes and 3 college courses I took the summer before starting university. UCLA requires 180 units to graduate.* [REDACTED LINK POST-AMA]

* December 2021: Joined Clever as a swe contractor for a year-long contract where I would work 5-10 hours / week asynchronously. The async nature of this with the low weekly commitment left me time to do internships as well (which they knew about).
* Summer 2022: Joined Tinder for the internship and did 4 Summer Classes [REDACTED LINK POST-AMA]. During this time is when I attended the Salesforce Tech Equality summit using PTO from Tinder, which they knew about.
* Fall 2022: In Fall I signed offers for both NASA (year-long, part-time role for students) and BitGo. I negotiated BitGo to only work Tues-Friday so I have Mondays off. I negotiated NASA to only come into the Lab on Mondays. Mondays I went to NASA, Tues-Friday I worked at BitGo, and I took [3 classes [REDACTED LINK POST-AMA]. My school gave me a couple credits for interning as well.
* Winter 2023: I was done with BitGo and Clever by now, and NASA was still ongoing as a year-long role. I quit NASA, went to Jane Street's FOCUS program, then moved to San Francisco to join Figma, since Figma was the company I was most excited about working at. During this time I learned that if I take 4 classes winter quarter, I can graduate in June 2023 - so that's what I did [REDACTED LINK POST-AMA]. Most classes allowed me to work remotely, but I took a total of 5 or 6  round-trips from SF to LA and back for Midterms and Finals. I wasn't optimizing for GPA or grades anymore. I also had a few days off at Figma, and near the end of March is when I attended the D.E. Shaw Nexus Fellowship
* Spring 2023: I finished Figma by now and focused entirely on finishing all requirements to graduate. A bit before finals week, I joined Netflix for the internship I had already signed. Netflix knew that I had graduated early, didn't care. I also had the Palantir and Two sigma virtual events during this time.
* Summer 2023: I graduated, went to Harvard's SVMP (Netflix manager approved my trip). This is when I also participated in the Kleiner Perkins Fellowship and the Neo Scholar program. I received full-time return offers from both Figma and Netflix.

***Edit (2:33 PM):***

Apparently there was a user leaving inappropriate and or offensive comments on this post. Some of you are suggesting this was my ""alter ego"" and my ""alt account."" I'd like to make it clear that I did not create any alt account or influence a single comment from any other account on this subreddit. I'm not sure what the comments from that user said, but they were already deleted this morning when I logged on. Kinda crazy that I need to even clarify this lol

***Edit (5:43 PM):***

Heading out to dinner plans now but just wanted to say that this AMA is officially closed now. Thank you all for the open dialogue. This was really interesting for me to see both socially and professionally. Will keep the criticism in mind and hopefully the answers to other questions were helpful!

16t6wg0,The market won’t recover,"Companies will realize that they don’t actually need 300k employees. Most of them are doing a bunch of stupid shit and dumb projects. Companies will realize that it’s not worth investing millions into these projects that don’t generate revenue. We are also seeing AI tools making coding easier, lowering the entry into a SWE position. With the market being so oversaturated, companies have even more reason to pay employees less as there are more supplies than demand. What about senior devs? Think back to the Industrial Revolution. What happened to the skilled artisans? They got replaced by cheap laborers. Those laborers were paid very little because they can easily be replaced. Sounds familiar to the current job market? Plus in the future, AI will only get better and better. Website builders and app builders leveraging these AIs will also get better. I personally believe that the tech industry will slowly begin to look like the finance industry where it is insanely competitive. The finance industry also was very oversaturated decades ago due to easy money and high pay with not much work. Sound familiar to current SWE? This is just my opinion, I would like to see people prove me wrong.",2023-09-27 01:35:10

**edit/update**: you all have been amazing, and I’m frankly surprised by the poll results, and I thank you all for contributing your thoughts in the comments. Reading the comments confirmed in my heart that Amazon is the right choice, so I sent the commitment email to become a Amazonian, and canceled the google/Roblox onsites I have scheduled for next week, and declined HRT because it’s not FAANG/ FAANGMULA and I don’t want to sully my good name.

z3xshn,New Grad 2023 Recruiting Summary,"Figured I’d do one of these since I’ve seen a couple here and there. I also receive a lot of dms and it’s hard to respond to them all so maybe this will answer some questions.

Background:
CS major at T10 school, previous internships at Uber, AWS and Google. No cool projects or any of the sort. Just this URL shortener and Neural net I built for Mammography classification. 

Stats: 
Applied to Ill say maybe ~20-25 places and heard back from the ones below: 

Jane Street: interviewed super early like July or something. Aced the interview, the interviewers even said so but I didn’t get called back for the next round. Prolly my fault for interviewing so early. 

Applied Intuition: Didn’t do too good in this interview can’t lie. Offered a redo but nah I wasn’t feeling it anymore just took the L.

Bloomberg: interview process took like a week and a half. Then another week for the EM meet and then I got the offer after a further 5 days. Received the hardest question I’ve seen in my life. Interviewer even said he didn’t expect any code to be written that he wanted a discussion. 

Uber: interview process was super quick like a week and then I got the offer the following week. I had a sys design round which I wasn’t prepared for but luckily I had seen a couple exponent videos so I aced apparently. 2 LC hards lol. 

Two Sigma: Did the phone screen, aced got another round aced, then had an intermediary round before the final even though it was supposed to be phone then final ( I even have friends that did just final). Didn’t do good in this one. The question was simply too hard for me to think of a proper solution. I was on the right track and all nah. Took the L.

Amazon: got return offer

Google: didn’t get return offer due to “headcount constraints” and HC viewing my report as just okay. Was sent the whole PA form again and told that I would only have to do a single interview this year if I wanted to join but heavy pass on that. 

Pinterest: Aced first round, Pretty much aced the final but I didn’t get it lol. Was kinda surprised at first but it’s whatever saw it with Jane street. 

Netflix: did codesignal, heard back like 2 days later, aced the first round, completely aced the final and system design rounds and got the offer like 4 days after the final.

Exodus Point Capital: what a bunch of dickheads. Didn’t even have the decency to say why they weren’t going to turn on their cameras but expected me to turn on mine????? Didn’t allow me express my thought process or explain to them what I was doing just wanted to see my type code like a madman. When it was question time at the end. I asked the typical “tell me a little more, there much info publicly available” they said “we’re a hedge fund we make money”. What a douchebag.

DoorDash: decline the interview. I was tired. 

Atlassian:  did so well and even taught the interviewer a thing or two during the interview about DSAs in Java and the C++ STL. Didn’t get moved on. I wasn’t even tripping. They clearly didn’t have headcount and also couldn’t handle my salary demands.

Headlands: L after being sent the OA.

Rentech: YES RenTech lol wanted me to interview for a research engineering position in C++ but I was more interested in their Java infra position mainly cuz my C++ was rusty. I prolly should have just done the research interview because the waitlist for the infra one was long AF. 

Radix: took my data and never scheduled.


I think that should be it. If I remember anything else I’ll edit the post. I will add that I did bomb a lot of OAs either cuz they were hard as fuck or I just couldn’t finish in time. Like citadel, DRW, IMC… I pretty much heard back from most places I applied it was on me to do the rest. If you ask me I’d say a T10 school and those previous internships carried but I’ve seen people do it with much less.  

Morale of the story:
1. Know C++ don’t be like me. 
2. Watch exponent videos after gaurav sen on YouTube for system design. You’ll thank me.
3. Neetcode 150 and company tagged is more than enough. If you couldn’t solve it after all that, then well that question is for the codeforces generals.
4. Apply early, don’t wait. I prolly Ld out of some other places like Atlassian and Pinterest cuz of headcount. (I know this contradicts what I said about Jane Street)
5. Anyone can do it.",2022-11-24 23:27:21
x53bng,"I am genuinely tired of ""algo tests""","Edit: If you don’t want to read the post, or can’t bother, then don’t — but then don’t leave a comment either. I said very clearly and articulately that I would understand if the situation would only be applicable to big tech companies such as MAANG who have many applicants. But this is not the case and this is what the post is about. Get your head out of your … and don’t comment if you don’t read the post and lack empathy. 

""Do I really want to go through this hell, madness, and circus every time I look for a new job?"" being the question that has haunted my mind for the past 1 week.

For about 3 years before starting Uni I freelanced as a Dev in gaming (Java APIs & reliability, though now I am on a Python diet but I guess you figured that out already!), then I had a disconnect from the commercial sphere because I began studying for a BS in CompSc. Now, I find myself in the situation that I ""have"" to apply for ""Grad schemes"" because as of ""recently"" I ""come across as a Grad"" (I wouldn't have said so, really? Maybe I needed a recruiter, a total stranger, to tell me it is done now). Anyway, this is not the problem - it's just a frustrating part of it - because SWE salaries are generally pretty low anyway where I live (think 80-100k TC with even close to 4 YOE at some well-reputed non-MAANG companies, and even less at about 30-50k with your usual consulting gig or other small-sized companies - I know, it is a massive gap).

But about that thing that really, really makes me fly off the handle is when I am asked to sit completely nonsensical (meaning, non-job related) ""algo tests"" (think ""trapping rainwater"", or ""total number of palindromic substrings in O(n)""). But when you look over the interviewer's open-sourced past projects on GitHub, they are your usual REST or NumPy code monkey. Come on... Don't ask a question for which you would not know the answer yourself without the solutions in front of you!

I have spent half my summer on Leetcode and submitting applications. I have \*little to no time\* to spend with my family - it's getting really, really frustrating & annoying! I hate this, from the bottom of my heart! There are an infinite number of ways in which I could have spent this time \*so\* much better!

You'd say it is an industry about common sense, but it really jeopardises that belief when you put to the test the fairness behind these assessments (generally): Devs with 8+ YOE, who probably don't have the time necessary (e.g., family responsibilities) to complete them, they receive lengthy but approachable take-homes in lieu; And Grads get tough, non-relevant, time-limited assessments. Make it make sense! It is as if things are made harder for others not to get into the industry instead of the opposite to ease this ""sHorTAge oF SkILLs"" they all keep complaining about.

I would understand if this was the standard only at MAANG, but no - other tech companies, medium-sized gigs, and even some ""quite shy from the public eye"" capital firms & banks now impose some horribly difficult and idiotic coding ""puzzle"" even for roles like DevOps or Frontend Development where they are totally out of scope. There's a no-name trading venture that asked me for 3 LC mediums in 90 minutes; Uber wants me to sit 2 LCs + 6 questions (not sure of difficulty, yet to sit) in 35 minutes. This is mad! It is unheard of on the job! There are days in a row when you have the same project to be finished by the end of the month, and still switch to some quick tasks for other projects in between. Amazon themselves had 2 LC mediums in 105 minutes for OA, and the technical screening after was just a discussion about a Trie implementation (and the LPs).

The recruitment processes for this industry are genuinely rotten to the core, and get more so as every day goes by. Where have you heard about irrelevant assessments in Management, Consulting, Accounting, Medicine, etc.? At worst, you will get a ton of behavioural questions, but at best you will still get into some relevant case study.

I am led to believe we are about the only profession who is willing to accept all this idiotic process. At this point I am more inclined than ever to reconsider my career options, although I have been coding since always.

If you are from the EU / EEA / UK, and know those handful few companies or recruiting agencies (or how to source them / what to look for) with some reasonable recruitment practices, please DM me with some helpful advice.

We've been together for almost 3 years. All has been great between us. We fight here and there all the time but not as bad as this time. She went in my phone and found out that I have given some of my girl friends ""Heart"" reaction. I explained to her that I am friendly and all of these girls are my friends (Even though we're not as close but still friends on social media). I spent a week to think about it and decided to have a conversation with her, telling her that I did not mean anything in those love reactions online and I've been completely loyal with her since the first day. I'm not so sure why she would end things like this since she knows that I am loyal and all. I understand her feelings in this topic but I am loyal and treat her like a queen. I put her up over everything I adore. Friends, family gatherings and especially my my family.

Honestly, I love her and want a future with her. She kept saying and thinking I want to cheat on her and that I am not loyal to her. She broke up with me saying she can't trust me anymore from what she has found and stated she's not comfortable when we're together anymore. Seriously, I never would have thought she would put this issue this way. Yes, I shouldn't have done that in the first place to cause confusion in our relationship. But honestly, is it worth breaking up from this? I'm upset and disappointed in the way she thinks and puts situations like this.

When are you supposed to apply for internships and why did nobody tell me? 

I hate racing people for stuff. I swear I am competent and I just want a job with good work life balance that pays enough so that I can support a family.

15sqdpa,Why we need diversity hiring,"I'm a black developer so perhaps I'm biased in favor of diversity initiatives but, from what I've seen, they are absolutely necessary.

I work in an office made up of 95% immigrants from soulth India. I am one of the only two black developers that work at the company and I'm fairly certain we wouldn't have gotten hired were it not for DEI.

There is absolutely NOTHING preventing this company from hiring anyone from any race and yet I don't see many east asians or even white people employed here despite being well represented in the overall applicant pool

I don't think it's because this company is ""racist"" or because south asian applicants are the only qualified. I think its ""hiring homophilia"": the tendency to overvalue or prefer someone who is similar to you.

My argument is simple. Human beings are biased and it's foolish to believe that we make fair meritocratic decisions without outside scrutiny. This industry has no official certification of talent so most companies choose people that are qualified (aka good enough not necessarily ""the best"") and are likable. Its just so happens that being similar in ethnic background to the hiring manager makes you likable",2023-08-16 13:46:13

11dfkx3,TikTok Internship,"I recently got an internship offer from TikTok (US-based office) and it's my best offer so far. But I'm worried about the possible consequences I'd have from interning there. TikTok is definitely not seen in the best light here in the US, and it's getting worse by the month. And as US-China relations get worse, I just feel like I might be shooting myself in the foot by working at TikTok.

I definitely would not work for TikTok long term because it conflicts with my morals. But personally, I don’t mind working there for 2.5 months since I don’t think I’ll have a large enough impact to make a difference in the company. But I’m worried that other companies/recruiters may not think the same.

I'm wondering if companies would be sussed out and view my previous experience at TikTok as a possible liability. Some of the companies I'm planning to intern/work at in the future include tech companies (both big and startups) and possibly HFT firms.

Could anyone provide any insight into their thoughts about interning at TikTok? How do I know for sure that employers won’t ding me for working there? Any past experiences of discrimination bc of work at TikTok?",2023-02-27 16:11:47

10se7ra,Why is plagiarism bad for students but not professors?,"If a student does anything even remotely related to what is considered to be plagiarism, they usually lose credit for the assignment on the first offense, and can be expelled in the second offense. For example, even if it's something as benign as quoting someone, attributing the quote to them, but forgetting to cite them, it's considered a harsh penalty and people seem to agree that's grounds for receiving a zero on an assignment. What can be an innocent mistake could derail your performance in a class. 

But if a professor takes slides from a course posted online, and slightly tweaks it - if they even do that, it's considered fine, even without the attribution or citation. 

I find it a little ironic that all my assignments are straight up copied and pasted from other schools, yet there is nothing to in regards to attribution or citation. It's possible to find answers for these assignments since the professors were so lazy they don't even change them.

jlnsiu,Best Tip I Can Give,"Hello all, I’m a junior in computer science at an engineering school and just wanted to share to you all how I found my first “big internship”.

To start off I’m no CS guru in fact I am just now taking DS so a little behind due to switching majors from CompE. I had no real practice with leet code other than a LC easy every know and then. But one thing I did have way a huge interest in the stock market and the drive to find ways to make my life easier while day trading. This led me to start my own web based tool to do so and I started grinding on a PERN stack. I got addicted to it because I generally loved it. I believe this one project alone secured me an internship at a fintech company. My resume isn’t great, I only have on prior job in swe which is through my school and one other web dev project. To get to the point find something that you love to do or something you want to make easier on yourself and build a project around it. Don’t make it a chore to program something you don’t enjoy for your resume, generally find a passion for it. Having this passion makes it so much better to talk about when asked about by an employer. If anyone wants to see my current resume or has any questions please feel free to ask. I just wanted to share what worked out for me and good luck!",2020-10-31 18:48:35

I got interviews for several APM programs but didn’t have the luck to get a PM offer. I have always thought that doing CS will lead me to a very rewarding career, but now when I think about it, it kinda felt depressing that I will be making average college grad salary, making barely above my internship pay. I worked hard to get my CS degree, and also worked hard to secure two very good internships, but in the end I might just be an average new grad making average salary. The new grad recruiting cycle is also almost over, and it’s unlikely I can secure a much better offer in Spring. Is it wrong to feel depressed?",2023-11-09 02:55:35
1btchwf,There are too many people taking CS as a major,"To quote The Atlantic:

""Last year, 18 percent of Stanford University seniors graduated with a degree in computer science, more than double the proportion of just a decade earlier.""

I graduated with a CS degree in 2001 - not ideal timing but it worked out ok.  Back then the majority of people I studied with and met in industry had been enthusiastic about computers as children. For example I learned to program rudimentary BASIC on the family ZX Spectrum by copying down program listings from the back of magazines before I was 10. That was not uncommon.

These days I see a lot of young people coming out of university who don't have a passion for the subject, they weren't into computers before university, they just see it as a well paying career. Having been in the industry for a couple of decades now it is very clear which of those two groups people I work with fall into.

I worry about these people and their futures. Not only is the market saturated, it seems to be saturated with people who don't love the subject and are not especially talented with it.

Being a professional software engineer is hard. It can be extremely emotionally and mentally taxing. Not everybody has the mind and personality for it. If you are just heading off to university now or still early in your education and you aren't loving CS, I encourage you to seriously consider changing subjects.

15ud2of,Big Tech Salary decay and general complacency,"What is up with the software engineers on here and their complacency? FAANG used to be, at least 10 years ago, a mark of serious prestige. They were getting paid astronomical salaries, up to par with major professional sports league players, significantly more than doctors, lawyers, and engineers of other trades. Why was this justified? Because the amount of revenue software engineers generate is on par with an NBA player for example, and to take it a step further, compare the valuation of an average Big Tech firm with a major professional sports league, and you will see, even with the large number of employees, the ratio of value generated/per employee for these are very similar.

Fast forward ten years, the average entry level salary for a ""Big Tech"" firm is still around 150k (according to levels.fyi), and the average software engineering job would be lucky to be breaking 90k. WTF happened? This is roughly the same as it was 10 years ago, except now there is rampant inflation and decent studios in big cities cost upwards of 5k in some cases. Why is there no push for larger salaries, or unionization for software engineers? 250k is the new 100k and it seems that many other industries are realizing this.

u7tqmj,"My experiences with ""computer nerds"" is making me discouraged about going into CS (Rant)"," Hello! I apologize in advance if this is the wrong forum but I'll try anyways. I have some thoughts about the social aspects in computer science. 

Short story, I just finished my bachelor in electrical engineering. However, I realized electronics is not for me, one thing that has caught my interest is programming, although I'm not an expert in it yet.

I am considering a masters in computer science, some areas of interest are computational physics, quantum computing and perhaps game development. 

There is one catch: I am scared of not going to fit in.

During my life, the most weird and arrogant people I have met are ""computer nerds"", if I may use that term. Although some people have been friendly, I have gotten a bad experience with these people. Below is a summary of my experiences. 

Computer nerds suffer from a superiority complex, looking down on everyone else who are not as good as them when it comes to computers and gaming. I can still hear the arrogant laugh from that IT support guy in high school who started to interrogate me about what is a mother board, and I pointed at the wrong part on my laptop. Even in university I was mocked for not knowing enough about computers and programming. I can only apologize, I did not grow up in a rich family with both my parents being software developers, plus my parents were very strict about computer time. I did learn Java at age 24 and got highest grade in a course in object-oriented programming a short time after, so it looks like I'm not totally incompetent. 

Each computer nerd considers themselves to be of the right kind, criticizing everyone who plays the wrong video game, has the wrong play style, has the wrong graphic card etc. There is a lot of ""gatekeeping"" among computer nerds, they don't allow other people to be a part of the community. Every computer nerd considers him/herself having the best taste of video games, music, anime and manga etc. It's like they believe they belong to some kind of master race, I thought we had left those ideas behind a long time ago?

""You're not a real anime fan if you have not seen this (anime that few people know about), Attack on titan is lame and too mainstream!""

""You play Overwatch? Lame, I hate Blizzard, greedy bastards!"" (Just move to Cuba then.)

""You play Team fortress 2? Lame, I hate Valve, greedy bastards""! (Just move to North Korea then.)

""You like Civilization 6? The last one was better!"" (They say that every time a new CIV game is released, what is your problem!?)

""You have an AMD processor? Lame, Intel is superior""! (Same conversation vice versa.) 

""You only have ONE computer screen? You suck!"" (I'm low on money right now, sorry.)

""Java sucks, C++ is better!""

""C++ sucks, C is better!""

""C sucks, Haskell is better!""

""You use Windows?! Linux is superior!"" (I still have not realized why Linux is the best OS in the world, sorry.)

""You have a Macbook?! Lame!!!!"" (Sorry, I just followed the crowd when Apple was popular)

""You have an Iphone?! Are you stupid?!"" (Sorry, I just followed the crowd when Apple was popular)

Computer nerds may sound tough in voice chat on Discord, but up close and personal, I have met many who are socially awkward and are completely hopeless when it comes to dating (some are lucky to meet gamer girls, a rare species though). Some even have had serious mental issues. I have realized that there is a very high percentage of computer nerds that have autism/Asperger’s or at least traits of it. I'm actually diagnosed myself with high functioning autism but I have very mild symptoms. I can dress properly and talk about different subjects like politics and history.

They have very limited interests beside computers and are reluctant of going out. I really want to train my social skills after two years in isolation because of the pandemic, try new sports and go to pubs. My worst fear is that I will have study and work colleagues that only want to stay inside. I actually enjoy sports and want to go out more. Problem with being at university is that time is limited, so it would be great if I could get some good study colleagues. 

Is all this really true or did I just end up with the wrong people? I just want to point out that these people I have encountered have been in their teens and early 20's, do computer nerds mature by age or do they stay weird the rest of their lives? Also, I come from Northern Europe, so I don't know if computer nerds may be different in other parts of the world.

14adre9,why are some of y’all stupid fr?,"""i was reading that post on that ~~girl~~ asian person that talked about how she was ~~harassed in her dms~~ assaulted and attacked by a black person, and as i was reading the comments, a lot of idiots were in the comments like “it’s not all ~~men~~ black people” BUT WHY TF IS IT ALWAYS A ~~MAN~~ black person? y’all don’t realize how insensitive and just plan stupid you sound. generally, (and yes i’m generalizing) you ~~men~~  black people need to reevaluate yourselves. most of you are old enough to have common sense and know shit like this is really harmful, not only to ~~women~~ non-black people but to other ~~men~~ black people who are genuinely good people but labeled as whatever because of how other ~~men~~ blacks treat them. like grow tf up""

now if you've read to here, i'm parodying [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/149w533/why_are_some_of_yall_stupid_fr/) to make a point. do you realize how you sound when you say things like this?

and now imagine if the comments section was full of comments addressing the black people getting mad, saying, ""Jesus these comments are depressing… if you feel personally targeted by this post you’re the problem lol"".

anyone in their right mind would recognize that that post would be considered hateful and bigoted to the extreme if you apply it towards any group other than men. everyone knows that it's wrong to generalize an entire racial group based on the actions of the worst offenders, even if that racial group commits disproportionately many crimes. yet when you do the same for men, this entire sub cheers them on and their post gets 300 upvotes. it really tells you something about the state of society that men are the only group against which you can spew the most vicious hate and bigotry and not only will you be not called out on it, you'll be cheered on.

the fact of the matter is it's morally wrong to generalize and demonize **any** demographic group, **no matter what** your personal experiences with them are. if you are ""just venting"" and think it's cathartic to spew hate and bigotry, then do so in a private journal or to a close friend. but if you do so in a public forum where your words are being read by everyone, then you're doing something morally reprehensible, and you *will face backlash* for it.

Edit: I'm done arguing with everyone, it's not surprising that this sub is complete garbage and there is no one who knows how to make a coherent argument. I used to think CS majors tend to be smart but clearly not apparently. I'm heading out of this cesspool of ignorance and stupidity.",2023-06-15 21:19:41

I am currently in my 2nd year in my CS degree, btw.

As of writing this post I have 4 projects under my belt (web applications like Video games eStore, Computers eStore and a mini ORM framework).

I also have skills in the backend which is my specialty (load balancing, frameworks like Spring, caching using technologies like Redis, Multithreading, system design fundamentals and more).

1bmeahg,"Please, stop the fear mongering.","Hey guys, sorry for the rant.

Recently I came across several posts on social media and reddit discouraging people from pursuing such a great career.

At the beginning it was a funny joke to say CS majors will be jobless, but now it is starting generate a lot of panic and it is starting to become really annoying, specially because it is not true.

Lots of influencers are doing sensationalist content just to get easy views from anxious younger folks which are vulnerable as they are just starting their journey.

The same is happening within tech companies, which are spreading propaganda to quickly lure investors... Most of such propaganda is false and those startups will soon disappear. Similar to what we saw with crypto. They are investing heavily in a sensationalist marketing strategies. Why? Because it works, it's easy money.

I just hope future CS majors are well aware of this. Please, don’t fall for this BS propaganda. Computer Scientists are not going anywhere.

Even if programming becomes automated (which I doubt it will ever become fully automated. It will just evolve into prompt engineering imo), there is WAY more than just programming in Computer Science. CS has a vast number of branches and it is an amazing science. There are endless applications that still need to be tackled computationally! And remember, we are the ones behind AI development ;)

ps: If we are rational, we can understand that the moment software development becomes fully automated, then that means the code to automate every other job is already written. So why bother? Additionally, AIs programming themselves without expert supervision is borderline a recipe for extinction. They should never become a blackbox. Computer Scientists will always be necessary :)",2024-03-24 06:37:52

1b3tobf,Fall of software engineering role and why I believe it won't be coming back," Disclaimer: I still believe that the role will be paid very good in the future I just will never go back to what it used to be before lay offs.    


We all have seen the same content from big companies such as Google, Facebook etc. has been centered around the idea of software engineering being this perfect job (good pay, being flexible hours, remote work, etc) with big pays which greatly exceeded a lot of other jobs.    


I believe the main idea around this was getting people hyped up for programming and getting as many people sign up for CS as possible. I think everybody can remember 'everybody can learn to code'. It all was carefuly designed to create a surplus of really knowledgeable workers so that CS companies have as much talent they need and with so many people trying to get into IT they can easily lower wages becaouse so many people are trying to get in and thus save company a lot of money.    


The dream is gone.    


With so many people hooked into IT from all around the world they no longer need to pretend and thus start to behave like any other company. Massive lay offs, remote work getting more and more scarce (becaouse money), decrease in pay, super competetive interviews which can take even up to months. I believe the IT at least for average CS major is no longer what it used to be and a lot of us just got played in the end.   


 P.S. I also believe that a lot of ""day in a life"" tiktok, youtube videos etc. might to have been actually encouraged by those companies and it also explains why people after posting them don't really have any really repercussions - don't tell me that Facebook, Amazon etc. don't observe what their workers do on social media and yet despite none of those had any negative consequences in the time of posting, .    


TL;DR Big companies show job good, lots of monkey go CS, too many monkeys go CS, Big companies change job - now job bad, monkey sad.

I'm a sophomore CS student attending a very no-name (ranked 200-300) private university (located in Northeastern USA). The only reason I chose this was I basically got a full-ride, so high school senior me thought that it was a no brainer.

I never really paid any attention to this fact, until I stumbled across this subreddit.

Comparing the linkedins on my schools alumnis to other schools (not even ivy schools, just well-known public schools) is soul-crushing, as the linkedins of the latter show me that their school has opened many more doors for their students.

I’m currently interning at a Big N company, so think Uber, Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Postmates, Venmo, Amex, etc. 

I just feel a little chauvinism in my team. My project manager keeps assigning work to this one man in the group, and there’s only two girls in the group (me and another girl). We never get assigned anything.

Now, before you say call HR and report it to the skip (manager’s manager), my project manager has never done anything blatantly sexist. In fact, it could be me just misreading the entire situation. He has never done anything outwardly bad to me or the other girl, in fact he compliments us during our meetings and reviews. But here are just some instances that I feel a little targeted

1. Me and the other girl are the only ones who are never assigned anything in the group. If we do get assigned something, it’s always to do with design or stuff that deals minimally with code
2. My manager really loves sports, think mid aged white guy who always watches sports and stuff. He chatters about this with the guys, so he is “friendly” with them and banters them up. He has made no efforts to bring sports or anything outside work-related to me and the other girl. 
3. He cracks up jokes when the table is only the guys, I’ve noticed first hand that when I got to the table or the other girl has gotten to the table, he immediately switches to a very serious tone
4. He doesn’t feel comfortable with only me and him being in the same room together. Ie when we’re in the same meeting room together and it’s just me and him, he likes to take our meeting to a more common outward space, like the cafe or cafeteria (same with the other girl)
5. I brought this up discretely to the other girl in the group and she feels the same way.
6. He took the guys in our group out to a sports bar last Friday but the (us) two girls didn’t get invited 
7. Not necessarily a red flag but when he’s talking to us (the girls) he always brings up his wife and two kids, I’ve asked the male interns if they’ve ever heard him talk about his family, and they said no. This makes me feel like he’s implying a “you’re a woman be a mom” mentality.

l0r4v8,Google Offer Rescinded?,"Hello,

I am currently a sophomore in college and I was lucky enough to get an offer at Google for the STEP internship. This would be my first internship, if I get over an obstacle.

Summer heading towards the 11th grade, I decided it would be a great opportunity for me to work at my parents' <business>, <company>, since it would allow me to help my parents and gain new skills; I worked at the <business> from May 2017 to Feb. 2019 without pay as a <role>. When the <business> was called for the background check, my dad picked up and told the agency that I worked from April/May 2017 to Feb./March 2019 since he wasn't able to recall the exact months of my work, due to the lack of official documentation, and this was marked as discrepancy on my background check.

I was asked by explain the reason for this discrepancy on my background check and I gave the reason that was said above by email. After I sent this email, I got an automated email confirming that my email is successfully processed and to give “up to 2 business days” for the Background Checks team to get back to me.

Note: I talked to someone else who had to explain his discrepancy on his background check and his was resolved in 2 business days.

It’s been 5 business days and I still haven’t heard back from the Background Checks team and I now I have a bad feeling about this. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What should I do?

Edit: When should I send an follow-up email?

Thanks",2021-01-19 19:27:02

I did not get a return offer due to the layoffs earlier during the year so I cold applied to 500 apps. I’ve gotten OAs but majority just ghost me even with perfect score. I also struggled a lot with job searching since I’ve only had 4 swe interviews out of 500 apps and 2 offer. That shows you that even people at top universities struggle with finding a swe job.

yp5hlh,Is it actually Game Over?,"Freshman in CS here. I've been reading quite a few posts recently from r/cscareerquestions and this sub. With all the layoffs from big tech and market corrections to tech making it so that VC is harder to come by, it caused less open positions than last year (I think, corrct me if I am wrong). I was hoping this tech recession would be done by the time I graduate, but I'm seeing some of you say that it's gonna last 5+ years before it gets better. Some of you are acting like getting a internship let alone a job is a herculean effort only achievable by the beat and brightest.

Am I fucked? The competition has been increasing a lot in recent years, and the number of CS grads has only risen dramatically. I know the demand for skilled engineers is still much higher than supply, but the market for juniors is abysmal I heard, at least for big tech. If it's also abysmal for regular ass joe companies according to this sub then god help me. People are saying that tech is still the best field to get into, although I am starting to have doubts about that. 

If this is better than other white collar fields, then those fields are swimming in the pits of hell. Is there anything else marketable I should learn besides the obvious like having good social skills? What should I do to prepare?",2022-11-08 00:07:04

theres a bit of shit post mixed in. Sorry about that but I had 2 midterms today and got rejected by 2 companies. 🙃

&#x200B;

Asking for myself. Currently in my junior year and the only jobs I can find are local jobs that think $10 an hour is a lot. Honestly this years been a massive ego blow. I spent months working on several projects and building work experience at startups to be destroyed by leetcode hard questions. I know I have come incredibly far. This same time last year I could barely write a python script and run it on the terminal. Now I work as a full backend engineer at a local startup and I also run cloud functionality. I should be happy but I am depressed because I promised myself last year when I started this journey I would get a good internship and here I am a year later with still no good internship. **The only way to recover my pride is to take down a giant next year**. As the title says 2Sigma, Stripe, Virtual Financial or DRW.  I added mathematical economics a second major and I finally have taken enough relevant classes to not be blindsided at an interview.

I refuse to lose next year. I mean it. **Refuse**. I've started praying to leetcode gods everyday for at least one hour sometimes more. I have 2 research projects I plan to do before July when the early applications begin. Still I would love the perspective of some who have won the battle.

Please if you have been blessed to work at one of these fine high paying companies  Could you share you story and maybe some preemptive advice for 2022? How did you prepare? When did you start studying? Maybe some fun project ideas as well.

I financial cannot afford to go another year without a good internship. I'll never be able to love myself.Im joking but not really please help.",2021-03-16 23:02:13

16aok9z,Sharing my Internship Experience at Optiver,"Hey there, long time lurker in this sub. I recently finished an internship at Optiver in Amsterdam for SWE. I was very fortunate and I got a return offer for a new grad position next year! So I just want to share some of my experience working in the company and hopefully convince you to give it a try.

# Itinerary

The internship lasted for eight weeks, which I would describe as intensive because it is not only about getting stuff done, but also to demonstrate your qualities.

On the trading side, you go through the trading fundamentals over the course of two weeks. In the following six weeks, there is a mixture of simulated trading and data science projects. This is the case regardless of whether you applied as a Data Scientist, Researcher or a Trader, because both skill sets are required for the job.

On the tech side, you go through the same course as the trading interns in the first week. The second week is more on understanding the infrastructure of the trading system. For the last six weeks, you work on a software project with guidance from your project mentor and your team lead. The nature of the project could vary a lot, from tools that traders use to the underlying hardware of the system.

# Lifestyle

As a starter, hotel rooms and food were provided. There is no secret that the work hours can be long. Trading interns have to work from 8 to 7 on days where they do sim trading. For SWE, my working hours is the usual 9 to 6 and we are encouraged to strike a work-life balance.  Still, it is very relaxing outside of these hours, and the company arranged activities like Friday bar nights and boat trips. Apparently teams will regularly organise team-building activities like go-karting, but I missed mine because my team went on one just before I joined 🫤.

Oh, and for those who haven't been to Amsterdam, it is a really lovely place, and with the bikes that Optiver provides, it feels like the entire city is within reach. The ramen at Ramen Kingdom outside the central station is authentic and very delicious, even if the queue is always long. Also, I highly recommend visiting the beaches of Scheveningen in The Hague, they have lovely beach houses where you can have dinner while watching the sunset.

# Education Resources

I still remember how I was able to strike a conversation about trading with the trading interns right until they started sim trading. My general impression from talking with them is that the moment they started sim trading, they rapidly picked up the skills to be a good trader, which involves a good balance between technical analysis and intuition.

On the tech side, you work with your team lead and project mentor who provides one(two?)-on-one guidance on the project, which in general is rather hands-off. Instead, you are encouraged to ask questions and talk to the shareholders who will make use of your project. My observation is that you can almost always find a solution to your problem if you talk to the right people and ask the right question. Furthermore, we had many talks with people in the company who explained the operation of the company in great detail.

Basically, those who make the most of their internship are those who are eager to learn.

# What are they really looking out for during the internship?

Personally, I was striving to get a return offer by the end of the internship, and it quickly became clear that I was being evaluated on all fronts, rather than simply delivering the project.

Optiver is quite proud of their principles and how they are applied across all offices. Besides the more common ones like curiosity and strive to go beyond, I think the most unique one is ownership. I was reminded that once I started working on the project, I am its steward and should proactively chart out the course to its completion. Such entrepreneurial spirit appears to be highly valued, and would appear to be an important indicator of success down the line.

On a related note, the most stressful period of my internship was actually the last week because I had to pass on the ownership of the project to someone else in the future.

# Reward

A neat thing about Optiver is that its reward system is one of the most transparent systems I have seen. It is based on the marble system. For each marble you have, you get a percentage of the company's global profit (with caveats of course). This system applies to all who work FT in trading and even in tech.

I (20M) am a student of Mathematics & Computing. IIT kharagpur, and am currently sitting in the on-campus internship drive. To give you a context, companies visit the college and offers students an internship for next summers (2024) in my case. 

Till now, many companies have come but in spite of having worked hard for the past 3 years I feel as if I have lost. About 50 companies have come so far and I didn't get shortlisted for a single interview round. I have all the necessary metrics, a good Cgpa (around 8.5 out of 10), good coding skills, some positions of responsibilities and an all round personality. 

For the past 3 months I was completely focused on preparing for the tests and worked really hard. But right now as I write this post, I feel as if I have been pushed to the edge. I want to continue fighting, that hasn't died. But I feel so lost. I see others, who are worse than me in the mentioned metrics getting offered. And I feel inadequate and worthless. For years hard work seemed to have gotten me through the challenges but I don't even know if relying on it alone is enough anymore. There is a lot of internal politics going on in the process. The entire process cannot necessarily be called fair and in spite of knowing this fact, I am feeling bad.

I'm well aware these are highly sought-after positions, and I'm ready to grind as much as possible to get to this goal.

&#x200B;

I'm a sophomore at a top target school (think Harvard/Yale/MIT) aiming to intern at JS following my junior year. I only recently began CS study at my school and as a result I don't have any SWE internships on my resume, but have a couple of basic personal projects via self-teaching and intro CS courses. FWIW I'm also a first gen, URM student (should there be opportunities tailored to this background.)

I want to know precisely what I can do at this stage in my college career to maximize my chances of landing an offer next summer.

&#x200B;

Right now I'm considering:

\- Applying aggressively to any and all remaining startup swe (fintech?) internships for summer 2023

\- Finding a programming language/systems research gig (possibly concurrent with internship) for summer 2023

\- I plan to be a course assistant for a functional programming course at my school next fall

\- Grinding Leetcode

\- Any particular concepts I should self-study? Book recommendations?

\- Any relevant side projects I should build?

\- Any particular extracurriculars I should consider pursuing?

&#x200B;

Lastly, if anyone is willing to share with me a copy of a resume (or elements thereof) that proved successful in the JS/quant SWE internship recruiting process that would be much appreciated.

As the title states, I’m looking for some advice as I am graduating in May and don’t really have any family or friends with experience in corporate jobs. 

I have an offer from Netflix for a backend engineering role, but I recently accepted an offer from a smaller, more local company in the midwest for an embedded software engineering role. I feel that the smaller company would be a great culture fit, but Netflix pays about 2.5x more. The COL for the midwest would be substantially lower than Silicon Valley, which would balance that out somewhat, but Netflix would still be substantially higher.

But even after scrolling to the least represented schools, there are barely any non T20 CS schools for SWE or T20 overall for Finance, which leads me to think that there's some hard filtration going on at the resume level.

It's a little disheartening to see that these companies operate as. I know many talented individuals that opted to attend their state school over an Ivy for financial reasons. With holistic admissions and such, it's usually things like ECs and legacies that grant people an Ivy ticket over a top public. It's kind of icky, the way these companies seem to be upholding and perpetuating a lot of institutional privilege.

I applied for the NETFLIX New Grad Software Engineer 2024 role last month, and I haven't heard back yet. I was wondering if anyone else has heard back, either for an interview or otherwise.

I know that Netflix is a very competitive company, and that the new grad hiring process can be lengthy, but I'm starting to get a little anxious. I'm really excited about the opportunity to work at Netflix, and I'm hoping to hear back soon.

If anyone has heard back, please let me know in the comments below. I'm also curious to know if anyone has any advice for the new grad hiring process at Netflix.

tciond,I'm a senior in high school and have a technical phone assessment with Dropbox in a week for a full-time position. Looking for feedback on my 7-day study plan.,"Edit: I can't believe it but I got an internship offer from Coinbase! 

First off, I am not trying to brag. I understand I am very lucky to be in this situation. I apologize if this comes off as arrogant, but I really am looking for advice. 

I got a coding assessment from Coinbase, but it turns out it is for a full-time position (this is a problem because I am going to college next year). I thought why not do it and maybe if I get through the interviews they will let me just be an intern. So, I studied DS&A and LC for the past week in preparation for the Hackerrank assessment. I completed it today and passed all the test cases.

Last week, a recruiter from Dropbox reached out to me on Linkedin saying I was a great fit for a position she is trying to fill. I had my phone screen today, and she said she would move me forward in the interview process. However, I learned that this is also a full-time role. I explained to her that I will be in college next year, and she said that I could still go through the interviews and that if I passed I wouldn't have to take them again when I re-apply for the internships for next summer. My phone technical interview is next Friday.

Now I know what ur thinking “how tf is this possible”?. I have a lot of experience but honestly I have no idea either. Maybe the recruiter just didn’t realize I’m in high school and now she’s gonna ghost me? Or maybe not? Idk 

I've decided I will spend next week (which is my spring break) grinding Leetcode and DSA. Right now I can solve most easy LC problems but not any medium ones without some help or peeking the answer.

Here is my 7 day study plan: 

# One Week Study Plan

## Every Day

- [ ]  Watch youtube video on each topic (if none, read EPI chapter)
- [ ]  Watch youtubers solve problems with that topic
- [ ]  Do leetcode problems on that topic
- [ ]  Complete previous probelems I couldn’t solve on my own",2022-03-12 15:27:06
11z00fg,From zero to two summer internships in 24 hours - My journey and tips,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my recent internship search journey with you all. Since September, I had been applying to multiple openings every week but had not received any offers. However, things changed drastically in the past 24 hours, as I received two internship offers from different companies. Here's how I did it:

1. I kept my spirits high: Despite the numerous rejections I faced, I never gave up hope. I stayed positive and reminded myself that the right opportunity was out there for me.
2. I tailored my applications: Rather than submitting generic resumes and cover letters, I tailored each application to the specific company and job opening. This showed that I had put in effort and was genuinely interested in the position.
3. I networked: I reached out to people in my industry and attended networking events to meet new people. This helped me gain valuable insights into the job market and also opened up new opportunities.
4. I practiced my interview skills: I knew that interviews were the make-or-break point for any job application, so I made sure to prepare thoroughly. I practiced my answers to common interview questions and also researched the companies I was applying to.
5. I stayed persistent: Even when things seemed bleak, I kept pushing forward. I continued to apply to jobs, network, and improve my skills.

In the end, all my hard work paid off. I received two job offers in the span of 24 hours, and I'm grateful for the opportunities. My advice to anyone going through a tough job search is to stay positive, tailor your applications, network, practice your interview skills, and stay persistent.

150vsst,Does Sundar Pichai know how to code?,"Not a shitpost, but discussion. Hear me out. We all know sundar pichai - right? The guy who owns google. What if I told you he actually doesn’t know how to code - or at least doesn’t code on the job.

I looked up his autobiography, I promise I don’t stalk people, he’s just very famous in my home country and I see him as a big inspiration.

Pichai received his bachelors of science from the Indian Institute of Technology, a very prestigious STEM university in India with a <1% acceptance rate and admitted students usually score in the top 99.99 percentile of the Indian national exam system. At IIT, he studied metals - yes metals. And the engineering of them.

He then studied Material Engineering at Stanford, surprising he did not do CS. And then MBA at Wharton.

What’s surprising is that before he even joined google, he was a business analyst at **McKinsey** and those people definitely do not know lines of code. In fact, the joke is is that if you can’t code but want money you go to McKinsey. 

He joined google as a product manager, and eventually his promotions to current were in product management, from ChromeOS to Search. Product managers don’t code.

With a background in consulting, education in business and material/metal engineering, and a career in product management, one can only help but speculate if the man actually can code - and if so how often",2023-07-16 03:50:21

18bzz29,"If you can't stand LC, don't force yourself to do it","I'm posting this because it saddens me to see a number of my friends starting to do LC. They absolutely can't stand LC but do it anyway because they became desperate. The thing is that they often fail at the resume screen, and I am very confident that they can do the technical interviews just fine.

&#x200B;

When I was a junior, I started to realize how insanely difficult it was to get my first internship. I started to realize that no one looks at grade at all. I went into a F**A**ANG interview, got a pretty easy question, and completely bombed it. The solution was obvious, and I think a lot of people arrive at the same conclusion. I had done like 3 LC questions before that point. I felt like doing LC was the only way I could've succeeded.

The thing is, I absolutely hate LC. I love reading code so I signed up to tutor & TA. I love doing big projects for distributed systems, networks, and OS. I love coding in general. But it makes me utterly sick and depressed to do LC. When I finish a LC question, I don't feel pride. I wouldn't feel satisfaction for finishing a hard. I just felt empty. It felt like a chore. I felt like I was grasping for air, constantly out of breath, trying to push myself to do LC. Sometimes, I felt like throwing up. It was disgusting. It wasn't the feeling I get from finishing a pretty decent multithreaded web proxy or a distributed arbitrage broker. Those were real projects, real challenges. It wasn't that LC wasn't hard. It was very hard. The thing that I hate so much about it is the sheer meaninglessness of it. It wasn't true CS. No one in their right mind solving a real CS problem would approach it like they would a LC question. I had to ignore every instinct I'd developed in my CS education. But I started to do it anyway. Like many, I'd thought that there was no other way. 

Months passed. Only 36 LC questions at this point. I finally got an interview. I did not get one since I failed the F**A**ANG one. Days before the interview, they canceled it. At this point, I felt like all the work I'd done, all the fundamentals I'd learned were for nothing. And I was darn confident about my fundamentals. It was depressing. However, due to that interview being canceled, I had a moment to sit quietly and think. I couldn't attribute any deficit in my skillset to the fact that a company pulled the rug under me. It was just bad luck. Still, I have a process of comparing how much I've learned over a period of time. And during the time when I focused on doing just those 36 LC, which I knew was not a lot, I learned nothing.

The only outcome of forcing myself to do something I hated was to demotivate me. Not only that I couldn't spam 50 LC questions a day, I couldn't focus on applying because it was so demoralizing. The stress from doing something I hated only exponentiated the blow from getting rejections. And a more practical reflection showed that I wasn't really improving at doing OAs either.

&#x200B;

The point I'm trying to make is that it's worth considering if doing something as a means to an end is really worth it if it brings immense negative effects to your mental health. I believe that these effects are more detrimental to the pursuit of one's goals (such as getting an internship) than the loss of practice when you don't do LC.

The thing is, my fundamental knowledge wasn't for naught. I doubled down on reading books, doing projects, research, and chatting theory with random professors in the hallway. I dropped LC entirely. I became much more productive. I felt confident for the first time in almost a year. When I was doing LC, I went into every OA paranoid. I felt pressured to search my brain for patterns to link the questions to LC. That was a mistake. The fundamental knowledge from core classes that I took overwhelmed the tiny amount of LC I did by a lot. Instead of linking my thought process to what I knew, I linked it to what I wished I knew - but in fact, I didn't know.

The next interview that came, I nailed it. The OA was hard but I went with a clear head. I read the question and laughed a bit because it was such a beautiful problem. I used to be afraid of OAs. I used to make it my goal to solve OAs just as I solved those LC questions. But in fact, true CS is really in the appreciation of both the solution and the problem statement. And I appreciated this detailed question in front of me. I was confident, but more importantly, I felt compelled to give an equally elegant solution. I ended up getting the offer. After the internship ended, I secured a top-performer return offer. My LC solved count has remained at 36 since.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** If you hate LC but love CS, don't sacrifice that love to achieve your goals. There are always other ways. LC is not the only way. Build upon your passion to solve problems not the giant weight of your declining mental health.

&#x200B;

Also, this pertains only to people who can't stand LC. I understand that many people can stand it just fine and prefer it over reading a bunch of books and screaming ""Stroustrupppppp"" every time they read one of his papers. Some people even do it as a hobby. While I can't claim to understand them, I respect that they are doing what they are comfortable with. I hope that this post vibes with people who feel like me, whose mental health drops through the floor trying to grind LC. I know that these people are out there, and I want them to know that they aren't the only one who feels that way. Please do what you enjoy & comfortable with. I promise it'll pay off.

Step 2 is to make sure you have internship experience. Projects are useless. Don't listen to some sleeze bum on here telling you projects help make you stand out because they don't.

13hhi2t,Is A CS Degree Still Enough To Be A SWE?,"I’m currently a senior in my computer science degree and over the past 1-2 years with the hiring freezes and rapid advancement of AI, I’ve had a few older people in senior level positions at tech companies tell me I should consider getting a PHD in CS or a law degree for the longevity of my career. They seem to think that the pay for SWEs is going to take a massive hit in the nearish future and unless you’re working on AI research or closely involved in the development of it, you’re not going to have much value as an engineer. 

For clarity, the phd in cs would allow me to grow vertically in the industry and stay competitive if a time comes where the average SWE is worth pennies on the dollar so to say or the law degree would allow me to branch out and be a middleman for tech legislation, especially as AI grows it seems likely there will be an increase in concern for liability and having both a tech and legal background could be very beneficial. 

I’m still of the opinion that climbing the SWE ladder is a safe, viable route even for the long term. At the same time, if the trend for SWEs is heading in the direction these people are saying I want to get ahead of it. 


The point of this post is for me to hear other opinions, both for and against, this argument so that I can learn more about the tech landscape and help me weigh my options. 

tldr: As a CS senior, I've been advised to consider a PhD in CS or a law degree due to AI's impact on SWE roles. I still believe in SWE's long-term potential, but I'm looking for insights to help shape my career path.",2023-05-14 17:05:12

I am thinking of buying an iPad and have it replace my laptop. The pros I see is that I don't have to carry a notebook around for taking notes.

Furthermore, the device is light and I can carry it around effortlessly.

The downside, since I am a CS major, is that I  programming on an iPad is impossible, at least that's what YouTube told me. Sure, we have a lot of computer at my university and I could probably just practice and complete homework on them.

I'm a high school who's always been interested in medicine, but now would like to switch to CS. However, I don't have much time left till college apps, and don't have too much CS experience. I know HTML, CSS, and Java, and will probably learn JavaScript over the summer.
With my limited coding experience, I'm not as experienced as students who've been coding since like middle school, but I still want to go to a prestigious CS university (GT, UIUC, Umich, etc). Is it possible for me to get into these universities for a CS major without having much CS experience? Will they understand how I switched really late?
Besides that, I have a good GPA and have good ECs, volunteering, and leadership. I just lack my experience in computer science. Do you guys have any ideas of what I could do in high school to increase my chances of getting into a university with a good CS major? 
Thank you!!

EDIT: thank you to everyone who commented, your guys' advice and information were really helpful. I have learned that coding experience may demonstrate a strength to colleges, but it's Still possible to get into a great CS program without knowing how to code.

qqjdy2,I am cheating my way through Linear Algebra. Will this bite me in the ass later?,"I am a freshman cs major in college that's cheating his way through Linear Algebra. Like, basically the whole way. I use a PDF for the homework and since all of the tests (aside from the final) are online, I just have a friend who's good at math take it with me and help me on the problems. I don't know what's going on in class or in the homework generally and I understand about 40% in the quizzes/tests although I can usually crack out an A or B with my friend helping.

My question here: will this bite me in the ass later? All of these concepts feel so abstract and pointless. Let's say I only understand about 60% of the content (as I do): will this come to kick me later down the road in my major or in my career? Will eigenvalues and linear independence matter to me 1, 2, 5, or 10 years from now? Thanks",2021-11-10 02:04:21

jekzxj,Why Aren't Teachers Held Accountable When A Student Fails?,"I know sometimes students fail because they genuinely are lazy. 

But does anyone else think there is a huge imbalance of power when it comes to students and teachers? An imbalance much like living in a dictatorship, and not a democracy (where the state is equally afraid of the citizens as the citizens are of them).

It feels like a teacher isn't afraid of anything. They can be as big of a d\*ck as they want, and its only the students who have to tolerate them. 

There are courses out there where the pass rate is 55%?

WHY!?

If a student fails, the teacher has to be questioned FIRST. It's the teacher's job to teach the student, if the student fails, it means the teacher has NOT TAUGHT THE STUDENT.  They have failed in their duty as a teacher. Or does the teacher have no duty?

If a course's pass rate is less than 80%, then it means the teacher isn't doing their job properly.",2020-10-20 07:50:59

12alcyz,college dilemma," 

Hello CS majors, I was contacting since i had a dilemma over which college i choose to attend. Your thoughts would go a long way to help me out

Schools: Berkeley EECS Regents vs Harvard:

Intended major: CS but also very interested in BME, comp bio and physics

Quant jobs are at the back of my head too cuz of the $$$

I feel like I have a great personal fit with both colleges

Berkeley: (36k COA)

Pros:

1. EECS program goated, I don’t think Harvard cs is that good
2. Regents perks- housing guarantee, faculty mentor, research funding, peer mentors
3. Close to silicon valley + more industry rep than Harvard i think
4. Engineering at least what looks to me is considerably better
5. Salaries after graduation >>>>>>>>>>>>, placements at top firms

Cons:

1. Crimes
2. Crowded classes- at least initially
3. Fewer resources per student/ harder to get research opportunities
4. Grade deflation

Harvard: ( 25k COA)(friend told easy to negotiate it to even lower)

Pros:

1. Prestige
2. Smaller class sizes, personal connection with profs, better LORs
3. MIT cross-registration
4. Course choices, I am not 100% sure if I wanna do cs
5. Biomed engineering/nano/ anything bio-related goated
6. natural sciences goated
7. grade inflation

Cons:

1. CS program is not that great
2. Salaries after graduation are not as high as Berkeley
3. Unsure if Harvard has good cs/engineering placements at grad school
4. Don’t know how employers look at Harvard cs/engineers
5. Elitism",2023-04-03 14:00:04

However, after seeing all these boot camps, and courses, and how literally every person in the world wants to do it (especially also from high-population immigrant countries like India), would it be a bad idea to major in it due to the high influx of IT interested people? Because I can definitely see it becoming an issue in the future. Already there are a lot of people coming into the workforce. In another 5 years, I don't know what's going to happen and what the market will look like.

Not to mention the high change of salaries to decrease due to the high quantity.

rrcp7m,Got into Microsoft after 10 FAANG/Big Tech interviews,"I’ve been in the industry for 3 years as a software engineer now (although I’m still technically in school for my MS).. and I’ve never seen the market so hot in terms of hiring for CS students /Software Engineers . I, as well as my friends, had so many recruiters reaching out to us for interviews - and many of them FAANG/Big Tech companies. So I figured I didn’t have anything to lose when I decided to do 10 interviews over the span of 6 months. It was a whirlwind, but man, it was a struggle to remember all of those Data Structure/Algorithm fundamentals without LeetCode + AlgoExpert.

I had interviews at Meta, Google, Reddit, Microsoft, Amazon, and LinkedIn. And it was SUCH a mixed bag. Honestly, i used to think you had to be a genius at getting into these companies (and you obviously have to have some sort of willpower/intelligence), but after this process, It’s definitely all about preparation and reacting to failure. They expect you to try 2,3,4 .. even 5 times before actually getting in. By the time I got to my tenth interview (MSFT), which I ended up getting an offer (yay!),I had essentially failed my way to the top. My mock interviews had just been REAL interviews… bumbling through speaking out loud, preparing for certain concepts (easy/medium/hard) by difficulty months in advance, doing practice “tests”, practicing my elevator speech etc. they’re testing you on literally how far you’re willing to go in order to get the role. Anyways, I’m curious about other people’s experiences interviewing with FAANG/Big Tech companies?

Is FAANG even still considered prestigious? I've had no problems getting interviews for FAANG, and at first I was super excited about these opportunities. But now it seems like everyone around me is receiving offers from Tier 0 companies (Jane Street, HRT, Citadel) while I have received nothing but rejections. I recently accepted an offer from Facebook but from talking with my friends, I realized they are accepting almost everyone this recruiting season. I'm so sorry if this sounds conceited, but I just feel like I can do better and I'm no longer looking forward to my internship. 

What do I have to do to receive responses from the better Tier 0 companies? For context, I go to a T5 and I previously interned at Google (Tier 1), and Microsoft (Tier 5) but I'm still not getting interviews for Tier 0's.

Currently I am a senior in high school working towards to applying to college as a CS major. I've actually gotten acceptances at my safety schools and ASU.

Naturally, from those acceptances, I started browsing the usual CS subreddits. As even though I have to apply to my other colleges and finish my senior year strong, I want to get an idea what I need to do next year, whichever college I end up picking.

But every single fking time, the top posts are always people being complete assholes to each other. Whether or not they an URM and they got the internship based on affirmative action. Making fun of colleges people go to, not doing enough leetcode, etc. I even had people say that I'm trash for having ASU as a target school.

Like, listen i completely get that. ASU isn't my first choice either but can't I least be happy that regardless of how my other college applications go, I'll be going to college to study CS? That it takes a big pressure off my back knowing that, I can go there and work hard and learn everything I can about this field? I know that I won't have the same advantages of someone who goes to MIT or other tech schools and I'm going to have to work harder to get my name out there in internships and leetcode but I'm prepared to do that.

Is all of CS like this? I mean, we had assholes during high school but everyone just knew they were assholes

Tons of college grads are unemployed. Everybody and their mother in Colombia is a doctor, an environmental engineer or an industrial engineer or some other spinoff of a traditional engineering discipline. What they're not, though, are computer programmers.

Over the past 5 years, the country's tech scene is really building up w a handful of unicorns and smaller startups. I believe that unlike all the other careers in Colombia, being a programmer is not saturated bc it's not yet mainstream (even being a doctor is saturated in Colombia for context). People think computer science, those have even heard of those words, is about fixing computers.

First post on this sub- I just honestly feel really lost and need some hope that there's light at the end of the tunnel. I did well in high school but when I entered college for CS, I just really lost myself in addition to doing bad academically (like HORRIFICLY BAD). Now I'm in the second semester of my third year and things are starting to get better- doing better in school etc but I'm just realizing how far behind I am now. I knew how important internships were coming into school and yet I hardly tried to get any. Now I'm about to enter my fourth year and have no SWE internship experience and even though I started applying this week, feel like there isn't much hope for me to get enough experience before I graduate (and it's incredibly unlikely I get an internship this summer anyways as most companies have closed their posting). Meanwhile all my friends are getting internships at Google, Meta, Amazon, or really cool startups and while I'm really happy for them (I genuinely am, it fills me with so much pride for them seeing how far they've come), I can't help but feel despair at my own circumstances for how far I've fallen. I just don't know what to do with myself. Even if my grades are great this semester and in future semesters, I can't make up for how bad I've done in previous semesters (though my degree will be 5 yrs), I have no job experience, and a shit ton of student debt. And yet part of me still hopes I can break into Big Tech for internships and make my parents proud even though that seems impossible now. I'm just lost. I just wish I could have been better but still have a little bit of hope i can turn my life around. Any advice for how I can do this?",2024-02-03 09:00:44

Hello there, recently I started a CS degree course, currently in the first year, second semester, and one of the issues I’m having is with classmates and colleagues constantly coming up to me saying that “I have this amazing idea, we should build and sell it”. I’ve had this exact line said to me a couple times in the last week.

Now I know collaborating with others is a great experience, and at the start of the semester I already started 2 projects with my friends for learning purposes and possibly to market with if it works. But recently some classmates and even old high school colleagues have asked about working on some project or business idea, and I have no time to dedicate to them because I’m trying to do my own personal project and building my own idea, as well as balancing it out with my course.

The issue is even after declining and saying I’m busy with my own stuff, they continue to persist. Does this happen often? The ideas they have are interesting, but they involve parts of programming that I barely know, like frontend-backend, complex AI, etc, where I mainly delve into low level programming and video games, only recently having learnt how to make apps. After telling them I am inexperienced they continue to go on.

How do you guys deal with this?

Thanks in advance and have a great day!",2023-11-24 19:49:49
15oyarr,Should I switch back to CS?," 

I am about to go to my third year of college at a decent university in California. I was originally enrolled as a computer science major with big scholarships and priority registration. In my freshmen year, I was extremely motivated and excited to learn about code. It wasn't until my spring quarter at the end of freshmen year where I really began to become hesistant on coding as a career. I remember being in a notorious weeder class and having to code almost every waking hour of my time as a student. Although I did like the aspect of problem solving when it comes to code, I began to question life and my sanity when I debugged for hours at a time. It felt like I spent more time debugging my code than I actually did writing. I remembered debugging so much that I genuinely appreciated going outside to touch grass and letting the sun hit my body. I just grew to resent code and debuggging the constant homework assignemnts.

What makes matter worse is that I developed severe dry eye the following summer from my first year of college not really due to code but from contact lens abuse. In my second year, I tried going through discrete math but my eyes would burn so much while studying that I had to drop the course. I had really bad dry eyes and switched out a lot of my rigorous CS classes for econ classes as a backup plan. My dry eyes have somewhat improved but there are nowhere as perfect as they used to be. I'm just anxious going into a field with a lot of screentime and debugging with the condition of my dry eyes.

Furthermore, it seems nowadays that the field itself is rather competitive and oversaturated. I feel like I have to be grinding code 4-5 hours a day, leetcoding, buidling personal projects, networking, and maintaing a high gpa in a rigorous major just to be noticed for internships and jobs. I understand that I have to put in the work but sometimes I feel so overwhelmed with the condition of my dry eyes and just how ahead everyone around me is. I took a year off from code just for my eyes to adjust and now I feel really depressed and behind from the rest of crowd. I do enjoy coding somtimes but I absolutely hate the fact of having to debug for hours on end with dry eyes (my eyes are very veiny now).

I'm graduating next fall and was hoping to find a FAANGM or even big N co-op in the fall semester. I'm just wondering if I even stand a chance against someone from a top CS school. My GPA isn't the best either, 3.3. It's pretty obvious someone that goes to a top 10 CS school has a much higher chance than me, but I'm wondering if it's possible at all.",2021-11-14 01:06:11
pwq4lc,Is it a big deal if you don’t get an internship freshman year?,"Hi!

I’m a current freshman, and thinking about applying for internships for the summer. The thing is, I don’t think I want to do one this year.  I’d much prefer to spend my summer with my family this first summer then be gone for the next few summers while I’m doing internships. I’m kind of far away from for college and I really do miss my family.  I can’t imagine being gone for even six weeks over the summer this year.

Am I shooting myself in the foot with that though? Programs like Explore Microsoft and Facebook University seem great and very enjoyable, as well as the fact I’ve heard URM have had a really good time at said programs. But if I try to get into those programs my sophomore year would that be alright? I fully intend to keep boosting my portfolio by making programs and expanding my GitHub- but I don’t want a formal internship.

Also, and I don’t know how much this helps, but my school ranks well for Comp Sci and is (IMO) pretty well known/a target school. I don’t know if that factors in at all,  but I thought it might be helpful to mention.",2021-09-27 20:43:31
nst0k3,Grinding Leetcode in a co-living space,"Since many people can study remotely now I was curious to know if anyone would be interested in renting out a villa, in for example Bali, to start the Leetcode grind for 2022 summer internships.

Of course, if want to work on something other than Leetcode, that‘s cool too.

mgqwmu,Bringing light to Simpson's paradox and other methods of lying with statistics with the increase in talk about sex and race in CS,"There has been a lot of evidence brought up to support some of the claims regarding how people's race and sex have affected their chances of having a successful career in computer science. I've seen a lot of claims like 'only x % of UC admissions are black' or 'y% of women have had unwanted sexual advances in the workforce' or 'the interview rate for this minority group is z% lower than this minority group'. While some of these statements are completely valid and add to the argument, others are just twisted ways of looking at statistics.

144j47w,Getting a swe job is a lot easier than you think,"I think people underestimate how incredibly easy to get a swe job and make decent TC like 70-100k comp in MCOL and LCOL areas. I'm a new grad and never really had to grind leetcode. I just had strong CS fundamentals like being able to code, understand my OOD design, data structures/algo, etc.. and a good communicator. I was able to pull 2 job offers at defense and a big fintech firm in this sht economy with massive layoffs. My TC wasn't sexy six figures like big tech but I was able to land TC between 80-100k as an entry level swe at MCOL region. It's crazy to me how people keep on emphasizing being great at leetcode but honestly you don't need to be a wizard at leetcode to get a swe job. I mean if you are trying to go big tech sure then that helps but other than big tech leetcode isn't that big of a deal for other firms. I think my biggest advice is to have incredibly strong fundamentals so pretty much everything you learn from CS curriculum. Also, the job market isn't that bad as people make it sound on reddit. Subreddits like this are just bunch of negative freaks and lazy sleaze bums trying to make you feel like the world is falling apart. In my experience, there a lot of job openings for entry level and you just need to find them! It's true competition is fierce but if you keep trying there will be a company that will give u a chance. FYI, I don't even go to a T20 school and absolutely 0 referrals. All I did was cold apply. Trust the process. Be smart like me and cold apply and have strong CS fundamentals. It works like wonders. Referrals help but you are limiting youself if all you do is just go for referrals. I'm not going to lie tho but once your foot in the door as a swe, you will feel like top 1%. I mean software engineers make bank and highly respected so whenever you mention you are a swe to a pretty girl, she will go home to you. As a broke college kid, you get no girls attracted to you but once you get that sexy swe job oh boy they will all want to come to you. That should be your biggest motivation besides $ is to flex your bank account and title to non-swe folks. It's still mind blowing to me how much earning power you can have with just  a 4 year cs degree. I mean I laugh inside whenever someone says being a doctor has higher earning power. That's true but that is only if you are able to get through 8 years of academic bullsht of memozrization, study and residency. The process to get there is insanely difficult. A lot of people end up either dropping out of med school or do something less highly paid and carrying 200k debt. As a swe, you can be a millionaire before 30 if you play your cards right ",2023-06-08 19:50:23
zmuirp,Unpopular opinion: CS degree is easy,"At the risk of sounding elitist and getting downvoted, I wanted to share my thoughts on this in hopes of finding out if my opinion is actually unpopular. 

The CS degree is fucking easy. I see a lot of post about people saying classes are hard, how they don’t have time to study for school and practice leetcode, etc. Compared to my friends in other majors (like electrical, chemical, and mechanical engineering) my degree is a joke. Now I don’t go to a top school (it’s only T50) but from what I’ve seen, most degree plans involve some sort of core classes and then some electives that you can choose. And most of the electives after the core class are easy af. After the core classes, I genuinely feel like the degree is so free. I have a friend at Berkeley and he also says it’s crazy easy for being a top school in CS. Maybe it’s just us, idk. 

And no, I’m not smart. In fact, it’s the opposite. I’m dumb as a bag of bricks. So if I’m saying it’s easy, you know it’s easy. I genuinely feel like if you just want a job that pays good money out of college, the ROI on CS degrees are out of the roof.

105yq0g,Advice for those who are in their final year of CS: NOW is the time to start applying for jobs,"I know it seems a little early, but it's really not. This last semester is going to fly by and you want to be ahead of the curve. The last thing you want to do is start looking for jobs in the summer because that's when the market is going to see a huge influx of new grads and you're just going to be a needle in a haystack. If you want to guarantee yourself a job before you graduate, then start now.

Here's what you should do:

1. Start creating your resume. Figure out what projects to put on there (school projects are okay if they're done well and showcase your skills), what skills you want to highlight, your experience, and so on. I highly recommend heading over to r/EngineeringResumes and read their wiki. It's one of the resources that I used last year to build my own resume when I started job hunting around this time.
2. Practice interview questions, and I don't mean leetcode ones. I'm talking about good ol' interview questions that you're almost guaranteed to be asked like ""tell me about yourself"" or ""what do you like about this company"". I suggest creating a new word document, and writing down your answers for common questions, including questions that you will be asking the interviewer at the end... then memorize them. In an interview you're not going to be repeating every word that you have in your word document, but you would have a good idea of what you're going to say when asked. You don't want to seem robotic but you also don't want to seem like you're unprepared and just winging it. Practice what you're going to say and get comfortable with your answers. If you don't know what your answers should look like then I recommend watching the The Companies Expert on Youtube, his videos are a great starting point.
3. Look through job postings, and start applying for jobs. Ideally you would want to apply to jobs that fit your experience level and qualifications, but it is okay to apply to jobs where you don't meet 100% of the requirements. If you feel like you like the job is a good for you, then go for it.
4. Create a word document or an excel sheet to keep track of every application that you send. Write down the position title, company name, the date you applied, the location of the job, whether or not you got an interview (I found it helpful to also record the dates of the interviews), and the status of the application. For the status I usually mark my applications as ""rejected"", ""no response"" (if I didn't receive any response in 14 days), ""active"", ""received an offer"", or ""turned down"". The reason why I recommend doing this is because you're going to be submitting a lot of applications and at a certain point they'll get really hard to manage. I had to submit a total of 63 applications before I secured my current job, and I found it very helpful to be able to know which positions I applied to already, where my applications are at, whether or not I'm improving, and so on.

There are a couple of more things to mention regarding interviews. First, you should understand that your job in an interview is to sell yourself. You want to look like a polished product. You should dress nice, look clean, be polite, and act confident. If you're having a remote interview then make sure you're sitting in a clean and well lit area where the upper half of your body is clearly visible. The second and final thing that I want to mention is that when you first start getting interviews, understand that you WILL make mistakes. You will say something stupid, you will ramble on and on, you will get nervous and have your mind go blank, there will be awkward silences... And that's okay. Having a bad interview experience is not the end of the world, you have to pick yourself up and try again. You just have to learn from your mistakes and make sure that you do better in your next interview.

Other than that, happy hunting and good luck to you all!",2023-01-07 20:26:24

I want to make Director level, earn more etc. And I noticed a lot of people at the top in Digital Marketing are usually CS majors or Computer Engineering.

I'm in a career rut. I'm not growing. I've been doing this for 15 years in the same company with two promotions. I'm f*cking up interviews with the Amazon's and META's and similar companies in my interviews or getting flat out rejection emails without even a phone call/screening.

I realise I'm slower when it comes to learning but surely if I can work hard enough and beat the interview and attain solid grades I could possibly do it? Or is it just not realistic and I'll be too old and not smart enough by the time i graduate. Is there anything I could do to improve on how quickly I learn or problem solve?",2022-08-15 09:44:59

I was pretty good in mathematics during my highschool. I get hyperfocused while solving a tough problem but also get quite restless if I'm given with a    boring problem. I struggle to keep my attention at sth for long. Being surrounded by introverted thinkers, I constantly question myself and my self worth and feel insecure for not being like them.

Am I taking the wrong decision simehow? Will I be really able to sit before a computer for long hours and enjoy this career? I want to have freedom and have enough money to travel a lot.


Anyway, please do advise me what I can do to maximize my efforts in this field. I always wanted to have introverted nerd like persona..but, It's really hard to change your core and I do believe one shouldn’t try to change who they are internally.

1bi39q1,Do CS Majors hunt animals?," I currently work at one of the big techs and recently wanted to try out hunting animals. My family are asian immigrants and live in the city so I don't have a family background in it but they were encouraging when I said I wanted to try it out.

I tried to ask my co-workers to come join me but none were interested. Also I couldn't find any channels at my company where anyone even mentioned being interested in hunting animals.

In any case last weekend I attended an in person class and just got hunting certified. I noticed I was the only asian person there. Everyone else seemed to have grown up on a farm and had a family with a hunting culture.

I wanted to make this post to ask if I'm really the only software engineer in big tech who's going into this hunting hobby or did I just find no techies in hunting out of bad luck coincidence?

The reason this matters is because I want to ideally go hunting with someone experienced and know well. I also want someone that lives in the city near me rather than in a rural area that is very far away so carpooling is easier. Unfortunately it seems that so far I'm on my own and will have to search on random hunting forums and clubs for people to help me out.",2024-03-18 21:57:55

They said that i didn't work enough hours and said that when i will have more time we can try again. When i got enough free time i agreed again. They said that after one month we can talk about money and a part time job as developer. One month passed and i said to my curator, who's very nice guy, that it is time to talk about money. Curator said that the department boss will come in 2 weeks and i should talk to him. Boss arrived and said that we need to talk to the owner but the owner was in another town. One day later i called my boss if the owner was available to talk. He said that owner is not at work rn. I said ""Well.. Then call me when the owner is available.Until then i will not come"".

In result, I selected the answer he told me and after submitting it. My grade turned out to be an 80. The boy who told me the answer got up and got his backpack and said that he told everybody the answer because he like the lie. You imagine the feeling that is going through my body. I was so infuriated with the fact that I knew the answer and I chose to listen to him. What made me even more mad was that like what kind of human being does that to someone?

142wdg9,Worried about majoring in CS as a girl?,"I'm just about to end my junior year of highschool, and I'm pretty set on majoring in computer science when I get to college. The thing is, I've been looking into some of my schools of choice, and I feel rather uneasy about applying. I'm sure everyone feels that way about the process every once in a while, but I'll talk to my friends who are pretty serious about their studies (already writing essays and seeming to know much more about the process than I do; also mostly guys) and often they'll discourage me from certain schools without much of an explanation as to why.

While most of my concerns are to do with a lack of self confidence, or feeling as though I'm not good enough to be some awesome ""woman in STEM,"" I've been researching some of these institutes on my own time and looking into the gender ratios, and some of the information I'm finding makes me feel a little uncomfortable with the idea of going into a STEM-type major, but I don't know what else I could study that I'd enjoy as much as I do CS. I feel as though I'm going off into a tangent, but it'd really help to hear from some people who are either in college as CS/STEM majors, or have gone through uni/grad school in the past, or even other highschoolers in a similar situation. I'm just worried that the place I end up might either not take me, or that I'll be discriminated against for being a girl. I'm working on building up a good background in cs so that the schools I'm interested in will consider me a good candidate, but sometimes I wonder if what I'm doing is enough for them. a few of the colleges on my list that I plan on applying to are:

* Stevens Institute of Technology
* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
* Northeastern University
* Stony Brook University
* Rutgers University

bvte1e,"Sad and regretful, going to the University of Michigan as a Canadian After Being Rejected by Waterloo and Toronto","I just finished my first year at the University of Michigan and I honestly thought it would be better than what ended up happening. At the time, Michigan was my first US acceptance after being rejected by Georgia Tech and waitlisted by UIUC and I was super excited to get in and thought I should definitely go to Michigan because I want to move and work in the US after graduation and since I'd heard a lot of good things about the school. Michigan ended up being the only US school that I got into even though I thought I had a decent shot at UIUC/better schools; I ended up getting rejected from Berkeley, CMU, UCLA, USC, Georgia Tech, and UIUC. For Canadian schools, I got into UBC and another safety but was rejected by Toronto, rejected Waterloo computer engineering, and deferred to Waterloo Honors Math from Computer Science.

&#x200B;

I knew I wanted to go to Michigan even before the rejection from Waterloo and I took it as oh, well I guess I'm definitely going to Michigan and was still really excited. I thought Michigan was still definitely better than Waterloo since I wanted to go to a school with good research and industry prospects and had an amazing college experience.

&#x200B;

After this first school year, I see that the majority of my friends at Waterloo have good internships that are better than mine where they're actually paid while I do a shitty part-time unpaid internship for a non-tech company and unpaid research. I initially got ghosted by the mass majority of the 300+ positions but I got final round at 2 places and an interview with a well known tech company for a data science position intended for MS/PhD students so I thought I was hot shit until the 2 final round interviews rejected me even though I thought I did fairly well. I know my resume looks pretty good considering multiple recruiters and people who have interviewed me told me they're surprised I'm a freshman but I guess it doesn't mean shit when I barely get replies and probably had juniors and seniors that were picked over me because I'm not good enough to compete with them. My parents spent 60k USD for me to come here and although I know I'm very privileged that they wanted me to get the best educational opportunity possible it pisses me off how I know students with much less impressive resumes working at the Microsoft Explore Internship while I got straight up rejected. Maybe I'm just stupid for coming here as an international Canadian student when I should have just swallowed my pride and went to UBC or by some miracle transferred into CS at Waterloo.

&#x200B;

I'm just disappointed in myself. I thought I could do so much more at Michigan but I was even rejected by their undergraduate research programs and had to find research on my own and was rejected from so many university affiliated opportunities here. I don't want my experience at Michigan to be a 240 thousand dollar mistake but it just doesn't make me feel well knowing I'm not doing jackshit at what's supposed to be a better school than Waterloo and my parents are paying so much more. I guess it's my fault that I didn't focus enough on school in high school and can't join my friends at Waterloo. Toronto is also basically the slightly worse Canadian equivalent of UMich yet I got straight up rejected there for computer engineering even though I've looked on LinkedIn and have stronger achievements than most students I looked at. It's my fault though, I didn't pay enough attention to my high school grades even though I did pretty well on standardized testing and I paid the price.",2019-06-02 03:45:24
12wxy84,You Don't Need a 5-Year Plan,"Hi everyone! I'm a recent Berkeley graduate, who studied CS in undergrad and EECS in the 5th year master's program. I wasn't an obvious candidate for the CS department -- before I came to Berkeley, I had never taken a CS course before and knew almost nothing about it. I was a big writer and a huge fan of journalism. But I wandered into CS, and later into AI research at BAIR.

I wanted to catalogue my thoughts about that path -- which felt a lot different to me from the highly calculated (not in a pejorative way) grand designs of many of my EECS classmates. I wasn't guided by any kind of 5-year plan but by intuition and half-baked interests.

I wrote a piece about all of this (you can find it here [https://posttruth.substack.com/p/how-i-got-into-computer-science](https://posttruth.substack.com/p/how-i-got-into-computer-science)), and how it's shaped my views on making plans, constant goal-setting, and the need I feel to devise some grand design when beginning new ventures.

I want internships and work experience as an SWE so I can have a competitive starting salary when I graduate college to pay off debt etc (90k/yr since that's the average starting salary at my school).

Problem is, I will graduate in 2 years assuming I take the full-time student route. I have no experience aside from doing some minor game development (think games that take less than 10 minutes to complete) in C++ using Unreal Engine.

For those who are not craving to sit down for 30 minutes through the whole video, it's basically about the CEO of NVIDIA saying that AI will take over the computer science scene, and learning how to code will soon become irrelevant, if I have not misunderstood the video.

Of course, I am not planning to knock down the nice tower of university-prep I was crafting just because of this one CEO guy yapping about AI. However, I did feel like it is a time to actually consider what's going to happen in the next 8 years, which is when I will graduate university (probably). I have talked about this to people around me, and I wanted opinions from you guys, the experienced ones in the scene! I just thought that the more opinions the better.

So, what do you all think? In 8\~10 years, will computer science become irrelevant? Would it not be worth trying to major it in university at this point? All types of opinions are accepted, I would love to hear each and every one of them from you all. Thanks for passing by!",2024-02-14 02:38:31

Some major considerations:
1. Crypto industry and trading is down, and the crypto HFT firm’s profit has took a big hit in profits ever since.
2. I am super interested in quant trading myself, probably moreso than being an SWE. However, instability scares me - If crypto goes down and my firm goes down, I’m not sure how easy it is to a quant trader role in another firm considering how competitive the field is, and at that point it might be difficult to hop in to a big tech.
3. I do not have a big tech internship in my resume - only a few small tech startup internships and an internship at this HFT firm that offered me
4. Big Tech company in question is a social media company that’s been thriving the past few years and look to be super stable.

nudu1b,Feeling extremely demotivated after a drop in my GPA.,"Hey everyone.

I’m (F19) a CS and Math double major sophomore (going into junior) next year. Throughout my freshman year I’ve thankfully managed to maintain a GPA of 4.0 and was really happy about it.

My sophomore year however, the courses became a lot more difficult and demanding. Taking math and CS courses without any electives to lighten my load really took a toll on me and it showed on my GPA. I went from being a straight 4.0, to a 3.92, to a now 3.87.

Yes, I am aware that the GPA is still good. However, I put all my time and energy into my courses, which means I haven’t been doing any internships or personal projects. Every time a vacation rolls around, I’m either too burnt out to do anything, or I’m doing a summer semester and can’t really intern because of it.

I feel extremely hollow and demotivated and upset that my efforts haven’t really paid off the way I wanted them to. And now it’s EXTREMELY difficult to raise my GPA (I need to get like a bunch of straight A’s just to raise it by 0.01). I keep comparing myself to others and beating myself up about it to no end. I’m paranoid that I won’t have anything to put on my CV (literally no awards, no internships yet, no personal projects, etc).

ynvmqv,From rejection everywhere to landing $85+/hr internship,"(throwaway acct) 

Freshman year of college, friends told me it’s possible to get an internship as a first year, but my fat inbox of rejections clearly said otherwise.  
 

September of freshman year: I ran to every career fair possible, sending out 100+ applications, not knowing what an elevator pitch was (saying all the wrong things), and pretty much missed all the fundamental points that are needed during this whole process. Rejection was everywhere, and I was pretty much the average Joe in a sea of people seeking the same thing I wanted.  
 

I spoke to some older, more successful friends about this, and had them polish my resume, LinkedIn, and mock interview with me, amongst other things (like getting a really good grip on one programming language, Python, instead of spreading myself thin)  
 

\- Nov. of Freshman year: Eventually I get some LinkedIn message requests: “Would you like to work at x, y, and z”. Rare but a handful, don’t appear to lead anywhere  
\- Nov. - Feb. : I attend conventions, every career fair, even interviewed with some delivery companies (UPS was nice)  
 \- Feb 1st: Have a lead with a relatively Big Name company, and engineer says I’m a good candidate: that is, until he finds out I’m a freshman, in which case he starts to reconsider my application. I’m starting to think ""Wth am I gonna do this summer"", while my successful friends go off to their internships in cool places.  
 \- Feb 3rd of freshman year: “Congratulations on your offer to work at \[Insert huge computer company here\].”  
 

Starting salary: $75,000/year + $2k/month for housing (that come out to almost $100k/yr as an 18 year old kid, **$24k in one summer)** Internship was remote and housing money was pocketed.  
 

Turns out, one of those LinkedIn companies that hit me up months prior had finally decided their minds a month or 2 after my final interview.

After completing that internship, and getting invited back, I decide to see what other options I had. I end up only applying to 5 top tier companies, and get 3/5 offers back. 

After completing the second internship with the new company, I go shopping again and my experience speaks for itself and end up landing a company that pays me 85$/hr. 

Freshman year mission: *More than complete*  
   
**Reminder that all you need is ONE yes! Getting over the initial hurdle is the biggest challenge and your life becomes significantly easier afterward.**  


I don’t say this to flex or to show off or anything (doing it on a throwaway account for a reason) but mostly to show that these results are possible. I know I really needed this advice/motivation when I was in my first/second year.   
 

If you’re interested in working on this journey yourself, feel free to dm me with any questions. I mentor around 3-6 students at a time, but with more than half of them already getting internships, there’s space for 3-4 people who are really interested in growing professionally as well.  
 

TL;DR: Got rejected everywhere freshman year, spoke with the right people, and now I’m at where I’ve been wanting to be. Find the right people to surround yourself with. DM me with any questions, and if you’re interested in learning more.",2022-11-06 16:55:15

I want to thank everybody for their immense support, everyone from your average Joe cs major to Indian-Americans who were able to share more about their culture and how that might impact my decision. 

Simply put, **I have decided to continue CS**. However, my relationship with my boyfriend has definitely changed significantly. We sat down to discuss everything, from his family’s views to his little brother’s opinion.

First off, his brother apologized in such a professional and sorry manner, probably one of the most genuine apologies I’ve seen ever. His tone in voice made it sound like he was on his knees begging for forgiveness. He communicated that he was not a sexist nor had any reservations about women being successful in the industry, he just made an insensitive comment that implied men will always be more successful (or at least paid more than women). After he explained, I decided to forgive him.

Now to the more juicy part, I spoke with my boyfriend and inquired if it was really social/cultural traditions that women can’t be the breadwinner in India, and he said yes. I asked again, this time telling him to be completely honest and nothing he says would affect our relationship. Now the situation has **evolved**. The major problem is that I’m not Indian, so his aunt won’t accept me… knew it lol. He didn’t wanna tell me in fear I’d leave him. He was crying and shaking after admitting this to me. 

Cs + working was a superficial problem, the main problem was me being white, and his family not being ok w that. Nevertheless, he’s asserted that he still loves me and does not agree with his family at all and will continue loving me. 

He came to visit today, as he knows this whole drama rifted our relationship. And it was the first time I didn’t answer the door to my own boyfriend. I gestured that I needed some time (both for myself and away from him). 

He gently left gifts and a card on my front door, apologizing for the situation and promising me he’ll talk it through with his family. I just didn’t know how much interracial couples were taboo in India.

Although I don't feel disadvantaged, I know many people with similar identities ""took advantage of it"" and got into the minority programs in big firms in both the finance and the tech fields. I am wondering if anyone with similar experience would like to speak for it or suggestions on whether I should apply.

15e03ny,How can I pivot from Cybersecurity?,"For context, I'm a high school student who got into a summer program at MIT called BWSI. BWSI is basically an intro level undergrad course crammed into 4 weeks. Students get admission by course, and I choose the cybersecurity one.

The course names focus a lot on the final project you create, all of which seemed pretty lame to me. However this means that I skipped over the NLP course which was disguised as the ""create a virtual assistant"" course, or the CV course disguised as the ""medical analysis"" course.

I feel dumb now, but I picked the cybersecurity course based solely on how cool the name was, and lowkey regret it. The course is fun, but I've come to the realization that a career in cybersecurity would be incredibly stifling for me, and that I prefer to be building things, not defending them. I'm pretty fond of the pure math we learned, so I figured I'd explore careers there.

By participating in the course, I get access to many internships the summer I graduate high school. I want to build a project or two to maximize my chances for an internship focusing on AI, but I know that my competition are kids who spent their summer improving on their AI knowledge. Is there any way I can pivot off of my knowledge? A project I can build at the intersection of the two fields? Or should I just cut my losses and begin learning as much as I can about AI.

Thanks in advance.",2023-07-30 23:35:57

1bhsm2c,Is doing Masters (M.S) any worth in USA?,"
Wouldn't even ask this question pre-covid or even during COVID. I would have jumped head first in this pool.

But now that the job market is erratic and all major companies are laying off / restructuring, is doing masters worth it?

I (24M) am from India. I work as an automation / cloud engineer and earn above average salary here. But more than half of my friends have migrated to either USA or Germany to pursue Masters. My job seems somewhat repetitive at times and it is less challenging but more time consuming. I feel like I could do much better if I were in an R & D environment rather than a product release focused environment. My job at times can be a bit stressful and my counterparts working in Europe / Canada / USA make a cushy income ( 120K - 150K  salary for an engineer with 2-4  years exp is good right?) and work only 40 hrs while I have to work 40-60 hours with an OK income. Management is also toxic here. 

I would have to take out an education loan in order to pursue Masters and based on the universities it might range from 100K - 150K USD. 

Is it possible to pay back these loan within 2-3  years and lead a better life in USA? 

Also, how hard is it to get a job if you already have 2 years exp plus start applying from 1st year in Uni?

Would really appreciate your 2 cents 🙏.

But everyday people on this sub are listing all their academic achievements and still not getting jobs. If people can’t even do basic math then who is the one taking these jobs ?

16sg5ah,My professor is being super harsh,"I'll try to keep this brief. I just wanted to vent a little and maybe get some advice. I have already reached out to the professor so we may set up a meeting to discuss this matter one on one. If that doesn't go well then I intend to take this to the higher ups such as my major's department.

So, we had our very first homework assignment/project due recently and note this assignment is worth 10% of my entire grade. I completed the assignment in its entirety and am proud of the work I've submitted; I think it shows that I put time and effort into this.

I am a computer science major, so this assignment was coding based. We were expected to turn in the coding file (.py file type) and a .pdf file type of the exact same file, just converted as a .pdf.

The assignment was due at midnight, and I had finished prior but had trouble attempting to save/locate the .py file from my computer, fortunately I was able to convert the file to a pdf. and save that. With the deadline drawing near, I decided to submit the .pdf file on canvas and shortly after added the .py file in the comments of the submission with a brief honest explanation of why I only submitted the pdf. version of my work initially.

A few days later, my professor essentially says that we were expected to submit the .pdf and .py files together as a whole, and that my entire submission cannot be accepted because I did not meet that expectation. We have a late policy, and he didn't even seem to consider enforcing that, he just voided the whole thing.

I mean I'm at a loss for words. The .pdf file is literally the EXACT same as the .py file but just saved as a different file type. Everything, all the work I did for this assignment is clearly all there in the .pdf. I understand this is the requirement and want to respect it, but to just toss my submission and 10% of my grade with it is just insane to me. Lesson learned but I really hope this finds a better resolve in time. I can't help but feel panicked until it does.",2023-09-26 06:32:58

q1pbxk,How do people work at startups and manage to live in HCOL places like SF with only a $120k salary?,"This might be extremely naive but it's a genuine question I've been thinking about for going to work at a startup postgrad.

If we consider a base salary of $120k, then after CA/fed taxes you have about $79k left ([source](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-paycheck-calculator)). Assuming $3k rent per month in SF ([source](https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ca/san-francisco/)), that amounts to $36k towards rent, leaving about $43,000 left to spend on other expenses, or about $3.6k/mo for living expenses.

Even if RSUs are 60k a month as a startup these shares are essentially paper until IPO so that doesn't actually help you to live

Maybe my perception of the word is severely warped but $3,600 doesn't seem like that much to live on  if you also want to invest for the future and be able to pay for bills, etc, compared to working at FAANG where RSUs are guaranteed extra cash.

Is there a secret trick people use to survive and save at the same time while at a startup or is my sense of cost of living completely skewed?",2021-10-05 06:52:35
poytb5,How to get paid well during the school year?,"During my freshman year, I had an internship for $15/hr. During the summer, I had an internship that paid about $34/hr. This school year, I have a technical part-time job at my university that pays $20/hr. Next summer, I have another internship making $49/hr. Obviously, I'm taking a huge pay cut during the school year, and I want to minimize that cut.

When I accepted my job for this school year, I was thinking that $20/hr is probably the best I can get as far as part-time jobs/internships go during the school year. All the listings I saw online for part-time work during the school year that paid >$20/hr were either lying about it being part-time, looking for people with a bachelor's degree, or were web dev positions (not my desired career/specialty). I also felt that companies that paid well were only looking for full-time interns.

I want to keep my current job for this school year because my boss says he gives good raises, the work has the potential to be rewarding, and will give me great connections for my desired career, but I want to ask this for next year - How should I go about getting part-time work for during the school year?

I like doing this but I can't help but think of how I was rejected by them, yet can make a helpful contribution to their team directly through open source..

In my spare time, I like to contribute to open source projects that I am highly interested/invested in. The last thing I want to do is spend this time doing DSA mind riddles..

I had time to prepare for these leetcode-style questions. However, I did not spend time doing this on principal -- I do not agree that this kind of recruiting style determines that you are a good candidate. I suppose I was hoping we would talk more about things outside of that, but this did not occur.

I don't think these companies are testing what they think they are testing for. They recruit people who devote the most time to solving their interview questions (many of which you can find online) but the rest seems irrelevant. If they suddenly changed the criteria to testing who can solve a rubik's cube with their toes in the fastest time, everyone who start practicing that, and Microsoft would hire all these people who are good at toe rubik's cube solving.

Yes, I know I should probably just play their leetcode interview game to get the job, and it is my 'fault' for not doing so, but it feels so wrong..

I just heard back from a couple of former classmates who are doing really well for themselves. One is currently going to Alaska working as a lineman nailing six figure salary from high school, another is doing real estate investment and so far seem to be doing well, another has enlisted in the military (USAF, stationed in Yokota Air Base) and urging me to join him after. 

And meanwhile there's the CS students who are all trying to do the next best leetcode, the next best projects, the next best grades, and then just to be told that they either sucks, didn't get the memos that getting 5+ internships is key, or making barely enough to live in the HCOL they're in to the point where they're exhausted. 

At what point do I just not take it anymore? Oh, because somehow I'm lucky in the prospect that I get to make six figure salary at minimum starting off, living in overpriced apartments, going to the office every single day, and being at risk for layoffs when times get hard which will put healthcare, stable income, lifestyle, etc. out and into the street?

u6q5vl,Some advice for you guys,"Not a shit post.


Now that I’ve read through all of the comments on my post here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/u5xhvk/new_grad_quants_is_it_worth_the_grind/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf



I have made a few observations based on the comments that warrant the need for me to give you people some advice. Remember, I’m not better than you, I’m only a third year, but this mindset I’ve had all my life has served me right this far. 

This advice goes for really any role in STEM. Y’all need to start believing in yourself, and not believing in what people tell you. From what I gather, a lot of you guys lack confidence in yourself, and moreover allow what people tell you on the internet to sway your belief in yourself and what you can achieve. The internet is a great place for information, but you have to understand that in STEM industries, there are people who want to help you, and people who don’t want to help you because of the crazy competition, and tell you things that are absurdly false to keep you out. 

What is sad is a lot of you guys are falling for a trap that many people use as a classic way to limit competition: *talking about how an industry is gatekept for x type of student with x type of awards from x school”. You have to realize that:

A) does an Ivy League/target school help? Absolutely, does awards help? Absolutely, does top publications help? Absolutely, *but it’s not the end all be all* sure, you can believe yourself that you can’t get a job because of a school you go to, but saying that out loud to yourself you should realize how ridiculous that sounds.

B) the school you go to is in no way shape or form indicative of your intelligence, your SKILLSET and your ability to COMPETE and PERFORM is what matters. I have interacted with these so called “target” school students. They don’t know anymore than you and I know. Are there super crazy bright students that attend these institutions? Absolutely. But don’t think that they are better than you just because they go to a prestigious university. I’ve talked to some of these people and they are just normal students…. Not god.


C) Dont hold limiting beliefs on yourself. “I can’t do x positions because I don’t xyz credentials”. Last time I checked if your resume gets declined, no one sends a response to you saying “sorry, we declined you because you didn’t go to a target school”. You get the same rejection as everyone else. It’s up to you if it’s because you didn’t go to a target or not, but no one here confirms that you got rejected because of that. 
Also, it takes like 4 minutes to apply, you have been spending the same time applying to a place where your profile may be more favorable, why not put in the extra 4 minutes to apply to somewhere where you think you might not get in? There’s always the chance you might.

D) no one really cares where you went to school. After your first job your college education no really cares about. It’s about your previous job experience. Yeah sure, you went to a non target and didn’t have any math awards, sure, you won’t get into that top company immediately out of college. But no one’s saying you can’t apply after padding experiences elsewhere? At that point no one cares what you did in undergrad. 


E) confidence is everything. I can sit here and cry about how I don’t go to an Ivy League and not apply everywhere, but I don’t really give a rats ass who went to what school. I know my abilities and that I’m good at what I do. Have some f*cling confidence in yourselves. The instant people realize that a few comments on the internet can sway you from pursuing what it is you want to do, your absolutely finished. Because they know you don’t believe in yourself.

I'm a current sophomore right now looking to get into the tech industry, and my number one priority right now is landing an internship that would give me the easiest recruiting season next year. Ideally, my end goal after graduation is working in the tech industry, so I'm just looking for an internship that would allow me to learn a lot and boost my resume for Big N/Unicorns next summer.

**Citrix - 12 Weeks**

* Location: Santa Clara, CA (I live in the Bay Area, so I can just commute from home)
* Pay: $41.83/hr + $3000 reloc assistance (Don't think I can pocket it, I'd just use it to pay for flying all my stuff back home instead of driving)

**Bank of America - 10 Weeks**

* Location: Jersey City, NJ (Right next to NYC)
* Pay: $40.50 + $3400 Housing (I can pocket the housing stipend)

Money is my second priority in choosing an internship, since I plan to use some of the money to pay off tuition. I did calculate the amount of money I will make overall before tax and overtime:

* Citrix --> 41.83 \* 40 \* 12 = $20,078.4
* BoFA --> (40.50 \* 40 \* 10) + 3400= $19,600

I will save a ton more money with Citrix because I will be living at home and wouldn't have to pay rent.

I'm really torn. On one hand, Citrix is mostly a tech company, and they do cloud stuff, which is cool. I'd also save a ton more money overall working at Citrix because it is 12 weeks long instead of 10, and I would not have to pay for rent. I'd also commute with my dad since he also works in Santa Clara. I'm not seriously into finance, but I'm open to it; It's cool, but my goals align more with working at like Big N/Unicorn tech company. On the other hand, everyone knows what Bank of America is since it's such a large company.

What do you guys think?",2019-11-24 02:38:50

As an Electrical Engineer, I could work in software and hardware. With the oversaturation of the market and introduction of AI, the future of software engineering doesn't seem to be looking too great. Should I go all in on CS, or stay in EE so I can always do hardware stuff as a backup in case SWE goes to shit?

1bgh6j3,Should I still look for an internship ,"Hi everyone, 

I am an international student graduating this May and I am trying to find a summer internship or a Co-op though the fall before going into my first new grad role. I have been applying to hundreds of internships, but no offer yet. It’s March right now, is it too late? 

On my resume, I have a previous start-up web dev internship, AI research at a top university, Data Structures TA and grader experience, and a full stack personal project. 

Realistically, what are my chances of getting an internship in the US? ",2024-03-16 21:54:01
1b5j174,Should I take and then drop an internship?,"I have secured my summer internship at the end of last year, but kept searching just in case. 

My summer internship is a decent one, good pay (at least for me), housing and pretty fair location. The title is slightly off, but the job itself seems just right, I might renegotiate the title later with them. The industry is not tech and I am happy since it is safer there. The rating on Glassdoor is above 4.0 with a ton of reviews.

Soon I have an HR call with another company and most likely they want to discuss my availability. 

This is also an internship, the title is fine, but the job itself might be a bit more trivial. The location is personally a bit better, but CoL is also higher. The pay is 33% lower, but still the market average, however somewhat low for that location. No housing but I live in commutable distance. The Glassdoor score is below 3, which concerns, and it’s a smaller tech. 
BUT, I can start ASAP. 

I have already decided for myself that 99.9% that I am sticking with what I’ve got for the summer, but the question now if I should try to get this one for 3 months till summer?

3 months internship is a good deal for me, I don’t really care how they pay, because anything is >> 0. My concern here is that if I clearly state my intentions about 3 months they will not give an offer for sure. 

Should I do the dick’a move and take it and leave then? Or maybe you can give me some recommendations on how to approach the negotiation process to keep options open for myself?

I would appreciate any input",2024-03-03 14:55:28

Guys, tell me if this will be super hard and what should I prepare before going for it? Cuz dropout rates seemed super high...

EDIT: *sigh*...Just let me tell you about the degree I currently have...it is Bachelors of Music(Hons)..not BA, or BFA, it is BM which is even specific compared to BFA. I really cannot see any progression in this career, the most stable job is being a teacher and thats it. I know this is not the only way guys. Its not like I am bad in studies, I know I am rather good with it because some of my high school friends that are not as good in studies made it through CS too.

140h3n3,Am I doing good?,"Hi,

I’m an international student at one of T10 colleges, and I’ll graduate next year.
I got an internship at a small local company. (technically not an internship. It’s a regular position. I sent a cold email to the ceo and got this position.)
This is the first time working at a company as a developer. (no internship experiences before, but I’ve done many personal projects)

I started working two weeks ago, and here’s what I did for the first two weeks:

1. I understood backend code of the company’s mobile app. (code base is less than 10,000 lines)
2. After I looked into the app and understood the backend code, I told the ceo that I can make the app faster and cleaner (I wrote prototype code, and the ceo and IOS developer liked it)
3. I redesigned a database ERD diagram. 
4. I finished refactoring the entire backend code and migrating mysql db and data to postgresql db (I used Postman to test the code and its performance, and I’m sure it will be much faster.)

I struggled with getting an internship and got rejected so many times, and my mental health wasn’t good. I thought I’m not good enough and not ready, so I didn’t expect that it’ll be easy to work on real world apps and projects.

I want to ask you guys how good I am as an entry level engineer based on what I said above.
It may sound bragging, but I’m serious… I had no professional experience before, so I really don’t know how to measure where I stand and how good I am compared to other students and entry level engineers.",2023-06-04 15:52:08

As a side note i didn’t really have to worry about things like personal branding etc as I had good grades.

I am in my junior year of college but close enough to graduating that I can spend a semester doing an extra internship, so I have decided to spend both the summer and fall of 2022 to do two internships.

I am hoping people can provide insight and advice as to which companies are best, as I don't know enough about work/life balance and culture.

I'm currently leaning towards Citadel/CitSec, because they are offering a significant signing bonus and compensation, but I have also heard they have a very high turnover rate. Also, if anyone has experience working here I'd also like to know which side is better to work for, Citadel or Citadel Securities, because I ended up getting offers from both.

On the other end of the spectrum, I'm leaning away from Goldman Sachs because I have heard they treat their interns and employees somewhat poorly (long work hours), and they don't pay as handsomely either.

All of the companies are providing either corporate housing or a housing stipend, so relocation isn't really an issue.

Unfortunately I can't fit everything in one poll, so I'm going to exclude Goldman Sachs as it is my least-desired choice.

My resume is pretty good. I am currently interning as an Application Engineer at Google. (I was also offered an SWE internship at Amazon). I was a Research Assistant at my department. I also worked as a Student Software Developer at my university and was a senator at my University's Student Government. I also have a 4.0GPA.

ehraic,Data privacy for Ethereum -- Announcing the Launch of Enigma’s First Networked Testnet!,"Today we are extremely pleased to finally announce an important milestone: **the launch of Enigma’s very first networked testnet**!

As you may recall, our previous major milestone was the release of our developer testnet in June. This allowed developers to easily begin building [secret contracts](https://blog.enigma.co/defining-secret-contracts-f40ddee67ef2) to power their own applications and solutions. Since then, we’ve released a number of [monthly development updates and other posts](https://blog.enigma.co/developers) keeping our community informed about our progress towards the mainnet release of Enigma’s protocol. As we mentioned in our first [Open Community Call in November](https://blog.enigma.co/recap-enigma-open-community-call-november-2019-9dac4adea6c3), we set a target of December 2019 for our next major milestone: our first networked testnet release. **Today, December 23rd, we are proud to have achieved that milestone!**

**This new release, for the first time, allows “**[**secret node**](https://blog.enigma.co/secretnodes/home)**” runners to begin connecting to Enigma’s Discovery testnet** and staking their own testENG. Secret nodes are worker nodes that perform privacy-preserving computations in Enigma’s network — and they form its backbone and foundation. We are happy to share that thanks to our active community, **the first independent nodes have already successfully connected to testnet!** The secret contracts for [Salad, Enigma’s coin-mixer implementation](https://blog.enigma.co/salad-coin-mixing-with-enigma-1c565adee79c), have also been deployed to the Ethereum testnet and Enigma.

Reaching this milestone means we are also getting closer to the launch of the [Genesis Game](https://blog.enigma.co/secret-nodes-everything-you-need-to-know-2c75c72046e2). During this period, secret nodes will compete to become the first mainnet nodes *(genesis nodes)* in Enigma’s network, earning the first network rewards and fees. Only 50 genesis nodes maximum will be selected, and it is critical that all node runners can maintain uptime and support the stability and reliability of the network. More information can be found in this [exhaustive blog post](https://blog.enigma.co/secret-nodes-everything-you-need-to-know-2c75c72046e2) describing secret nodes, the Genesis Game, network economics, and more. We hope you will choose to run your own secret node and help Enigma support the privacy of the decentralized web!

Privacy solutions have never been more critical to the blockchain ecosystem — and to our world. Networks like Enigma are needed more than ever. Please read on to learn what the release of our networked testnet means now for node runners, developers, and Enigma’s ecosystem and community.

What This Means For Node Runners

As mentioned above, this first release of Discovery’s networked testnet means the community can begin setting up their own secret nodes. Some dedicated community members have already successfully set up their own nodes and connected to the network! Our team and community will be available to provide support to other node runners and answer questions on our [Developers Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/SJK32GY) and [Developers Forum](https://forum.enigma.co/).

Practical information on connecting to the testnet can currently be found on the [Enigma Github](https://github.com/enigmampc/discovery-testnet). For questions pertaining to nodes and node setup specifically, please use the [Nodes subforum](https://forum.enigma.co/c/enigma-nodes/8) of the Enigma Developers Forum. Over the coming weeks, we will be refining our nodes documentation and adding it to the existing [Discovery documentation](https://enigma.co/discovery-documentation/). We will also release more information in the coming weeks about staking providers who will be supporting Enigma’s network.

Note that this release does not mean the Genesis Game will start immediately. We are giving ample time for node runners to get familiar with Enigma’s network and to attempt to connect their own nodes. Our development team is also working actively to stabilize and strengthen our testnet, and further releases will follow before the Genesis Game begins. There is no hard date for Genesis Game to begin at this time. [As mentioned in previous posts](https://blog.enigma.co/secret-nodes-everything-you-need-to-know-2c75c72046e2), we intend for the Genesis Game to run for four weeks, after which all genesis nodes will be selected as follows:

* The top 30 nodes by genesis score are selected as genesis nodes. (Note that there will be a threshold for minimum uptime percentage in order to qualify. You will also need to have an average stake above 25,000 ENG.)
* More nodes (up to 20 maximum) will be eligible for whitelisting based on contributions to the Enigma ecosystem, primarily those building supply-side tooling for workers and staking operations, as well as valuable but harder-to-quantify contributions during the testnet phase / Genesis Game (such as identifying critical bugs).

These genesis nodes will be the only nodes eligible to operate when Discovery launches on mainnet, and they alone will receive network rewards and fees until more nodes are added to the network. (Please consult [earlier posts](https://blog.enigma.co/secret-nodes-everything-you-need-to-know-2c75c72046e2) for details on how and when secret nodes beyond genesis nodes will be added.) The successful completion of the Genesis Game is our last major milestone before Discovery can be launched on Ethereum mainnet!

What This Means For Developers

This release does not change much for developers, as they’ve already been able to use our [protocol documentation](https://enigma.co/discovery-documentation/) to get started building their own secret contracts. The only thing changing is that we will be providing even more support for developers and our developer community going forward!

Between our recent [Gitcoin bounties](https://blog.enigma.co/enigma-bounties-roundup-420184ffd2ec) and the [outstanding projects built on Enigma at ETHWaterloo](https://blog.enigma.co/community-update-enigmas-ethwaterloo-trip-report-7f521fc0b89b), there has been so much progress made exploring the possibilities of Enigma’s protocol. In 2020, we will be exploring even more hackathons (including [ETHDenver](http://ethdenver.com/)), more bounties, and other developer initiatives. We also have a number of community members who have begun building their own longer term projects on and with Enigma — so stay tuned for more information on this!

If you’re interested in building on Enigma — or if you’ve already started — please let us know about your projects and ideas! Post on our [Developers Forum](http://forum.enigma.co/) or get in touch with our team using this [inbound form](https://airtable.com/shraD9Oo5HPmRR9eE). We’d be happy to reach out to you and provide whatever support we can!

What This Means For the Enigma Ecosystem and Community

This networked testnet release allows us to continue working with our great partners and collaborators towards the mass adoption of decentralized applications and smart contracts. It will also help support the adoption and development of early applications built on Enigma (such as [Salad](https://blog.enigma.co/salad-coin-mixing-with-enigma-1c565adee79c), a coin-mixer developed by the Enigma team).

As we recently announced [in a co-authored post with Intel](https://blog.enigma.co/enigma-discovery-bridging-private-enterprises-and-public-ethereum-30302f5f9f5d), Discovery is the first implementation of the EEA Off-Chain Trusted Compute specs for a public stateful network. **With this release, we are taking a massive step closer to bridging the privacy needs of enterprises with the public Ethereum ecosystem,** breaking down one of the biggest barriers facing mass adoption of Ethereum. Enigma has also begun actively contributing to the specifications of the Trusted Compute Framework v2.0. Our team and collaborators look forward to bringing you many more updates on this work in the near future. To stay up to date on this and other progress, please sign up for Enigma updates below!

What can Discovery do?

As covered in previous posts, including [our developer testnet release](https://blog.enigma.co/the-discovery-testnet-developer-release-is-live-57db09fa23e) and [our implementation of the EEA’s Trusted Compute Specification](https://blog.enigma.co/enigma-discovery-bridging-private-enterprises-and-public-ethereum-30302f5f9f5d), Discovery introduces a number of novel features.

Stateful (Encrypted) Secret Contracts

Secret contracts are capable of maintaining a state, allowing to persist encrypted data between private computations or different tasks. Stateful contracts enable many more use cases than stateless computations.

Secret Contracts decoupled from Smart Contracts

The Enigma network only relies on Ethereum as the consensus layer, but is otherwise decoupled from the requirements and limitations of Ethereum. This means that secret contracts can have their own runtime and programming language (Rust, instead of Solidity).

Private Outputs

In addition to private inputs, the network supports storage of computation outputs by storing the contract state encrypted on chain and sending results encrypted directly to the dApp user.

Ethereum integration

Secret Contracts may call arbitrary functions of any other smart contract deployed on Ethereum.

Peer-to-peer and storage layers

Completely redesigned from scratch, these functions are now an integral part of the Enigma network and no longer rely on Ethereum.

So what can I do now?

As covered above, there are a number of ways you can begin or continue contributing to Enigma and our ecosystem right now!

First, if you have interest in becoming a **node runner** and participating in our networked testnet and mainnet, please first read through [our complete guide to secret nodes](https://blog.enigma.co/secret-nodes-everything-you-need-to-know-2c75c72046e2) which covers many common questions, including around staking and rewards.

You should also read through our full [Developers Blog](https://blog.enigma.co/developers), which contains helpful information such as our [Developer Quickstart Guide to Enigma](https://blog.enigma.co/the-developer-quickstart-guide-to-enigma-880c3fc4308) and our [Technical Resource Index](https://blog.enigma.co/enigma-technical-resource-index-bd9110714ea6).

If you are a **project or enterprise** who is interested in building on Enigma and learning more about what is possible, please read through our [Solutions blog series](https://blog.enigma.co/solutions). You can also read through some of what has already been built on Enigma by reading our [Gitcoin Bounty Roundup](https://blog.enigma.co/enigma-bounties-roundup-420184ffd2ec) blog post and our introduction to [Salad, our coin-mixer implementation](https://blog.enigma.co/salad-coin-mixing-with-enigma-1c565adee79c). Reach out to our team directly by [filling out this form](https://airtable.com/shraD9Oo5HPmRR9eE) — we’d love to help you learn more!

Finally, if you’re a **member of the Enigma community** who just wants to be more involved with the project, you should consider joining the [Enigma Collective](https://blog.enigma.co/collective/home)! The Collective is the core of Enigma’s community and helps support the protocol in a number of different ways, from refining our visual identity, to working on business use-cases, to strengthening our developer community and documentation, to creating educational materials about data privacy, and much more. You will work directly with our core team and other Collective members and have special access to unique resources. There’s never been a better time — so we hope you choose to join us!

The entire Enigma team is thrilled to have reached this major milestone, and we could not be prouder of the tireless and ambitious work of our internal development team. Now we are excited to see our community set up their own secret nodes and take a more active role in the future of Enigma. A huge thanks is due to our community (and especially the [Enigma Collective](https://blog.enigma.co/collective/home)) for their patience and support over the past years!

We look forward to 2020 and the many opportunities of the decade to follow. The new year will bring the Genesis Game and Enigma’s first mainnet, and we will be aggressively expanding our ecosystem and awareness of our privacy solutions — both inside and outside the current blockchain space. Stay tuned to this [blog](https://blog.enigma.co/) and our [channels](https://twitter.com/enigmampc) for more announcements, including our second Open Community Call scheduled for January 2020.

**Enigma’s mission is to create a strong and secure foundation for the decentralized internet.** The future of the web depends on Enigma — and Enigma depends on all of you. Thank you for joining us on this journey.

Onwards and upwards,

I shaked a little bit while presenting and people seemed uninterested with my idea. I don't know anything about business and had to present my business model in front of freaking consaltants.

8mmjqw,Choosing between two professors and undergrad research projects for grad school,"Hi all,

I am seriously considering applying to grad school after my undergrad. I am entering my senior year and I have done several internships at top tech companies. I've done some independent research at one of the Big 4's and the paper is currently pending publication at a conference. This paper isn't anything too significant and is the area of computer architecture/distributed systems. All my internships have been in software except for my current one which is more data science/machine learning.

I am leaning towards doing a PhD in AI/machine learning or perhaps even a PhD in Statistics in the States/top 10 AI school. I am trying to decide between two potential undergrad research projects I work on in my remaining terms before applying to grad school.

This first professor I know fairly well through an OS course and we've hit it off well during/after class. He knows that I was one of the top students in the class and is very open to me doing a research project with him. His research area is primarily in low\-level systems/OS. His alma mater for both his Master's and PhD are both at schools I'm looking at \(top 10 CS/AI grad schools\) so I believe he has many valuable connections.

I have also been in contact with another professor who's area of research is in AI/NLP/machine learning. I do not know this professor too well outside of the few times we've had conversations about a potential research project. He did his PhD at top 10 AI grad school that I am somewhat looking into.

I would probably be more interested in the work and project with professor #2. Professor #2 does not know me as well as professor #1 so I am not sure he will write as strong of a recommendation letter. Professor #1 will most probably write me a very strong recommendation letter. While he has connections to his alma mater \(schools I am interested in\), he did do his grad degrees in systems so I am unsure how much weight his letter carries relative to professor #1.",2018-05-28 01:55:04

vm6648,"Unpopular opinion(?): if you’re smart enough to work at a trading firm, you should build a startup instead","In my opinion, Trading firms are one of most disgusting forms of domestic brain drain in countries with large financial hubs. It frankly feels like a waste of intelligence to have all these smart people working on making rich people richer and market making vs building startups that solve big problems (I.e. deeptech, biotech, AI etc.)

Now, one could make the argument that the type of intelligence that lends itself better to quant trading is different than that of startup building. However, in my opinion, at a high-level, both come down to problem solving and dealing with abstractions. Someone who is successful in trading can be likely be successful in startups (I.e. Alexandr Wang // Scale.ai)

I’m really interested in programming I’ve made an app with firebase and done up some python as well! I am trying to stand out to get a scholarship by joining a load of competitions both international and national representing my school. Though I don’t win them all I did have certification and knowledge. I am aiming on being computer club president (I am just waiting to be old enough to do so). I have decent grades. 

Those were just a vomit of what came to my head. So like the real question is like how do I get a scholarship or minimally excel in programming more. Should I do more competitions or Coursera or smth? Like what can I do with my Mac and an average brain to land into the CS field? Ik many of the ppl here are literal giga brain 14 core processor (you reading are too :) ) so like what now?

1bgoclf,Why does no one specialize?,"It seems like I am coming from a totally different side of CS. Right now I’m going through all the fundamental classes, and a lot of people are complaining about not finding jobs.

One thing I’m noticing is that a lot of people don’t have either a passion, or interest in CS. Most of these guys I know in my classes are just doing the bare minimum. One guy I knew went in cause “it was interesting” and then failed out.

I just feel like with CS, there needs to be a passion that keeps you interested. I’m tired of seeing people who only know leet code and a few languages, and an internship or two expecting FAANG jobs out the gate.

I think that’s why specialization, and research is needed. It makes you stand out. 

Right now I am starting undergrad research, and I am trying to specialize in work with the military or aerospace. Therefore, I am learning those skills.

16vs0we,Inside Look: How Hiring Really Works at Tech Companies (You Might Not Be Surprised),"Hey everyone,

I recently joined a unicorn company as a new grad SWE and got a peek behind the curtain at the hiring process, and was able to confirm/demystify some of the tech hiring myths I've been hearing:

1. **School Elitism**: It's real, and it's prevalent. Whether we like it or not, candidates from 'top-tier' schools often get prioritized. Sometimes, they're even fast-tracked straight to the final round of interviews if they go to one of the ""top"" schools and have a high GPA. In fact, my company is doing exactly that for interns and new grad candidates. I was lucky enough to be among those who got fast tracked because I went to one of their target schools. I was pretty confused about that at first because some people I knew from other schools who applied to the same position received OAs instead. After I joined the company, I found out about their target schools from an internal doc where they maintain a list of schools/programs they'd hire from along with some name-callings on which programs/companies to avoid hiring from due to having ""low talent density"".
2. **The Resume Screen**: This stage might be *way* less RNG-based than you think. It might appear very RNG because to outsiders it seems like a big black box that either spits out ""rejection"" or ""move on to the next stage"" emails. But as you may already know, they have certain ""algorithms"" or ""heuristics"" that decide who are their ideal candidates. This is probably not news either: I learned that many resumes never even see human eyes and are usually graded by an automated process. Recruiters who claim that they personally review every single resume are most likely just capping unless they really enjoy the job of reviewing resumes! Fun fact: I managed to see the source code that ""reviews"" your resume in one of the code repositories. I accidentally found it when searching through some irrelevant internal documentations. Apparently it was some python scripts written by the CTO himself, which basically consists of a bunch of if else statements that lead to three possible outcomes based on where you go to school and your GPA: 1. fast track to final 2. normal pipeline 3. send ""thank you"" emails.
3. **Tough Competition**: We received over 10k intern applications after we open the position for just a week. To put this into perspective, it's equivalent to receiving one application per minute on average after the application opened. It's a record high number but we are slowing down hiring this year and only have 10-20 spots to fill for this internship position.

Although what I described above might not be representative of all the companies out there, it's pretty much true for most companies that people here would call ""prestigious"". If you've had similar insider knowledge or insights on hiring, I'd also love to hear them. Finally, I just want to say the job market is really tough right now. If you are struggling to find a job, just know that you are definitely not alone. It's a stressful time so please remember to take care of yourself first!",2023-09-30 00:11:10

I will be 19 when I start this internship, I just happened to get the offer a few weeks before turning 18. I graduated HS at 16 with a 3.0 GPA, enrolled in a community college, and did 1 year. Transferred to a SUNY as a Mathematics Major for Spring 2023. I took 3 classes(non-STEM) in order to grind for an internship, polished my resume by going to hackathons, joining the E-board of a club, and doing side projects. All the CS-related knowledge I have is self-taught and Im a chump compared to people I know. After 300+ applications with over 50 rejections, and getting ghosted by several companies, I was able to land an internship for this summer(python instructor @ camp) and the one mentioned in the title. I have worked in restaurants since I am 15 picking up dirty dishes and getting paid minimum wage, so the compensation offered to me is well enough to put me through 2 years of college which is a huge help considering I'm not getting any help from family members and I have no academic-based scholarships. It is crazy to think I was considering joining the Marines 6 months ago because I thought I was not smart enough to compete in this current market and the fear of not getting into the current University I am in. Anything can happen if you put in enough work and you sprinkle in a fair amount of luck.

In a few years if this keeps pace there simply won't be any senior level left cause no one wanted to train junior level. What will they do then? Keep on begging to the sky until pigs fly and the man with 5 or 10+ years of experience falls out of the sky? 

Everyone wants a house no one wants to build it, I get that, but they have to figure something out here cause this model is simply unsustainable. If nobody offers internships or offers new grad jobs, you'll simply have a more strained budget long term cause you'll have to shell more out of pocket for retention.

Also, what exactly is it that special something that someone with 3-5 years or 10 years of experience has that makes them so infinitely more valuable than an entry level person with a Computer Science degree? If there are things that employers want students to have that they currently do not, why don't they make majors more specialized then, or at the very least, provide a clearer path towards career progression that does not require job experience, since companies are refusing to offer that right now?

Do they want everyone with Masters, PhDs? That isn't too uncommon in other fields where the expectation is an X level of education. 

What is gonna happen in 2 years when all the people who couldn't get jobs graduate? Or are the T100 companies going to be the only ones who offer internships from now on and the other mid-size firms going to be fine fighting for the scraps, even if long term it wrecks their bottom line?

I've got a fantastic paying job lined up where I'll be making more money than I even thought was possible when I was a kid. I'll be living in the SF Bay Area, exactly where I've wanted to be, too. 

I should be happy, right? I can't help but feel like I'm going through the motions. I worked really hard to get here, and yet I feel so unfulfilled. I have it all now: financial security, a loving partner, and a job a lot of people would kill for. 

Yet I can't help but feel empty and pointless. I even have hobbies; I love to draw, code, learn to play the piano, and do marathon running. Do I really care about the ""mission"" of the company I'm going to be working for? Am I going to find fulfillment being yet another SWE cog in the corporate wheel?

All I feel is oncoming dread. I know I'll continue to learn things on the job, but I just don't think it will be what I *want* to learn. I always wanted to study machine learning more in-depth and how it applies to computer graphics. I've always wanted to work in the creative animation, videogame, or film industries, but with my cookie-cutter full-stack SWE skillset, it seems so out of reach to me.

Sure, I can code an MVP of a full-stack web and mobile app on a weekend, or integrate with a giant legacy codebase. I learned these things because I *needed* to get an internship, a job, or any light at the end of the tunnel for college. I never got the chance to learn the things I'm genuinely interested in, like computer graphics, animation, etc. because I was too busy trying to stay afloat.

And sure, I've been passionate about making web apps before, but more often than not it feels soulless and dispensable to me. Like anyone else could do what I am doing and it wouldn't make a difference.

I know I'm probably overreacting, but I just can't help but feel dreadful, feeling like I wasted my time studying what would make me employable vs. studying what genuinely fascinates me. Where do I go from here? I am feeling genuinely lost and would like some advice.",2023-01-31 20:37:11

Trees (Binary search tree, binary tree)
Graphs (acyclic,cyclic)
HashMap, TreeMap
Linked lists
Arrays (2-D arrays)
Binary search
Recursion
Stacks, queues, heaps, PQs
Sliding window, two pointers
Dynamic programming
Sorting Algos

I haven't had the time to self-teach myself computer science, but... I found CS50 and TheOdinProject online, which everyone online claims to be absolutely amazing for beginners.

I ended up sort of solving it, but it only passed one test case and failed the other, and it was a disgusting piece of code. Multiple loops, all that. No decent code principles to be found. I had to comment and apologize for it. 

I'm really sad because I felt like they gave me a chance, and I blew it. I doubt they'd interview me further if I don't even complete the OA, right?

mt1vhc,How screwed will I be if I don't do an internship this summer?,"I'm an undergraduate junior. 

I accepted an internship offer earlier this week.

Earlier today, my parents called me and said they have a surprise. I asked them what the surprise was. 

They said that since the whole family would be vaccinated (COVID-19 vaccination) by the time my current semester of university ends, we were going to spend the  ENTIRE summer in Hawaii by the beaches and resorts, partying and sightseeing and eating delicious food. 

My mom is a teacher and doesn't work over the summers. My dad has requested time off work and will only work for a few hours every week in the hotel at night. 

My parents have already booked the plane, hotel, resort, and various sightseeing tickets - these are very expensive and nonrefundable. They booked the tickets before calling me to tell me about the surprise, so I could not tell them I had an internship lined up and to not book tickets for me.

If I stay home to intern while the rest of my family goes to Hawaii, my parents will lose a lot of money since they can't get a refund for my tickets. 

I will have two weeks of free time after my semester ends before we go to Hawaii because my sister's semester ends two weeks after mine. However, I don't know any company that would be willing to hire an intern for only two weeks. 

So, I have no choice but to back out of the internship I accepted the offer for and go to Hawaii with my family this summer.

hduapl,"Help me decide: Penn (MCIT), Berkeley iSchool, or Cornell Tech/How does my plan look?","**Situation**

* Accepted to Penn's MCIT (graduate ""bridge"" program for those w/o a CS background) for this fall
* UCB just announced a scholarship (min 50% up to full) for alumni of my undergraduate scholarship partner (think Posse or LSAMP)
* I'm also interested in Cornell Tech's dual Master of InfoSys (Connective Media) program w/Technion in Israel.

**Problem:**

* Would it be weird to get a master's at Penn (to get the programming skills) and then a second at UCB or Cornell Tech for a master's in info sci?
* The UCB scholarship is really, really attractive.

**Context**

* Background isn't CS, it's cheap, online, and I can study part-time to continue working so that's why MCIT fits.
* But not in a rush so maybe I can just skip Penn altogether? and wait a few more years to apply to UCB + Cornell—two schools I'm actually interested in. I don't care much for Penn tbh; I just need the programming chops required for UCB or Cornell. I also don't care for Technion.
* I lowkey prefer UCB > Cornell Tech bc of social culture + career placement, but the program focus at Cornell Tech seems more in line with my career interests.
* I'm interested in research so eventually a PhD is the goal.

**Plan:**

* Penn MCIT (online) to gain the programming experience UCB + Cornell Tech requires, then choose one of the two for a second master's",2020-06-22 15:22:15

1820clu,"There are no ""gotcha"" problems in Leetcode or interviews.","I know the title is a bit inflammatory, but trust me, it's true. I will prove it. 

&#x200B;

Human knowledge compounds over 100s and 1000s of years. Every generation is constantly learning tougher and tougher things because they become standard pieces of information. What we learn in schools today was the topic of research among the worlds most intelligent people just a few generations prior. Knuth-Morris-Pratt string matching algorithm was invented in 1977. These are 3 mega-names in algorithms research and yet we are expected to solve a problem, optimally, using this algorithm, in 45 minutes. No one expects you to derive this algorithm.

During Geometry class, no one is every stomping their feet, screaming ""Pythagorean theorem?! I would never be able to derive this in an interview! This is such a 'gotchya' problem!"" And, I think this same analogy applies to Leetcode ""gotchyas"". 

When you are grinding leetcode, as we mentioned, you are learning things that took actual giants in the field of algorithms to derive. No one expects you to derive them in an interview, but they expect that you studied the tools to be able to map these algorithms onto seemingly unrelated problems. This is the problem solving technique of modeling problems from one domain to another: transform-and-conquer. The ability to use tools and solve hard problems is what is being tested. But more than that is being tested, the main thing is that you are prepared.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, don't blame the field or companies for doing what they do to find the best candidates. You have to swallow the pill, that is life, and make the best of the situation. I personally found, in my career, that knowing an extensive base of algorithms helped my code dramatically in situations that I didn't expect. It's better to have these tools at your disposal than to not have them at all.

&#x200B;

As a final note, I want to mention that studying algorithms in a depth-oriented manor will produce positive results outside the scope of just knowing algorithms. Take the interview grind as an opportunity in self improvement. 

&#x200B;

Good luck!",2023-11-23 12:40:58

18hu05o,Will I be fine in college CS if I like coding but hate debugging?,"I like CS. I do USACO and it feels incredibly satisfying to finish all the test cases correctly (complete with the little fist pump). I enjoy making plots in R and had fun making an app in Shiny. But the one thing in CS that pisses me off is debugging. I'll often spend 2-3 hours debugging a single USACO problem and still not find the issue. It doesn't exactly make me want to kill myself but it is quite frustrating. I hear people talking about how you have to truly enjoy CS in order to do well at the schools I'm applying to (UT Austin is the big one). A big issue I'm worried about is having to manage my time very carefully since you won't know how long it takes to debug a project (especially if it's a massive one, which are pretty common from what I've heard). So for someone who hates debugging and is not exactly great at it, how bad will it be? Any tips to avoid this issue?

Edit: seems like the general consensus is no, I will not be fine. So what was the change in mindset that led everyone to enjoy debugging more? I doubt every CS major started off liking debugging, so I guess I should try to go through the change myself.",2023-12-13 23:07:26

18k4e2b,Unravelling the Role of Content Delivery Networks in System Design,"🌐 Understanding CDNs: Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are vital in enhancing website performance by caching static content like JavaScript, images, and HTML pages globally. They are essential in modern web architectures for companies like Spotify, Netflix, and Instagram.

&#x200B;

🖥️ Broad Applications: CDNs have wide-ranging applications, from bloggers aiming to accelerate their sites, to developers preparing for system design interviews, and CTOs managing viral startup traffic.

&#x200B;

📈 Practical Use Cases:

&#x200B;

  \- Static blogs: Utilizing CDNs can significantly boost loading times globally, improving SEO rankings.

&#x200B;

  \- System design interviews: CDNs are often discussed as globally distributed caches for static (and increasingly dynamic) content, enhancing latency, scaling, and security.

&#x200B;

☁️ CDNs in Cloud Infrastructure:

&#x200B;

  \- Simplified with AWS services, options range from hosting static content on EC2, storing it in S3 (blob storage), to caching via CloudFront (CDN service).

&#x200B;

  \- Cloudflare is highlighted as a user-friendly, all-in-one solution for static content management.

&#x200B;

🔗 Additional Resources: The article concludes with links for further learning about CDNs, including explanations for beginners, benefits, types, and specific features of services like Cloudflare.

I got into Georgia Tech for Spring 2023. I got into Columbia GS as well. For GT, I got in as a math major but GT lets math major to double cs so I will double math and CS and for Columbia GS, I can major anything I want so I will major CS.

My goal is to get into top ML/NLP(maybe CV) PhD programs in US and Canada (Stanford, CMU, Berkeley, MIT and MILA)

But it seems Berkeley is much better than Gatech in terms of placing its students to top ML PhD programs. But I have changed my major while I was in community college and I don't have much extra curricular activities prepared to get into Berkeley EECS. So if I want to get into Berkeley EECS, I would need two more years(more like 1 year and 8 months but anyway) at community college.

I've updated my LinkedIn to match my latest resume, but after adding all the positions, I noticed how ugly my profile looks.

Studying to pass the SAT means you're now good at the

Likewise, studying Leetcode and HackerRank and
memorizing riddles means you're now good at those

rc6ppg,Resume Rejected,"So I’ve applied to around 110 places so far and I’ve received 12 resume rejected, which is expected. Started kind of late this year so still waiting to hear back from most places and working on OA’s right now. I’d assume it’s too soon to hear back after only applying like a week ago. My resume from last year was mostly the same (formatting and everything), aside from a few new projects which I worked on over the summer. That resume got me OA’s at Amazon and a few unicorns as well as interviews at some big banks (e.g. C1, AMEX) last year, so I’m assuming my resume can’t be that bad. What really concerns me is that I just got resume rejected from Ford and the Gap within hours after applying. I know that resume rejects are the norm, but I’d assume these companies likely have lower hiring bars then other companies, so if I can’t get past the Ford resume screen, how could I possibly get past any resume screen. It also came at like 5 in the morning after applying at like 7 in the evening the previous day, so I’m assuming it’s likely automated. Also got the HRT OA and it came from a recruiter like 2 days after applying, so it didn’t seem automated. I’m a junior btw. Any tips?

qu93dh,I resent coding interviews and the culture they engender.,"It's a tired subject i'm sure, but with facebook (meta) interview coming up tomorrow morning I realize how stupid the process is. I hate the fact that interviewers will toss you a few puzzles as if your ability to solve them (read: how well you've memorized certain concepts and techniques) has any bearing on your fluid intelligence, interpersonal skills, ability to use a search engine, etc. which are what really matter in work. 

Of course, runtime considerations are important when working with software on a large scale. But that's only one part of the equation, although you wouldn't know it from talking to the average silicon valley zoomer. 

I think I'm a decent programmer. That word encompasses a number of hard and soft skills I've built over time. And I hate the fact that ""preparing"" for this damn interview doesn't naturally happen as I work on things with people. It's about as useful at gauging your potential as SAT scores are at predicting your success in and after college. 

If there are books, forums, Discord servers, udemy courses, and hundreds of hours of youtube videos dedicated to ""succeeding"" at an interview for a job, you know something has gone wrong.

As a freshman with already two internships under my belt, a personal project, a ton of awards and also, of course, a ton of programming experience, I told myself I'd at least get a coding challenge. Also, I'd heard that this program favoured minorities : as a south American woman, I thought that helped too. But nahh.  Edit: I am not implying here that because I am a minority that I would automatically get in, but simply that it would help, alongside the rest of my application, as per their little disclaimer that encouraged minorities to apply.

I was wondering if some of you had a couple minutes to quickly glance at my cv and tell me what i can improve on it and what type of experience I can add for next year (ie: make an app, get a more technical internship since both of mine were at research labs, etc).

188uogk,Genuinely in one of the worst possible situations imaginable and it seems insormountable. Failed both midterms and need an 85 to get a B.,"I go to a t5 cs university in the U.S. I'm taking an intro python class. Throughout the year I have continuously did things that are counter intuitive to my learning and now I am in a situation where I need an 86 on the final in order to get a B in the class. A C would be legitimately the worst possible because I would be inches away from losing my scholarship. An 86 doesn't seem terrible considering it's an intro python class but here's the problem the exam is this coming Friday and legitimately I only have a bare bones understanding of python and when I say bare i mean bare. We've had 10 homework assignments with 5 coding problems on it and the last one I did on my own without chat gpt was homework 2. It all started with an extreme amount of procrastination. I said that oh I'm just using chatgpt once I'll catch up but I never did and ever week I messed around and didn't focus and so now here I am. If you asked me to solve any homework after HW2 I would fail to do so and I've failed both midterms meaning if I don't get an 86 I get a c. 

&#x200B;

I've told myself over and over that I would change but I have a problem where I just let myself escape by doing anything but work so when i look back at the weeks that have gone by I realize just how much time I've wasted and I feel like a complete fool. Even now here I am still procrastinating and so now I have to ask where can I go from this. Procrastination is a habit that has been engrained in me since high school I've always been smart enough to screw around and still get high A's which is how I got into this school but I've been completely unable to do that here and so whenever I got a little anxious I would avoid everything and bam another day has gone by and no work is done. 

I keep rambling but this is probably one of the worst cases of procrastination in my life. It feels like the walls are collapsing and because of how insurmountable everything is I feel like I want to learn but because of the vastness of content I just don't know how I'd go about this and so I continue to escape. If I continue on my foolishness I'll end with 3 A's in easy classes and a C in Cs my major and a B or a C in calc which the same situation is occurring only difference is I have one extra week to study. I've been a complete disappointment to myself, my parents, and my goals and all I want is a restart but even then I feel like it's a self fulfilling prophecy I've always said to myself I'll make a change on procrastination but each time I got away with but I always felt like if i look back at my life (18 yrs) I could've done more with everything yeah i got into a t5 but I could've been even better. 

I feel like if I don't figure something out I'll fuck around until friday and fail the exam and fail the class so now I am at my wit's end and I'm essentially begging anyway to tell me is it possible to learn enough to get an 85 on an intro python course in one week or six days. All I know right now is just some stuff from lecture like I went to lectures but I never learned to actually implement anything so all I've got is random words floating through my head and half thought out concepts. Is there anyway i can do this in a week i've got the time if I essentially didn't stop studying for each day. Can anyway tell me what to do with my problem and where to go from here and how I should go about studying what resources I could use and whether it is possible. I've regretted what I've done everyday and each day I feel the weight of existence pushing down on me and I hate my life right now. I've never been under this much pressure and I just need to succeed but nothing is looking good so what do I do. I always use any distraction to escape the feeling of dread I feel whenever I wake up not any substances but going to parties, yapping to people about nothing, and just general avoidance.

What the fuck am I supposed to do with that? Live under a bridge and eat trash? Just so bezos can keep murdering his employees and spend all the stolen money from employees to brag about going to space? Hell no, I accepted a 25/hr offer from a small company and I’m very happy with my choice, this was the minimal I was expecting for as an active student, so fuck you Jeff!

Edit: I’ll give you some context, I’m from Mexico and the position offered to me by Amazon was Software Engineer Intern and the other offer from the startup was for a Junior Software Engineer role, the offer from Amazon was a slap in the face, not enough to even cover basic expenses, 4 rounds of interviews in English, asking me leetcode mediums all for nothing, sucks living outside the US, companies just want to take advantage of you and they believe you’ll happily take 2 bananas, 1 taco and 3 cents a day for a wage

Other edit: Just for scale on how terrible this is, what Amazon offered me is the average salary of a cashier in Mexico, young bilingual and highly educated software engineers working for Amazon Mexico get paid the same as a Mexican cashier, how crazy is that?

fwkd84,Caught Cheating in Computer Science,"So I am currently a first year student at university. I was recently caught for cheating on two assignments. These are typical weekly assignments we have, but they are large, all of them being worth a total of 50% of our final grade. I was working on the first one and needed help with a specific function, so I looked up how to do it. What did I find? I found the exact same assignment online. So what did I do? I was foolish and I copied some code and the basic framework for my assignment and submitted it. I received no warning after that. After I did the same for my second assignment (even more foolish), I got caught. I spoke to my professor and he said he was glad I owned up to my mistakes, but he was still required to report it to the academic integrity council at the university. I regretted my decisions when I went through with what I did and I regret them now. If I receive a failing grade in the course, I get kicked out of my honors program and lose the scholarship money I earn from that program. What do I do now? The final verdict is in the hands of the council. My university's policy is that for the first offense it's a failing assignment, and for the second it's a failing grade in the course. I don't know whether this would be considered one offense since they're being reported at the same time, or two offenses since it’s for two separate assignments, and I don't know the severity of this. What do I do? Is it the end for me? I can't tell my parents because they would severely punish me, but when I get the final verdict I'll have to tell them. I've always been a student who follows all the rules to the max, and I got desperate and cheated. I don't know how much of this I can handle, I keep panicking and my heart rate is constantly at 130bpm. If I could take back anything I've ever done, it would be what I did for these assignments. I wish I hadn't done what I did, but I did it and I have to suffer the consequences. Are there any tips on what I could do or say to potentially get my potential punishment lessened? I definitely deserve a failing grade on the assignments, but I know I'd never make this mistake again, and I would never again do anything to deserve failing the course or maybe even getting kicked out of the university.",2020-04-07 13:19:10

But I was looking forward to a relatively stress free semester knowing that I had a skilled partner who could carry their own weight.

So I laid out the division of labor and we both agreed that our parts were equally divided. She kept on sending me stuff that didn’t work; her code didn’t even compile so I confronted her about it and she said she’d fix it. Spoiler alert: she didn’t. The night before our first presentation I just wrote her part myself and I talked for the majority of our presentation. I just figured out things would improve before our second monthly presentation.

So I ended up doing pair programming wit her and things were worse than I imagined; she didn’t even know the difference between an array list and a regular array and other basic stuff like that. I had enough at that point and did the entire project myself. At the end of the semester I told the professor I did everything and showed him my GitHub commits and he flunked her lmao. She dmed me in discord saying she lost her internship cuz she would have to do the class next semester lol.

I honestly don’t feel bad at all, there are thousands of students like me who are decent programmers and can’t find an internship while people like her ride the coattails of others and find success. If she struggled with this basic project she wouldn’t even be that good at her FAANG internship prolly. I think I did her a favor here because she probably would’ve failed at her internship anyways.  As I always have said: “You can’t go to the big leagues if you can’t play tee ball”.",2023-07-25 22:28:43

The Reliance-Disney merger, valued at $8.5 billion, creates a massive Indian streaming entity. This means a huge content library combining Disney+ Hotstar's international shows with JioCinema's regional content and Viacom18's popular Indian shows.

The key to unlocking this library's potential lies in AI-powered content recommendations. Reliance and Disney, both leaders in [digital transformation solutions](https://lancersglobal.com/solutions), can leverage this tech to personalize user experiences and keep them engaged. AI can also optimize pricing strategies and potentially lower subscription costs through targeted advertising.

However, competition from Netflix, Prime Video, and local platforms like Zee5 remains fierce. These players will likely invest in AI as well. Market dominance is a concern, especially with Reliance's IPL rights. Regulatory bodies will need to monitor the impact on pricing, accessibility, and diversity.

Looking ahead, AI-powered personalized content curation and a focus on regional content based on AI insights are possibilities. Reliance Jio's expertise, combined with Disney's resources, could lead to significant investments in AI-powered advancements, improving streaming quality and user experience.

The merger is a game-changer, but questions about pricing and dominance linger. AI will likely play a major role in shaping the future of Indian streaming.",2024-03-18 07:43:59

1apce3e,How good of a programmer am I expected to be when leaving college?,"Hey everyone. Just had a quick question about what companies expect of me as an eventually graduated CS student. I'm 2 years from graduating, and my college focuses on C++ but they teach other languages too like C#, Python, and Web Development stuff like HTML CSS and such. So far as a second-semester sophomore, I have taken and understand Data Structures up to trees, I can kinda understand paradigms of programming languages, manipulating files, linux shells and terminal stuff using Bash Perl and C-Shell, and other stuff. Like, I can confidently get a spinning square on my screen using SDL2 and OpenGL which I think is kinda cool, and I have done probably like 30 leetcode questions in my life, 25 of them being easy ones which I won't lie I still find tricky sometimes. 

I don't wish to brag if that's somehow what It sounds like I'm coming off as doing, but If anyone has experience, especially those who've graduated, I'd like to hear how you were standing half way through college and whether that's been a good thing or a bad thing. I just hope I'm doing enough y'know? I love learning about videogame development in C++, but what use will that be if I end up at Microsoft using like C# or something lol. I just want to know like if I should do more or less. Just for comparison, below is a list of EVERYTHING I have learned and known up until this point, whether I learned it through school or on my own. The list only has main points in it, not little tiny details like how I learned to code and use programs on a raspberry pi or something like that.

&#x200B;

Learned Through School:

\- C# (Just started learning it this semester)

\- Python (Functions, Lists, Tupples, Sets, Dictionaries)

\- C++ stuff like file loading and string manipulation

\- Data Structures (C++) (stacks, queues, linked lists, event queues, trees)

\- Assembly Language (Taking a class now haven't even learned which we are using lol)

\- OpenCV and how images are processed with cameras. Also all the fancy image stuff like aperture and depth and stuff.

\- Game Design in Unity

\- I'm taking a class on how AI works right now.

\- Linux programming using Bash, C-Shell, Perl, Gawk, and some other basic stuff.

\- An IT class that taught how networking worked and how computers function

\- Discrete Math and Logic Circuits, along with Calc and Pre-Calc

\- Spanish

&#x200B;

Taught Myself:

\- C++ (The basics before I went into college)

\- GameMaker (The language I used before college, but basically C / C++)

\- CMake

\- OpenGL

\- External Libraries for C / C++ Projects and how to use them, like SDL(2) and GLAD (for OpenGL stuff).

\- How computers functions (Just watched a crap load of LTT)

1amwpbw,"To the lovers, the doomers, and me!","I want to give hope to all that there is hope for the light at the end of the tunnel.

I am a recent grad from a decent UC (but not t50 school) and a FAANG internship under my belt.

I can guarantee that while I tried to be a very good student (3.76 GPA, but still graduated Suma Cum Laude lol) I did not have many projects or skills. (I was a python tutor at the college during the school year). 

It took me 2 years of applying and grinding leetcode to get my FAANG internship to only be waitlisted into oblivion for return offer (I bet you can guess which FAANG), and everyone convinced me that it would seriously boost my resume.

Starting last August at the end of my internship, I began applying to entry level software jobs to little to no avail. Between then and now, I have been sent completed OA's for only 5 companies and interviewed with only 3. The first rejected me after 3 interviews, the 2nd rejected me after the initial behavioral, but the 3rd one today has just given me an offer for a 6 month contract for $55 / hour, hybrid 3 days in office role with the chance to get a salaried offer at the end of it. 

I intend to take this offer as it's a big tech company and it's good experience that will hopefully jumpstart my career. This is a reminder that it truly only takes one!

Also I my one bit of advice beyond grind leetcode and be charismatic is that I've had the most luck for interviews with jobs I applied for on handshake. Idk if that's just my luck or if that's the best place for people in/just out of college to look for jobs on.

17ht9vs,Thinking of creating a job board just for software engineers,"Before you say the last thing we need is another job board, hear me out. In my search for software engineering jobs, I found it very difficult to find jobs that met my search criteria: skill, experience level, and coding language. For example, I searched for remote entry level React Developer jobs on LinkedIn and GlassDoor and found everything ranging from entry level to senior level jobs, with a tech stack ranging from Ruby on Rails to PHP, with most not even offering remote as an option. So this meant I often had to search through hundreds of jobs, and read through long job descriptions just to find a single remote entry level react developer position. 

My idea is to create a job site just for software engineers which would allow me to make a number of optimizations in the job search process. In order to create a job, employers would have to select and provide information on the following  criteria. Job setting: the first thing employers would need to choose is whether the job is onsite, remote, or hybrid. Experience level: the next thing employers would need to provide would be the experience level the job is suitable for ranging from entry level to principal level. Experience in years: employers would also need to provide information on how many of experience are required ranging from zero experience to 10+ years. Skills: the most important thing employers would need to provide is the skills / frameworks / languages they use with an associated experience in years for each skill / coding language. Salary information : I know this has already been done but it’ll just be an additional search criteria. 

By having all these fields as required inputs for a job post, candidates would be able to much more easily query jobs by setting, experience level, experience in years, skill / framework, and coding language. It would also reduce the required size of job descriptions and remove the need to parse through long descriptions to find out if a candidates skills and job criteria are a match. 

I’m also planning on adding answers to  all common questions ( gender, work authorization, EEO information, etc. ) as part of the profile creation process so that candidates don’t have to fill out the same information over and over again. 

The main challenge I see is getting employers to post initially when the number of candidates on the platform is low, and getting candidates to signup when the number of employers posting jobs on the site is low. To incentivize users, I would likely make the service totally free for the first year and provide a $10 Amazon gift card as a reward for signing up and applying to a job / posting a job. 

I realize the competition in the job board field is great, but I think the process of applying to software jobs could be greatly improved by creating a job board specifically for software engineers. I’ve already got a domain name, codejabba.com. If you don’t like the idea or think it won’t succeed, let me know why. Regardless, I’ll probably create the project to practice my MERN stack skills and give me something to do in my free time. Curious to hear you thoughts.",2023-10-27 17:52:00
17hhd44,Apple vs. Oracle FT Offer,"Hi, I'll be graduating this year with my bachelor's in CS and I've received 2 verbal offers for both Apple and Oracle, but I'm having a lot of trouble deciding.

Apple:

\- \~$150,000 TC (not negotiated yet)

\- San Diego

\- Full-stack web development on one of their video apps teams

\- Return offer, really liked my team this summer—great culture and WLB

Oracle:

\- \~$175,000 TC (no negotiation, final)

I'm leaning towards Apple because I really liked the senior engineers and manager on my team, but at the same time I'm worried that taking a full-stack web role will limit my career in the future—this position specifically is a lot of frontend, and I'm concerned jobs for this field will decrease due to AI. I took a distributed systems course and really liked it in college but I've never done anything related to it in my internships.

17gyzxr,Should I Request an Offer Renegotiation?," I have two offers on the table.

1. Walmart Global Tech in Bentonville, AR. TC $95k (excluding bonus + sign on), or $107k with maximum bonus. RO from this summer, love my team / manager and it'll be with them again.
2. CoStar in Richmond, VA. $115k TC, no stocks/bonus but bi-annual reviews with promotions.

I think my heart wants Walmart, I love the area, love my manager/team/etc, but my brain wants CoStar because the base salary is $115k (6-figures) and Richmond is Beautiful. Plus, my career goal is to retire around age 35, I'm only 20 and will already be making solid money, so starting off at $115k will help when looking for my next role in \~1.5-2 years. 

I've already signed the Walmart offer and have yet to sign the CoStar offer.

Would it be smart to send a professional email to my Walmart recruiter asking for a potential renegotiation with this second offer on the line? If they were to increase my base salary by like $5k, I'd instantly turn down the other offer and stick with Walmart.

This sub has helped alot in being able to understand the ecosystem of cs students, here is my top advice for everyone

\-Improve your resume, too many times i've seen a cs student with 0 projects on their resume

\-Join a school organization (recruiters love it), there is bound to be a cs club or org at your school and if theres not than you could be the one to start it!

\-Maximize linkedin, too many people simply have a basic linkedin, make one that stands out and don't be afraid to message recruiters.

\-Its a number game, don't focus on the idea of FAANG and 6 figures. Apply to local companies if possible.

\-Some helpful resources to help anyone who is struggling are these github pages updating on positons:

[**https://ripplematch.com/index?r=7RDrhL**](https://ripplematch.com/index?r=7RDrhL)

it’s probably because i always got help writing my loops; i was in OF almost everytime a project was out getting help which i think stunted my understanding of this foundational concept. i go back to school in ~ a month to learn c++ but if i don’t solidify my understanding….i  think im really going to struggle. i just need direction in terms of how i can get better loops and what online resources i should be using. i don’t want to go into my next cs course feeling this unprepared.",2023-07-21 21:06:14

12wpivo,"30, BA/MA in English, and back to school for a bachelor’s in CS","After following The Odin Project for over a year (20% through JS path) I’ve decided to head back for a BA in Computer Science. I already have two degrees and work experience as a teacher, but I’m skeptical towards bootcamps and I don’t trust my degenerate self to succeed solely self-taught. I feel that a degree is the safest, most comprehensive path towards my goal of working in web development. 

From my extended (and, at times, exhaustive) late-night Reddit scrounging on this topic, it seems a bachelors is the best fit for someone like me. It’ll take me $16k and 2.5 years to graduate and I’ll have two summers to (hopefully) secure some internships. I’ll be catching up on prereqs this summer before diving into calc 1, intro to programming, and a computer programming elective class in the fall. I’ll also be taking as many courses as possible at my nearby CC and transferring credits. 

Any specific tips or general advice for an older, returning student like myself? Should I join the CS / programming club? Attend hackathons? Any special electives I should look out for? Could already having degrees affect my chance to get an internship?

Obviously lots of variables at play here, but I was hoping to get sub feedback since none of us are even in college yet.

1. Below average admit at a top-tier program like MIT or Stanford. You got in, but you're not going to stack up well it comes to competing with your school peers for opportunities like internships and employment.
2. Average CS major admit at a top school not primarily known for CS, like Harvard or Penn. You're taking care of business, but you're not a standout and are relatively anonymous at the university.
3. Top student in a CS Honors program at a non-CS school like Alabama or Arizona. You're among the best at the school and have priority access to university resources.
4. Top student at a community college with a lot of self-learning that gets into industry two years ahead of the others.
5. Entirely self-taught through high school and able to land an entry-level dev job out of high school to get a four year head start on the others.

wyfruy,Waiting for Google Decision Internship [Anxious],"I had two phone interviews with Google.

Interview 1: It was perfect. I was able to code whatever he asked me. I explained it well. We talked about what was going on in our lives. I was super happy with it. It went beyond what I expected.

Interview 2: Exactly the opposite, I was only expecting coding questions, but she asked me what I was doing, why I wanted to work for Google, and such questions, Followed by a few CS theoretical questions. I did not prepare anything for this. So I clearly messed up on this part. There was one question to which I was like, ""Our university has not taught it yet"" (I could have said something different) to which she laughed.  Then the coding problem was given that I had not ever approached ever before. I communicated my ideas. She helped me with hints. However, I did not have any time to implement it. The interview went just okay or bad. But in the end, I showed I was interested in knowing how to implement it, and she showed me how to do it. Also, told me what the concept is called. She also gave me her LinkedIn. I wanted to connect with her but didn't ask.

I have mixed feelings about interviews. Though I was not able to do good in the coding part in 2nd part. But I still felt like I was able to communicate well, and showed that I wanted to learn more. It has been almost 2 weeks since the interview. However, I have not heard back from them. I sent my recruiter an email asking about when I could expect to hear back but still haven't gotten any reply.

Could you guys let me know what is the most probable result, when should I expect to hear back?",2022-08-26 17:57:26

veb31m,Should I switch majors to CS?,"I’m currently a rising junior computer engineering major at my school, and recently I’ve been thinking about switching to computer science. I know that computer engineering is very similar to computer science, just with more hardware classes, but I cannot stand doing hardware labs and projects for assignments. To an extent, I like working with hardware, but I don’t see any future in which I would pick a job working with electrical hardware than with code, as I just don’t enjoy doing it for anything other than myself. 

I’ve talked to my parents about it, and they seem to think that it may be a mistake to switch, as you don’t need a computer science degree to get a decent programming job. They think with would be better for me to have the “engineer” title to be more versatile and to show that I could work with hardware if the company wanted me to. But like I said, I don’t think I would ever pick a job where hardware would be a factor, as I simply wouldn’t enjoy doing it as a career.

A little bit of what I’ve discussed with my parents thus far:

-It would be cheaper for me to switch to computer science since engineers have to pay a $1000 engineering fee every semester and engineers have to pay a $2000 co-op fee for 3 required co-ops ($6000 in total)

-I would be getting a Cybersecurity minor if I switched to computer science to help me stand out when it comes to applying for jobs

-The first 2 years of computer engineering at my school are relatively similar to the first 2 years of computer science so I would only be one or two classes behind

-I’m actually passionate about programming and enjoy doing it. I actually dread going to my electrical engineering classes because of how little I enjoy working with and learning about hardware outside of my own personal projects

-I am currently an RA at my school and get housing paid in full because of that. If I remain a CE major, I won’t be able to be an RA because of how co-ops work and when we are required to complete them (basically I’ll be gone for spring of my junior year and fall of my senior year because of when co-ops are) so I would have to pay for housing my last two years, as it is unlikely they would hire me to work for only half of the year

-CS majors are still required to do internships (and even if they weren’t, I would still do some anyway just to get experience) so I wouldn’t be missing out on hands on experience in the field if I were to switch

Just to be clear, my motivation for wanting to switch is not because I find my electrical engineering classes too hard or because I wasn’t doing well. My electrical engineering grade was actually one of my highest grades last semester. I just thought I should clarify this because I know my parents were worried that I just wanted to switch because it was too hard or that I wasn’t willing to put in the extra work to do well.

I just need some advice. Do you think it would be a mistake to switch my major since I could just dive more in depth in programming on my own, or because computer engineering is so similar to computer science anyway?",2022-06-17 11:33:06

um9epg,On courses and course-loads,"About my educational aspiration:

I hope to transfer from my Community College in southern California to UC Berkeley. I have received a 4.0 at college for the past year and a half, and intend to maintain that GPA moving forward. I also intend to meet every single UCB transfer requirement, which for me means I must take the following courses:

1. CS113- Basic Data Structures/Algorithms
2. MATH260 - Calculus 3
3. MATH265 - Differential Equations
4. MATH270 - Linear Algebra

As a bonus to myself, as well as the only way into the school of engineering at UCB, I must also take:

1. PHYS 151 - Principles of Physics 1
2. PHYS 152 - Principles of Physics 2
3. PHYS 253 - Principles of Physics 3

Additionally, it has been suggested by UCB's transfer center that the following classes will help me achieve my admission goals, note though, they are not required:

1. CS226 - Discrete Structures
2. CS151 - Advanced C++ Programming

TIMELINE: My hope is to transfer in the fall of 2023, meaning that I must apply to the university this upcoming fall semester. This means I that my time interval will decidedly be the semesters of:

1. Fall 2022
2. Spring 2023
3. Summer 2023

MY QUESTION: I wanted to ask you other CS majors, what do you think is the optimal way for myself to meet UCB's requirements under the previously mentioned conditions?

Typically, I would just apply a difficulty meter to each class and then fill the available semester's with even ratios of difficulty as to not over-burden myself. But I am unaware of the difficulty levels as I have not taken the classes and am mostly unfamiliar with their subject matter- so I came here to ask you all.

I have contacted International student office at my university before and have received mixed responses so wanted to see if anyone over here was in a similar situation as me before.

Additionally, I know full time off season cpt eligibility differs from university to university which is why I am mainly curious to know if someone was able to successfully do it since based on what I read on my school website, it seems like I should have no restriction in doing an off season full time internships as they will make me enroll in a internship credit course that would keep me a full time student during fall/spring semester",2022-05-01 16:31:09

tnoxiz,If you had to become a software engineer without a degree,"Ok, so I have (kind of a loaded) question to people who are pursuing their Comp Sci degree. There’s obviously a big push for software engineers to be obtained by companies through bootcamps and/or people who go the self-taught route. I went through the “traditional” route of getting a BS in Comp Sci, but I’m curious to hear what people think about their majors? Do you think it’s super vital that you need to go to college in order to be a good developer - or is it more of a societal pressure to get a degree in order to seem like a legitimate candidate for the industry? And if you do think your degree is really important, what specific classes do you think you’ll use when you are working in the industry? What percentage of classes are relevant to what you’ll be eventually doing during your day-to-day?

The reason I’m asking is because I want to know what people’s perception of the industry is based on what they’ve learned in school. If you’ve had an internship before, you’ve probably gotten a taste of similarities and differences between the curriculum/coursework versus practical applications in the corporate world, but regardless, what are THE most important things you need to know?

My list is:
Object oriented programming
Data structures and algorithms
Testing fundamentals
System design (maybe OS)
Learning a language and building apps

qjy5l1,"Failing college as a senior, after accepting a full-time offer","So, everything was going well until now. My GPA is 3.84 and I completed junior year with a lot more credits than I needed in order to be in senior standing. And a few weeks ago, I signed an offer for full-time employment at a well-regarded tech company, starting in May next year. 

But now, in what was supposed to be my penultimate semester, I’m failing a class. And I don’t feel confident about my other classes either, so I may fail one or more of them too. I’m taking 15 credits right now, and so withdrawing from or failing two or more classes will make me ineligible to graduate next semester. 

Moreover, I’m an international student on an F-1 visa, and for us, not completing at least 12 credits in a semester is VERY bad.

n0xgnt,Cornell/Hopkins - CS,"Hi community!  I've posted something similar before but I'm now trying to help my son make a pretty last-minute decision and we decided to ask some questions again based on our current concerns/thoughts.  Would appreciate any help. I’m hoping that in addition to getting a great education and having good career prospects, he will actually be happy for the 4 years.

He will major in CS. He is choosing between Hopkins (Engineering) and [Cornell](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/cornell-university/185) (admitted into A&S, not sure if he wants to stay there or transfer later into Engineering). Not sure about career choice yet - possible software engineering, possible law school, possible anything else at this point. His interests lean towards math and physics, but he also has other interests such as astronomy, econ, foreign language. He is smart, mature, and a hard-working, disciplined, self-motivated student. However, he can suffer from major anxiety and inability to sleep during exams. He has plenty of high school friends but is on the introverted side, needing time to himself. Not a big partier. Likes playing video games with friends.

[Cornell](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/cornell-university/185) is very appealing because of the excellence of its CS program, overall academic excellence and breadth, natural beauty, some alumni family ties, the Ivy moniker, and just an exciting feeling. We are from NYC and the rural community feels a bit limited, but Ithaca and Collegetown seem nice and he feels he can enjoy four years there. And great food on campus!

Our cons for [Cornell](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/cornell-university/185) are the idea of walking a mile to class in freezing, bitter, snowy weather and living with the depressing-ness of dreary grey skies and cold, and the perception we’ve developed that there might be an academic environment of intense competitive pressure, weedout course competition, grade deflation, expectation of all-nighters, causing extreme anxiety and inability to sleep on the nights before exams (especially if he transfers into Engineering). We’ve encountered numerous posts saying Cornell students are not happy because of these factors. In addition, I wonder if the huge number of students makes Cornell a more impersonal experience, and more difficult to make friends?

Hopkins seemed smaller, more intimate, more friendly, with a very pretty but smaller, navigable campus where dorms are close to classes. Students we met there said it’s nice to walk into a dining hall and always know someone. So maybe easier to make friends? The CS department is also smaller and more intimate, with maybe more chances to get to know profs. And the climate is warmer.

But the CS program is not nearly as well-rated, and we have heard that the Hopkins CS education is not as deep as Cornell’s. Baltimore is also not appealing. Although students seem to feel safe on or very near campus, and we really liked the campus and immediate surrounding areas, the area only a few blocks away seems sketchy and unsafe. And as pretty as campus is, there’s no good place for students to hang out while studying (Hopkins is building a really nice student center but this won’t be completed for 3 years.) And although both schools are incredibly great, it’s a bit hard to turn down the Ivy League.

Financially both programs are similar.

Would appreciate any suggestions or hearing people’s experiences. Especially interested in hearing what people think of Cornell’s CS culture in terms of competitiveness, unhappiness, degree of pressure and tension students feel.

Thank you very much!",2021-04-29 05:17:32

mt12sv,What can I do about the programming courses at my community college being so outdated?,"First, I'd like to knock a couple of disclaimers out of the way:

I understand it's just a community college, not Harvard, MIT, or even a state university. Also, I've never taken CS classes at a state university, but I will be starting this Fall. I've heard that it's pretty much the same situation at **some** universities, depending on which one you're attending.

However, the tech industry is constantly changing, with new programming languages coming along, new frameworks being used, and more platforms to develop on. On top of that, we have a billboard on the interstate that reads, ""University-quality Computer Science courses, for a fraction of the cost.""

With all of that out there, I wanted to say that I learned much more programming from courses on sites such as Udemy than I have taking about 2 years worth of programming courses at the community college. Not to mention, Udemy has only been a fraction of the community college's flat tuition rates, not even counting books and other expenses.

Anyway, I shouldn't be rambling on too much about Udemy, because I'm trying not to advertise them, but more rather see how I can make the CC's courses just as good as those websites.

In terms of most programming, we don't do much outside of the command line. On very rare occasions we would do basic functions for things like Turtle in Python, or JavaFX with Java, but that's about it.

As for web development, we only have 2 courses that just teach basic HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. They don't even teach any sort of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Materialize. And PHP? The only backend language being taught? Most mainstream websites out there don't even use PHP anymore, and it's a common argument on whether it's outdated or not. Even if it's not officially outdated, it still lacks much of the features in most other web development languages and frameworks nowadays.

After looking at the textbooks for these courses, I noticed that most of the material hasn't been updated since **2005**. Seriously? Again, granted it's just a community college, but still, that's way too outdated. Mobile and touch devices weren't even mainstream back then.

Another thing is that most of our professors *don't* recommend using websites like StackOverflow when you're having trouble. They never said you're *not allowed* to use it, but they just *don't recommend* it. So, how do we solve programming problems, according to them? Just look closer at textbooks and official developer documentation, and if you can't find the answers there, experiment with whatever code you can possibly write until it's fixed.

All this being said, I think the main reason our programming courses are like this is because most of the CS professors are older, and this is how they did things during their professional career- Most things were done via command line, PHP was pretty much the best backend web language, there weren't many CSS frameworks around, and StackOverflow, along with other developer forums, were almost nonexistent. 

So, before I leave the community college, would there be any way to bring more updated material to it? I have a feeling that it mostly just teaches outdated material that isn't really useful in the actual world of programming today.",2021-04-17 22:58:37
mmytki,Is CS gonna be super saturated in upcoming years?,"The question is self explanatory, will this field have a CUT THROAT competition in upcoming time? I'm in high school rn, and consider whether is it even good to go into CS (I do know coding, so don't come at me like that).

Im a freshman looking to get a internship next summer. I plan to study over the summer (May-September) and practice for interviews. I already have projects done, so I will dedicate most of my time to interview practice, while working on a project to keep my skills sharp. My goal would be Google STEP or MSFT Explore but ofcourse any internship would be great. 

I was wondering if this course cover the DS's I need to know to do well on an interview. Judging by the length, I can probably finish this course in a week and then start leetcoding and doing mock interviews.

Would you recommend this course or is there another course you would suggest I take. 

Ive gotten other suggestions like MIT opencourseware and [this](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html), but I prefer udemy/coursera courses because they have everything in one place. If I there arent any good courses then what would you suggest out of the two? (if it helps, Im proficient in python and js, ok with C, and familiar with kotlin)

m058c8,Should I take this research offer? Clueless student here.,"Hey guys, looking for some outside perspective from people with a bit more industry experience than me. For reference, I’m a rising junior at Stanford/CMU/Cal/MIT studying CS/AI and Math who has done backend software engineering at a startup, TA a data structures class, and have projects mostly related to AI models (1 potentially being accepted to a conference) and a bit with webdev using React. I kinda dropped the ball this past recruiting cycle and didn’t start really applying until January or so (just got too invested in my classes) so I currently don’t have any offer letters in hand. I currently have a few interview processes I’m going through but I’m honestly pretty rusty with technical interviews and not doing too hot. 

I have an offer to work in a lab with a great professor here  who I admire (h-index > 100, if that’s even relevant) after doing well in his AI class. I’ll be working on a deep learning platform in mainly Python and C++ he’s been trying to get off the ground, which hopefully will be used by researchers working in his domain of AI in the coming years. Given the nature of undergrad research, I don’t know how often I’d interact with him directly, but I’m hoping to have him as my undergrad advisor. 

My question is what am I losing out on (besides SWE $ like at Amazon 👀, holy shit they pay stacks) if I chose to take this gig? I want summer 2022 for me to be working in a more traditional, non Python/AI SWE role at a prestigious company, if that helps add context, and am shooting to work as a traditional SWE or ML engineer after wrapping up my 5th year’s masters here. Would having research vs another internship on my resume impact my chances next recruiting cycle? Should I gamble and try to find an internship, or just accept the research offer? I have to let the lab know in a week or two. 

I appreciate any feedback, I might be overthinking massively. Most of my college friends aren’t very industry-focused so it was like the blind leading the blind when I asked em about this.",2021-03-08 02:01:34

I'm a junior applying for interviews. I get past the screening pretty well but I don't know where I'm messing up in the interview process (behavioral/technical round)...My experiences so far have only led me to doing  unpaid internship work in addition to some contract work. I have regular mock interview sessions with friends and have considered getting paid ones in addition.

I keep getting those generic emails that said thanks for applying but better luck next time essentially. I always email for feedback, and I know no one's entitled to feedback, so I save and take to heart whenever I receive feedback.

I even had one interview, interviewers were like: ""your experiences really align with the role"" and when I had a marketing prompt they were like ""you really embraced the brand"" to be hit with a generic rejection. There was another time I did well in behaviorals but the hiring manager had to reschedule because they had to move (reasonable) but then I got ghosted altogether.

Besides cold applying, I've gotten referrals, gotten interviews from cold messaging before, but it's just the interview I ultimately mess up despite massively sinking a lot of time into now whether it's doing mocks or researching the company a lot previous to interviewing.

I know the response I should be told is to just suck it up and that everyone has it bad right now but to just keep going. I've been applying since August and would rather not deal with this for another 3 months. (I got last offer in April but this has been so depressing just to get rejection after rejection. There's not even time to dwell on it as it's just to the next application.)

What I'm trying to hear is just any help or feedback anyone is able to give, because I'm not going to toot my own horn and say I'm the best of the best in terms of candidacy but certainly I'm trying my best but not sure what's going wrong.

jmz5kk,FB v Goldman v Microsoft v Twitter,"Deciding between Facebook, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, and Twitter for a summer internship. Super grateful to be in this position. I'm at a loss for where to go though. I interned at Twitter this past summer. 

I think I feel most enthusiastic about Twitter's product, especially the team I worked with. Facebook I don't feel excited about, Microsoft (I got assigned to the cloud org), depending on which team I get, could be very cool. Goldman I'm ambivalent toward.

Putting aside the company's core products, what is more important to me is which of them have the highest chance of extending a full time offer assuming equivalent performance. It seems pretty good at Twitter from what my recruiter informally told me, but I have yet to get a response from the other places regarding return offer rates. If anyone has insight on this, I'd love to know. 

Location is another big thing for me. I'd like to stay in either the NYC or Boston areas. Goldman seems like the winner on that. FB and MS said they have low availability on the east coast and it's difficult to FT there. Twitter is in the middle, with some teams having decent availability. 

I'm of course hesitant to return to Twitter since diversity of experience is important, but since I am familiar with operations there, I'm thinking that will allow me to do a better job and increase the likelihood that I get a return FT offer. 

The FT comp seems roughly in this order: FB > Twitter > Microsoft > Goldman, so I am a little drawn to FB for that. On [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi), FB and Twitter are not too different, but I've heard about the generous signing bonuses returning interns get.

I'd really appreciate any help or advice to help me think through this decision! Thank you.",2020-11-02 23:40:19

I'll also talk about imposter syndrome, and maintaining balance during covid times while working on [https://www.joincolab.io/](https://www.joincolab.io/), where I'm helping aspiring PMs, developers, and designers break into the industry with practical and collaborative product experience.

I've started applying to places from the beginning of the month, and I've applied to around 50 places now. But I literally have zero responses - auto rejected by 10 places, getting only OAs from companies that automatically send them, and even then no response after that.

I realise that I  don't mesh with the department of my school that well but they're the closest and most reputable college in my area because I didn't want to spend more money getting a dorm elsewhere. 

I medically withdrew for this semester.  

The online computer science program at Troy university  takes 36 hours of course hours,  plus I won't have to be as mentally screwed as I've been so far sense attending this university. 

However, I'll miss this university due to its connections through internships, everyone is familiar of the university and I feel like I'd regret not being able to physically talk to my professors or classmates. On the other hand, I've never had a close relationship with either groups of people. I've been  humiliated a lot in school, made fun of by TA's etc.

e8zpqm,Atlassian vs. Box Internship,"Hi, sorry for another summer 2020 internship decision advice post but I’m genuinely having a difficult time comparing these two companies! 

Here’s an overview of my thoughts so far.
- They’re both in the Bay Area & housing stipend is the exact same 
- Atlassian has a higher intern pay, but my research right now indicates Box will have a higher new grad TC
- Both seem to have high return offer rates
- Box lets me pick the exact team I will be placed on (of the ones that haven’t been chosen yet by other interns, and there are a lot available still) 
- They both seem to prioritize a great WLB and open company cultures
- I thought Atlassian was more “known” in the industry, but I found that a lot of people respect Box as well
- I don’t particularly have a greater attachment to either company’s product 
Let me know if you have any other questions. In terms of what I’m looking for, I’d appreciate more insight on how people perceive their company cultures (are they *actually* really great), quality of their tech stacks, and overall company reputation in the industry. I am definitely trying to figure out where I’d want to continue working most after graduation as I’m currently a junior.",2019-12-11 00:54:29

af2k6t,Should I Transfer to a Better School to Improve My Chances of Getting a Big N Internship?,"TL;DR; Do you think I have a chance at getting a Big N internship going to a no name school with two internships and a personal project, or would transferring to a more target school drastically improve my chances?

I’m currently a sophomore Electrical Engineering major and minor in CS at an average state school in Florida that you’ve probably never heard of. I didn’t expect to get an internship so early but I applied anyways and here I am with a CS internship this semester! I’ve started applying to summer internships to local/smaller companies as well, and I’m confident I’ll get one, though we’ll see haha. It got me thinking, if I have two internships and do a big personal project before I apply, I would have a shot at getting an internship at a big tech company the summer after my junior year. However, I’m concerned about my chances because I go to a no name school and because my major isn’t CS. 

I’m open to transferring to UF, which is ranked the best CS program in Florida, if it would drastically improve my chances, or any competitive CS program in Florida. What do you guys think? I have a hard time transferring just for a “chance” at something because frankly getting a Big N internship wouldn’t be guaranteed anyways. Also, I would lose a scholarship I have at my current school for $2000 a semester(the last $8000 of it would be lost), but I would still have Bright Futures, which pays for my tuition up to 132 credit hours. However, I think I would save some money transferring to UF because I could major in Computer Engineering, which my school doesn’t offer, instead of having to pay a for the excess hours to finish my minor in CS. Also, it would pay off anyways if I got the kinda money that comes from a Big N internship and the resume booster. 

To anyone wondering why I don’t just major in CS, I like hardware and software almost equally. EE let’s me learn how to make things and a fair bit of programming, but CS just teaches you software and not how to actually make things, which is much harder to learn on your own than programming. Also, I want to have the option of going back to get my Masters or PhD in biomedical engineering.

- I go to a pretty good school (top 25)

5- split your schedule to two parts one for strength one more focused on size

6- for strength do 1 top set of 5 reps leaving 1-2 reps in the tank then drop the weight by 10-15 % then do an all out set  
7 -for size do 2 sets of 8-12 reps all out

I made a small handwritten pdf if anyone wants it and I made it into something that looks like an actual schedule

18y9437,Should I mention my disability in job applications?,"I have diagnosed ADHD and probably have undiagnosed autism. I got diagnosed in my sophomore year of college and I’m trying to apply for jobs now. 

I got extra time for exams and with medication I’d say my focus level is similar if not better than a neurotypical person. 

So I feel like although on the one hand being disabled (neurodivergent) might help companies who tries to have a diverse workforce, they might also have biases towards people with autism/ADHD, especially given that most people know ADHD people got more time in exams, which can be perceived as an unfair advantage.

I agree but then I fuck up OOP, which is supposed to be my bread and butter. This question could totally be a real feature to make OTJ.

I just couldn’t organize all the information so fast or fully understand the question yet and it’s edge cases. I kept getting confused on how to organize information into my objects and at first couldn’t understand what was the purpose the methods the questions wanted me to implement. It just felt weird to me.

The question doesn’t require those typically annoying algorithms, it was straight. I just kept getting confused.

I have been giving my all to prep for technical interviews but I know if I pulled this bullshit in a live interview I’d get swiped. To everyone else these problems come much simpler by this time but it doesn’t seem like I’ll be set up at all interview calmly and independently this cycle.

Heres some background about me; I'm from NJ, I don't really care for city life or weather. In that sense I don't think NYC/Pittsburgh would be thaaat important for going out reasons.

Both schools cost similarly around \~30k a year after fin aid. Columbia slightly more, but not enough to be financially troubling.

Career wise, I'm majoring in CS and would like a lot of internship oppurtunities. I think CMU would be better for this, but I don't think Columbia is lacking either. Aside from normal internships, I'm also partially interested in software startups and potentially founding one of my own. I think NYC would be better for this with more VC oppurtunities.

Academically, to be honest I don't really care about course difficulty. I much prefer practical work, so rigor wise classes at either school probably wouldn't make much a difference to my interests.

lz3wol,education path,"Hi together

It would be great to get some advice form anyone who had the same problem about decision making for education path.

I stand for the decision for a MSc either in Computer Science or in Business informatics. I already studied business administration and then business informatics at the Bachelor Level. Now I want to make an MSc but I am not sure which one I should take. In my job I am working as a Head Application Manager in the classic field of Business Informatics. So in considering that factor, it would make sense to make an MSc in Business Informatics. But I doubt that an MSc in Business Informatics will generate my extra value because I already have a BSc in this field. With a MSc in Computer Science I could certainly expand my skills in IT areas.

I'm hoping to land a bigger internship than I have right now at a top tech or finance company, so anything is appreciated :) Given the choice, I would do quant over swe, but since I feel like quant has a much smaller, and higher hiring bar (and in some cases also has programming questions), I'm also preparing for swe internships as well, but it's really hard to manage.",2020-07-19 00:58:42

c8e241,Repost: 2 Day Hackathon,"Reposting as a Hackathon at the suggestion of @[pumpkinpie666](https://www.reddit.com/user/pumpkinpie666/)! Was previously calling this an internship bc I didn't really know what else to call this, but anyway, people thought it was a scam. It's just a hackathon. I can't code, everyone else already has ideas, and it's boring to just sit there for two days, so here I am. If you would like to volunteer to do free work for a hackathon, please read on. If you do not, no need, eat a snack, live life, etc. 

This is admittedly somewhat random, but I thought there was a chance someone here might be interested. I'm a project manager at a medical/tech startup in NYC and we have a hackathon next week (July 11th and 12th). As a project manager, I have few skills (read: zero) with which to participate in said hackathon, but I have a whole project laid out to create a 'quiz maker' - essentially something that leverages my company's API (we make 3D interactive medical visuals) to allow nontechnical people (aka folks like me) to create their own 3D gamified quizzes without needed an engineer. I'm looking for a person that might want to join in on the hackathon and build this scheme, go for gold, etc.

&#x200B;

**What you will get:**

\- My undying gratitude

\- Get to do a hackathon

\- I am fun

\- Cool portfolio project to show off

\- I don't think there are prizes, but maybe there's a prize? Fair warning, it will probably be a funny mug or an Amazon gift card, if anything at all - so possible opportunity to win a potentially theoretical prize

\- Honor and glory

&#x200B;

**What you will** **not** **get:**

\- Money

\- Fame

\- A job

&#x200B;

**FAQs/Requirements:**

\-  Competency in html, good UX design sense, ability to utilize our JavaScript messaging API that enables interactions between the website and an integrated Human widget, JAVA or Python or whatever your language of choice is for creating and capturing survey data, a general enthusiasm for 3D visuals, iframes, interactive content, and human anatomy

\- You are free on July 11th and 12th

\- You are a good communicator, work well on a team, and are willing to do video chats with two non-technical people and deal with our dumb questions

\- Is this company famous? The next google? Will this give me name-brand recognition on my CV? Also, no, not really. Again, my sense of humor and charm is the real selling point here. You should be in this for a fun ride.

\- If you live in or near NYC, you are also welcome to come hangout, but as long as you have access to the internet, you can be located anywhere

18jgbo7,The recruiters for JPMorgan AIML QR Markets Internship are some of the most irresponsible recruiters I’ve ever seen.,"Title. Interviewed with them earlier in November, and absolutely smashed the interview. The interviewer literally sent me a Linkedin invite after the interview because he was shocked at how I solved one of his problems by Chernoff bounds and generalized one of his coding problems to a much harder problem, and wrote code for that instead. 

A few days later, I get an email that I’m invited to their superday. I click on the email to schedule the interview the next day, and their form says “no more available slots”. I send them a friendly email that their system won’t allow me to register. They reply 2 days later saying:

1) On their system, it shows I saw their email for the last 2 days and did not accept their invite, and that the invite had a deadline of two days.
2) That they called me TWICE and messaged me on my phone number and I didn’t pick up.

Therefore, they treated me as “rejecting” the super-day invite.

Now that’s COMPLETE BS, they never reached out  at all and the email definitely didn’t sit for two days. 

Anyways, I’m pissed and I send back a rant saying that what they said is complete garbage, and that my phone-number, which is also on my resume is the one they should’ve used. 

2 weeks later, I get a call at 8:30 am by them asking if I am “Mr Jing” and if I am still available for the superday? Now all the love to my asian homies, but I’m white as fuck, so I ain’t no Jing. I basically went off on the recruiter telling her that their system is beyond fucked, and that it will now show that “Jing” was contacted just like the BS that happened with me. She said “she’ll get back to me” and closed promptly. Obviously heard nothing.

There was so much math, like I didn’t even know math could ever reach beyond a certain point. Even in non math classes there’s math. NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING COMPLEX, BUT YOU HAVE TO PROVE IT! Proofs are like the devil to me. It is in my nightmares. The whole experience was horrible. You will feel so dumb, like so dumb that 75% of the time you will think this isn’t meant for you, and you don’t belong here. Once you get back your exam grade that says 30% after wasting your whole week studying you will want to die. There is no running away from the math too. My school makes things so complex it’s crazy. Sometimes I look at the power point and am completely lost I don’t even know where to begin. I sit at night with anxiety and can’t sleep because I can’t stop thinking about how hard it seemed and how I can’t even grasp it. I always feel over whelmed. I always feel dumb. I feel like a fraud.

It’s hard to reject a good paying offer letter that you worked hard for, haha. I’m sure someone can relate to it. Working in a SWE company that’s super chill at working hours, I think is doable. 

Also, it’s a smart way to seek more knowledge and make great money, I guess. I don’t know if it’s legal to work? And I’m sure IRS doesn’t really care during end of the year tax return.

and decided to reply with a post since I don't think it's as black and white as that. For example, in my previous company (Fortune500), at my specific location, they hired around 30 new grads. Of those 30 new grads 20 were diversity hires (I'm classifying diversity hire as not a White/Indian/Asian male). Then of those 20 around 8 majored in comp sci or software engineering. The remaining 12 were healthcare management, business, etc., or the closest major to tech, IT. Meaning around 40% of new grad hires, in this case, were people who had far different credentials than those who had to go through the hell of a degree CS is.

There were people I knew who were struggling to find jobs as a cs major, while others, who weren't even qualified, got the job due to the diversity hire requirement. For sure there are diversity hires that are cs and have grinded to deserve their spots, but there's a good chunk of companies that hire strictly to appease quotas. On paper, these quotas don't exist, but it's implicity put there. This is just what I've seen and maybe your experiences may differ. 

In university, the ratio of guys to girls I saw was for every 25 guys there'd be 1 girl. So it makes sense that if society is hypercritical of companies that aren't diverse that the 1 girl has a much better shot than the 25 guys (supply/demand). I don't want opinions I want data. Ideally, I'd like to see what percent of diversity hires are CS/Software Engineering majors vs. what percent are not. ",2023-08-16 16:59:50

15cnzm9,(Please read post text) Choosing between BS and MS from UCLA CS or Georgia Tech CS... what will employers think?,"*I know this sub doesn't really like college comparison threads. But this has been an incredibly difficult & taxing decision for my family--seriously, I'm looking for genuine advice and am not here to foster pointless discussion, flex, or wtv. I've already tried* r/ApplyingtoCollege *&* r/cscareerquestions *but couldn't get much help. I hope you can understand.*

Hello,

I've been accepted into UCLA and Georgia Tech for CS. I don't know which to choose. **Whichever school I decide on, I'll pursue both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in CS through their respective BS/MS programs.** \[Applying for grad elsewhere is too uncertain\]

UCLA is in-state tuition but GT isn't prohibitively expensive. But what's stopping me from going to UCLA are the schools' rankings. Georgia Tech is ranked nearly double UCLA for CS in both BS & MS:

\- Georgia Tech BS CS is ranked 5th (right below MIT/Berk/CMU!), while UCLA BS CS is 12th

\- Georgia Tech MS CS is 8th while UCLA MS CS is 14th

**MORE INFO:**

My job interests are CS, AI & ML, and Quantitative Finance.

I regard the curriculum at both schools to be pretty equivalent at both Bachelor's and Master's levels. It's just that UCLA by a small margin better supports my interest in CS+MATH double majoring. Also, GT offers many more interesting specialized CS courses I don't have time for that many.

**QUESTIONS:**

\- I know my job placement depends largely on my efforts, but will SWE recruiters regard a Master's in CS from Georgia Tech better than a Master's in CS from UCLA? If employers do think this way, is it enough to make a difference? What about Quant firms?

\- If employers do weigh the ranking of the school, when in the hiring process would they do this? Would their first few interview rounds be easier? Would they decide whether to send me an online assessment because of my school?

\- Which employers (Big Tech? Startups?) might regard a CS masters graduate from UCLA as not as good as one from Georgia Tech, because of the school rankings?

\- Will UCLA CS have a good brand name outside of California?

\- Lastly, what would you choose? Again, I can get a BS & MS at either school.

If you've read this far, thank you so much.",2023-07-29 09:33:18

Somehow I earned a final round interview with an actual human and I did great. I had genuine, long responses for the behavioral questions and was able to answer follow up questions.

After that interview, I knew I had it in the bag and received an offer a few days later.

this is coming from a guy who got 841/850 on first attempt and 4/4 on fb. in fact, i finished much faster than the other guy who made the post complaining about code signal with this score. and you know what? thats fine. theres no system thats perfect, but atleast this one is transparent

15ehoa0,advice for incoming cs freshman looking to land offers in quant or swe,"so i'm an incoming freshman at a US college and I'm looking to build up my resume and start preparing for internships/career stuff. A bit about my high school background: it's mostly split between competitive programming and AI/ML research. I have some decent (nothing crazy) competitive programming awards such as Codeforces Expert rating (peak 1720), USACO Gold, and some local programming contest that I won. For AI/ML, I have two research projects that I worked on with university laboratories. My research ended up getting published at decent venues (for a high schooler). I mean they're solid places, but like a graduate student would be expected to do much much better. 

So that puts me in my current position. I'm looking to really build up my resume to be successful with landing some sort of internship this summer. I hear some people saying it's already time to start applying, but I don't feel confident that my resume can pass screens to get me to the interview stage. I was thinking I would spend a month (maybe up until mid-September) to grind Codeforces (hit 1900+ rating) and start working on some personal web-dev projects. Would this be a good idea to build my resume into something competitive for SWE/quant internships? And also am I going to be too late by mid-September?

I am currently entering my 2nd year of university majoring in Computer Science. Having loved computer science and coding since I was a kid, I feel robbed of my childhood dream which at one point felt fairly attainable; after seeing all of the posts on this subreddit, however, I feel extremely demotivated, and to some extent, scared for my future. Have I made a mistake? As I am still a student, I have yet to do too much research on the market and have little experience as I am just about to go into my Co-op/ interning term shortly. Based on what I’ve seen on this subreddit as well as other similar ones, have I chosen the wrong career path? The issue is I have a true passion for the field and don’t have much motivation of any sort to pursue any other career in the near future. What should I do? Will the market improve?

11p5qxg,Why Computer Science is the worst major,"Hey guys, this is just a rant about my opinion about why the Computer Science (engineering) major is the worst from my experience.

1) It’s not even Computer Science (for the most part)
The whole major jus feels like a bunch of weed out engineering classes full of Math and Physics with some Computer Science geneds sprinkled on top. You do very little comp sci in your whole college career. Most of the CS you do learn is theory, which is important don’t get me wrong but since we do very little CS you aren’t getting what you need to get basic a job.

Plus I don’t think I Calc 3 and Quantum Physics should be required for a CS major (these are actual current requirements at my university).

2) It’s hard and time consuming!

Like I mentioned previously, all these weed out classes are hard and suck out most of your time and energy leaving you time for nothing else.

It’s hard for the wrong reasons, I’m not complaining about the CS part I’m complaining about the weed out Physics classes and Math classes, I didn’t sign up for this 😭.

3) No time to learn practical CS on your own / work on side projects

It’s well known, especially in this sub, you need a good resume with practice experience and side projects to get a good job offer. Welp, if you are spending most of your time studying for the irrelevant weed out classes you won’t have time to learn practice CS which they fail to teach us in school (for the most part), so you can’t even take it into you own hands. You won’t have much time to grind leet code if you too busy failing some hard ass 4 credit class which is not even your area of interest.

4) I feel bad

I feel bad for the people who did the CS major soly for the purpose that they will get a high paying job after graduation. I feel like the average CS major (if ur in this sub ur probably already above average) after college will have no real practical experience to get a good job, assuming they only focused on their academics (which I see most of my fellow classes mates do)

What I think is a better option:

IT (Information Technology) majors - I think this is the most reasonable choice as you get to focus on CS without the rigorous math / science and weed out courses.

A easy business major - honestly your practical experience overshadows your academics. So why not chill out in college? 

With these options you will have all the time in the world to live a healthy stress free lifestyle with more time to work on your side project, gain practical experience, and grind leetcode!

TLDR; CS majors get the worst of all worlds. Hard weed out classes, no to little real world CS, no time to do what is required to get a good CS Job.  

Idk, I jus though if this when taking a shit , let me know if I’m making any sense rn!",2023-03-12 04:58:16

16gnv4h,CS Students: Feeling the Heat,"This may be a divisive or even stupid viewpoint, but this is what I believe. Computer science students are not only treated unfairly by the economy, but also by their ""competitiveness.""  It's almost like an auction, where two or three people raise the price and you have no choice but to match those prices if you want the item.  Nowadays, most students in competitive computer science degrees want to do 3 to 5 internships before graduating, and some even do 6; at this rate, doing 4 internships, 4+ projects, and 200+ LC, will be the bare minimum in 2 to 4 years to be hired for mediocre pay.

I'm not saying it's bad in any way, but as I mentioned earlier with the auction example, it allows ""employers"" to raise the bar for hiring new grads. 

PS: I am not advocating that people strive to be mediocre; I am simply expressing some of my observations without claiming that they are correct or incorrect.

I'm trying to find an internship using referrals in a big company. I'll be honest, I don't wanna work in startup cause I just want that 'tag' in my resume that I interned at a big tech.(don't judge lol)

So I talked to few of them and I realised, everyone's response was totally different. I'll summarise :
1) Internships in vacation are great. The name of a big tech company in resume gives you an edge during interviews cause it's difficult to get into those companies. Working for a startup too shows you know a lot about your field.
2)Just practice leetcode everyday instead of internships cause cracking the coding round is the biggest hurdle. Internships won't matter at all if you don't get to the interview round. Instead learn more skills and highlight projects in your resume instead of experience.

So, what do you all this is idk, the correct advise for a uni student?",2023-05-23 15:48:52

Just picked myself up an old cream-colored windows 95 desktop to mess around on and am looking for a commodore 64. Not just old tech though, like technology in general. I especially love learning about the evolution of tech if that makes sense. Stuff like that. I get people may not share the same love I have for tech and stuff, but I go to a decently sized school and cannot find one other person I swear. I'm not even seeking out people who must know this and must know that! But bruh it seems like these kids don't even know computer companies other than Microsoft and Apple. In one of my classes a teacher will sometimes talk about Linux servers and I feel like everybody but me stares at him in complete and utter stupidity. I suppose that's forgivable because it is a coding class, but most of these kids don't even code outside of classes except for homework or practice for upcoming quizzes. Does anyone else feel like this or am I a loser? Am I selfish for wanting friends with same interests? Is this just the way things are now? Lmao. It's not even like I'm older and have lots more experience. I'm younger than most of the kids in my class.

15vjemk,Fired because of Disability! What Should I Do?,"     I had just started work as a remote developer for a global company and really enjoyed the job. I was progressing through training quicker than scheduled and getting along with my employees. I was completely blindsided!

     I have anxiety and adhd and with meds and therapy, everything usually goes fine however the second day, I passed out during a daily meeting. My heart rate rose to like 150 (at rest) and I blacked out. I told my manager what happened and that it was likely due to a combination of lack of food, sleep, working out, and then my meds not corresponding well with that mixture. I let him know that this was unusual and should never happen again. I stayed late and made it my mission to finish my first part of my training ahead of schedule to make up for it!

     Flash forward to Friday, due to the recession, and growing up economically disadvantaged, I have no food in my home. I quickly ran to get something, before taking my meds so I wouldn’t pass out again. I was a few minutes late for our meeting (most of which is the higher-ups talking about anime and movies). I was still able to report my progress and the managers acted as though I was doing a great job and would be discussing the results of the first part of my training. They moved me on to the second part, in the meantime. 

     As soon as the day ended and I logged out from my work station, nearly completing the second part of my training that was designed to be completed the following week (trying to work fast to prove my worth!), the temp agency that placed me told me they terminated my contract. I was in tears and honestly contemplated ending my life. It sounds crazy, but I’m a new grad who lives in an abusive and clearly poor household.

17y08ws,Here’s the Reality for those who are graduating 2024,I’m a 2023 new grad and want to shed some light to y’all young folks. Getting a job is a lottery system. How do you maximize your chances of winning? You already know. Internships. Even with internships don’t guarantee you will get a job because that depends on how economy is doing. So this post is a reality hit for those who say to themselves to wait until graduating to apply to jobs or who anticipate to be unemployed. The competition people say they encounter when applying for jobs is when you are no longer a new grad status. After a certain number of time since u graduate you become less undesirable as new grad. Let’s say u become unemployed for 6 months and u trying ti apply for new grad roles companies only want new grads from current graduating year and not the past. So you would be applying for “entry level roles” but these roles typically require exp 1 year exp minimum. True entry level roles are those with “new grad” titles on job post. This is why most people who don’t find a job within a short period after they graduate usually lose their opportunity to find a job within their field as their new grad privilege. This is why it’s so important to don’t fuck around while in college and neglect job search  cuze time flies like a bitch. Have fun later grind now to get your foot into the door cuze looking back now it’s so much easier to get job opportunities with student status. I’m employed full time as swe so these are my insights as a 2023 new grad. I know peers who are still unemployed and switched out of cs completely. I know some of y’all don’t want to grind and party and that’s fine. But trust me life is so much better and fun when u don’t have to stress about finding a job. That’s what I did. Grinded in college to get a job  and now I’m chilling and having way more fun than in college.,2023-11-18 06:23:17
11b9w9m,I regret my internship decision.,"I want to start off by saying I am grateful for even having an internship in the first place, and am looking forward to it- but I kind of just want reassurance/am ranting. Some background: I am a Junior at a top 50 CS school.

In the fall, I accepted an internship offer with a defense company. At the time, it seemed like an amazing choice because the pay is relatively decent, I wouldn't have to relocate, and I have an opportunity to do machine learning (which at the time I thought I was interested in, but in reality I am not 100% sure if I am).

I was so decided on this offer that I turned down an interview with Capital One, a final round interview with Bloomberg, and an interview from Appian.

I am primarily regretting turning down the Capital One interview. I'm not 100% sure what my career goals are, and I feel like Capital One would have been a way better choice (assuming I got the offer, which may be a bold assumption).

I am always seeing online the disadvantages of working in defense (old tech, below average pay), and pay is fairly important to me. People tend to talk about how ""easy"" it is to get a defense job. It kind of makes me feel like a failure. I am a Junior so this is my last internship opportunity before I graduate. I had one other internship but it wasn't a software engineering role. 

I feel as though I will be disadvantaged in terms of relevant experience and resume prestige if my goal is securing some kind of good paying software engineering role at a prestigious company when I graduate. 

I feel very regretful- did I really mess up so bad?",2023-02-25 02:45:31

17a0vs2,"My BA in CS degree does not require Calc 1 & 2, am I fucked?","Hey guys! I usually lurk around in this subreddit to gauge how people are going about getting a job after graduating, however I decided i might as well get help with my personal situation. I am currently a Senior about to graduate with a BA in Computer Science at my state university. I was at a CC for my first two years and got my AA, so at least i finished 2 years of college. After i finished my AA, I transferred over to a state university that was really convenient for me to finish my CS major in.

In my school, i found out that there was two versions of the CS degree, the BA in CS which is less math/science intensive and not ABET Accredited, and a BS in CS which contains the typical math/science requirements and is ABET Accredited. Both the BA and BS in CS students take the same courses with the same professors together if they share the same classes together which they 80% do.

It seems that I never fulfilled the math requirements which was Calculus 1 and 2 when i was at my CC, therefore my advisor placed me in the BA in CS. The difference seems to be about 10 courses, here is the program im pursuing for reference:

https://www.cis.fiu.edu/academics/degrees/undergraduate/b-a-computer-science/

Here's the version i am trying to match as closesly as possible with my electives:

https://www.cis.fiu.edu/academics/degrees/undergraduate/cs-design-and-development/

It seems to contain the important CS classes, however i haven't had time to pursue an internship due to my financial situation with my family, so I work full time at my office job as a database manager to support them while taking classes part time to save up. I am 23 about to be 24 soon, and im really worried about not being able to pursue a career in CS due to my degree's courses as well as the lack of personal time for side projects.

So what I am basically asking is:

1. Should i switch my BA in CS to a BS in CS, thus taking longer (probably a year longer) to graduate but i get an ABET Accredited degree? Both are valid degrees however the BS is ABET Accredited.

2. If I stick with the BA in CS, should i try taking calculus 1 and 2 at least? How do I go about brushing up on my math, I am pretty weak when it comes to math and would love to work on that.

3. What should i do right now as a Senior to improve on my resume/skills so that i can pursue a SWE Career?

I really want to start pushing myself more moving forward, and with how close I am to graduating, I want to make sure I am following through with something logical.

172k84e,I'm actually enjoying majoring in CS way more than I thought I would,"I'm still fairly early in my program, but I'm actually really enjoying it.

Before going to uni I had a couple programming classes, one in high school and one in community college. My high school one was worthless. We were *supposed* to learn python, but I don't think our teacher even knew how to use it (she didn't even know you had to create a .py file to save your code... we wrote everything in the shell). It was basically a free hour for us. When I went to community college, I took another Python course, actually learning the basics this time. But the course wasn't structured very well and in turn I struggled to understand some basic things. Honestly, I thought maybe programming just wasn't for me.

Fast forward a few years, I realized that virtually nothing else interested me career wise. So I decided to major in CS since it was one of the few subjects I didn't loathe. But now? Now I'm actually enjoying it. We started with Python but it went more in-depth and things were structured in a much more sensible manner (my cc class never even taught us about formatting strings or half the stuff this class taught me). Now we're focusing on C++ which is what most of the classes from this point focus on. I actually find myself wishing I had more to do... I get maybe two assignments a week and they take me less than 30 minutes each.

My other classes though, they will be the death of me. I got stuck with a couple professors whom I either just can't understand or they genuinely seem to hate their students.",2023-10-07 23:30:41

I've been very fortunate to receive offers from both Meta and Netflix. However, I already accepted an offer from Microsoft because I hadn't heard back from Netflix or Meta at the time. Should I renege Microsoft for either Meta or Netflix?

*I want to base my decision on these factors:*

* **Resume value of company**
   * Would internship at Microsoft vs. Meta vs. Netflix be pretty comparable in terms of resume value?
* **Intern conversion rate**
   * Is it worth it to renege for a lower return rate company (i.e. Netflix or Meta) - if I don't get a return, will the higher resume value get me in the door for companies of similar caliber as Microsoft?
* **Full time employee compensation**
* **Possibility of high-impact work**
* **Note:** work life balance does not matter for me as of now.

*Specific questions:*

* Did anyone have luck moving a Microsoft internship or Netflix internship to Fall?
* Is Microsoft's resume value about as much as Netflix or Meta for internships? I wouldn't want to stay at Microsoft for a long time because of (relatively) lower compensation, so how likely would it be that I could transition to somewhere like Netflix or Meta after working at Microsoft for a year or so?
* If I renege Microsoft, will they blacklist me? If so, for how long?

18b8qc8,Why can't I get a job?,"

I'm a CS graduate. I wouldn't say I loved programming as I didn't find interest in coding during my degree and I didn't score much in my exams. 
I was into web development and started off by learning HTML, CSS. Hated JS at the time and looked for no-code options like WordPress. 
I freelanced as a WordPress developer and then after a close friend of mine got a really good paying remote job, I started learn reactjs. Built some projects following tutorials and solving leetcode and codewars, also did freelance work as a JavaScript developer but still couldn't land a job.
I did a 3 month internship as a vuejs developer that turned out to be miserable for me as they expected me to have experience in vue js and be a dev already and I was expecting to learn from seniors. 
I kept learning and improving, but I didn't get much JavaScript html css react work on my freelance profiles, only got WordPress, joomla, wix, Shopify no-code work and really couldn't have professional experience that could make me job-ready. 
I thought after practicing for an year I might land a job but still I don't even get interviews and get rejected in the first step. I have updated my CV many times. 
Don't know if I'll ever land a job.

I’m majoring to become a software developer but if I get through math quite well and I think I think the extra workload for the extra moneys worth it, switching to be a CS major is possible too.

Can I get a general roadmap of what certificates I should go for?

But then i missed an assignment because i took so long to even figure out where to start and on another assignment i got a 3/10 because apparently my code didnt even print anything. Though the thing is that honestly I'm not learning much from my class and 90% of my assignment code come from dozens of different articles, so i feel it could be possible that i just have a rough class.

17tydjb,Potentially Regretting CS Degree (But not because I don't love CS),"Yes, unfortunately, as I'm sure I'm going to be told off for, it's about money.

I love CS, I'm really enjoying pretty much all aspects of it (besides the machine learning stuff, but that's mainly just the speed at which it's being taught, being asked to learn the entire foundation of AI within three months is a bit of a headache xD), I'm working with Java, C, Haskell, assembly (oddly my absolute favourite, although only in 32 bits so maybe my enjoyment will half if I shift up to 64 :P), even using the damn command line to push a repo to GIT makes me feel special -- honestly the creativity and challenge of the degree really suits me and as a career it's definitely something I could see myself doing.

However, I'm getting myself down over finances (which I'm aware is probably silly, but feelings, right), and I guess I'm looking for advice from any graduates.

Basically, I was working in finance, earning an okay salary which room to move up, and I left to persue the degree because a) I really do love it, b) I wanted to feel that I had a specialised skillset and c) I wanted to ensure that I'd always have an in-demand career that would get me a decent salary, just to give me a bit more security in life (I don't think doing things partly for the money is as big a sin as people make out).

As time has progressed, however, it's really starting to grind me down that the four years I'm spending at university are potential wasted earning years. I'm really working my absolute a\*se off, I'm looking at the interviews to even get an internship which would also require me to work my a\*se off against heavy competition, and I'm looking at the starting salaries of around 22k (UK based, very Northern), okay, I can live with that.

But then I'm looking at the friends I left behind in finance. They've all moved on in the last few years to being on an average of around 40k p/a, and that seems to be growing rapidly. I'm looking at how much I'm getting on (be bloody **34** when I graduate), and I'm looking at my decision, as much as I enjoy what I'm doing now, as perhaps somewhat of a mistake given my age and the trajectory I was already on in finance.

I guess I'd really like to hear, okay, I'm starting off in a new career, I have to expect to start off at the bottom, but is the salary trajectory fairly stagnant? From what I'm researching (this is without speaking to actual developers, I know that's kinda dumb, but here I am making up for it), you're looking at around 3 years minimum as a junior developer, working a full time job, working on a portfolio in the background, and continuously practicing (which I do anyway but still, finance just seemed to pay you progressively more for very little effort) before you start to even break the low 30k's. I'd be almost 40 by then, with my professional worth already devaluing. Has anyone here any experience or been given any solid advice to say that the salary progression with experience, skill and effort is fairly speedy, or would I perhaps have been better off accepting my age as a limiting factor and staying where I was?

Thanks <3",2023-11-13 00:35:44

172pxb7,Seeking Internship at FAANG in summer 2024 - Will 2.5 Years of Prior Work Experience Affect My Chances?," 

Hello everyone,

I am currently pursuing my Master's in the US and am set to graduate at the end of 2024. My goal is to land an internship at a FAANG company during the summer of 2024, ideally transitioning to a full-time role post-graduation.

However, before starting my Master's, I accumulated 2.5 years of work experience in the industry before (in Australia and Vietnam). I've heard from some peers that internships, especially at top-tier companies like FAANG, typically target undergraduates or those with little to no professional experience.

Here are my concerns:

1. Will my prior industry experience of 2.5 years reduce my chances of securing an internship?
2. Do FAANG or similar companies have policies or preferences against hiring graduate students with prior work experience for internships?
3. Would it be more advisable for someone in my position to apply directly for full-time roles instead of internships (Even though it's almost a year and a half before I graduate with my master's degree)?

I'm genuinely interested in the internship experience at a top tech firm and feel that it could provide a valuable transition between my graduate studies and returning to the industry. I'd love to hear from those who have been in a similar situation or have insights into the FAANG hiring process.

Thank you in advance for your advice and perspectives!",2023-10-08 04:17:14

16bnnu7,How I learned the simple way to code in Java,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I'm a beginner programmer who recently learned how to code in Java. I want to share my learning journey with you and give you some tips on how to learn Java the simple way.

&#x200B;

\## Why I chose Java

&#x200B;

I chose Java because it is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world. It is used to develop software, web applications, mobile applications, games, and more. It is also an object-oriented language, which means it allows you to create reusable and modular code.

&#x200B;

I also chose Java because it has a lot of resources and support available online. There are many tutorials, courses, books, videos, podcasts, blogs, forums, and communities that can help you learn Java from scratch or improve your skills.

&#x200B;

\## How I learned Java

&#x200B;

I learned Java by following these steps:

&#x200B;

1. I started with the basics. I learned the syntax, data types, variables, operators, control structures, arrays, methods, classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, abstract classes, exceptions, generics, collections, input/output streams, threads, concurrency, lambda expressions, streams API, etc.

2. I practiced a lot. I used online platforms such as \[Codecademy\]([https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)), \[BitDegree\]([https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/how-to-code-in-java/](https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/how-to-code-in-java/)), \[HackerRank\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/n1yb4a/how\_do\_you\_write\_text\_messages/](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/n1yb4a/how_do_you_write_text_messages/)), \[Codewars\]([https://www.howtogeek.com/745107/how-to-apply-text-formatting-on-reddit/](https://www.howtogeek.com/745107/how-to-apply-text-formatting-on-reddit/)), etc. to practice coding exercises and challenges in Java. I also used online tools such as 

&#x200B;

[Repl.it](https://Repl.it)\]([https://www.howtogeek.com/how-to-quote-in-reddit-on-desktop-and-mobile/](https://www.howtogeek.com/how-to-quote-in-reddit-on-desktop-and-mobile/)), \[JDoodle\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/e0pobn/how\_do\_i\_make\_text\_hidden\_spoiler\_text/](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/e0pobn/how_do_i_make_text_hidden_spoiler_text/)), \[OnlineGDB\]([https://www.oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com)), etc. to run and test my code online.

3. I built projects. I applied what I learned by building small projects in Java such as calculators, games, quizzes, chatbots, etc. I also used frameworks and libraries such as Swing, AWT, JavaFX, Spring Boot, Hibernate, etc. to create more complex and interactive applications.

4. I shared my projects. I uploaded my projects on GitHub and shared them on Reddit and other platforms. I received feedback and suggestions from other programmers and improved my code quality and functionality.

\## Tips for learning Java

&#x200B;

Here are some tips that helped me learn Java the simple way:

&#x200B;

\- Be consistent and persistent. Learning Java takes time and effort. You need to practice regularly and not give up when you encounter difficulties or errors.

\- Be curious and creative. Learning Java is not only about memorizing syntax and rules. It is also about exploring new concepts and features and creating your own solutions and applications.

\- Be resourceful and supportive. Learning Java is easier when you have access to various resources and support from other learners and experts. You can use online platforms such as \[W3Schools\], \[Stack Overflow\], \[JavaTpoint\], \[GeeksforGeeks\], \[Baeldung\], etc. to find tutorials, references, examples, answers, etc. You can also use online communities such as r/learnjava, r/javahelp, r/java, etc. to ask questions, share your projects, and help others.

&#x200B;

\## Conclusion

&#x200B;

Learning Java was one of the best decisions I made as a beginner programmer. It opened up a lot of possibilities and opportunities for me. It also helped me develop my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

15algk8,How much does a cs degree matter?,"So I'm an incoming freshman and planning on doing a uniquely named major from my university (VT) called ""computational modeling and data analytics"" (cmda). I have heard of a couple of graduates getting jobs like swe or dev which is more common for cs students.

So Im wondering like should I change my major to cs? How much does a specific CS degree even matter or does relevant projects/work-experience matter more? I've heard a degree is mainly to demonstrate you can stick to somethin for 4 years? A decent amount of my courses overlap with CS however, I don't need to take chem/physics and other weedouts, and I have much more free electives available than if I chose cs, (alot of my 40+ AP credits from HS would be wasted If I chose cs.)

So should I bother changing my major to CS or should I just more 'easily' and 'quickly' complete cmda and build up my resume with relevant internships/projects? (cs/cmda participate in the same career fair thing at VT)

Also, I only need to take like 2-3 courses for a cs minor. It is also possible for me to finish in 3 yrs tho I'm in no rush but it would save money n stuff unless I chose CS. Or what if I got a ms in cs later?

WOULD APPRECIATE ANY AND ALL ADVICE. THANKS IN ADVANCE.

EDIT: I should probably add, I don't really have any specific goals or jobs I want to do, just that I wanna be somewhere in tech. And this is a description of [cmda.](https://catalog.vt.edu/undergraduate/college-science/computational-modeling-data-analytics/)",2023-07-26 23:31:51

14sfs8n,"I ""lost my smarts"" after leaving game dev. How can I regain that type of thinking without going back to it?","I know this is a weird post, but please hear me out. 

When I used to do game dev, I had to use alot of math to code the game, and had to do ""creative thinking"". 

We all know how complex games can be, and while doing game dev, I came across alot of theoretical concepts that I never ever thought of before. However, I left game dev because I see no future in it.

  
Now that I've left it for a while, I literally forgot most of that mathematical and creative thinking I once had. How do I gain that back? 

  
Should I do one or two LeetCodes everyday? Is there a specific type of math I should study? Or should I let it go and be okay with the fact that I became rusty in that knowledge?

14jpos1,New grad and 2 FT SWE offers- My advice,"I just graduated this year and I was able to land 2 SWE job offers 80-100k TC at medium cost of living regions. I know that you probably read many doom and gloom posts where people say ""job market is brutual"" or whatever bs people say but let me tell you this that the job market is not brutal for new grads who have internships! Yes, I said internships and not an internship because more internships will put you in a better spot in landing an interview for new grad roles. I have 2 swe internships and 2 non-swe internships so 4 internships in total in my 4 years of college. Now, they are comprised of part-time and full time internships. FYI, I applied for new grad roles during the winter season when layoffs were rampant, hiring freezes, etc that was a lot worse than what it is now and yet I was still able to pull 2 job offers. I had 0 network and all I did was cold applied. People say networking helps but to a certain extent. I did get referrals and I still got rejected. I think cold applying works only if you have a stellar resume and lots of relevant internship experience. For those who were like me who dreaded not having a ""network"", don't fret it. I thought it was the end of the world to getting a job if I did not have a network built up in college but that's not true and I was still able to get a job. Do your best to network because I was able to get my FT internship as swe by knowing the son of a CEO of a large corp and we went to the same school. You never know who you run into in school so that's why it is important that you meet as many people as possible in college because that person you meet can change your life like it did to mine. FYI, knowing high power individuals within a organization helps because I was able to bypass all the interview and go straight to the final round because the individual I knew that was son of CEO gave me a good word. Without that internship, I probably would not have the job that I do now. Network helps! Cold applying works 2! Always be friendly to those you meet.",2023-06-26 18:50:26

14c1ruy,Starting to rethink school,"My school is like top 300 university just barely making it. It is not my first choice I am here because my parents moved to a new state and I get in state tuition. I am not bragging(ok maybe a little) but I am one of the smartest if not one of the smarter people at this school and they made me a ta my first semester here. I am now grading students labs and just in utter shock how bad they are. I am really contemplating either applying for better schools or just saying F it and taking a boot camp and getting a job that way. I have an easy 4.0 gpa here with like 0 effort because the projects don’t require thinking and the tests are mostly open book. Is that how it is at other universities? I’m just thinking my degree here will be meaningless. It seems like the students that go here chose this as their number one decision. I was just helping an honors student with his lab for 3 hours last night because he was so stressed out. I got him 100% on it most likely and he didn’t even want me to explain to him how to do it properly. He basically copied my work. The research group I’m in here is terrible. We are making the most useless project and I really want to do side projects but I don’t want to get a bad gpa. I heard of some smart students here that don’t even go to class cause they’re all open book anyways and they just focus on Udemy classes to build projects to their resume. Sorry for ranting but I’m in between a rock and a hard place because I am in my 30s going back to school. I want to make the right decision. I feel like I can get into MIT or Harvard compared to these students (not really but hopefully you get the picture). Tbh I started  the CS50 class by Harvard and it seems to be more my pace and much more critical thinking. Which I like. I don’t want to sound like a snob but I think I may underestimated myself and should have applied to better schools. I already have a bachelors so I’ll be done in like 2 years. I was just scared cause I was never good at math before and didn’t want to fail at this if I failed at math and everything would crumble. 

Idk i guess I needed to let it out to people that may understand where I’m coming from. Cause no one in my life gets it they are all married or my parents age. I really want to learn swift right now and have no time. Idk what to prioritize. Thanks for listening.",2023-06-17 21:06:29
147mvek,Learning C++ on My Own: A Progress Update and probable next step?,"Hi, I have an Electronics Engineering Degree and developed a passion for  C++ ever since I enrolled in my bachelor's program and used it in any project I could. However, the courses related to C++ in my degree were very limited. The most advanced course available was OOP, and that was pretty much it. Due to my limited knowledge and lack of guidance, I thought that was sufficient.  
  
However, after graduating I soon realized the reality when I started interviewing for jobs. Employers asked me leetcode-style questions (because I had mentioned using C++ in my projects and in skills sections), which I clearly wasn't prepared for. These job opportunities paid very well, while others that didn't ask such programming questions offered substantially lower salaries.  
  
To address this gap in my skills and to be on par with CS grads, I created a roadmap for myself and dedicated three months to learning and improving my C++ proficiency.

I’m on my first internship at a startup where pay is bad and in-office 5 days, but I really like the work. The only issue is that it’s almost too much. Our first week was just learning everything about the architecture and what we were doing, then the next week we were split into our teams and started working. Me and another intern are working on a main product in the company and the timelines are fast because it had just started when we got there. These last 2 weeks have been a lot. I have worked 8 hours straight almost everyday forgetting lunch some days because of all that I have to do. I do good work, and complete things at a good pace but I shouldn’t feel like I should have to stay late to get work done on near minimum wage, but here I am. Moreover, I have full time staff depending heavily on the work I’m doing and everyone is so busy that the guidance I get when asking questions is “look it up”. I understand the devs as they’re on a tight schedule and spending time teaching us things is not efficient for them but it sucks. We have had to skip unit testing on some parts for now because the timelines are so short. I get home everyday mentally exhausted at 6pm and fall asleep at 10:30pm.

Anyways:

I am a student at a T25 school, a current sophomore hoping to get a masters in ML/AI at a T10 grad school.

Right now, I've developed software for a biological modeling software as part of research at a university (forthcoming paper), as well as beginning deep learning research for computational imaging at my school.

Also planning to do Kaggle competitions and Leetcode, as well as develop my own personal projects.

I was wondering, what else can I do to be truly competitive for these positions? My school is not known for CS research exactly, so I don't know how well this research will weigh.

Additionally, what are the differences in what I should be doing if I want to get a thesis-based vs course based masters? I want to eventually become a ML engineer, getting a Masters out of school first before getting a doctorate later. Which would be better to this end? Or is there a different route I should be taking?",2023-05-01 22:22:28

There's game development, mobile development, general software engineering, cybersecurity. Then there's also stuff like systems engineering and robotics engineering (Boston dynamics robots or Tesla self driving car software) Which specific field do you guys think would be in most demand within the next few years? Would Machine Learning and Ai be at the top of the list, considering the new advances in AI technology?

&#x200B;

I applied on their website and got an email a few days later. But, I didn't see this email since it was sent to my spam folder. I was checking my spam folder and saw the recruiter reached out again a few days later asking if I was still interested. I said I was and scheduled a quick 15 min interview. We did it and at the end asked my availability for round 2. Round 2 was about a week later - this morning. It was scheduled for 25 min and we talked abt the company and what we would do there. Then he asked me a few easy asf coding questions, things like what does this code do?, what language is this?, explain to me this concept. Then, we finished about 30 min later because it went a bit over. About 3 hours later I get an email saying I will get an offer letter.

&#x200B;

I looked the company on linkedin and levels fyi and it exists with about 1k employees. There is however, no mention of it on the levels fyi internship page or on the csmajors reddit.

12eplv6,Is 5 classes in a semester doable?,"For the next fall semester I plan on taking 5 classes, but im worried if it will be too much. Three of those classes will be CS classes, software engineering 1, Software engineer tools, and database systems. I do have knowledge in SQL from a class ive taken at another college so I hope that at least helps. For my other two classes, it is business for engineers which i heard is a fairly easy elective and engineer probability & statistics.

I decide to go for 5 classes for the upcoming semester in order to graduate by fall 2024. Does this course load sound overkill? Have you taken a similar course load in the past?  


Edit: Thank you guys for words of encouragement I think im gonna bite the bullet with that semester and do my best to tough it out.",2023-04-07 15:49:54
12dp3s1,"Whether to go for a masters in CS, and whether I even can"," I'm finishing up my CS degree (I'm actually doing bioinformatics, so CS and biology) and my grades are pretty subpar (CS average around 76%, Biology is likely to be 92%). It's a very tough school but I'm not American so it's not likely anyone outside of my country will recognize that. It doesn't seem likely I'll be able to pursue a CS masters degree in the same university with these grades, and it's even unclear whether any university/college will take me with them.

I am already working in a student position as a software engineer so I feel fairly confident I can continue to find jobs like it in the years to come. In my current job, the programming isn't really sophisticated and is mostly about communication with outside APIs and data ingestion/processing. It's fun for now as I'm still junior and everything is new to me, but I don't see myself feeling fulfilled by this type of work for long.

Long story short - I have two questions:

* Do you think a masters (graduate) degree or a phd is necessary to find jobs that actually require creativity and cleverness, and aren't just about solving minor problems that any determined middle schooler can solve? Or are these jobs available to all software engineers if they look hard enough for them? I'm specifically interested in ML jobs but I'm open to anything that will be challenging and important.
* If anyone has experience with applying for a masters in the US/UK/Canada as an international student - do you know if these grades are sufficient, or should I forget about it? Not limiting myself to prestigious colleges.

If improving my grades by a few points will make a difference I still have the opportunity to do that.

After numerous rejections, I finally managed to get to the technicals for this one company, which was an OOD Question, and there was a property of objects in Python that I didn't use. The interviewer briefly mentioned that my implementation was a bit different from what they were going for, but since they didn't make a big deal out of it I didn't think too much of it in the moment-now that I'm thinking back, though, I think I colossally fucked up by not using that feature.

On the bright side, the solution that I came up with had optimal time/space complexity, and was correct. I also think I did a great job explaining my thought process, explaining the tests that I would write-I also solved the follow-up perfectly, and had 10 minutes left over for questions. I also thought I vibed well with my interviewers.

However, I might have botched this interview because of that one small detail. I'm just writing this to get it off my chest, but I guess the most useful takeaway is to understand all the small details of whatever language you are using.",2023-02-28 13:24:01

But, here in Europe(and I've worked in 3 countries) we usually just hired part time students for many developer or related(like simple data engineering/analytics) positions, then they sometimes just got hired after, or they moved out from the university city back to their home town where I guess   


Same for me when I studied, I worked part time at a web agency for several years. Maybe I mix up the terminology, but it seem to me that what americans talk about as internship is a fixed period of 12-16 weeks where you work full time in the summer break or as a master thesis mixed job in your last semester or so

Like I have complained before and said I was worried. Wow I just figured out all my worries are not paranoid delusions after all. I’m in data structures and our teacher is speed running through this course without explaining anything and barely explains any questions students have. The most I learned from my first two prog classes was how to make a class, functions and basic things like a regular loop. 

They recommend us to do leet code now that we are in data structures and I see so many things with vectors. We did not even go over a vector once. I have little to no idea how to declare or what you can even do with it. I see some solutions on leetcode that uses prebuilt in functions. We have not been taught about any of these things except for setw and precision for decimal points. I feel duped by my university. 

So now on top of my shitty school and figuring out what they want me to have to bs on my hw and tests I have to teach myself everything for actual problem solving skills like leetcode etc… my school is a joke.

Without trying to brag/sound cocky, I graduated from one of the top universities for CS and interned at two FAANG companies.

The hiring team told me that they were impressed by my resume by the companies I worked at and the school I went to.

Second interview went ok - came up with a brute force algorithm but stuck on how to optimize. I told my interviewer where I was stuck and got a hint. I made a little progress but I didn’t see exactly where the interviewer was going. So she asked me to run through a test case, which I came up with myself. After that I kind of figured out the optimal solution, and coded it up.

Up until my junior year all I’ve been doing is learning a new language per semester, writing a substantial amount of code, then forgetting all about it and starting afresh next semester in a new language. It is now time for me to attend career fairs and try to get an internship but I have no idea what to work on. I never got time to build on a particular coding project or dive deep into a topic it was all just deadlines and assignments and exams.

19cj3b3,Could there possibly be a stigma against swe candidates who graduated during covid?,"We all know the vast majority of job postings these days specify an unusually high amount of minimum experience required typically between 3 and 5 years. Amazon in particular explicitly states they want 3 years of post graduation experience which means they don’t want anyone who graduated during or after the pandemic. The obvious explanation for the yoe requirement is that more experience === better developers.  



However, I think it is possible that relaxed expectations and changes in higher education during the covid lockdown hiring boom may have left a bad taste in the mouths of employers, who now see new grads as risky hires.

Particularly:

1) During the lockdown, professors went easy on grading and cheating on coursework was likely rampant. Additionally, during the tech boom prestigious companies increased headcount and relaxed hiring standards for interns and new grad swe roles. As a result, too many college grads have a very high gpa coupled with good internships. This makes it impossible to separate good junior devs from bad junior devs through traditional screening methods, leading comapnies to opt out of hiring new/recent grads altogether.



2) Many companies that are less prestigious than faang have been forced to settle for less than stellar junior candidates during the covid boom since during that time any decent new grad could get 150-200k tc working in big tech. These subpar swes may have left a bad impression of junior developers on employers, and are now being more risk averse when it comes to hiring new grads based on their prior experience with shitty junior engineers.",2024-01-22 00:58:38

16ved1g,They rejected me without even looking at my resume (Wellfound),"This happened on Wellfound (the job website catered to startups).

As per my understanding, the application process on this site is different from most sites. You create a profile, and then when you apply to job, you simply have to send a message to the company about "" What interests you about working here? "".

And then if they like your message, they accept it and look at your profile (which acts as a resume)? At least that's what I think. There's no option or prompt for attaching a resume when you make that initial message.

I applied to one company and complemented them on their work. I said I thought it was interesting and would like to be a part of it. Just within 2 hours, I got a rejection message. But when I looked at my profile stats, it looked like they didn't even look at my profile. The last view I got on my profile was from more than 8 months ago.

Why would a company do this!??!? This seriously makes me think that I have somehow ended up on some kind of a blacklist. Like the recruiters just enter my name into some database and it says "" DO NOT HIRE "". It makes absolutely no sense!

&#x200B;

So I've been searching for a job ever since I graduated, when recently a company I applied to reached out for an interview. When I applied for the job, I thought it would just be a normal Security Analyst job where I would be working with a team or under someone that I could learn and gain as much experience as I could about the the cybersecurity sector in real life.   


But, during the interview, the interviewer said something about the security department being new. I was a little puzzled about that, so I asked if I would be working with a team or under someone for this position, and he said that if I'm accepted, one or two person (including me) would be ""the security person"" of the company. I was already a little worried, because I have just graduated and the only work experience I have is my 3 month internship, which I mostly did reports for my senior pentesters anyway, but I didn't say anything and continued with the interview, thinking that there would be other experienced applicants and I wouldn't even be considered for the job, so I should just practice my interviewing skills with him.   


Well, I have just received a text from the interviewer, saying that I am accepted for the job, and he will send my offer letter later today. Not gonna lie, but I am a little freaked out about the responsibility and the possibility of being the only one responsible for the whole company's security department. I feel like I don't really have the experience for this. Should I decline the offer? Or should I just accept it and wing it as I go? Any advice would really be appreaciated.

That sucks, big time. But don't let it get you down. You have skills, you have potential, and you have options. Here is something I feel I did right to land those interviews and find a new job in the bad market quickly after being laid off from my first job.

The number one thing is **network like a boss**. You have seen those numbers in Linkedin job posting. An application without reaching out is almost invalid in today's market. Your resume will never get reviewed. I emailed over 1k+ recruiters and hiring managers. I think email is better than LinkedIn Inmail because Inmail is too easy (anyone can send it) and you can't follow up unless they reply. Also, don't forget to follow up after your first email, I usually do up to 3. [InTouch](https://intouches.io/) is a great tool for finding and sending emails quickly and it's totally worth it.

The second thing is **apply like crazy**. Don't sweat the rejections, they're normal and they don't matter. Just move on and apply to more. I use [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/) to make the process easier. (just double check each field in the applications, it's not perfect) Also do some homework on the ones that interest you and tweak your resume. Tell them why you're a great fit for the role and the company vibe. Show some passion and personality.

Finally, **don't lose hope**. I know it's hard to stay positive when things don't go your way, but trust me, there's a job out there for you. You just have to keep trying and keep learning. You've got this!",2023-07-17 04:22:27

Going to grad school for a masters is always an option but getting that experience as a swe early on as a new grad right now is even more critical for future success to move toward bigger roles when AI-assisted coding replaces the majority of entry-level swe roles. I am speaking to those who are new grads or soon-to-be new grads that are considering ML roles, SWE or development roles in general.

11uktwo,gaming laptop or macbook for college?,"hi, soon to be cs college freshman here, i'm wondering whether it's worth it to buy a gaming laptop (zephyrus g14, or any other laptop that's pretty light and has good battery life) or a macbook (or maybe a surface laptop) for college? i'd prefer to be able to play some games once in a while, and i'm not sure if bringing my entire pc would be a good idea, especially if i'm going to be going pretty far away from home.

i do currently have a gaming laptop, but it's pretty cheap so i have issues about heat/fan noise and battery life, so i'm wondering whether i should have that and a macbook, or try to sell it and get a new one.

specs don't need to be anything crazy, most of my games are games that can be run well on modern low-end graphics cards (like a 1650, which is what i have currently) but would probably struggle on integrated graphics

11l0p7t,Tier 1 vs Tier 2 school choice?,"Just for context: I live in Canada, in a province where most of the good ranked unis are all in the city. There is another school that's a few hours from home and that is not as well ranked but it's extremely well funded with a beautiful campus, top of the line research institutes, etc.

I got into unis A, B and C in Computer Engineering in all, A and B are very good universities in the city, and C is a lesser known, but heavily funded university but with a lower ranking that not many people outside of Canada would know about. However I feel a certain draw to go to C, not just because ""I want to move out and be independent"" I'm already extremely independent and have lived alone before so it's not an exciting new experience let's say. I want to move there because I feel like if I stay at home I won't be able to focus and give uni my all, I have big aspirations for my time in uni and really want to do well, and I've learned that I far much better in terms of education when I'm left alone to focus on my own, there are way too many distractions that happen at home and I'm afraid it will affect my uni time. 

Unfortunately for me, most people around me don't understand this because schools A and B are super well ranked nationally (we're immigrants and going to ""the best"" school is kind of the only thing they know about) and C is pretty unknown even though it has better resources and better opportunities in research. 

TLDR: Do I go to a tier 1 school and risk having a bad academic life, or a tier 2 school and know that I'll do amazing there?

1809jou,Read this if you hate CS or can’t code,"Firstly, I want to say that I am not attacking or criticizing anyone. 

If CS is your passion, that’s fine. CS isn’t my passion. I got forced into it. 

You may ask why I don’t just change my major. I wish it were that simple. 

A little backstory on me. I wanted to major in marketing especially social media/digital marketing but my parents told me to stick to Engineering because it was “safer”. 

Alright so I chose CS because it paid hella bread and it looked cool.

So there I went, got into a top 100 college for CS. Little did I know that I would hate doing it.

It was genuinely boring for me (at the time). Freshmen year, I hated going to my CS classes because of how boring it was. I also had to work a retail job because of how much I needed money to support my family, after my dad had passed away. 

My GPA tanked to a 2.9. Yeah… 2.9 at the end of Freshmen year. Not a good sign… 

Alright Summer 2023 rolls around and I think mannn I can’t keep doing this. I’ll be on the streets at this point. I decide to get my sht together and grind the summer. Completing random certifications online and doing random projects. 

I felt like a fraud because I was spamming these and not learning anything. I was copying YouTube tutorials and replicating projects to put on my resume. 

Fall rolls around, I grind in my classes and I’m getting all A’s. Still, I don’t know how to code.

But the crazy thing is that I have a realization. I’m good at marketing right? I’m also doing a career in CS. WHY DONT I COMBINE THE TWO???

So I did start a [YT channel](https://youtube.com/@revolutionarycodee?si=n_FB2TzPG2iNnPiO) before, but I was barely consistent. I released a video every single day for fall (right now). 

I’m genuinely learning how to code while gaining an audience on YouTube that I plan to turn into a full time gig someday. 

Now what changed in my liking CS? I realized that technology was the endgame. Whatever you have to do, tech is involved. 

Now about 2 months in of learning to genuinely code, I got an offer at a start up company. I know it sucks, but for my level, I’ll take anything I can get as a Sophomore.

So here’s everything I learned so far in my CS journey:

1. If you don’t know how to code, do codecademy tutorials and record yourself and put it on YouTube (you will learn more and feel more motivated)

2. Stop worrying about other people, focus on your progress. Show up every single day and outwork everyone. 

3. Learn it the first time. There’s no shortcut to learning. Do the hard work, especially when you don’t feel like it. (Hamza)

4. If you want to make a ton of money, build something useful that people would KILL for. You will be a millionaire, but it won’t be easy.

5. It’s never too late to start the coding journey. I started sophomore year of College. 

6. The journey will virtually never end. You will keep learning til the day you die.

I know this was super spontaneous but I wanted to get most of it out. Thank you for reading. 

Remember, keep grinding and do not stop, no matter what anyone says. You were the one chosen to change your whole family’s history. Make it happens.

tl;dr - Start a YouTube channel and learn coding. If you want money, make a useful product and start selling it. It’s never too late to start coding.",2023-11-21 05:27:10
164lsym,Should I continue with CS?,"I am 17 at the moment. My dad is a software developer, so I often saw him code and got amazed by how he could make his own apps. When I was 12, I learnt a bit of basic programming. My dad wanted me to become a lawyer but I insisted I want to do CS and he kinda accepted it eventually. I created some basic invoicing apps with reporting and stuff using WinForms & .NET.

I  continued doing this for a long time and was able to understand how computers work at a low level and a big chunk of programming.

I thought of freelancing 1.5 years ago, and in 2 weeks I got my first gig for 50$ (huge thing in my country, India for a kid 16 years old) . After this I was making 100-150$ a month for 2 months, and then I applied for a Minecraft Mod Developer position for a big YouTuber. He started paying me 400-500$ a mod, and I was able to do 1 mod a week. I was really happy with my progress.

However, around that time my 10th board exams started (kinda important), so I put it on hold, and once they were done I started again, I was making 2k-2.5k a month when I was around 16-17. 

However, this distracted me from studies in 11th, and it hit me in 12th grade so I stopped development and just continued on studying so I could get into a good college.

Now, I see a lot of kids here go for CS because they think it pays well (well to a certain limit), no one knows what it is, anything at all. I have even seen kids who dont even know what the full-form of CS is. I am not trying to bring anyone down but now it feels like a huge rat race, which gets me worried.

I have around 4 years of experience in frameworks like Spring Boot & ReactJS, I've made a lot of projects ranging from development, DSA, robotics, and all sorts of shit.I can still make 15-20$ an hour (again, a huge thing here) but I am just studying for a good college.

Should I continue & take CS in college as a major or some other branch? CS is my love, especially the low level stuff, like CPU architecture, assembly etc.

Also, I do not plan to work in another country since my dad would not want that (he finds countries other than India unsafe).",2023-08-29 15:38:30

174a9yj,How Do We Solve The Software Engineering Skills Gap?,"Hi everyone, I'm conducting research as part of my undergrad and would appreciate any insight you'd be willing to provide.

The software engineering landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, and the demand for skilled professionals continues to soar (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023). However, recent graduates often find themselves facing a skills gap that hinders their ability to meet industry expectations. A careful literature review revealed that the biggest perceived skills gap by industry were soft skills such as professionalism, teamwork, communication, and project management (Akdur, 2022). Further, some hard skills such as software maintenance were also identified as pain points (Dobslaw et al., 2023).

In light of this challenge, I am seeking your input on two potential approaches to bridge this gap. 

**Option 1: Academic Reform**

Many argue that the core of the issue lies within academic institutions. They believe that universities and colleges should adopt their curricula and teaching methods to better align with the rapidly changing needs of the software industry. This option calls for the re-evaluation and transformation of traditional Computer Science curriculum with a focus on interdisciplinary learning and an emphasis on ""soft-skills"" such as project management, communication, professionalism, and teamwork.

Counter-arguments for this include concern that a shift towards soft skills would result in a lack of technical knowledge, and that it might not be feasible to teach these soft skills in the short, 1-2 hours per week of an 8-12 week course.

**Option 2: Startup Programs**

A novel solution to this problem has been investigated by the University of Helsinki through the creation of a software startup (Tenhunen et al, 2023). Students work, for pay, to develop and maintain software products gaining practical experience both in hard technical skills as well as soft skills such as communication, professionalism, and teamwork. 

Counter-arguments for this approach argue that the selection processes for students may be biased leading to systemic inequality, student run startups may not be sustainable long-term, and the program may cause students to focus less on their studies resulting in poor academic performance.

&#x200B;

Please take a moment to share your thoughts on which approach you believe holds more promise, or if you see value in a combination of both or neither. Your opinions and insights will help shape the conversation around the future of software engineering education

On this mock interview, Nolen solves a problem where he gets a unit conversion problem. Like he gets (m, 12, in) which means he has to convert 12 meters into inches. He is given 5 units (m, ft, in, hr, min). 

The solution from the video seemed a bit overcomplicated. I tried the solution in the photo.

16y87te,What was the point?!,"I could have dropped out and gotten a trade freshmen year. I didn’t want to disappoint my parents. I was told i could get a job and it would pay well. I seen the offices and snacks and the comfortable lifestyle of software engineers.  I wanted to escape poverty and help my family, as many of them didn’t go to college.

So I stuck with it. I got two internships after applying to hundreds of places and getting rejected.

I tried to get this full time job that I live by. I could WALK to their office. I PASSED their interview. I KNEW people who were doing the hiring. And I got rejected.

I have a job offer though. About 70. But it’s across the country. I’ll have to live alone and pay rent alone in a place I’m not from. So after all the money spent, all of the tests, homework, tears, panic attacks, countless anxiety attacks, insomnia, and lonely nights, what did I gain? An opportunity to be isolated across the country? An opportunity to leave all of my family and friends? Is this what my hard work brought me? Is this my reward?

I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs. I’ve been rejected from hundreds of jobs. The entire point of this degree was to get a job, be financially comfortable, and be happy. I worked so hard. I did projects. I couldn’t leetcode, but I definitely worked hard.

What am I supposed to do? Why did I put myself through this? Why did I even go to college? What’s the value of this degree if no one wants to hire me? And if I do get hired, how do I gain anything if I have to leave everyone I know and love behind to be isolated with my panic attacks?

Why didn’t I just get a trade? I could have been a plumber. Or HVAC. I could have had a car, and maybe my own place by now. So what did I even do this for??? 

I’m so upset I was rejected. All I can do is keep applying.

EDIT:

Hey everyone, I’ve been having a lot of anxiety attacks since August so I really catastrophized in this. Now that I’m feeling better this is pretty hard to read.

First, this new city is much more vibrant and has much more opportunity than my old city. The funnest summer I ever had was in this city. It’s also much safer and more friendly.

Second, I’m glad I even got an offer. So many people are struggling to find employment in our field right now, so complaining about 70k is pretty strange.

Third, I am not completely cut off from my old friends and family. I can get a $100 ticket to see them whenever I want. And if I feel like it, I can go back to my old city when I get experience. And we can call eachother.

Fourth, I know a lot of people in this new city because my two internships were over here. The very first guy that I messaged in the new city said that he’s down to letting me be his roommate. I didn’t need to look that hard. And we’d work at the same company.

Fifth, my main issue is probably just managing my depression and anxiety. This situation is perfectly fine, and it’s only October so I can keep applying. I’ve just dealt with recurring anxiety attacks since August started so I’m not all the way “there.” But I can manage. I can cope. And I can have fun and come back home if I want.",2023-10-02 20:59:06

18asjlu,Should I be content with my salary and lack of ambition?,"Should I be content with salary and lack of ambition?

Sorry if this makes people angry, and to preface this I am really just trying to seek validation for my lack of ambition in life.

Background: currently a senior at a top cs/ivy school. I immediately accepted a return offer (they only gave me 10 days to decide) for 114k in august to work for a government contractor in the DC metropolitan area (hybrid, would be living at home to save money). Honestly I initially felt excited and relieved with finishing the job search, especially since I know the WLB is pretty chill and that I’ll be graduating debt free due to the generous financial aid i received from school.

But part of me is also angry for not pushing myself to look for other job opportunities with higher TC. Most of my friends and people I personally know constantly talk about their FAANG+ job offers with 200-300k TC, and I feel like I should have pushed myself to try to get a higher paying job. It honestly makes me embarrassed when everyone is constantly talking about the job search and people are disappointed when they ask and I tell them my relatively (at this school) low salary. Don’t get me wrong, I know the salary I was offered is way more than enough money to get by… but I also feel like if I just put in some extra effort I might have obtained a job paying a LOT more which would allow me to live even more comfortably. On the other hand, even tho I go to a top CS school, my grades are subpar (low 3s), I can barely do leetcode mediums, and outside of my internship I don’t have any notable projects or activities, so maybe putting in that extra work would have been for nothing 

Am I just being stupid and giving in to the competitive environment and peer pressure here? Or should I have been more ambitious with my career goals and worked harder? This is the only thing that’s been on my mind the last 3 months and it’s killing me, and there’s not much I can do about it now since I already accepted my offer and most of the high TC entry level positions are filled.

- They have done nothing to stand out. No dual major, no minors, no side certifications and projects, very little to no work or internship experience (Internship experience in terms of trying to find a full time job). 

A lot of you have done it to yourselves. Not all of you, but a very very large percentage. A lot of you that didn’t get anything didn’t make yourselves standout, and that’s YOUR fault. What connections have you built? What clubs have you joined? Have you gone over your interviews and resumes with recruiters and your advisors? A good GPA does not go far if that’s all you have that’s good. I will get downvotes for this and the ones that do are the people I am calling out. Not trying to be mean, but your pity is all over this feed and it’s cringey and annoying. Take accountability. If you get denied by over 100 places and find no job with a CS degree, that’s on you. I know a lot of people in my CS major at the University I go to and the ones that don’t have anything lined up and keep getting rejected are the ones that have done nothing extra. The ones with stuff lined up have a stacked resume. This isn’t 2018 where anyone with a CS major will get a job.

15g872f,How to Prepare Ourselves as Software Engineers in the AI Time?,"AI is on the rise and it enables people to do amazing things that weren’t possible before. As software engineers, how should we prepare ourselves?

I’m not talking about AI taking over software development. I don’t believe will happen anytime soon.

I’m not talking about using copilot to generate code either. That is a tooling change. It is the same to software development as it is to all other types of works. 

I am thinking about how software engineers can more actively take advantage of the rise of AI, and potentially better position ourselves on the job market. I can imagine a future in which most apps will integrate with AI to some extent. And it is software engineers’ job to implement this. So the AI related features will be a specialization in software development, similar to frontend, devops etc today.

And this might have a promising career path for a software engineer. How should we prepare ourselves for it if we want to break into this field?",2023-08-02 12:54:52

11wl2nj,Third time trying to get at uber. Any advice?," 

Hey guys. So this is my third time trying to get at uber. I received 3 times for a software engineer II position. But i never passed at the first round (live coding interview).

This was the feedback i received from my last interview:

Pros

* Seems to have some knowledge on the Kotlin language

Cons

* Candidate didn't code much during the session, and was not able to think about a solution for the problem
* Didn't ask much questions about the problem
* Communication was a issue too, as I needed to constantly push him to speak something and share what he was thinking

Conclusion

The candidate had extreme difficult during the session, not being able to code much. He was not able to even start creating a logic to solve the problem. After a couple of minutes, I started to give several hints, and at some point, I clearly described two ways to solve the problem, but even with that info, he was not able to code much.

12amhw8,I’m worried that the Computer Science classes for a BS degree are too advanced for my current level of understanding. Should I switch gears or stay the course and learn more foundational information on my own time.,"Hey everyone, I have a question that you all will hopefully have an answer to.

TLDR: I’m worried that the Computer Science classes for a BS degree are too advanced for my current level of understanding and I’m wondering if I can learn the basics from a CompTIA A+ book or other resource.

Wall of text version: Last year I decided to earn a degree in computer science, with the ultimate goal being to work in cybersecurity. Now, I can use a computer but I would say that I have no real IT experience or understanding of computers. I’d really like to learn more about the networking side, as I think that would give me good foundation to build upon.

I’m now 31, and I was in my late 20s when I started my college career. I have earned an Associates in Paramedic Studies, but the BS in computer science is the next step. When I took my entrance exam a few years ago, I did not pass the math section (namely because I hadn’t done any math in an academic setting for 10 or so years.) I’ve since taken all the remedial math classes needed to get caught up and am moving on to Calc and Analytic Geometry 1 for the upcoming fall semester. Once I learned the material again the math has been going well and I’m not too concerned about it so far.

As far as the computer side, I’m worried that the computer classes will be too advanced for me and I’ll have no clue what is going on. Looking at the other computer programs offered, like Information Systems and Technology or Information Assurance and Technology, the classes seem more geared towards beginners and the sort of stuff I’d like to learn. Some of them are:

CTS 110 - Network Essentials

CTS 120 - Introduction to Linux

CTS 140 - Network Security Fundamentals

CTS 234 - Windows Server

CTS 130 - Networking 1

CTS 131 - Networking 2

CTS 240 - Advanced Network Defense

CTS 242 - Network Intrusion Detection and Penetration Testing

CTP 114 - Python for Everyone

CTP 115 - Introductory Object-Oriented Program Analysis and Design

CTP 130 - Programming in PHP/MySQL

CTS 170 - Digital Forensics 1

CTS 216 - Network Forensics

CTS 222 - UNIX/LINUX System Administration

CTS 236 - Virtualization & Cloud

STM 213 - Professional Skills for STEM

Essentially, I’m worried that I won’t be prepared for the computer classes, and I’d like to learn what the classes I listed above offer but they are associates degrees. I feel like a BS in Computer Science degree will allow for more open doors in the future. Are these classes all things I could learn on my own time from something like a CompTIA A+ prep book, YouTube, etc?

16x14vq,What is the most meritocratic career for a CS grad?," 

TLDR; Title

Hi, I am a junior year computer science student from a 3rd world country. All my life, I wanted a career that is designed in pure meritocracy. I know that's just an idealization but closest to that is fine. I thought about joining academia first, but then I realised that you need to lick the boots of some well-known professors, if you want to get admitted to top school from no-name school. Even if you do great work, your connections is that matters to get your work published. So I thought software engineering career would fit me too. One of the most important requirement is to solve leetcode type problems. Which demanded hours of work to be put. I like this approach since all my hs life was to solve as many problems as I could before the day ends to get one of the top universities. And before that it was highschool. The numbers you spend at the desk is the pure determining factor of your success. I know that education system is flawed, but that's what I was taught. You put hours of work and you get rewarded, no external factor will stop you. But as I dive deep into the forums like this, [r/csMajors](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/), r/cscareerquestions, blind etc. I realized that this system is not as meritocratic as I imagined it to be. I found some people that have the perfect interviewing experiences (both behavioral and technical) but still getting rejected for some reason. And I saw a conference made for women to get into job was flooded with men, not just that I heard that this conference was an easy entrance for women to get into faang jobs before with easy algorithm questions. Seemingly hr needed to fill diversity quota that was set by company and this was the easiest way. The morality is this occasion is debatable. Or there are hiring managers that hire you based on your gender and ethnicity. These might be false, since I heard it from random people online, and I got no evidence besides that. Nonetheless, it planted seeds of doubt in my mind. I am rethinking my career choices right now. I heard Investment Banking and Management Consulting are another common career options for STEM alumni from my school. I am thinking about these options too, since they too have a proccess like lc grinding, case study grinding. I don't know if it has less toxic hiring proccess. I simply want my career to be based on merit.",2023-10-01 13:24:40

I have declared my major as computer science due to the apparently decent salaries and having somewhat of a desire for learning how to program. However, as I read more about the tech industry, I see more and more about the struggle to find jobs/internships and about how A.I. may potentially wipe out a good amount of jobs in the coming years. This has really been making me regret my decision to declare my major as computer science and it’s honestly quite depressing as I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I thought for a while about majoring in information systems but upon reading about my intended university’s(UNR) information systems program, I learned that their IS program is somewhat subpar. I don’t know where I’m going with this but I was hoping to get some advice and hear some thoughts about the future of the comp sci job market. Thank you.",2023-03-18 08:18:28

12ub4t6,Computer Engineering vs. Computer Science,"I realize this is basically all speculation, but with AI becoming better and better at coding I can see a future where either a) there is infinitely more code in the world as a consequence of AI making coding much easier/faster, or b) it takes fewer developers to produce the same code, and there will be less jobs for CS grads in general. Given this, would switching to Computer Engineering be a safer option? The raw computational power that these AI's will need maintaining, and I think a computer engineering or electrical engineering degree could align with that.

177dsti,"Okay, SWE/CS people (& those in the industry) I need your opinion!","I wanted everyone's opinion on something that has been concerning me for the past 8 years. I'm referring to the LeetCode-like questions that companies give, where if you don't pass, you basically are discarded.

Is it me, or am I just crazy? Personally, I know I am better at coding to build something that, say, users can go use or download and that would solve a problem, than sitting down for 60 minutes to come up with a solution to some LeetCode-like question.

I've realized that every company wants me to sit down and go through this but I can't seem to get them to see that my skills are better highlighted through my work---not through a 60-minute test. Most of my time for the past 8 years (I taught myself to code in 2015) was not spent grinding LeetCode. Instead, I was learning to code and I was building things. I do want to say though that I do understand Data Structures and Algorithms---just not to the extent of someone who spent their past 8 years mainly doing this while I was building stuff that people were using and downloading. IDK, like I said, maybe I'm just the crazy one here.

I mentioned earlier that I am better at building and allowing users to download whatever app I may have than a leet-code-like test. This is in fact true and one example I have is with my app CampusStore that I built on my own during the summer of 2023. I coded the entire thing, currently maintain it, and grew it to currently 300+ users all on my own. I launched the app on August 17, 2023, right before school started back up.

Here is the LinkedIn post that speaks about this: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jerry-noel\_campusstore-campusstoreapp-forcollegestudents-activity-7097961910884597761-LULY?utm\_source=share](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jerry-noel_campusstore-campusstoreapp-forcollegestudents-activity-7097961910884597761-LULY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

This is just one app that I built. But I'm highlighting this one specifically as it has more users than all of my other apps combined and it's my current endeavor, as well as the one I am most proud of.

So basically, I'm just trying to get other people's opinions on this topic because I know there are talented people out there who perhaps aren't the best LeetCoders but are for sure on their way to becoming successful and who were able to build something valuable for users and customers. In my head, I think there has to be another way to evaluate someone because this can't be it. Building something from scratch, navigating the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, growing users, maintaining the app, fixing bugs, listening and iterating on user feedback, and implementing ways to keep track of what's happening in production, all while keeping an eye on costs and implementing different mechanisms to keep costs low in terms of server costs must have merit. I think this should hold more weight for someone like me than a 60-minute test.

1aes2oc,Should I choose computer science? (Please read everything),"Look, before I get into my question: this is not a typical post made by someone who just likes computers or programming and just wants to choose cs because of that.

I am 19M, finished high school and going to go to uni/college most likely this September. I pretty much only have one option in mind. The reason for which I have doubts about it is because I really like on side of it and kind of dislike the other.

I was always good at math, maybe not top of the class, but I never found any difficulties even when it came to learning calculus in the last years. I've liked solving logical problems since elementary school. I'm not a prodigy, but what I'm trying to say is that I enjoy. I have two friends who are already in the middle of their first cs year in uni. They say that so far it's been exactly as expected: loads of math and almost not practical work, but as I said, I enjoy math and don't mind this.

So the issue now is, that I find programming lame. I don't like actual web or app development. I don't like the idea of most programmers' jobs. I tried learning some basics of front-end development and didn't enjoy it that much. I still have to explore other programming languages and sectors of cs to understand more what I like, but so far for what I tried I didn't really like it. For this reason, I'm scared that I will loose motivation during my studies.

The main reason I want to choose cs is to get a career in cybersecurity, which I've been passionate about for many years. I like cybersec also due to the fact that it relates to my love for solving logical problems. I don't know if I should maybe choose a more cybersecurity oriented program in uni, or just go with cs and then go for a cybersec master. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",2024-01-30 16:13:17

17z462t,The way to get a job interview is through hiring manager outreach,"If you just submit your resume, you are a piece of paper.

A piece of paper in a pile of hundreds of pieces of paper.

Even if you're a great candidate, you might not get picked out. Does not mean you are a bad candidate, you are just participating in a broken system.

NYU alum here (class of 2017) and I've been working on Reachy ([www.reachy.app](https://www.reachy.app/)) for the last year and a half. I talk to students pretty much every day and for CS students, they usually tell me that because they were told to apply to 100+ jobs to secure even just one interview, that's the way to go and that all they need are better projects to up that to maybe 5.

Also, recruiters aren't the only hiring managers nor are they the ones you should talk to. Yes, a great recruiter can help you through the whole application process and vouch for you, but you'd rather have a director or VP vouch for you and how you can help the company meet its hiring needs.

Startups are also raising millions every week - I see very little talk about approaching them. If they raised millions, chances are they are hiring, even if their careers page is empty right now. For all you know, they could also be filling those jobs through people they already know through the people who work there.

I've spoken to hundreds of CS students at this point and it's always ""if I submit more applications, I'll get a job."" Someone I spoke to submitted 1000 applications before he got an internship. Why not instead reach out to 1000 alumni or non-alumni hiring managers? Surprised that careers centers aren't talking more about this and are still telling students to spam applications - yes, apply, but don't think being one out of hundreds of pieces of paper is how you'll stand out.",2023-11-19 19:00:59

A lot of positions that are open during late/winter and spring are usually startups that hire and they tend to be shitty cuze they are unstable, terrible WLB and you can be laid off anytime as opposed to working for a big company that has money to train you. This has been my experience so far so depending on your goals, I recommend working for a big company than a startup because mentorship tends to be better and benefits/WLB are also freakin good depending on which company you work for.

Hi guys,

This isn't to boast to at all. 
But this is to just tell you that despite this market, if you still work hard, the universe will work it's ways to get you a great job. 

And to just to maybe add how I did got these and how did I apply 
1. Strictly LinkedIn - no other source, plainly applied and got this. Didn't have any specific technical rounds. Just 2 behavioral with asking me about my past experiences. 
2. Career fair - yes this works! I have had so many people telling me careers fairs are shit. I won't deny but all you need is 1 recruiter who will remember you and contact you so just shoot your chances. 
Process - phone + 1 technical + 1 Hiring Manager 
3. Referral - this one was the best offer I got this season. 
Phone + coding assessment + 2 technicals + 1 hiring manager 

I am open to answering any more questions on how I did it. But in the end it's just about motivating you guys because that's what motivated me too.",2023-04-25 10:59:36

I go to a top public school, with an extremely reputable business school. I had originally planned to double major with cs and finance; but now looking at it, i’m not sure it makes sense to go to business school. (It’s a two year program at my undergrad)

I’m interning at the a to z company this year and hopefully want to intern at a quant firm next year. I also hope to get an MBA down the line, and have heard having our business school on your resume is pretty valuable. However, it’s an extra $8k/year to attend the school, and i’m not really sure it provides and value for my immediately career goals. 

Does anyone know if working in big tech (maybe quant) speaks for itself when applying to MBA programs?

Hi everyone

With the rise of AI, which IT jobs will become irrelevant? For example will coding become irrelevant?

I'm asking this question so I can know which subject of computer science I should focus on. Also can I become a data scientist/date engineer or do something with machine learning with an applied computer science degree?

I know for coding people will bring the argument, that people will still have to check the code the AI/program made, but the amount of people needed for coding will be way smaller because you don't need the actual coders anymore. So will IT jobs will the demand still be great enough that I will be able to find a decent job quickly.",2023-03-07 22:27:45
11jy9jq,Does your school allow you to view other people's code?,"I struggled and eventually left CS and part of that I think was feeling super isolated because I couldn't *really* ask for help. I couldn't show anyone code except the IAs in office hours, which were always super overcrowded. I could *maybe* get help every 60-90 minutes for 10 minutes tops most of the time. We could work with one partner but anyone I tried to work with wanted to just sort of split the work so we'd miss out on part of the learning of the project. 

And they just sort of bailed soon after the beginning anyway for one reason or another. I'm used to spending 60-90 minutes trying to work through a point where I'm stuck and then be able to reach out somewhere for help but then that was just not allowed. I risked getting in trouble.

1aja972,It is INCREDIBLY cope to want to work at FAANG when quant exists,"For context, I am a former high school US olympiad contestant, competed in an international olympiad, and have graduated at one of HYMPS with a BS and MS in four years. (not trying to brag in any way, I am just trying to lay down some context on my personal background).

I have ended up with a FAANG offer, which is not bad, but I do not see why many people consider this salary remotely good and/or ask me to stop complaining given my past: I have done many, many final rounds for quants, and have previously interned at two quant firms, so I know my rough capabilities. The truth is that my salary is less than half of what students, who were much worse at the internship performance wise, and were simply 0.0001% better at talking and not requiring visa sponsorship, are getting -- and this enrages me. Many people come up to me and say ""you do realize that FAANG is still a good outcome in this economy"", but I present counterarguments.

We can consider cope in two main facets of explanation: first in terms of what I would consider a skill-based validation, and second in what I consider to be money-based catchup.

First, we consider skill-based validation: having a quant job is a clear indication of skill. After all, the interview process is most similar to taking USAMO and other similar olympiad tests in high school, which were clear indications of being intelligent (if it was not, then MIT would not be using such metrics to admit students). Furthermore, I claim that the most intelligent kids in the world either end up in quant, or pursuing a PhD to go into quant: just look at many of the US IMO team or the Putnam results and you will see that this is often the case. 

if you are smart => you are in quant, 

which by contraposition shows if you are not in quant, you are not smart. I've worked hard to get to multiple olympiads and at HYMPS but the reality is, unfortunately I am not smart, and you are probably not that smart as well. Until you receive external validation from quant, then it is impossible to even CLAIM that you are smart -- you are objectively less smart than a lot of math olympiad students at quant firms, and getting into FAANG is not going to impress any actually smart kids from these circles. 

Second, we consider money catch-up. For this, we define a few new terms:

First, we refer to one year of not working as one year of OFFSET, i.e. a year where you do not do any work. Then, now we can consider people as being X years ahead in life, i.e. they are 3 offsets above in life. (Note: We must consider years ahead in the eyes of the BETTER agent, for which the better agent should have higher access to privileges and other properties barring all else equal)

Say you get a 200k salary at a FAANG, with one year offset vs. a 190K salary at another FAANG zero offset. In this case, you have to work 20 years in order to GET BACK at the level that the person who graduated first is at, i.e. somebody in the year above. But it gets more concerning:

Now consider a more real example: you are working at FAANG, get a good offer negotiated to 220k, and then you meet a friend working at an HFT firm which pays around 400k. (Note: most actually reputable places pay more i.e. Citadel JS HRT 5R, but I'll just use this because if your firm pays less than this most likely it is on par or subTier 5 on quantnewgrads). Now note that in 20 years the earning difference between you and this other friend is 3.6 million. Think about what you can buy with a 3.6 million dollar home: you are that much less of a subhuman with your so-called 'good' 220k salary, than somebody at a BARELY above tier 5 firm in quant. 

I can get into more detail with this analysis, as I have an entire excel sheet which compares a few more entries such as geometric scaling of wealth, SMV etc. but I just want to give a brief exposition as to the reality of quant vs FAANG. It is NOT good to be in FAANG: you will forever be losing to other superior humans, and the thought of this alone means that you can never live comfortably in whatever small apartment you choose to rent for the next 5 years of your life until you can even begin to muster the words 'down payment' for something long term.

Stop simping for FAANG when quant exists.",2024-02-05 06:44:43

15wdfec,A question from a highschooler,"I'll try to sum everything up as quick as posible. 

So I'm still 2 years away from college but I'm planning on majoring in cs. I'm from a fairly poor country so PCs and just tech in general is quite expensive for most people here. I'm saving up money to buy a laptop before I go to college but there's something that's kind of bugging me. I've heard that MacBooks are the best for cs majors but the thing is I want to use my laptop both for college and games and a Mac is definitely not made for gaming (+ I heard that professors make fun of students with Windows??? I don't wanna deal with that). So what I wanted to ask is whether a mid-range (or slightly better) laptop would get the job done? (I prioritize my studies so if it's really that big of a difference I'd get a Mac I just don't want to make the wrong decision)

1ahx7d5,Going back to the company from last Summer. Feeling down :/,"Hi guys,
I'm just feeling very down, and I needed to talk. 

I'm an international CS major at a well-known Liberal arts college.But, I guess my original sin was coming to this place in the first place. I had an offer from an HBCU in Washington who send tons of people to FAANG. I have couple of friends over there, all of whom intern at such places. However, the college I'm at currently offered me 12,000 USD more in financial aid, which is why I decided to come here. Looking back, I shouldn't have done that.

I feel like I have a decent resume, nothing too special, however I believe it does show that I know what I'm doing. Got an SWE position at a small company my freshman summer break, did a part time SWE job my sophomore year, and got another SWE position at a small company again for my next summer break.Also have decent projects, nothing groundbreaking, but still something that shows that I know how to find my way around.

I'm now a junior, and I wanted to reach higher: get an internship at a better, larger, more well known place. I did try hard. Got around 250 applications in. Barely got OAs from 4 places, none of which got past it to the interview phase. I reached out to a recruiter at a startup who does cool shit, they offered me an interview but I just heard back that they rejected me. 

The previous company I work at invited me to return back. However, I feel disappointed at myself. Disappointed that I couldn't get anything better offers that I have to return there. I feel stupid, behind on life and career. I thought I'd be better than this. I had dreams and aspirations but it turns out all I'm destined for is working at a no-name company doing the same repetitive shit. They don't even give return offers after I graduate, so what's the point?

Anyways, just wanted to talk to someone. Now this is not exclusive to what's been going on career wise, but I was thinking of self-harm a few months back, but I did recover. I feel like I'm again in the same fold now cause I feel like such a loser. 

I can't return back home after graduation (I just can't, so many personal reasons). Well, I'd need a good job offer then. I probably won't get it with only 2nd grade internships huh. Future's bleak and black. What's the point?",2024-02-03 14:23:09

1akroh7,In desperate need of help (FGLI CS Underclassman @ HYPSM),"Hi all! 

tl;dr FGLI CS freshman @ HYPSM needs a plan to get better at the skills necessary to be a great SWE (problem-solving, coding, efficient solutions, developing projects, etc.)

  
From a young age, I always knew I wanted to work in tech -- I built my first computer when I was just a little kid with my cousin, and my love for video games/online communities just skyrocketed from there. I did a little coding here and there, but nothing of substance. Fast forward now, I'm a FGLI freshman majoring in CS at HYPSM and I am just beyond overwhelmed.

I am trying hard in classes, but I know that it is not enough. I've taken the AP CS courses in high school, done well in them, and have also taken my school's introductory CS class, but I still feel like I'm an incompetent programmer/CS person. To that end, I am reluctant to take higher-level CS courses, but I know next year that I will have to. My goal is to work as a SWE at a HFT firm.

Now, here's my plea for help: I need a plan to start from somewhere. It's so conflicting, because on the one hand, I want to do LC to prepare for difficult interviews. On the other hand, I want to do projects to develop my coding/problem-solving/project-based skills. And, nonetheless, I want to read books to learn theory so I can actually have a deep understanding of CS (I know this is what my education is for, but it is still a desire). Being the perfectionist I am, this has lead me to do nothing. Pathetic, I know. But I am in desperate need of a plan. I have done my research on many sub-reddits, but am just so overwhelmed with where to start. It seems like my dreams are so far away, and as if I am wasting my HYSPM education.

Should I begin with small projects, where I try my hardest not to follow tutorials, to learn? Should I start with learning DSA and doing LC daily (DSA at my school is notoriously terrible in terms of application, since it is so theory based)? Should I read theory books for fun? Should I do all of those things? Some of those things? I'm so lost, and it seems like I just can't compete with these kids who have seemingly been coding for their entire life.

With all that being said, I acknowledge how privileged I am. I have been given an amazing opportunity, and so I just want to capitalize on it. I am willing to put in all the necessary work as well. Open to all. Thanks.",2024-02-07 02:08:50

18y6z9n,Where does the smugness /arrogance surrounding knowing how to program come from?,"I am an non-traditional student working on my second bachelors degree in computer science. 

Before taking an interest in CS, I had some background knowledge of the rumors that people in CS (or other STEM fields) were smug, competitive, and arrogant. 

But considering I'm an adult in my 30s, I thought this wouldn't be very true in a post bacc program where everyone else is an average age of 30+.

But I was wrong. 

I was truly shocked at how much people bragged and flexed....about computer science. 

I'm only about 1/3rd the way through my degree program, there were rumors at Discrete being ""super hard"". It was time consuming. But doable with a good professor who could teach. 

Then Data Structures and Algorithms is another supposed hard class. And it felt sufficiently tough at the time, considering that I needed to get used to the new concepts and applying them. 

But with the classes I've taken (and the self studying I've done as well), I keep wondering ""Where does the super hard part that only the smartest and most special people can handle come up?""

(I know CS is quite complex in certain areas. I'm not that naive. But certain aspects of every field is reserved for the best of the best mind. And those jobs aren't supposed to be for most people.)

But just the regular degular programmer or software engineer. 

I don't get where this attitude  that coding is so hard and special that the learner is somehow smart or special for learning it comes from. 

Or why so many adults participate in it. 

I guess I can understand 18-23 year olds being braggards. But people in their 30s and beyond is weird AF to me.

Everything I've learned so far, even if it's hard at times, I keep thinking to myself ""The average person could learn this no problem if they put in the effort.""

I feel like there exists this subset of people who seem to make it their mission to project them image that the barrier to entry in this field is astronomically hard. 

And....it's not. 

I remember when I first started learning how to code, I sucked at it. Badly. Learning how to think algorthmically was hard AF. 

But I likened learning programming to learning another language. I speak another language very different than English. And I remember the time when I was bad at it. When it was confusing. I still remember it. 

And I also remember the moment it clicked. And I just got it. And the following X years, I've gotten progressively better at it. Much quicker than when I initially started. But that's just how anything works. 

Keep doing anything long enough, and you'll gain some competency at it. 

But in the Computer Science space, some people seem hell bent on acting like that's not true. 

I remember before I started learning code. I would sometimes stumble across subreddits or articles about programming, using programming jargon. And I remember feeling like it all sounded so smart, and hard to comprehend and far out of reach. 

But as I've learned the concepts behind that jargon, I find it...sufficiently easy enough for regular people to understand if they'd learn it..

So then the smugness and arrogance surrounding being able to build stuff using computer code makes no sense to me. 

I can understand being proud of yourself for working hard to learn a thing. 

But I don't feel like being a programmer or in SWE or having a degree in CS is really anything to be excessively smug or arrogant about. 

But it's clearly common AF. So I feel like the odd person out.",2024-01-04 07:04:42

Spent five minutes coding up a solution and it passed all but two cases - an I literally know how to optimize the solution to make the rest pass as well. Lesson learnt that if it seems way too hard it’s probably a brute force. But also, can people stop calling everything “leetcode hard” when people ask about OAs just because they can’t solve it?

164snv7,On Honesty - A Different Take on Disclosing You've Heard an Interview Question Before,"Hey folks,

So I jumped in on that [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/163l8os/comment/jy5wwfb/?context=3) about telling the interviewer if you've heard a question. I got a bunch of downvotes, but hey, different strokes for different folks, right? The majority seemed to lean towards not disclosing, and I get it. If your main goal is to get through the interview, then sure, keeping mum might be the way to go.

But here's my take: I'm looking at this from a more holistic view of being a working professional. It's not just about acing the interview; it's about setting the stage for the kind of working relationship you want.

Being upfront about knowing a question does a couple of things. First, it shows you're honest. That's a big deal in any job, not just the interview. Second, it breaks down the 'us vs. them' vibe that can happen between interviewees and interviewers. You're not just trying to 'beat the system'; you're trying to engage in an authentic convo about the work.

In my experience, this has been a good move. I had an interviewer switch up the question once, leading to a more exciting chat. Another time, we went deep into the optimal solution I suggested, and guess what? Got offers both times.

So yeah, I am not saying this is a one-size-fits-all strategy. But if you want to build a career based on trust and mutual respect, maybe give honesty a shot.",2023-08-29 20:00:30

145nozl,Will taking CS as a minor only affect my later career?,"Hello! I recently picked up cs as a major last year as a sophomore. But after taking a few classes and reviewing the major requirements, I was planning on just taking it as a minor. 

Here’s some context: I went into college as a Gender Studies major, and eventually got into cs as my boyfriend was a cs major. My sophomore year (last year) I was a CS + Gender studies double major. It was fine at first, but towards the end of the semester I couldn’t balance all my readings, papers, and then code

I want to leave the door open for a potential SWE job. Upon reviewing the requirements of the CS major, there are some courses that are required but that I am not really interested in such as parallel systems, hardware architecture, and discrete math. I recognize these are important courses and a lot of SWE people build compilers, GPUs, etc so these low level courses are definitely useful but I ultimately want to go into backend SWE. On the other hand, the cs minor only requires data structures, algorithms, and any electives such as mobile dev full stack OOP, the courses which interest me more.  

My question is, will taking cs as only a minor as opposed to a cs major make finding a SWE intern or job much harder? Should I stick with gender studies and cs or just go gender studies with a cs minor?

126pmkb,Why there are so few job openings for software engineer and salary is very low now?,"I am sophomore(4th semester) of college.
So, I am not going to apply full time job until 2024. I am going to apply internship for 2024 summer starting from July 2023.

So, to see current job market conditions, I looked up job postings in google jobs and ziprecruiters.

When I see the job posting, it is mostly for senior level software engineer and very little openings for new grad/junior level.

Also, it shows salary very low. It shows like 70~100k for senior level software engineer and 45~67k for junior level. Most job opening for junior/new grad level requires at least 6 month experience on job, plenty of languages and frameworks and the salary is mostly around 50k which is much lower than median salary for entry level.

My searched location is DFW and Austin in texas.

Is there reason why there are so few opening for software engineer and salaries are very low now?

Is it because, now is March? Is March one of worst time for job openings? When is the hiring season for junior/new grad software engineer? (I've heard it will starting July).",2023-03-30 15:02:19

Applied for AIML research internship roles, only applied FAANG this year. Although I have publications, I have 0 publications directly in my field so far.

From my experience, here are the most important things about landing internships in descending order of priority.

(1) Connections

(2) Project Fit

(3) Ability to ""work out loud"" on problems in a clear and logically consistent manner

(4) Technical skill

I know this isn't generalist advice, but I think it's especially helpful if you find a project that you would see yourself working on with these companies, instead of focusing on ""one-off"" projects. Even if you are at a point (like me) where you don't have paper outcomes, you can still land positions if you are clear in what you are researching, and have exciting work that you can show off.",2024-02-12 09:03:15

Hi, I'm a first year student at a top CS program and am passionate about AI and have plenty of experience. However, I've heard that you need a PhD in AI to get a decent AI job and chances are that I'll earn less than if I just did my bachelor's or master's and went through the general SWE route. Thus, I would like to know which subfield of CS (distributed systems, backend, cyber security, etc) pays the best and doesn't require the PhD route. What do SWEs at top companies primarily do? Sorry if this is an over-asked question. I'm asking this question since I'm very passionate about CS but there's just so much to learn, so I would like to know what has the best career options so I can focus on a specific topic instead of overwhelming myself!

What can I do in the meantime to stay on top of my career? I have a couple of good projects on my resume already and 10 months worth of internship experience. I’d need something for the next month ish stretch, and hopefully into spring. Preferably something that makes money.

18c9jhr,How to land an ML internship (Blind75 / NeetCode150 for AI/ML),"If you're like me, you really like structured learning resources, and are also interested in how ChatGPT really works at the lowest level, and even how to code it up from scratch. Generative AI is the biggest wave in AI/ML right now, and projects on your resume that actually deal with the lower level details of Gen AI will almost certainly draw a recruiter's eye.

Unfortunately, there aren't nearly as many resources/tutorials out there for these kinds of projects as there are for typical SWE projects.

Most AI/ML resources have way too much math, and are either hella confusing, or just drag on with tedious math proofs. I created the YouTube channel [GPT and Chill](https://www.youtube.com/@GPTandChill) to focus on what you actually need to know for ML side projects or to break into ML engineering.

So far we've covered many ML and neural network concepts from scratch, and the next video in the playlist/series will be on **coding up GPT from scratch**. If you're interested in this, I would recommend going through the [existing playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf2BgkdQjMYsyPx7HPO4M6aqTfPl2iEPx) first!

All you need for this is a decent grasp of Python and basic calculus knowledge (what's the derivative of x\^2 and similar stuff)

I'll also be making a similar playlist/series for how self-driving models work and how deepfakes are generated, in code, from scratch. Next, I'll be adding a platform where you can try to code up the ML concepts and run against basic test cases.

189i5s0,CS Major Job Suggestions?," I am not great at programming. I first noticed this in my AP CS A course where a routine coding problem would take me 1.5-3 times the average time to solve due to me not being as effective in debugging my code. I earned a 4 on the AP CS A test, which is not optimal, considering I am looking to work as an SWE. I have also struggled a lot in university computer science and programming-related courses, earning primarily B's and C's in them. My resume does not have any internships or personal projects on it; I mainly have clubs and relevant course experience on it, and my Github has my schoolwork visible. That said, are there any decent computational or computational adjacent career paths available for someone in the SF Bay Area or LA County that are less programming intensive, and can earn $85,000 or more that fit me? Some that I have heard mentioned include things like project manager, however, those require longer experience and generally don't have as much openings as SWE especially with the shrinking job market. I have also considered operational/logistical engineering (more interesting to me), as well as systems administration. Please also discuss important pros and cons if any. ",2023-12-03 01:19:02

I constantly need someone to tell me that it's not gonna matter in few years. I am so hung up in my past thinking about the grades again and again. Nothing makes me feel better.

My health issues aside, my head feels heavy. Can't focus on anything, no neetcode, no leetcode, no netflix. My comfort show is friends but I have watched it so many times that even that doesn't help in distracting me. How do you come out of this phase? I don't wanna rely on smoking or drinking. I just wanna come out of this phase in a sober state. How do you tell yourself that it will be okay without any hard evidence giving any guarantees?

17htyij,Is it worth all the trouble getting into this field,"


I’m almost done getting my bachelors for CS(great timing for the market I know ) 
But the more research I do the more I see that SE isn’t the best option . 
Why is it we have to work so hard both in and outside of school only for most of us to get burned out so quickly . 

This screen shot is from 1 month ago for a Home Depot SE INTERNSHIP . Over 2500 applications in just over 3 days . Home Depot is not even a high tier tech company .
 this field has become so saturated (yes I know saturated at entry level but plenty of opportunities at high level ) 
But that begs the question . From what I’ve read most people burn out / can’t make it long enough to even get to senior level . 


It’s taking people 300+ applications to get a regular Software job , why is this normal . 
Why are we fighting to hard to get to an illusion .

17hsy34,Is a career in Comp Sci right for me?,"I will be heading to college soon and am excited. Though the one thing that is weighing on me is choosing my major. I became interested in computer science after watching Michael Reeves and Mark Rober. Even began working with a raspberrypi on a few basic projects. However now that the time has come, I am worried that computer science might not be for me.

I am alright when it comes to math, currently taking math 110 online Duel Enrollment. Though I’m not particularly good at it, usually takes me a little bit to understand new concepts. Math is definitely one of my least favorite subjects . This has me concerned as I don’t want to go down the wrong path and end up regretting my decision.

I am specifically interested in going into AI development. I want to work on projects like ChatGPT and Neuro-sama. While also making a salary that is over 6 figures. Am I going down the right path or am I going to end up regretting my decision?",2023-10-27 17:36:55
17hoqfs,Worth it to continue searching after receiving an internship?,"Yes I know it's greedy to look for another one even after receiving one, however, the one internship offer I received is at a location that I wouldn't want to return to full time and the pay is slightly below what I would want for a full-time offer. Thus even if I get a RO from them I probably would still want to go somewhere else.

I'm currently thinking my options are:

1. Try grinding for grad school and get a masters so I have more time for Internships --> RO. Unfortunately, I have very little research or connections with professors so it would be an uphill battle to acquire those in time as most people going to grad school already have research/connections.

2. Thug it out and apply to jobs as NG which seems a little bit like suicide in the current market.
3. Keep applying now and hope to somehow land a good company that I would like an RO for.

We do also have the CS mainstays like DSA and DBMS, which I don’t think I’ll struggle with.

Also because this is r/csMajors I have to obviously mention jobs. I’m kinda worried that an employer might see that I’ve specialized in AI and pass me up in favor of someone who’s done a general CS degree.

I’m coming up to the end of my first year. Where I live, all STEM fields take the same classes for their first year, and you have the option to switch your degree before you start with your second year. If you miss that window your only choice is to drop out and start again, which I obviously don’t wanna do. So I need to make a decision soon. Any advice?

I do also want to pursue a Master’s degree if that makes any difference.",2023-09-02 15:05:15

Allow me to explain. I currently live in Israel (18M) and I'm about to go to the army for 2.8 years.
I also plan to start doing a bachelor's degree in computer science immediately after I finish my mandatory army program (^_-).

However, recently I've been considering my options, and I believe that going to study abroad, specificaly in the US, would be an amazing opportunity for me. I've always heard about MIT's top-tier computer science program, as a result, I would really like to go and study there. I am aware that there's a very minor chance of me actually getting accepted into there, especially with it's difficult curriculum of actually getting accepted into there.

I've researched what exactly it is that I need to do to get into this prestige university, and as far as I know, I need:

* A letter with multiple essays on multiple different topics.

* A few recommendation letters from my teachers attached to myain letter.

* Pass the SAT exam.

( * Pray. )

My main concern for actually going there is the fact that I would be probably wasting my time doing all of this, pouring my heart into paper, sucking up to my teachers for good words about myself and studying for an exam that is pretty much useless here in case of going into an university. All of this would take lots of time, when I could just study for the psychometric test (the ONLY thing that I need to do to get into a uni) in order to get into a university.

What y'all think? Should I risk it and go the abroad option (something that I REALLY REALLY want) or stay and complete my degree here?

I appreciate any feedback and thank you for reading my long post :)

Delete those apps if they have that kind of effect on you. I did this a never looked back.

15o5cw5,Just starting my comp sci program at wgu. I've been seeing a lot of rants about people not getting jobs. But my question is everyone applying to ONLY SWE jobs? [Incoming rant],"I've been seeing a lot of rants about people talking about how after getting their degree and internships etc.... It's basically impossible to get a job.

However even if we take the current lack of hiring companies and positions into account. 

If we are all getting comp sci degrees but everyone is trying to be a software engineer instead of exploring the other paths in the comp sci field are we setting ourselves up for failure?

Like comp sci is a good tech degree that's not limited to just software engineering. But it seems everyone gets this degree then complains about the competition because of the jobs they try and funnel into.

Not trying to to downplay anyone's feelings or experience but it seems a lot of people have a skewed view of what's happening.

Were getting comp sci degrees but everyone is only going for SWE jobs. Meaning a lot of other sectors like data analytics, networking,ai etc...are available but not alot of people choose those.

Alot of people are funneling into swe for what I can only assume is the salary then complaining about the competition and then not getting jobs. 

But realistically swe roles are not your only option and there's other ways to make money in the comp sci world. 

I guess I'm just sick and tired of seeing the complaining post from people who can't get swe roles even though they know it's a highly competitive field.

And even worse, alot of them probs don't like coding but some will get those jobs over people who actually like coding.

And to make matters even worser lol. There's other jobs available. 

No offense but sometimes it comes off as people are complaining because the commonly suggested easy ,high paying swe jobs that they thought they were promised with this degree seemed appealing to other people and now that they had no genuine interests in comp sci they feel stuck because they're not making the money they want in the perceived ""easy remote"" job they read on blogs.",2023-08-11 10:39:52

I have also implemented some networking protocols from scratch, and done some projects related to machine learning. I'm also into graphics stuff, and have written a 3D game engine from scratch. Right now I'm learning about compiler design and I plan on writing a compiler from scratch in a few weeks.

I am an international grad student (US) pursuing MS in CS. I just completed my first semester and my GPA is only 3.11 so far. I'm really afraid that it might hamper my chances for even getting shortlisted for interviews. I see that many companies require a minimum of 3.2 GPA. Will it be a hard cut off? Will ATS detect it and auto reject? Or will someone manually reviewing the profile later scrutinize it?

Will it several impact me? Should I mention my GPA in the resume? 

There is nothing I can do regarding it until the end of the Fall semester to increase it. But, that would be already too and majority of the applications close by then.

PS : I had work experience over 2 year's as full stack developer (Not in FAANG)  before joining my masters program. Can this composate my low GPA?

PPS: Being an international student limits the number of  opportunities already. Out of the 15 current open applications, around 10 wouldn't hire an international student because of the VISA sponsorship additional overhead. And, on top of that I have a crappy GPA and a below avg profile. I'm doing the best I can as there is a lot of time left, but I'm shit scared and panicked deep inside! I know that I Fu**ed up!

14bc0yv,How to learn new things without a strong feedback loop?,"Disclaimer: This post is not strictly about programming languages, but just about learning technical concepts in general. Also I posted it earlier in r/learnprogramming but since it has become restricted, I’m posting it here. 

I have generally been a quick learner in high-school/college, grasping concepts related to multiple disciplines in very short periods of time. I'm not sure if this was motivated by the fact that I knew I would be tested in these subjects at some point so I better study, but I have always enjoyed learning concepts, practicing them and applying them in exams. However, once I started my job (been 2 years at it), I feel like I haven't been learning at the same pace at all. I make plans about learning something new every day, however I end up getting stuck in some vicious cycle or the other - tutorial hell, spending too much time going into minute details (I'm more of a perfectionist so I get anxious leaving out small details), or just saying fuck it and getting unmotivated to follow through with my plan.

After some self-reflection, I figured out that the thing that kept me going throughout my academic life was the quick feedback loop - every time I used to learn something, I used to enjoy applying it to solve some question, and learn from my mistakes to perform better on exams. However, such kind of feedback loop seems to be missing when I try to learn something new on my own now, which I think is the cause of my sluggish pace. Everything just seems to be a vast sea of never-ending technical concepts (system design, AI/ML, etc.) that you have to learn to be a good software engineer. I'm beginning to think if I'm just better suited for academic life since I have been able to perform well in those environments throughout high school and college. 

If anyone has any guidance to help me out, or have felt the same way in the past and are willing to share what they did to get out of it, I would really appreciate it. And I'm very sorry for a long post!

TLDR: How do you keep yourself disciplined to learn new technical concepts once you graduate and have a day job, since there is no ""quick feedback loop"" for you to practice what you learn and get better at it?",2023-06-17 00:04:46

I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit has experience with a masters in cs (please specify if course or thesis based) and whether or not a course or thesis based graduate degree would be worth the time and money to help me land a job in the field. I appreciate any help. Thank you all!",2023-05-11 16:41:40
13e4i0i,Stephen Wolfram thinks the future of programming may become heavily prompt-based with language models.,"I'm unsure if this is the right place to post this, but with the topic of ""Will large language models take our jobs?"" being asked constantly on all the CS and programming subs, I figured the Redditors here might be interested in the discussion between Lex Friedman and Stephen Wolfram.

""When you look at Computer science departments that have turned into places where people are learning the trade of programming, so to speak. It is sort of a question of 'What is going to happen?' and I think that there are two dynamics. One is that the kind of boilerplate programming is going to go the way of the assembly language went back in the day of something where it is mostly specified by, at a higher level, you know, you start with natural language and turn it into a computational language. When you look at the computation language, you run tests and understand that is what is supposed to happen. If we do a great job of the compilation of the computation language, it might turn into LLVM.""

[Lex Friedman Interview With Stephen Wolfram](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qvrPWi47YUyYqdCFwQw53?si=p_8iUeLtTG-cojDgNpBqsQ&t=9239&context=spotify%3Ashow%3A2MAi0BvDc6GTFvKFPXnkCL&nd=1&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA9WO0WrCMBSGnyberXVJ1TkoUi3xYm4oKNMriWlqs2bJaZK28%2B2XyvYQwrn4%2BH8%2Bzl95D%2B41jh0YL8tbxAAiJXUdL8CaouU%2BNSD0COGkbJU6t1al1aAgkiFMww119G9z8x0iAdKZQgRKms5uP2UyOx1up6ZY0X7XTwgi1ElEcji%2FyIPY%2BP36iZuv%2FPoBy8btEJ76UM4xmQfkRnvxMwR%2FPxCekMxVpr8Dfs%2FkeNnlfLre0%2B6Nbo%2B6Xm3uc5lSF8brB5kcPF0E5XlUCuZbK1Jjr0xL%2FguPXezsoQEAAA%3D%3D&product=open&%24full_url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fepisode%2F4qvrPWi47YUyYqdCFwQw53%3Fsi%3Dp_8iUeLtTG-cojDgNpBqsQ%26t%3D9239%26context%3Dspotify%253Ashow%253A2MAi0BvDc6GTFvKFPXnkCL&feature=organic&_branch_match_id=1184956517542970255)

If the above link does not take you directly to the point in time where he discusses this topic, go to 2:34:00 (2 hours, 34 mins, 00 seconds). Also, the interview is an interesting one. I recommend listening to the entire episode. Stephen Wolfram is a highly intelligent individual, and I enjoyed listening to his insights about large language models.

I think that he is right, but I wonder to the extent that we become reliant on these language models to remove most of the more ""tedious"" forms of coding. I, for one, welcome this potential change in programming, but I wonder how the Luddites of programming might feel about this. Wolfram's statements still infer a large reliance on understanding code and how it works, so in a sense, programmers are ""probably safe"" in terms of job replacement, but the ones who refuse to adopt LLM for their work will likely suffer negative consequences in the future job market. In other words, learning CS is a safe bet.

What are everyone's thoughts on Wolfram's statements about programming and LLM?",2023-05-10 21:52:23

12t7mro,"Which offer should I take (sophomore, summer 2023 internship)","I received two offers, Company 1 (defense company, C++ tech stack) and Company 2 (well-known tech company, frontend).  


For context, I already accepted Company 1's offer and will have to renege for Company 2.

Here are the details:  
Company 1: (work in a different state)  
Pay: 25/hr  
Relocation stipend: 2000$ (this'll cover my entire housing)  
Work: Working with C++ to create math models.  


Company 2: (30 minute commute)  
Pay: 40/hr  
Work: Working as a frontend developer (React.js, not sure about the other languages)  
Note: I wanted to work in full-stack and although this MAY be a possibility, for now if I intern there I am a frontend intern.

I am a bit disappointed with my role in Company 2. On the other hand, it pays way more and I do not have to relocate. On the other hand, Company 1's work seems interesting, but is a non-tech company and less prestigious, which might lead to a harder time finding an upcoming internship in Summer 2024.  


I am not sure which one to go for. Any opinions?

EDIT: I am not really sure what I am passionate in, so either one of these topics is a bit in the air. I am doing supervised ML right now, and although it is interesting in theory, implementing it feels like a bit of a chore. On the other hand, I have previous experience w frontend, but I’ve never felt passionate about working w React.js.

Overall, I am just not sure what field I’m interested in.

Imagine making something that makes multiple companies millions just to have one call you up sometime later, telling you to fix your code without any compensation or recognition. Then think about who the average programmer is and the disconnect between the higher-ups and the people coding. Most programmers are copy pasters and the higher-ups don't even know the ins and outs of the code and could care less if you're using somebody else's code. So the guy contacting you through GitHub could be some gen z guy with an attitude that doesn't even know what the MIT license is. It's just something to think about.

I, myself, don't go to a prestigious school. I did take over 200 hours of courses on Udemy. I didn't mindlessly watch them for the certificate, but really focused on the info, followed the hands-on projects, and continued with personal projects on my own.

During my freshman year in college, I applied for a security researcher role at a startup.
The CTO of the SU who interviewed me asked me why he should hire me instead of more advanced students or new grads.

My answer was simple: ""Judge my knowledge"".

A few weeks ago, months into my role at that company, I asked him about that. He said I came to this interview light years ahead of every other student, new grad, and bootcamp grad in regards to my knowledge.

This is not a flex. CS degrees very rarely teach people things they can't learn better and more in-depth on their own.

Granted, and before you raise that point, you need to pass the initial HR screening, and studying at an ivy league school is a simple way to do that.

However, you also need to pass the technical interview. And, imho, the best way to do that is to come with actual practical useful knowledge.

Very few roles require you to write code that is O(logn) instead of O(n). The current hardware and cloud computing tech render these difference moot in most cases (unless dealing with GIANT amounts of data).

19bhtos,"Moving from Australia to the US, many many questions.","For reference, I am turning 21, an Australian citizen completing my Bachelor of Computer Science in Melbourne, Australia at RMIT in my final (3rd) year.I really want to move to the US for a job, for several reasons, the two main ones being higher paying jobs and a change of lifestyle, however my pathway to get there is very unclear. I have family friends in the US, with some in tech.   


What they have told me is I should do a Masters in CS at a relatively cheap uni so I can stay there under the E3 Visa and eventually get a greencard following that route. Although I don’t think a masters degree is very beneficial to me as it’s putting me more in debt, but if it’s the only way I can get a green card then so be it. Also I would be working part/full time somewhere to pay it off hopefully.  


Ideally, I would get a job offer from the US and I can directly go under the E3 there, but again this seems unlikely and I also have no idea how I would even go about applying for one. I have been trying to build my resume with side projects and all, trying to land an internship or two for my final year, but I still do not think it’s enough to land a sponsor.So ultimately I am very unclear as to how I’ll make such a big move. I have a lot of people offering me a lot of promises but I wish to do my own research.  


 Obviously the end goal is to land a high paying job at a tech company the fastest way possible, but my timeline for that is so vague. Would I be able to do a tech job whilst I do my Masters? How would that work? Would it be smarter to just stick to the normal path of graduating here in Australia and finding a job here, gaining some experience and then maybe considering a move to the US? Although I don’t really want to put things off I think it’s better to make these moves young.  


Please suggest me how I should go about things and what more I should be researching to have a better idea of things. This is a very early planning stage for me so please excuse the obliviousness.",2024-01-20 18:09:22

Currently l’m doing A levels in UAE and I was considering Canada for my bachelors degree in computer science but after looking at the cost and recent change in rules I decided to do degree in uae and later my masters in Canada but i can’t decide on what to do. if I go for a degree in Canada I will spend more but I will probably gain more experience and find a job faster then doing a degree in UAE. On the other hand, if I go for masters in Canada first I will spend 4 years in uae and spend less on my degree compared to Canada then find a job in uae(which is really difficult these days ) or do masters in Canada while searching for a job.

If we look at getting citizenship, going for a degree in Canada is faster then masters as it will take me 6+ years from now. 

Also I have heard from many programmers that degree doesn’t matter that much but your skills  for getting a job in CS. This is also a point that is making me to do degree in uae and save up my parents savings/loan as spending thousands on a degree which don’t add that much value to your skills is not worth it.

In the end, my goal is to become a programmer and get Canadian citizenship while spending less but I don’t know should I go for a degree or masters in Canada.

18y1h9p,Finding a Niche in SWE?,"
I’m a junior CS major will be working for a FAANG (the zon) company this summer.
I can’t tell if I convinced myself that I like the work or if I did it for money. I’m just worried I won’t be on a team I like in the summer and won’t enjoy the work. I have friends in different majors who are in a very niche field and seem to really enjoy it.

I was wondering what companies exist that I could work for in the health sector. 

I have heard that bioinformatics prefers MS/PhD students, and I was more so leaning towards companies that build health software. 

For example, Flatiron Health. I got rejected from them recently but want to try again for new grad.

I’m also interested in sustainability and how tech could intersect it

 I was wondering if anyone has any advice or other companies I should look out for. I’m hoping that after this summer, my resume will be stronger for a company like Flatiron health.

But also, if anyone has any advice in general, please feel free to message or comment. I feel like Computer Science is such a large field and I’m worried because I did not find my specific role or domain",2024-01-04 02:15:24

However in my current role there I'm not exposed to any codebase. Even if I don't have much work, I dread my job daily. I feel that I'm set up for failure.

I'm not allowed to internal transfer to other roles until 18 months as per company policy. So my options are to stay another year then try to switch internally. Or I can switch to some startups.

I will be in my company for atleast 1 year so the only difference is should I stay for another 6 months and switch internally or immediately switch externally?

Pros of current company
Stable, no layoffs, good WLB, good company to have in resume.
Since I don't have professional coding experience, it might be easier to switch internally to development role than outside.

Cons of staying 
Current role is extremely undesirable, I either sit with almost no work all day monitoring bunch of things (only work if incidents or issues which we monitor) or lot of issues at once so don't get time to have breakfast.
No growth in current role.
No KT or much help from coworkers and all the tools are internal so can't Google.
My manager has said he will try to push me to devops slowly but I'm not interested in that domain.
Also I think I learn a lot more when working in a startup.",2024-01-02 02:14:48

I am studying Engineering in India, my branch is IT, and my GPA till now is 9.1 on a 10 point scale

TLDR: I am in Third Year. The only experience I have is in Web Development. I have no experience in any other field, like ML, DS, AI Cyber Security. My resume just looks so monotonous, I want it to have more variety of projects from other CS fields, especially research based projects, so how can I get into that and improve my profile?

I realized that my entire profile and resume is just Web Dev. I have only done projects in Web Dev and JS. I have very recently taken up a freelance project ( to make a website for my uncles law firm which I will publish) and I am doing an internship in Web Development and learning some project management also from a small company in my city. In my second year, I made some small projects in Java and Python, but those are a little childish.

I also realized that doing only Web Dev projects and internships will only give me a Web Dev job (which is not bad, but), so I want to add some more projects in my resume about other fields in Computer Science ( especially research based ). It will help me to apply for Masters in the future. I want to publish some work of mine as well. Also it will just overall improve my profile and not make it look monotonous.

Also, Can there be research in Web Dev ? if so then please guide.

It's kind've lackluster, but I am still gonna try it since it's just something I can get started with. There's a small issue with the office of the job. The office is 60 miles (1 hour) from where I live, which kind've sucks since I am NOT a morning person. The job is hybrid, so it's not horrible, but I am not looking forward to driving so far.

Option A: Hybrid relocating to MCOL, Entry-Level TS/SCI Software Developer in Government Consulting, TC \~$120k. Starts in June. (Considering this option because of the things I can learn from others at a large company)

Option B: Remote in LCOL, Chief Technology Officer in Tech Startup, TC \~$60k + 10% equity. Starts in May. (Considering this option because I can have more impact)

Option C: Continue fully paid MS in Computer Science for one more year at T150 school. Last year will consist of me working on a large-scale project. Starts in August. (Considering this option because of free tuition)

Some things I can do are A+C or B+C. I think it is also possible to do A+B because there is no conflict of interest. However, I am mostly leaning toward doing A+B+C simultaneously because my project during my MSCS will be the MVP I am working on at company B, and company A is also open to continuing education.

1bslz05,Real life Aladdin situation,"Summary:

I'm an international student facing a big career and education decision.

I've received a $177K job offer from Company1 in San Francisco for an entry-level Software Engineer position.
I'm also in the final interview stage with Company2, which offers sponsorship for further studies.

I've been offered a fully-funded PhD at the University of South Florida to research AI-generated music therapy for dementia patients. This aligns with my passion as a part-time rockstar and my desire to innovate in the music industry.

Additionally, I have master's offers from Johns Hopkins and Purdue University, pending scholarships.

My dilemma is choosing among these options.
Which is the best choice?
If I go with Company2, I'm curious whether I can enroll in a part-time master's program while working full-time, how to manage both commitments, and if Company2 might cover the tuition.
Seeking advice on navigating these opportunities and balancing work with further education.









OG POST

Hey fellow Redditors, strap in because I've found myself in quite the pickle, and it's not the kind you eat. Picture this: I, a humble, wallet-challenged international student, tripped over a magic lamp recently. No biggie, just my daily Aladdin moment. Now, the genie inside didn't offer me three wishes, but the universe did hand me a decision-making nightmare that's almost as good.

On one hand, I've got a job offer on the table from Company1, ready to throw $177K at me for an entry-level Software Engineer role in the city where the hills will definitely get your calves in shape - San Francisco. Not too shabby for a fresh start, right?

But wait, there's more. I'm also on the cusp of nabbing a final interview with Company2, a behemoth in the industry that's dangling the golden carrot of sponsoring further studies for its employees. And let me tell you, I've got this in the bag - because I'm not just any candidate, I'm TOP-G (Top Genie, if you will).

To sprinkle a little more spice into this already zesty salad, I've landed a fully-funded PhD spot at the University of South Florida. My game plan? To merge AI and tunes, creating a symphony of artificial intelligence-generated music aimed at studying its effects on dementia patients. Picture AI meets Beethoven for the digital age - it's AI music therapy, in a nutshell. I kinda want this more 'cause i'm a part-time rockstar, hoping to change how contracts are done in the music industry.

Oh, and just for kicks, I've also got master's offers from Johns Hopkins and Purdue University waving at me from the sidelines, scholarships pending.

So here's the million-dollar question(s) I'm tossing into the Reddit void: What on earth do I choose?

And if I decide to dance with Company2, here's the scoop I need:

Can an employee rocking the OPT (Optional Practical Training) vibe dive into a part-time master's program related to their field, all while juggling a full-time gig at Company2?
If so, how do they manage not to drop any of the million balls they're juggling--How do they juggle both programs?
Is it within the realm of possibility for Company2 to foot the bill for such an academic escapade?


Help a broke, genie-less Aladdin out, will you? I'm all ears for your wisdom, anecdotes, and maybe a magic carpet or two.

1bio9nd,What is a CS Degree? SWE Perspective,"Howdy everyone. I just wanted to pop in and share some thoughts and advice from the perspective of a ’21 grad, mid-level SWE. 

First I see a lot of doom and gloom surrounding the rise of AI/ML tools. Writ large, our world is changing rapidly along with how we do our jobs and what our responsibilities are. I want to share something I believe to be true of our field: we are not programmers. We are computer scientists. We are problem solvers. What we do as engineers, is take in a set of requirements, interpret them in the broader context of our technical architecture, company bureaucracy, customer demands, relevant legal frameworks, etc. Then design and implement a cost-effective solution. Those without a CS degree will have an extremely difficult time doing this, especially given that the prompts you’ll need to do your job are steeped in the language of computer science and require an understanding of the code output. 

Another thing - if you aren’t able to get an internship, c’est la vie. I supplemented my resume with technical clubs (software person on the engineering team most of the time) and volunteer work (tutoring CS to K-12 at a local library, working at hackathons). What matters (as someone who reviews resumes) is that you have something useful in there. All I want to know is - do you know the technologies I’m hiring for? Do you have problem solving skills?

Finally, your first job out of University does not need to be an SWE role. I started as a “support engineer” at a tiny company doing tech support for industrial equipment. My CS experience was EXTREMELY helpful in this field, and it helped develop a lot of corporate soft skills I was lacking. You are not wasting your time with a CS degree. You’re learning abstract problem solving skills which will serve you well wherever you end up. 

I hope this is helpful and/or motivating to y’all. Best of luck! :)",2024-03-19 16:21:45

1bii5nh,A.I. hype is here to stay,"So many coders and SWEs here don't understand HOW AI will impact their life. 

 
- AI is not just another tool for coders to boost productivity. Current gen tools like Python, Git, Excel, even google need someone who knows what he's doing to produce code. AI isnt aiming to replace tools like py or git, but to replace the user. Its Arificial INTELLIGENCE not Artificial tool #77373 that is just a text-to-code version of current gent programms. Everyone and their mother can now produce high quality code.

- AI is developing exponentially. With all the money pouring in and general tech development, AI is going to be smarter than anybody in no time, probably early 2025. 

- All tech companies are already starting to fire people based on rapid development of AI and resulting redundancies. 

An example:

Situation rn: CFO wants recent numbers for a business. He asks his Analyst to produce a report. The analyst uses excel and his skills to produce said report. Takes ages and costs a fortune since its a human and good analysts are rare.


Situation with AI: 
CFO wants recent numbers for a business. 
He asks AI to produce a report. AI has links to tools (databases, Powerpoint, and excel) and produces the report. No need for a skilled analyst and no need for a promt generator, because the ""prompt"" the CFO makes will be the same as to the analyst. Everything done perfectly in a matter of seconds.


So yeah, AI is going to cook you if you're still believeing that its just a temporary hype that wont develop any further.

1. If you returned after completing MS in the USA, what led you to choose coming back? Was it for family, career prospects, or other reasons? How has your decision unfolded over time?

2. Interested in hearing from those who returned without securing a US job. How was reintegrating into the Indian job market? Any challenges faced, and advice for someone in a similar situation?

3. Lastly, for those who opted for a job switch over higher education abroad, what influenced your decision? Are you content or have regrets?

Appreciate any insights, stories, or guidance. Thanks in advance!",2024-03-22 10:53:49

1bhyhed,Thoughts on 70k NG offer,"Hi, I am an international student deperately looking for a NG position. I already graduated in December, so I have less than 70days until I have to be employed or leave the country. 

Recently, I got an offer from a company with 60k base + ~10k bonus, which also offers H1B sponsorship and other benefits. It’s based in Chicago but it is a staffing company, so I don’t know yet which city/company I will end up working. I wouldn’t take the offer and would wait until the market gets better if I can stay unemployed longer, but it makes me comtemplate since this is the only offer I have atm and they provide sponsorships. It is a one-year contract which means I have to pay ~20k(depends on how early I leave) back if I get a better job and break it before it ends. 

I want to know your thoughts on the offer and my situation. Thanks!

EDIT; I was thinking of reaching out to profs who I’ve done researches with during college, which will also help me maintain the visa status. I just hesitated because I thought work experience would be more helpful than researches if I want to be in the industry in later days. That was one of my last options.

Maybe I should’ve included this in the original post as well. I wonder how you think about research vs industry experience at a non-well known company. I graduated from one of the top cs schools if that makes any difference.",2024-03-18 18:49:53

1blynzd,cheap and easy comp sci degree anywhere for experienced programmer (who already has degrees?),"Hello, I have 3+ years professional experience as a dev at a Fortune 500 co. I like comp-sci, I like math, I like learning and teach myself as much as I can in my free time- lately math but also it's applications in data science, neural networks, finance etc. I have an undergrad degree in economics and 2 more years in accounting for 6 years of total undergrad desk sitting already.  
In looking for jobs to advance my career I unfortunately learned I am very average, and also have no comp sci degree, which some places want and more places like. It's only one thing, one param, but is there any way I can get one relatively quick and cheap and easy from somewhere? If I call a university, who would I negotiate with? Hmm that's a thought.  
I'm not lazy. I've put in and am putting in the effort for real but don't really want to have to put in 3 years as a FT student and $80k given my background. I can get it online or wherever. The hiring companies who ask if you have one probably won't ask where it's from, so ""Go Land Crabs"". Or it's not the most important thing if it will help.  
So given 6 years already spent in a class and 3 years on the job, I feel I should only have to, or I'd only be willing to do about 1 year's worth of credits not to exceed $10-15k\*- online in evenings and weekends if possible. 2 years if I'm really getting something from it. That's the other thing. Even if I did it 2-3 years I'd probably only be getting 20% of what young bucks are getting out of it.  
\*I'd be happy to study so I can test out of any number of things in advance, like discreet maths, all the maths, other things. I can prove I got the chops. I'm not against investing the time per se, just the time in the program. I like self paced learning more anyway when it comes to math. How many people say they learned more from Prof Leonard than their own prof?  
Or.. perhaps I could skip a second undergrad degree and go for a masters in something. I have never thought seriously about that, ever, but it could be a way, potentially. I know I'd have to test out of a lot, and find a good program that suits me and helps me.  
When you're my age (40s) you care about efficiency and you care about doing what you're passionate about, not jumping through hoops to support large institutions where it doesn't make logical sense. Perhaps there's a masters degree program I could get accepted into in a field that I care about, that could be a powerful career door opener.  
But when you're my age you realize you have to do what you're passionate about. I did my second course of studies in accounting only because it aligned with what I already had a lot of credits in, under advisement (financial economics) when I should have just started fresh and did something I wanted like regular engineering. And very first time around, nobody even advised me, got to know me, not my parents, not anyone at the college that my grandpa paid for. They just told me to figure it out at 18 after giving me a sheltered life. So yeah.. you learn to be more self-directed, see the good in things as well as the bs- and there's both, and sometimes the system makes you swallow bs, sometimes you can get it waived or bypass it. That's where I'm at, that's my view which I think is reasonable  
Primarily I want formal ed to open career doors. That's it's role. I'll to the substantive stuff on my own but a degree I cynically view now as the window dressing, the 'pay to play'. If I could get actual value from a program, so much the better but I'm not banking on it. It would also be cool to not feel like an impostor when applying for jobs, trying to justify I don't have it.  
BTW I just found Cassie Kozyrkov's stuff recently, google's chief decision intelligence officer. She's impressive and a great presenter. She has degrees in or has done graduate work in economics, mathematical statistics, psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Wow. Wow. Just an insane amount of intelligence and cred. Few people are at her level but there are a lot of people still between her and me, competing in the same market.

I don't want to apply for any jobs where I feel I have a less than 5-10 percent chance of getting in the door. I know other factors are involved- networking etc but before I start sending out 100s of applications, I want to know how I can first make myself the top 20% of applicants, at least, if not the top 5% otherwise it feels like it's going to be a great waste of time and source of frustration. Top 5% of applicants when 600 people apply means you're still competing against 30 people.

I LOVE learning. Learning is my happy place but let's be honest- you can't just learn and succeed. You have to plan your learning, systematize it AND get credit or recognition for it or so much value is going down the sink.  
Thanks brothers and sisters",2024-03-23 18:09:09

I am an international student pursuing my masters in united states. I recently got 2 offers for summer intern 2024 from Genesys cloud and New york life insurance. Both companies offers decent hourly pay with no big difference. But genesys is fully remote and NYlife work location is NYC for the internship role. So, i am a bit confused here because i was also thinking of the opportunities for the full time positions in those companies. If anyone who has been interning with any of those companies can give some insights on the work over there. I wanted to know couple of things here
1. I have 4yrs of work experience back in india. Now, after my internship, will they consider my exp or will i be considered for fresher role
2. What can be the package in those companies for a full time role?

I honestly love anything in development/networks/cybersecurity. Anyways I’ve been sending tons of applications but haven’t landed a single interview. 

I’ve heard a few people online and at my school say that internships are for 3rd/4th years and that’s when they will wait to start applying for jobs. Meanwhile my parents say that I’m being lazy, my cousin got a cs internship at some big company in his 1st year, and I’m not trying hard enough, I’m doing something wrong etc.. Co-op people also say that there are plenty of offers for 2nd years and I need to keep applying.

Honestly the latter is probably true but idk what to do. I’ve put in so much effort writing hundreds of cover letters and resumes and I’ve gotten nothing out of it. I’m so tired and burnt out from studying, commuting home, and then applying for jobs until I sleep. I do hackathons and job fairs, trying to leverage my network/go to networking events.

I was stuck at some point and they decided to give me a hint which WAS WRONG. So lets say we have a linked list, ABC->DEF, and we want to find CDE, then realistically we have to search character by character. THE INTERVIEWER WAS CORRECTING ME ABOUT THAT saying that I should just check if the string I am searching for is in the current node(I was using Python so she was referring to the ""in"" keyword). THIS WAS LITERALLY WRONG as you can see in the example I gave. THIS TELLS ME THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THE QUESTION!!!! I also initially came up with an O(n) space solution, but it took them a while to realize that the constraints on the question was that the strings had to only be accessed once. So I coded up that initial solution for a while until they then told me otherwise, which led to so much wasted time. To add to this, I understand that English is not everyone's native language, but it felt like they didn't even understand what I was saying, and it was also hard for me to understand them. WHY would you have only 1 interviewer anyways? If they had multiple this wouldn't have been a problem. For example, literally a day before this interview, I had another technical interview where I was talking to the EM and 2 senior engineers. And that interview had a much harder question than the one I had here and I was able to solve both questions in 30 minutes. I understand that its also on me that I wasn't able to solve the fucking problem, but I can't help to wonder how things would've been different if I had a better interview experience.

I'm just really pissed off because I applied to this same company last year and I didn't even get resume screened so the fact that I fumbled in round 2 is such a pain in the ass.

TL/DR: I had a technical interview where I fumbled hard for a simple question, even though I had a much harder interview the day before which I thought I aced. Although the interviewer themselves didn't even know how to solve the fucking problem themselves based on the hints they gave me.",2024-03-11 22:58:10

1bcr2cl,A simple guide to crack your interview [for Beginners],"Hey I thought I’d give back to the community by sharing some tips on how to best prepare for your upcoming interview. I have worked hard to put these videos together and I hope you’ll find them useful. Let’s start. 

Just to give some context, I'm a software engineer working at a bit tech company (one of top 4 cloud companies) and I like sharing my knowledge. Any feedback is appreciated.

If you’re a beginner or you don’t have enough experience I suggest you add something to your portfolio which you can talk about during your interview.s 

Here is a Java Springboot app project which you can work on during a weekend. This is an app that builds a REST API + Unit Testing and also integrates a third party OpenWeather API: https://youtu.be/lDihdYfVACM?si=QPfZhiHSIUR4-vls


Brush up on interview fundamentals such as Big O:

Theory: https://youtu.be/G0NMGUZbtmk?si=zaDd0pQ8gPydx1JA

Practical examples: https://youtu.be/qN7gWGBD14g?si=UCUt11JWgpQ27-fb


Now that you have at least something in your portfolio it’s time to understand what you need to focus on for your interview prep. Here is a guide on how to find the questions that the company might ask: https://youtu.be/ybyjhWDr6w4?si=00BF-kzphA8_f7Mj

Ok, so now you are ready to start doing Leetcode. Start with learning about the most asked data structures first: https://youtu.be/AHtQb9aDFq8?si=OsTmlDMdKDx1-Ewv


Now move on to the most asked leetcode coding patterns: https://youtu.be/-lcAuPXsQ-8?si=1qEfCYJolqHOhrW_

You are almost ready to start grinding Leetcode, but before that I suggest you take a look at the most effective way to use Leetcode: https://youtu.be/4vcncZSJM_4?si=jChTdg2oy2czNE37


And depending on the company you might be asked a System design questions as well. Here is a playlist to begin with but it is not extensive: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gerIf2DYQ0I&list=PLJce2FcDFtxKEQBCjRqwb2Y95gkKSBp1p

1b6onnm,How do you feel good about having to go to grad school ,"Im an senior int’l student graduating very soon and I can’t find a job. I didn’t get a return offer from my previous internship…

I know only 2 people from my country in my class who are able to go into industry and work. Everyone else is doing masters and phd. 

I have been wanting to work after college all this time. Did a ton of Leetcode questions and prepared for several interviews this year but all of them fell through. Now I have no choice but to go to grad school. I hate going to grad school. I find it pointless and I don’t want to be another cash cow. But there is no other options. My country has even fewer opportunities and competition is fiercer, I won’t have a chance. Plus I feel like the tech bubble is bursting and there is a very real possibility of not having a job after grad school either, which makes it even more pointless. It is going to cost $100k for my parents who have to borrow it and finance it. They are fully supportive but i feel so bad for them and I wish I didn’t have to. 

How do you feel good about continuing paying the schools for a masters degree??? Every time I think about it I am filled with regrets and sadness. I am still looking for junior position jobs with very little luck. I know its too late but it’s better than not trying at all. ",2024-03-04 22:44:45

I think this is my first post here and as english isnt my first language so kindly ignore my mistakes. 

So my intention of making this post is to ask whether I'm wasting my time learning turbo c++ or not.

so I've just enrolled in a university for CS and there's this important course called fundamentals of programming where our teacher who isn't that bad of a teacher is teaching us programming but he's using turbo c++. I'm no expert but after some digging about turbo c++ I've come to a conclusion that this language/editor is extinct and has become obsolute. So naturally I asked my teacher about it and he gave a reason which i cant really understand, He said that when he was a student he had a teacher who was a PHD holder (which in all fairness is kind of a big feat in my country, I'm from a 3rd world country) also used turbo c++ to teach. 

So what do u guys think ? Is it viable to learn turbo c++ or is that a big fucking waste of time ?

I don't want to be a top tier developer, I just want to land a job that is accessible to me since I'm visually impaired and there aren't many jobs that I can do. and when I started to learn programing about one year ago, that was a somewhat doable career choice for me. I was going to be a low level programmer and that's it, no realistic probability  to be a senior dev someday. but that was OK for me, I don't have a job, so having any job would be better.

but that changed in the last few months, the rising of AI and the layoffs showed me that this field does not have the capacity of growth in jobs that I'd thought it has.

now before you reply with the usual stuff, I know that AI can't replace programmers and we will still need juniors, and the layoffs are do to interest rate and Companies will go back to hiring when interest rate drops.

but I don't think that self-taut developers like me will have a chance like before. I think that the bar for junior programmers will get higher and the field will require fewer juniors. and landing a job for a visually impaired self-taut developer like me will be extremely difficult.

1bd5lnk,CIS or CS?? Need advice,"So let me explain my situation. Also, I should say I’m 22 and no debt!

* I have a bachelors in Finance and have decided that the long hours for not that great of pay isn’t gonna work for me long term.
* After a while thinking about what I should do next I figured tech would be a good field to get into and therefore computer science would be the best degree.
* however I work a state job, which if I work full time would allow for the tuition for three classes a year to be covered. And if I do computer science I would probably have to work part time due to the rigorous nature of the degree
* the other degree ( computer information systems ) is less rigorous so I could do it part time and work full time ( so no debt being that tuition is covered ) but also of course less prestigious.

- the CIS degree seems to lean towards the IT field 

* it would take about two years for either choice to get the degree but one I would graduate with no debt
* pretty much is computer science and the debt worth the job prospect? because as with everyone else I’m worried about the oversaturated market. Keep in mind I’m not looking for a 6 figure job right out of college lol I’m cool with a regular 8-5 job that pays 50k then the ability to move up from there over time to eventually 80k or more.

I really want this internship especially because I don't think many FAANGs do internships in fall & spring. I just don't feel like there are enough hours in the day to do everything I have to & prep for OAs. My entire weekends are usually dedicated to me reviewing missed lectures, doing  assignments that piled up during the week & studying.

Hi, i’m a first year university comp sci student in Canada, and all is going well school wise. Although i’m in my first year and it won’t be another 3+ years till I graduate i’m feeling worried about if i’ll get a job in a reasonable time after graduating, if at all i guess.

I hear a lot of people saying “CS is saturated”, “you won’t get a job”, or like “if you can do CS you can do something else and have a better chance”. The thing is, I genuine like doing computer science, to the point I wouldn’t even be upset about leaving Canada for a job, even before the big covid boom when everyone decided to hop in I wanted to do it. I didn’t get in for the money (of course it’s important but it wasn’t the main motivator).

Hearing all those things makes me want to switch majors and probably just minor in comp sci, so I can do it on the side and have a better chance at a main job with a more sought after degree. Is this something I should really consider, considering the state of the job market? Will it improve by the time I graduate? 

I’ll gladly take any opinions on this, thanks so much

1b8tddk,I am afraid that AI might replace me as a developer? Arent you too?," I don't know where to start. I'm fresh out of university and have my CS Bachelor's degree in my pocket. I'm currently looking for a job and already have one.

However, when I look at the situation on the market, I get scared. The economy is not doing well, many companies are cutting jobs instead of hiring new (junior) staff.

And then there's the development of AI. Every few months you hear about a new milestone in AI development. Be it GPT, Gemini, Claude 3 or Sora.

These tools can write code for you without much prior knowledge, generate UI from images or concept drawings and so on. I've tested it myself in my job, it's scary.

In my company, I work as a full-stack developer and work on projects for clients. One wants an app that communicates with their machines, another wants a website to manage their internal processes and so on. Using GPT and co, I was able to create a functioning Rest API and JS UI within a few minutes. Work that normally takes half a day is done in minutes. Without errors in the code, without AI comprehension problems.

Nobody can tell me that this is NOT scary. Are we really so replaceable? Why are we digging our own grave and supporting such a development? With this degree, we can hardly reorient ourselves or continue our education if this development continues and everyone can become a developer using AI in the coming years and decades.

Why aren't we demonstrating against this? Aren't we taking to the streets like other professional groups have done in the past? Where is our protest?

And above all... Is this fear justified? With speed, it will replace us, won't it? What are we supposed to work as in the future?",2024-03-07 12:24:23

1bimhh7,Doing nothing as an intern (literally),"Hi everyone,
So about 1.5 months ago, i started interning part time at a software company. Its a shitty company (stingy and disrespectful ceo, terrible hr management the list goes on…)
And the way i got that internship was through a referral. Now the thing is, i haven’t been doing literally ANYTHING for the past 1.5 months there as half the time i went and there were problems setting up make a pc work for me (as the IT department there is too shorted barely 2 employees) and when i kinda got something to work on, literally no one was helping which i understand employees are doing their job its the trash management there that just didnt assign anyone to help me or mentor me. 
Anyways, im a college student and have one year and a half left to graduate and the reason im still at that internship is just to have something that would help my resume but i have a question if someone was in the same boat or knows more than me:

-I’m planning to not go to this internship ever again, as the hr doesnt seem to give a f*ck and i was never contacted when i didn’t go or when i came back to the office. So my plan is to never go and wait for them to fire me. Would i technically be allowed to put on my resume that i interned there from the start of my internship to its end (when i get fired)? 

Just as a final note, i know a lot of people are killing themselves to get an internship and was grateful for the opportunity, i just don’t see why i should stay there longer if its wasting my time that could be put into studying more for my college courses and at the end of the day i learn a lot on my own beside what im taught at uni, what i was being taught in this internship(when there was something to do) was stuff i already knew and learned. And at the end of the day, isnt the goal of this to put that i interned so future employers take it as a plus? Like i can lie and say i did this and did that at that internship as long if its stuff i know.
Would love to hear your thoughts and sorry if the post is all over the place.

CS: I heard that is not so much about programming and it's mostly about how computer works and mathematics. That's why I find it the least interesting for me, because I like a more hand on approach, but it has one advantage, it is versatile you can go a lot of different paths with this degree.  

Software engineer: That's the one I was thinking about starting, because is a lot more hands on and I like solving and coding stuff. I can't find something negative from my point of view, it also gives you a bit of versatility like working as web dev or mobile dev etc. Maybe it's more difficult to get other roles such as Management roles.  

Applied Ai: Like we all know right now AI is the buzzword, I find this field interesting and it seems like it's going to be the future. From what I read though most Position in AI require at least a master or phD. You also limit yourself only in one direction. That's why even though I find extremely interesting I am afraid of choosing this degree

I'm just taking 4 classes and actually doing nothing. No experience with side project or internship yet. Is it ok just keep doing like this for my goal? I haven't got any chance to get roadmap, but just heard some random short advises like ""You must do side project"", ""Practice algorithm problems"", ""Go career fair""..ect from random people. But I don't feel I can't handle all of those at once. I'm really confused!
Could anyone please let me know if I'm missing some thing that I should not? If I am, how to start them?",2024-03-30 08:07:20

**The Salary:** A few years ago everybody was saying to go anything related to software. Still software pays much more than Hardware but the entry-level saturation and competition in CS is another point.  


**The Peak:** Accelerators for AI/ML are very hot now. But it may not be the case in the future. Or there will be enough engineers for that so that pay will cripple.  


**Buzzwords:** As tech companies become trillion dollars worth. Any buzzword about tech gets highly praised. For instance Robotics. I first wanted to be specialized in Robotics but then so many people advised me to Not do it. As there is not enough demand for it.  


**Money shouldn't be the only factor:** It is very important but it shouldn't be the only factor.  


**Areas to Grow:** 20 years ago it wasn't the AI/ML as the most hyped one but now it is. What are you guys expectaitons.

If I am preparing for recruitment in the US, does it differ much between these two companies? The work at Tencent is quite aligned with my major in AIML and it's SDE title as well. I known for a fact that it's the largest Chinese company on the market, but I'm worried that no HR has heard of it in the US since WeChat and stuff are mostly focused on the Chinese market. 

On the other hand the front end work is rather chill, and it's US company based in SV, but I don't know if there will be as much of an impact on my resume as interning at Tencent.

Our professors have told us consistently these are meant to be very hard ""time intensive"" projects where we implement many different design patterns and flesh out our own libraries and clients, etc. I've done a lot of object oriented projects, RSA cryptosystem, projects dealing with playing audio files in a sequence etc...

Most of the class I know seems completely lost when it comes to the projects whereas I finish them in literally like 1 day since it's fun/solving a puzzle dopamine. 

The issue is that even though these projects the professor claims to be HARD... most of them when we donwload the zip files come with detailed instruction on what you need to do in each section.. so much so that you just need to follow the logic spelled out to implement whatever... they are very hand-holdy..

1bd69wz,Capital One Technology Development Program (TDP) Advice," 

Yesterday a recruiter for Capital One TDP reached out to me on LinkedIn saying that they had already concluded hiring for 2024 cohorts, but wanted to reach out regarding 2025 opportunities. She asked for my resume and to set up a call that I will have in 6 days. I am a class of 2025 (began college in 2022 but my graduation might be delayed to 2026 if I decide to do a coop from Newport News Shipbuilding) CS student who goes to a mediocre CS school. I have a good GPA, alright projects, and I will have one IT internship after this summer. Could anyone please give me any advice or knowledge on the TDP program, what the application process looks like, and how to prepare for it.

At Wayfair, I see a clear path to promotion, potentially reaching SWE 2 and a salary of around $170K within a year. I will be close to family and friends. I will also have minimal living expenses (rent is free - less than $1000 a month for everything else. I also get to WFH on Mondays and Fridays.

On the other side, SpaceX's role is in Washington, so I'd have to move there. I also have to be in person every day, sometimes even working Saturdays.

I haven’t received an offer yet, but I’m contemplating if it's worth considering, especially adding all the added benefits of staying with Wayfair (close to family, friends, and gf).

Given these factors, would reneging on Wayfair for SpaceX be a wise move if I get the offer? Any other advice on the situation?

All these languages are basically the same, just different syntax.  


But when I decide to work on a project, I have 0 idea how to do it.  
As long as the project is straightforward with very readily available resources, I read some documentation, use a few AI and my problems are solved. But I'm not learning anything from them documentations. I read telebot.py and didn't understand shit about how telegram bots work. I ended up using AI to make my project for me.  


I don't even know what to learn next, never mind about where to learn it from. I usually understand codes so well, but lately it's been failure after failure in learning something, I've stagnated, and IDK what to do anymore.  


I decided to do leetcode, but turns out I don't know those concepts well enough to solve the hard level problems. I don't even know where to learn those concepts from or what they are called.

Github doesn't have a discord community for me to ask these questions. Leetcode doesn't have a discord community to ask these questions.

My CS journey started off quite well, I learnt a bunch of languages, used modules to run data analysis on cryptocurrencies locally and performed cool data analysis, even did some jobs related to SQL data analysis.

But as I grow I feel like I'm missing out on so much.... I never used multiple files, I coded everything in a single file. I feel like I won't get anywhere the way I am now. I have not learnt anything new since last summer.

I am an international student studying CS in the UK. I will be graduating in 2025. I have some options but I am very confused. 

Option 1: 
Go for masters in the US and then find a job. 

Option 2: 
Stay in the UK, do masters and then find a job. 

Option 3:
Find a job and then do masters after an year or two. 

I don't have any work experience (including internships) but I have done volunteering in the past. 

What should I do? Is it too early to make a decision right now? What is the best option?

SDE @ Bank (mid-large company)

* Pros:
   * Intern program is very structured, with well-defined project & demo at end of summer
   * I'd be working on a backend system migration, so this experience would be more applicable to other SWE FT roles (even if I didn't get the return offer here)
   * FT conversion is common
   * I feel like this is the safer option
* Cons:
   * FT conversion is common, but intern pool is larger, so return offer might not be as guaranteed

AI/Data Science @ Tech Consulting (large-ish company)

* Pros:
   * Project not well-defined, no specific deliverables
   * I'm mainly there to gain experience working with the team and help with technical implementation (mix of AI/data science, software, reporting/analytics)
   * Return offer is more guaranteed, since the team is viewing the internship essentially as training for FT position, and they actively want to hire on interns
   * I feel like this is the more interesting (but riskier) option. AI is pretty cool (& I also majored in it), and I think consulting would be more interesting than purely focusing on development
* Cons:
   * I feel like the skills I'd gain here are more specialized, and the other role would be better if I wanted to look for general (and maybe higher paying) SWE FT roles after graduation",2024-03-21 18:28:58
1bk1j9m,Tips on catching up to school work + avoiding falling behind in the future ?,"Hi there. I'm in my fourth week of semester 1 year one of my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science.
I had ultimately fallen behind and I have made attempts to catch up. They were semi-sucessful because I nearly caught up, but my core understanding of the papers was subpar. At this point in time a lot of our assignments are due so I have to put what I know to practice.

The three papers being introduction to python programming, discrete maths, and this other one paper about bit conversion, hexadecimals, logic gates, and the programming language assembly

The thing is they move so damn fast I don't have enough time to go over and understand the content and get the necessary help I need because by the next week they will have moved on.

I can only hope that after these assignments are due, the gap between them and the next ones will allow for a proper catch-up WITH understanding but my grade will take a medium size hit if I can at least manage with 50% on these assignments. 

I also wanted to do some other programming courses in my free time but one thing I realised is with falling behind is that you have to forfeit everything else in uni life to catch up. I was planning on doing other coding courses and what not lmao.

Any tips for me?",2024-03-21 08:16:44

Context: During my undergraduate years, I learned DSA using C++. However, seniors suggest Python might be a better choice, especially for tackling Leetcode problems and navigating technical interviews due to its simplicity in expressing logic and code during interviews. While I agree on Python's ease of explanation, I believe C++ has its advantage in fast runtime, particularly when dealing with complex algorithms on platforms like Leetcode. 

So, should I stick with the familiarity of C++ or jump to Python for its potential interview advantages? Your insights and experiences would be immensely helpful in guiding my decision. Thanks in advance for your input!

Full stack development

Distributed systems


I can’t decide, I like webdev, but JavaScript causes me so much pain. I did .NET to avoid JavaScript as much as possible, but Visual Studio is a buggy mess if you try to use react/angular with it (no intellisense and constant crashing/invalid ssh cert) and also I’m selling my soul to Microsoft. Basically I like webdev but I can’t stand all these IDE and Framework stuff.

I also did a bit of research on networks and security and it seems something I would enjoy a lot more. I did some stuff with arduino’s in high school and it was fun too. 

I can’t decide, one opens up paths for cloud/devops/webdev while the other opens up cybersecurity/network engineer/embedded and firmware engineer.

1be2q5s,HP vs Accenture. Help!,"Hey guys, I have a dilemma in choosing where to Intern for the summer. 

I go to a state school on the east coast and I am currently a Junior standing. I currently have 2 offers, one with HP and one with Accenture.

I got the offer for Accenture last November, for the technology development program where I’ll be a summer analyst. It’s more consulting than coding, but I am really good at speaking to people, and I am curious about that field since I have family members who have done the same program and are living quite well. Naturally, I accepted the offer since I didn’t receive any others at that time. Accenture is paying 32/hr and it is based out of Los Angeles. I have family that lives nearby and have been to LA a couple of times. 

I just received an offer from HP this week (after one interview, I’m surprised) for a SWE internship for 28/hr and it will be in Vancouver, Washington. I am considering this offer since it will give me SWE experience, since I have yet to get an internship for SWE. I think the name is better for the SWE field as well. But, the pay and the location is something that is holding me back. 

Accenture PROs:
- Better pay
- Better location
- Very flexible/hybrid
- $2000 sign on bonus (will be using this towards rent though)

Accenture CONs:
- No relocation stipend
- Not SWE (not really a big con for me, but for this subreddit it seems like it’s SWE or nothing 😅)

HP PROs:
- Better name
- SWE
- $6500 sign on bonus/ relocation stipend 

HP CONs:
- Not a fan of the location
- Lesser pay
- If I accept, will have to renegade Accenture offer, that I received through applying on my university’s. Job board. 

What are your thoughts? I really need some guidance. My parents are saying stick with Accenture but my boyfriend thinks HP on my resume will get me far. Help!!!

(P.S. I know this is a good dilemma to have, considering the job market. I am grateful for both opportunities, and whoever’s still looking for internships, keep applying. It’s really never over until you say it is.)",2024-03-13 21:02:41

1bd89ro,"Securing a SWE Job at my current company/job, I have a meeting for the position.","I am currently working at this company I am at which is an e-commerce that sells products for their website. I work currently as a product content creator, however I've been on everyone's good side here at my job and I noticed they have a software developer team that works on the website.

Now I'm currently 24, and I'm graduating this semester with a BA in Computer Science from a 4 year Uni, the only difference between the BA and BS in CS is that the BA does not contain Calculus 1 and 2, nor any physics, as well as like 2 or 3 courses. Outside of that, they both are pretty much the same.

Pursing an internship or working on personal projects would be unrealistic as I work full time to help out my family. So what was my plan?  I requested to be internally transferred over to their SWE team as I am about to graduate. That way, I can get some real hands on experience which fills in that internship requirement, AND I also have an actual title of a SWE that helps me find a different job that pays more after I gain enough experience.

The CFO and their Team Lead set up a meeting with me tomorrow as they seem on board with transferring me. I have an idea of what to say, how I just want experience, but how should I go about this, given I have no actual experience outside of school work.

TL:DR I am asking at my current job to be internally transferred as a software developer, CFO has a meeting with me and is enthusiastic about having me work for them, I want to know how I can best leverage the situation to my advantage in my goal in getting experience to pursue a different high paying job in the future.",2024-03-12 20:53:51

1bcg8xq,No internship until graduation.. what would you do?,"
Hello, 

I am an international student with one year of undergrad left, currently taking a gap semester. 
Due to complications with international student regulations, I won’t be able to get work authorization until after spring 2025, which is my expected graduation date. 

I added CS a bit later in my program so don’t have any internship experience (was planning to do one this summer but can’t bc of the authorization issue) and I don’t have a great portfolio either. 

Because I won’t be able to work until summer 2025, this means I would have to find a full-time job after graduation without any internship experience. 

Is this even possible? 
What could my options be and what would you do in my situation? 

1. Stay in home country this fall and try to find an internship here to at least have on my resume. 

2. Go back to school this fall but add one more semester so that I can work in summer 2025 and fall 2025 and possibly get a return offer. 

3-1. Go back to school and graduate as planned and attempt to find a full-time job without any internship experience. 

3-2. Extend my graduation over the summer by taking a class in summer 2025 so that I at least have a few more months for job search. Anyone has experience with this route? 

4. Graduate as planned, do a summer internship, then start grad school in fall 2025.

And then I'm like ""Why the hell am I paying so much for this when he won't even put in the effort?"" ""What's the ultimate implication this will have in society?"".

1b9vrdt,help me decide between new grad offers,"I'm pretty torn deciding between 2 new grad SWE offers due to the location. here are the offer details:

Microsoft:

Redmond, WA

118.4k base + 25k bonus + 100k stock + relocation package

team: azure edge + platform

pros: it would be really cool to work from the headquarters, good career growth, easier to make connections/meet other coworkers, I like nature/hiking so Redmond would be a cool place

cons: really far away from my bf and family on the east coast, bf not really open to moving to redmond/seattle because he wants to work in NYC, possibility of layoffs

&#x200B;

Geico:

fully remote

120k base + 5k bonus

team: unknown but it's the TDP program

pros: fully remote so I could live wherever I want/have more flexibility, maybe a better wlb?, cheaper living expenses bc I would be living at home and not having to pay rent

cons: wouldn't have the same resume value as microsoft, won't form as many connections due to working remote, people on the geico subreddit scare me

any advice is appreciated :)

\*also if anyone has received a microsoft ng offer for redmond and had any luck with changing the location to remote or NYC, let me know.

NC state is close to home and in the research triangle, which would have its advantages.

However, I have also been admitted to Georgia Tech for CS, which I will likely pay out-of-state tuition for if I choose to attend.

I’ve been told by many people that Georgia Tech is still the better choice in CS due to its curriculum and reputation, which would be particularly helpful in this job market and I do believe, but I am not sure if those benefits outweigh going to NCSU for free. 

I’ve also heard that Georgia tech often provides scholarships to out of state students after they are admitted that make the school substantially more affordable. Is this true?

On the contrary, I’ve been told that the academic culture at tech can be very stressful and toxic and that being part of such a small scholarship program (~35 students) at NCSU can provide me with research and career opportunities that beat what the average GT student may receive.

1b4hzyk,Unveiling the Truth: Who's Selling Your Data to Train AI on Reddit," 

# 

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized how companies operate and innovate. However, behind the scenes of AI advancements lies a complex web of data collection and distribution. Particularly on social media platforms like Reddit, users' personal data is a valuable commodity, often traded to fuel AI algorithms.

Understanding the dynamics of data privacy on Reddit is crucial in today's digital landscape. As users engage with content and interact with others on the platform, their actions and preferences are meticulously recorded, eventually finding their way into the hands of companies looking to enhance their AI systems.

Being aware of who has access to and potentially sells this data is key to safeguarding one's online privacy. In this guide, we delve into the intricate world of data monetization on Reddit, shedding light on the entities involved in this process and empowering users to make informed decisions about their digital footprint.

## The Significance of Data Privacy on Reddit

In the digital age, concerns about data privacy have become increasingly crucial. With the vast amount of user-generated content on social platforms like Reddit, the protection of user data is of utmost importance. Reddit, as a popular social platform, serves as a focal point for data collection and AI training due to the wealth of information shared by its users.

### User Data Collection Practices on Reddit

Reddit engages in comprehensive data collection practices to enhance user experience and facilitate targeted advertising. The platform gathers user interactions, preferences, and behaviors to construct user profiles, which are utilized for personalized advertising and AI training purposes. By analyzing these data points, Reddit can tailor content and recommendations to individual users, optimizing engagement and revenue generation.

### Legal Aspects and Privacy Policies on Reddit

Reddit's privacy policies and terms of service govern how user data is handled within the platform. While Reddit claims to collect minimal information to improve user experience, questions remain about the transparency of data usage and sharing practices with third parties. Understanding Reddit's privacy policies is essential for users to make informed decisions about their data sharing and privacy on the platform.

For more information on Reddit's privacy policies and practices, you can refer to the [Reddit Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy). Additionally, engaging with online communities like [r/Privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/) and [r/dataprotection](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataprotection/) can provide valuable insights into ongoing discussions surrounding data protection and privacy concerns.

## Understanding AI Training with User Data

In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), user data plays a crucial role in enhancing the algorithms that power various applications. Companies like Reddit and third-party entities delve into the world of data selling to fuel the training of AI systems. By monetizing user data, these entities contribute to the evolution of AI technologies. One real-world example can be seen in Reddit's collaborations with AI companies, where user-generated content becomes a valuable asset for training algorithms.

### Data Selling Practices by Reddit and Third-Party Companies

Reddit, a popular social platform, has ventured into licensing deals with AI companies to provide access to its vast reservoir of user-generated content for training purposes. This exchange of data enables AI algorithms to learn from diverse user interactions, conversations, and content posted on the platform. Similarly, third-party companies specializing in AI training source data from various platforms, including Reddit, to improve the performance of AI models. The process involves anonymizing and aggregating user data to protect privacy while enhancing AI capabilities.

### Implications of Data Monetization for Reddit Users

The practice of selling user data for AI training raises concerns among Reddit users regarding their privacy and online experiences. When user data is leveraged for AI purposes, it opens avenues for targeted advertising based on users' preferences, behaviors, and interactions on the platform. This targeted approach can lead to a personalized but sometimes intrusive advertising experience for users. Moreover, the impact of data monetization extends to the overall user experience on Reddit, potentially influencing the content users see, the recommendations they receive, and the interactions they engage in within the platform.

By exploring how Reddit and third-party companies utilize user data to train AI algorithms, one can gain insights into the intricate relationship between data, AI advancements, and the ethical considerations surrounding data usage. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, the responsible handling of user data for training purposes becomes paramount in upholding user privacy and fostering transparency in data practices.

For more information on AI training with user data, you can refer to relevant articles like [Vendors Training AI With Customer Data Is an Enterprise Risk](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/vendors-training-ai-customer-data-enterprise-risk) and [Reddit has a new AI training deal to sell user content](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/17/24075670/reddit-ai-training-license-deal-user-content).

## Protecting Your Data on Reddit

With the increasing focus on data privacy, safeguarding your information on Reddit is crucial. By implementing the right practices and utilizing effective tools, you can enhance your data protection on the platform.

### Data Protection Best Practices

When it comes to securing your data on Reddit, following best practices is essential. Start by ensuring you have a strong and unique password for your Reddit account. Avoid using easily guessable passwords and consider using a password manager to keep your credentials secure.

Additionally, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account. By requiring a second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone, you can prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

Regularly reviewing the permissions granted to apps connected to your Reddit account is also crucial. Make it a habit to check which apps have access to your data and revoke permissions for any that are no longer needed or seem suspicious.

### Utilizing Tools for Data Privacy on Reddit

To further enhance your data protection on Reddit, consider leveraging various tools and resources that prioritize privacy. Privacy-focused browser extensions like Privacy Badger or uBlock Origin can help block trackers and enhance your online anonymity while browsing Reddit.

Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) can add an extra layer of security by encrypting your internet connection and masking your IP address, making it harder for others to track your online activities. Reddit users who prioritize data privacy may benefit from using encryption services like ProtonMail for secure communication.

By incorporating these tools and best practices into your Reddit usage, you can strengthen your data protection efforts and navigate the platform with increased peace of mind. Stay vigilant and proactive in safeguarding your data to maintain a secure online presence.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, understanding the intricacies of data privacy on Reddit is crucial in today's digital landscape. We have delved into the complexities of who may be selling your data for AI training purposes, shedding light on a concerning reality. It is imperative for Reddit users to remain informed and vigilant about how their personal information is being utilized in the realm of AI. By staying educated and proactive, we can navigate this ever-evolving landscape with more awareness and control over our data. Your privacy matters, so stay informed and empowered in the digital world.",2024-03-02 06:53:23

1) Could I ask the Tesla interviewer to see if I can defer the role for Fall 2024? If yes, at what stage should I say it? Should I email about this before the first interview? Do I tell them when I passed the first technical round? second technical round? third behavioral round? 

2) What is the general start date of Tesla Fall Co-op? For the company that gave me the offer, I had expressed an interest of starting early June and ending in the first week of September. Will this be a conflict with the start date for a Tesla Fall Coop? Essentially, if I am accepted for Fall co-op at Tesla, can request to start on the second week of September?

When i got my offer letter, it was sent from an automated cloud system to my email, which landed in the spam folder. I discovered it and downloaded the PDF of the offer letter from the mail. Also, after receiving it, i talked to the recruiter on phone and also in the primary email thread(where other conversation with the recruiter was going on), i responded that i accept the offer and joined the company. After a few months i discovered that i was being paid differently(less salary) than what was mentioned in my offer letter. I reported this to HR, but the HR told me that they have a different offer letter generated in their system. So they asked for the proof of the original email in which the offer letter was sent.

The problem is that the offer letter was sent in the spam folder, which gets deleted after 30 days in gmail. The HR has terminated my position and mentioned that i produced a fake offer letter and asking them to increase salary on that ground. Also, since there was no official ""offer letter signing"" done from both sides, i dont have any proof that i got the offer from their system.

Given that the software industry is rapidly evolving, will it still be worth it to grind leetcode rather than learn how to leverage/implement machine learning and artificial intelligence so I don't waste time studying leetcode and still get replaced by AI.

1btdc46,A Nightmare come true,"I used to frequent this sub for a while seeing all of the doomposts. I wanted to turn a blind eye as to how bad the job market currently is. 

For context, I am a undergrad (Junior) at a decent state university. Okay GPA, many projects and prior experience (2 internships). 

I had a lot of referrals and connections for SWE intern roles, and I managed to nail a few interviews with compliments from recruiters. I’m not trying to brag here. I am passionate about the industry, and I was juggling offers. 

I boiled down to two good positions. Both positions gave me phone calls/emails of verbal offers and congratulations. I accepted the first one while waiting for the second (second one took 6 weeks from start to finish). 

As I accepted the first one, they immediately rescinded it. They stated that they overhired and already filled the position. The recruiter was very apologetic but it crushed me that week. Today, I followed up on the second company for a written offer.

To my shock, “due to management changes” they closed the position and rescinded the verbal offer they gave 3 business days ago. 

I am now out of a summer opportunity and it’s too late to secure anything else.

I can’t believe this is real and it felt like a nightmare repeating itself for the last two weeks.

Not sure if not getting any offers is better than getting your hopes up twice just to be in the same position.

The thing is I’ve learned to code I’ve realized I don’t like it as much as I thought and even though I’m capable I dread it a lot. I go to a community college and as I’ve been taking my courses I’ve gained a deep interest in math and physics despite hating it in highschool. I have pretty good grades but I know in the field of research and academia it’s almost impossible to get a teaching position or work as a scientist for a livable wage. I want my life to be filled with learning and discovery and I feel like my background is hindering it. I don’t want to be poor anymore so there is a disconnect there as well. I’ve also considered becoming a doctor, but the way my life is set up as far as being able to focus I don’t even know if I should even bother. I have to study at Starbucks and my schools library which is a far commute by train everyday, so it makes it even harder. I guess what I’m looking for is some advice, thanks. ",2024-04-01 10:07:14

1btdpor,Is Georgia Tech CS worth the debt?,"

I’m a high-school senior who is about to graduate and I have been accepted to University of Tennessee Knoxville (~25k/year) as well as Georgia Tech (50k/year). 

I’m in-state for UT and the plan is to major in computer science or engineering—haven’t decided yet. Don’t get me wrong, Georgia Tech’s CS/CE program looks like it’s phenomenal. But does it justify 200k in debt? I’m not so sure about that. My parents have about 100k in a college fund. I don’t assume or believe they will pay the rest. I don’t qualify for aid, so I would be paying off 100k.

I didn’t earn an associates degree because I changed my degree to computer science on the third semester and my plan was to do cc for two years and then transfer. I attempted to transfer to my state school but they didn’t accept me because my grades were shit. This was then I decided to transfer to WGU. It has been 1.5 years (and two semesters at WGU) and I have not graduated from WGU yet but I probably will this year. However, now I am having my doubts.

1btes6x,"bombed an interview, would i be valid to contact the recruiter?","hi everyone,

recently had a pretty terrible interview experience. I talked with the recruiter slightly over 1 week ago and he told me the next step would be a zoom interview with the hiring manager. he told me that i should expect mainly behavioral questions on the interview. I, desperate for any hope at a summer internship, welcomed the news and awaited my zoom interview.

Today I just had the zoom interview and all I could say is that it was the exact opposite of what I was expecting. It wasn't necessarily being asked technical questions that bothered me; it was the type of questions I was being asked. I was being asked questions that were easily googlable and in my opinion did not assess my ability to perform the job. These questions were basically memorization questions about specific programming languages' syntax. Worst of all, it was humiliating to sit there and answer that ""I'm quite proficient with this language"" before being bombarded with very specific questions about features of the language and having to respond ""I'm not sure..."" 

Anyways after the interview I'm really considering reaching out to the recruiter and explaining what happened. Again, I'm not bothered about being asked technical questions (especially things that were on my resume) but to me these technical questions were doing too much given that I was told ""mostly behavioral"". I know people say that it's not a good idea to do anything that can influence the outcome before it's happened, but I'm honestly really unhappy about this whole experience. ",2024-04-01 20:31:24

I’m a little confused on what’s the purpose of having back to back ones.

I wasn’t looking for internships, but a company reached out to my university and I was recommended for it. Applied, got the job.

I don’t have an end date per se, just will finish up the internship when some projects are done. I now have a small IT company who really wants me to join their team. They’re a pretty small business but are growing super fast. They do a lot of different work, and they want to hire me on once this internship is done. 

I just want to know if a job like this is gonna be better (and look better) than an internship for future employers. IT is not exactly the route I am wanting to go, since I am getting a CS degree. But, I know that experience is experience, and not everyone gets handed opportunities like this. Should I continue looking for internships? Or should I get on this job and stay for a while? I’m going to stay in school and get my degree regardless. Will I have too much IT work on my resume that it will overshadow other CS experience? What do I need to do to make sure this doesn’t happen?

Also- will this job even look relevant? I mean, I’m still in school. I just don’t want it to look like a small helpdesk job. I want to show that I am climbing my way up the ladder. ",2024-04-01 16:46:22
1bt8k78,statistics vs machine learning summer research?,"I have to decide between 2 research programs for this summer (rising college sophomore), and idk which one to choose: 

1) research program at my school, it's very traditional statistics applied in economics, so it's a lot less related to cs. However, I'd get to stay on campus for the summer, which is something I really want to do, and I'm always 1000x more productive on campus than I am at home (in terms of doing/learning other things and skills over the summer)

2) research program, through a connection, in machine learning applied in chemistry. obviously the ""machine learning"" part sounds a lot better, but I'd feel a little strange doing this because I got the opportunity through a ""connection"". Plus, I'd stay at home for the summer, which is just a whole lot less fun, and I'll be less productive overall (in terms of doing other things I want to over the summer)

Any advice as to which program to take? I'm a lot more interested in machine learning, but realistically how difficult would it be to use the ""traditional statistics"" research experience to turn towards machine learning research later, like this upcoming fall?

1bt6hs9,should I add business or do a master's?,"Hi. I'm a student in a t10 CS program in America and I have 2 opportunities that I could do. Either I could apply to add business honors from my school's t5 business program or I could graduate with a master's in CS through an integrated program. Both opportunities would have me still graduating in 4 years. Like eventually I do hope to go from SWE to a PM which is why I'm considering the business degree, however I've also seen that some senior level positions do need a master's degree. I'm leaning towards the master's also because I know I can always go back to school for an MBA if I really need to as well. The master's would also let me add a business minor but the business honors program's resources are also really strong so they could help with getting jobs on wall street.

To this end, i’m seeking fellow software engineers who use any form of large language models, (whether that is running your own models locally, integrated tools like Github Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) to participate in an online call interview.

### What’s involved:

&#x200B;

* A 20 - 30 minute interview conducted via Zoom/Google-meet (or your preffered platform).
* Questions will center around your work. your use of ChatGPT or similiar technology, and your perspectives on their benefits and limitations.
* Your participation will be completely voluntary, and all information will be anonymized in my thesis.

### Who can participate:

&#x200B;

* Software engineers in its broadest definition including all subfields
* Open to individuals from all geographical locations and sectors

If you’re interested in participating or have any questions, please DM me or leave a comment below. I’ll provide you with more details and we can schedule a time that’s convenient for you.

Thank you for considering this opportunity, and i look forward to chatting with you",2024-03-27 13:26:46
1bou8l4,Microsoft Location Placement New Grad,"The offer letter states that the position is in Redmond WA but it doesn't explicitly tell me which team I will be on. In fact, they responded to my emails that I will not know about team placement until 1-2 weeks until my start date but then in another email they say that team could depend on start date. On top of that, it even says that you might not even be matched with a team until you start. So now I'm totally confused. Even in their offer letter, they say that location could change at any time.

I just really want to know for sure if I am moving to Redmond or not. I am currently in NYC and would love to be remote or at their NYC office and stay where I'm at, but I'm uncertain whether or not I will be moving. And because I don't know where I will be moving to, how can I decide my start date? They said I have 48 hours to choose the start date. How will I know if I have to break my current lease or not if I don't know the location? I'm about to graduate in less than 2 months and I'm feeling anxious not knowing these things. Any advice on how I can learn exactly which location I'll be in? I interviewed with mainly cloud people, but that is not a guarantee that I will join them. I keep emailing but they ignore my location question :(

Thank you for any advice or past experiences about this! I definitely feel very lucky to have my current offer and I am super super grateful. I'm just so anxious and confused about where the next step in my life will be.",2024-03-27 05:27:07
1boqvpt,Is asking about job salary range in the introductory call considered a red flag?,"I am a CS major in the US, currently applying for new grad positions. I stumbled upon a remote SWE opening at a small startup with a somewhat vague job description—it doesn't specify the tech stack, required skills, or years of experience. Their LinkedIn page lists Bangalore as their location, but the job posting states it as remote in California. Despite the ambiguity, I applied and the co-founder reached out to schedule an introductory call to discuss my experience.

However, I have concerns regarding the position's location and pay scale. Specifically, I'm unsure if the role is intended for the US or India, and I'm curious about the expected compensation. Would it be appropriate during the introductory call to inquire whether the compensation aligns with US or Indian pay scales? Or would raising this question be considered a red flag?

1boasfk,Thoughts on Dual Comp Degrees?,"I’m am currently a college junior majoring in cybersecurity and I am set to graduate in spring of 2025. 

My college offers a dual degree program that would let me get a bachelor’s in both cybersecurity and computer science and it would only take me an extra semester to complete it which would move my grad date to winter 2025. Would it be worth it? 

My scholarship will run out in spring of 2025 so the extra semester would be out of pocket (Approx. $7,000 for the extra semester). The main pro I can see is that it would help me stand out compared to others in the job market and it would give me an extra summer to get intern experience.

I’ve been told that my cybersecurity degree should be enough and that since the majors are so similar that it wouldn’t really do anything. Does anyone else with two degrees feel that it was worth it and would you do it again?",2024-03-26 15:33:24

I am one of those jobless cs kids graduating this May and I’m so close to losing my mind that I’m on this forum. For reference I have two mid internships, been a TA for 2 years, perfect gpa, shit school, Jake’s resume format and I’m considering jumping off a bridge because this field seems absolutely fucked 

My first internship was at a startup and in my first year of CS so I didn’t know anything or really contributed much. It was my first experience working on an Agile team and to be honest I got to be familiar with git and some basics of web development but nothing measurable. 

My second and most recent was at a F500’s IT division. For some fuck ass reason my team had been taking interns every summer and never giving return offers since they never had an opening. Anyways, I wasn’t really assigned a project of my own. I worked apart of the team completing various Jira tickets (32) on a wide variety of things between frontend adjustments to bugs to writing unit tests. I actually wrote a lot of unit tests and increased the test coverage by about 12%. 

That and the number of Jira tickets I completed is what’s on my resume and a short description of what tech stack the application used. 
“Used JUnit and Mockito to implement comprehensive test suites for multiple Spring Boot services that increased application test coverage by 12%”

Why did you choose CS over CIS? The money prospects? You prefer making programs and coding over the working WITH the software/hardware components?

Serious question. I am getting ready to expand course and degree offerings to hopefully increase enrollment but am wondering what students are after. 

Currently I have an intro to IT course, intro to networks. Intro to cybersecurity, ethical hacking, intro to cloud computing, intro to programming with Python and intro to databases

1bmqzyg,"Automation, PLC programming","I’ve been offered a role as an “automation technician” for a relatively small engineering company. Essentially a PLC programming/design role in which I would occasionally travel for commissioning. Would this be beneficial for pursuing careers in CS?  I think they mostly use ladder logic but they mentioned they would appreciate the skills I could bring to the team as a CS student.

I work full-time so I’m a part time student. I have a background of 8 years In distribution including leadership/supervisor roles for 6 years. I’m currently in a specialist/analyst role managing inventory replenishments. Being a part time student I still have ~3.5 years of schooling left. However I’ve been trying to find opportunities to better align my experience while I’m still in school.

I’m on the fence so what do you think? My pros/cons are pretty much just cons but if it helps my career in the long term that’s a big pro.

The job offer is about 10% less base pay than what I currently make and would be hourly opposed to my current role which is salary. They have quarterly bonuses (undisclosed amounts I imagine they’re pretty small). The working hours would be more & the commute is double my current commute. They said travel is 10%-30% and is all paid for by the company of course.

1bmmjgd,need genuine advice about cs and internships ,"hi all, 

So my situation is a bit different. I switched to CS in my sophomore year and as of now i am a junior still taking the first 2 courses of the major bc i had to repeat. The reason i had to repeat the 2 courses (one of them being discrete math) is because im a horrible test taker, i get anxious and then space out bc im pressured by the time. Projects I got all A’s on, labs, etc so i think im finally starting to get a grasp on the concepts, I just can’t do well on the exams which are obviously weighed more. 

I have been having serious doubts about my ability. I know i can do it but a part of me just can’t have the discipline to sit down and study for hours because i get anxious and just automatically assume I’ll fail the exams, stupid i know, but I just don’t know. Discrete math is kicking my ass, if anyone has any resources please let me know i would truly appreciate it. 

When it comes to studying for cs courses, how do you study to get a grasp on the concepts? How do you prepare for the written part of the exam where you have to write out code? Are there any websites, notes, etc that you use to help retain information? 


As far as it goes for internships, im not sure where i would begin and when I should begin to look for internships. Do I apply directly thru websites?

I have a few points of concern, although having been asked this question, I get a reply mostly that it doesn’t matter. I think y’all would be able to answer it better. 

• What is the **difference** between both the degrees and what’s being taught? 

• Does the B.Comp. Degree have a **potential disadvantage** over the other? maybe in terms of curriculum,  (what is taught), opportunities Etc or whatsoever. 

• Which one is harder? 

• Bachelors in Computing or Science , both are very different, one is science and other is not (While being a cs major) . what does this mean?

I‘d really appreciate if you help me out with this, I’m in a dilemma whether i should attend this uni or not and the course is also of 5 years.

1bkpzsz,"Has anyone had any experience with the company ""Virtual Internships""?","My university has partnered with a company called ""Virtual Internships"" that pretty much guarantees an 8 weeks internship. I've read that some people have had to pay for theirs but since my college decided to do business with them I won't have to pay. 

Anyway, my fear is from seeing people post about having internships and then not getting a job because the internship ended without followed employment. So basically they had an internship, didn't get hired with said company, and no nobody wants to hire them because their internship didn't go well I guess.

I'm afraid that since my internship will only last 8 weeks (no longer, no less), I'll be one of those people that won't find employment. The company that offers internships has lots of companies they place interns at for the specified period of time. I'm guessing those companies do it for free labor. Not sure. 

Anyway, my question is, have you had experience with this company? If so, please tell me your experience. Also, even if you haven't had experience with this company, do you believe that only being able to intern for 8 weeks will weaken my ability to get another internship or job offer?

1bkoumr,Internship Dilemma: Stick with a Sure Thing or Roll the Dice for SWE Dreams?,"Hey everyone,

So here's the deal. I'm a second-year Informatics undergrad at UW, dreaming of becoming a software engineer. Last year, I spread my nets wide – 150 applications – but sadly, not much came back, and I tanked the assessments I did get.

Last summer, I interned in an IT role with a government agency, not exactly SWE but related, and they're offering me to come back this summer. It pays about $25/hr, which isn't bad, but here's the catch: it's in Bremerton. That means I'm looking at either finding a short-term rental there (goodbye, decent portion of my income) or enduring a 3-4 hour commute each day from Seattle.

I initially said yes to the return offer a few weeks back, but as I'm about to set the dates, I'm getting cold feet. Bremerton isn't my top choice of a summer spot, and the financials of staying there are less than ideal. Plus, since it's a repeat internship, I'm not convinced it'll shine up my resume much more than it already has.

The upside? Stick with them till graduation, and it seems like a $100k full-time offer is almost guaranteed within two years. But here's where I'm stuck: it's not SWE, which is where I really want to be.

I tried to negotiate a better deal or remote work – no luck. And now, with March ticking away, finding another internship, particularly in software, feels like finding a needle in a haystack.

So, what's the move here? Take the safe, somewhat misaligned Bremerton gig for another summer, or decline and hope I can land something more in line with my SWE goals, despite the late hour?

Would love to hear from anyone who's been in a similar boat or just has some good advice.

I’m obviously really excited regardless of if it works out or not, but I’m also terrified because as most college students at my level would probably agree on, I don’t feel like I have the knowledge and skill set at this point to even be confident in myself or my abilities. But obviously learning how everything actually works day to day is what an internship is for, so I’m sure I will be fine.

But with only a few days to prepare for this, what should I expect as far as questions goes? It’s only 15 minutes so it can’t be that extensive, but I don’t feel like I could do well if they start quizzing me and stuff because honestly with no certs and only a couple of years of school, I don’t feel like I know even the basic fundamentals of what they might expect. Am I overreacting, or should I be seriously concerned and start studying up and getting myself knowledgeable enough to be considered as a serious candidate?

I'm in a very fortunate situation, where I received 2 offers from GE Healthcare and NSA. I love the work from both organizations and am excited about both opportunities, but I'm finding it challenging to make a decision, and I could really use some guidance from the community.

A little background about me: I'm a recent graduate with a degree in CS, and my main technology tools are associated with Python and Java. Both offers are for roles that align with my skills and interests, but I'm struggling to weigh the pros and cons of each opportunity.

Some pros and cons that come up for me at the moment are:

**GE HealthCare (Can start working immediately)**

Pros:

\- I don't have to move out of state

\- The technologies they use are similar to my stack

\- Talked with engineers there and this allowed me to learn a lot about team/company culture there, which I really like.

\- Meaningful work

&#x200B;

**NSA (CJO - have to apply for clearance, which might take more than half a year from now)**

Pros:

\- Meaningful work, however, I still have no idea what team I will be placed in

\- NSA has a long history of job stability and longevity

\-  NSA is a prestigious name on a resume.

I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could offer insights into these organizations. Thank you in advance for your assistance. The salary ranges offered are similar. At the moment, I'm leaning toward GE Healthcare",2024-03-20 16:11:00

1biz2s4,How to learn different technologies for summer internship?,"Hello, I am interning this summer and I asked my manager what technologies we will be using so I can hit the ground running and hopefully have actual impact. They replied with the following:

Java / C# [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) (backend)

Vue / React (front end)

SQL (database)

\*There are multiple languages per section as different teams use different technologies. 

I understand this question can be considered as repetitive but I was wondering what the best way would be to learn these as I am currently in tutorial hell.

1biwak7,How to view my own solution in a CodeSignal challenge I almost finished,"I ran out of time for Anthropic's CodeSignal challenge and I think I would've finished if I had 2 more minutes, which makes me feel dumb because I took 2 minutes off to get some food as well as used a slow computer with a bad trackpad because I didn't predict it would come down to a matter of seconds.

I am now trying to view the solution I submitted because I'm dying to know what the last little bug(s) were. 

However, the problem is now completely locked down, and even if I were to somehow circumvent it and view the problem, I wouldn't have access to the code I submitted.

Is there any way to view my original solution? I feel it is psychological cruelty for them to withhold this information. Might even be illegal considering it's ""user data"" am I right?",2024-03-19 21:44:52

I'm currently finishing my MS and will be starting my PhD this fall. I've been offered an opportunity to participate in the AFRL summer program at Eglin Air Force Base, and I am seeking insights from anyone who's been part of it, especially graduate students.

Could you share your experiences with the program? I'm particularly interested in the outcomes of your research—were you able to publish your work? Additionally, how did the experience benefit your academic or professional journey?

To provide some context, I've also been offered another summer fellowship with a Non-profit AI research institute in London, UK related to safe AI. Both opportunities align closely with my research interests but differ significantly in terms of the organization and location. I'm trying to gather perspectives to make a well-informed decision.

1bion9f,How does CodeSignal scoring work,"I just completed an Anthropic CodeSignal question with 90 minutes for 4 parts, 1 question. I ran out of time at part #4 and suspect I was extremely close to solving it, and would've debugged the last issue if I had 2 more minutes or had simply used a better computer and a real mouse (I was using my old chromebook with a trackpad, which lowered my editing speed and my chromebook even *lagged* on that website sometimes, which I didn't expect at all), or maybe just not gotten food in between (I was a little overconfident and did not expect stepping away for 2 minutes would make such a big difference).

My final score was 500. The completions said 100%, 100%, 100%, 75%. But I'm confused by people claiming you can easily get 800 if doing only parts 1, 2, and 4. Is that supposed to mean that if I'd debugged that final issue and gotten 100% completion my score would've been 800 instead of 500? That seems like a huge difference for such a small bug.

Also, if that's true, why is part 3 worth so much less than part 4? That would mean part 4 is worth at least 400 points alone despite requiring less time than part 3.",2024-03-19 16:36:51

It's tough out there, especially since many internships seem to favor college students.

They will be asking for transcript’s, and I will have 81/128 fulfilled for my degree (I am labeled as a Junior).

1bham4g,Opinions on different specializations of master degrees,"Hello,

I'm currently a student in my third year of university. I'm unable to decide whether if I should choose research, cybersecurity, or development track for my master.

I like learning (and thus research by extension), but I'm afraid that I would either not find a job, or end up burning out because I have such a high standard of myself. I like coding, and I'm afraid that I wouldn't code a lot in this track, or I that I would saturate my capacity for theoretical stuff.

I like the challenging aspect of security, yet my idea of it is still quite vague despite researching about what it is. I only kinda know the CTF part of it, and I don't like CTF. I would like to learn more profound techniques of reverse engineering, yet I have absolutely no experience in reverse engineering. I also am not sure about the employment opportunities of this track.

Development would be the safest choice, I'm quite good at writing code and I like it. Though would like to know if the other two fits better my vision of my future so that I'm not missing out. Besides, if I were to learn ethical hacking, learning to code on a bigger scale might help too? Maybe going with the development track and self learn cybersec stuff in the reverse engineering field is also a viable option ?

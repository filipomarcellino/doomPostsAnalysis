idhfuw,"I bring some hope! 39, female, self-taught- just got first dev job offer!","I'm a 39f from Scotland who began coding a couple of years ago very casually when I stumbled across 'digital nomadism' and I discovered here was a career I thought was long closed to me as a social science grad with an illness potted work history.  I used freeCodeCamp and got stuck a couple of times at the JavaScript stage.

I decided to really go for it Chrismas 2019. I started again from scratch, doing freeCodeCamp with extra Udemy to help with topics I was struggling with.  I started applying for jobs around April. I think I might have tried for around 100+ junior or apprentice positions in front-end and software engineering, getting about 5 different interviews and being offered the post of junior software engineer today after a 5 stage interview/testing process. My job includes a free 12 week bootcamp online with Makers Academy from London that I'd never be able to afford myself.

If I can offer any advice to others, I'd say: 

1)Have at least 3 personal projects. I had a virtual pet, a responsive website and an API using page.  No great shakes but they were all mine and taught me a lot about problem solving that I talked about in my interviews.

2) Don't be ashamed about your current work, even if it's nothing to do with development.  I was able to talk about the teamwork of my current job in social care. 

3)Try and be geographically flexible. I'm having to move about 300 miles away as there wasn't anything like it locally. 

4)Use LinkedIn and Twitter to network- I've had tons of encouragement from my new Twitter amigos. 

5)If you don't apply, you'll never get the job. Even a highly unlikely job that you apply to gives you a chance of success, however small.

&#x200B;

I hope this might bring some confidence to fellow self-taught coders looking to break into the industry.",2020-08-20 19:49:47

TLDR: Made an anonymous salary sharing website with a focus on UK/EU.

It's been around a week since launch, and I've added a lot of the features you guys requested (still a lot more on the backlog)! A quick summary:

* Added a dropdown menu to show more details such as RSU breakdown and perks
* Added company logos
* Added support for multi-currency, € will show up as € instead of being auto-converted to £
* Added hovering elements, e.g. when you hover over intern TC it now shows as pro-rated

Your insights are valuable to the mission! Please check out the website ([compclarity.com](https://compclarity.com)) and let me know of any more features you would like. We're currently lacking mid/senior data points so I encourage anyone reading this to share some!",2024-03-04 11:07:11
laz3hv,"More than 1000 applications, 57+ interviews, one FAANG offer!","Here's my experience with Technical Interviews in the past 6 months.

## **The grind -**

I was doing an internship with Intel, Ireland and it was about to complete in December 2020. I already had a good understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA) but I was out of daily practice. I started the daily grind on LeetCode(LC) in early July.

With an everyday job in mind, I never really got to do a lot. 2 problems/day with a quick revision of each associated DSA topic from GeeksForGeeks. (Maxing out to 5 problems/day over the weekends)

By September 15th, I had a good practice on BFS, DFS, Backtracking, Trees, Graphs, Hashmaps, Strings, Stacks, and Queues. I took one more week to get good hands-on over basic Dynamic Programming problems and some advanced data structures like Tries.

## **Interviewing phase -**

I started my interview season by bombing the first interview with ByteDance. (Well, to be honest, it was until date one of the toughest code-pair rounds I have been through). I knew I had to improve so I started practicing random problems just to be in sync with my understanding of DSA.

*[I appeared for many interviews but I would like to share my experiences with a few big ones here]*

After a few initial interviews at firms like Amazon, Microsoft, Workday, LinkedIn; I realized that I was doing good at code pair interviews. So I pivoted my focus from DSA to core Software Engineering. Alongside being in sync with DSA, I started learning more about Backend engineering, System Design, Database design, Distributed Systems, and Networking.

I had the next rounds of interviews scheduled for all the aforementioned companies in mid-October.

**LinkedIn**:= Couldn’t clear their second interview round.

**Microsoft**:= Cleared their 45 minutes of interview round but the process got delayed because of Covid. (Heard back from the HR before a week for scheduling the next round)

**Amazon**:= Cleared their 3-hour interview rounds(LP’s + HR + Coding) and they had a final round scheduled for next week. I cleared the final round as well and I received an email from Amazon HR that I have been selected for the role. After 20 days, I received another email saying they have canceled the role right now because of Covid.

**Workday**:= It took them almost a month to get back to me. And they said I have cleared their interview process. We had a salary discussion round and I said I’m happy with what they are offering. In mid-November, HR contacted back saying that they found somebody else with more years of experience and they will be retracting my offer.

**Apple**:=

I had applied in mid-August and I received an email to schedule the initial phone screen in the month of November. I was already halfway through my preparation with 2 retracted offers.

After the initial call, I had a coding test on Hackerrank for 90 minutes.
 3 questions all of which were variations of standard LC style questions. [2 medium, 1 easy]. I passed all the test-cases and was waiting for my next round.

The next rounds at Apple were all phone screens.

**1st Round => (120 minutes)**

* Data Structures and Algorithms — Analyze time complexities for different stub codes, whiteboard algorithms for 0/1 knapsack and fractional knapsack, explain tail-recursive call in depth.

* Lots of C++(runtime polymorphism[vtable and vptr in-depth], volatile, threading, STL implementations [list vs vector, unordered_maps vs maps], garbage collection, move semantics, unique_ptr, pointers, references)

* Operating Systems(virtual memory, segmentation, page faults, caching[L1 vs L2 vs L3], memory management algorithms)

* Web development & JS(Async calls, what is hoisting in regards to JS keywords, alternatives to REST API’s, couple of questions on NodeJS event loop internals, what is event-driven architecture, sessions vs cookies vs JWT in regards to security, basic cipher questions)

**2nd Round => (120 minutes)**

* Walkthrough on the CV and my experience. Questions about my speaking engagements at different PyCon’s(Python Conferences globally)

* Lots of Python interview questions. A few questions tailored to my understanding of Python features and their internal implementations like (GIL, Asyncio, Multithreading, Subinterpreters). [PS — I had done a lot of research on core C code that powers Python which helped me get through these questions]

* Brief System design question — Design a rate limiter. [The interview wasn’t interested in knowing much in-depth. He had given me a situation and I had to fabricate the rate limiter according to conditions.]

* Many questions on Pub-sub architectures, Microservices, Kafka & Redis caching because I had an experience working with them.

* Few questions on Load balancers & Reverse proxies. Also continuing discussion on Nginx and Varnish.

* HTTP 2 vs HTTP 1.1 and major changes.

* Two brief questions on testing my design patterns knowledge. (On what design patterns are chat applications like WhatsApp and Telegram based. Explain factory vs abstract factory design pattern in regards to the real-world applications?)

**3rd Round => (45 minutes)**

* Why Apple

* Mainly behavioral round with standard STAR technique questions.

I received a call from a recruiter on 18th December 2020 that I have been selected for the role but the offer letter will take time because of Christmas. Looking at the way companies have retracted offers in the past, I wasn’t too excited until 7th January 2021 when my recruiter called me again and said **“Welcome to Apple!**”.

   * [Company engineering blogs](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview)
   * Head First design patterns book

**Final thoughts**

 1. Interviews are not just about LeetCode and Data Structures. They test your core Software Engineering skills. Learn about them instead of just focusing on LC grinding.

 2. Give yourself 6 months and you will sail through the SE interviews at most of the companies. (The interview system is completely broken!)

 3. Don’t prepare for company-specific questions or mugging up solutions to the questions. You will fail most of your interviews by doing that.

 4. Selection email for a role/offer letter is not equal to **job confirmation** [I have had terrible experiences in the last few months]

 5. Relax, go out for a walk, cook something, take a break for a day or two. Divert your mind for some time. You need hours out of work to concentrate well on your work.

 6. Be confident and most important be yourself. Express what you know and **say a no to that you don’t.**

11ek3kp,My experience working in Germany,"Hey peeps, I saw a couple of posts here before about moving to Europe, I thought I’d share my experience living and working in Germany as an American.

Here’s a quick timeline, then I’ll dive into the details:

September 2018 - Decided to move to Germany, started applying for jobs there

October, November 2018 - Interview, accepted an offer

February 2019 - Flight to Germany

March 2019 - First day of work

February 2023 - Last day at the same company


#Background
I graduated with a CS degree in 2016, then joined a mid size startup in Atlanta doing mostly backend and data stuff with Java. So in total, including internships and stuff, I have about 3 YEO before the move.

Salary progression in the US (USD):

* Software Engineer

* 65k + 5k sign on

* ~68k after about 6 months

* ~73k year after that


# Reason for move
Prior to this, I did not have much context of Germany besides their soccer team, and WW2, never even thought of working outside the States. Then out of the blue my GF got offered a phd position in Germany, so we decided to head over together. In short, the reason was love.

#Job search & interview
LinkedIn was the only place I looked at for job postings. I spent a bit of time curating my resume and cover letter to match each of the jobs I applied to, so in total I probably applied to less than 10 jobs, no more than 5 even.

My response rate was terrible, only 1 replied to me, but fortunately, it’s the one I really wanted. Went through the interview process, and ultimately received an offer. At this point, I didn’t have any other interviews lined up, and am already quite happy with what I’m hearing about this company, so I accepted the offer.

Interview process:

* Initial phone screen with HR

* Take home assignment (build a bowling game API)

* Technical interview, mainly discussing the app I built

* Interview with head of engineering

The whole process took about 2 months.

Offer (EURO):

* Jr. Backend Engineer

* Munich

* Unlimited contract with 6 months probation period

* ~54k

* 4k relocation

* 2.5k housing stipend

As you can see it’s not a great offer, but not bad either. Not very thrilled with the down level, but I didn’t have much experience with their tech stack (Ruby on Rails), so it’s whatever. They also wouldn’t negotiate, so I just accepted as is. At this point it’s about early December 2018, and now that I’ve got a job, I can just move over to Germany with my GF since her start date is around April 2019.

#Visa process
I made an appointment with the German embassy, there’s one located in Atlanta, so I didn’t have to travel far. Prepped my documents to apply for an EU Bluecard.

Roughly this is what I remember I needed:

* Application

* Employment contract

* Copy of diploma

* Copy of passport

* Proof of health insurance

* Flight details

* Housing details (hotel or airbnb is fine)

To my surprise, they issued me a temporary work visa that expires in 6 months. I had to schedule another appointment when I arrived in Munich to get approved for the actual Bluecard. The second appointment was pretty easy, just had to show up, and since all my required documents are already on file, they just approved it right away.

I highly recommend you to be diligent on this part, and schedule your appointment as early as possible because they’re super busy at the foreigner’s office. Available slots most likely will be months away, I’m talking about > 3 months wait, probably more so with the influx of refugees lately. Not a big deal tho, your visa automatically extends to the date of your appointment I believe.

To obtain a Bluecard, your salary need to be past a certain amount, in 2019 it’s ~52k euro or so, and your job must be in demand in Germany. Also your degree, and institution must be recognized by German authorities, and should match your job field. For example, it wouldn’t work if you have an English degree and received a SWE job. You can still get a work permit, but not a Bluecard. Similarly if you have a tech/cs degree from some unrecognized institution like U[sic]GA or something, you’ll need to get another approval for your degree.

#Move
The actual move was quite rocky with the missed transfers, and lost luggages. Between the 2 of us we brought 5 luggages worth of stuff over, in hindsight that might be little too much. Worked out in the end tho since they found our luggages and delivered them directly to our hotel a day after we settled, we didn’t have to lug them around. We did not ship anything over.

#Housing
First 2 months here in Munich, I stayed at 2 different Airbnbs. With the help of the relocation service, I was able to find a more permanent place within those 2 months, and moved in there after on month 3. I stayed there for 3 years before moving in with my GF. The 2.5k stipend paid for the first 3 moths which was nice.

The rent for the apartment is 975 euros, that includes AC, electricity, heating, internet, and furnitures. It’s very small tho, about 25 square meters, that’s about 260 square ft. Flexible rental contract, I can extend it every 3 - 6 months. In the 3 years I stayed, they never increased my rent. It was also in a great location, right by the Isar river, and down the street from the Munich zoo, bakery, grocery store, and the U-bahn station.

Most landlords will ask for 2-3 months rent as deposit, this one only asked for 1 month, and I had no troubles getting it all back. All in all, I think this apartment was quite a gem.

If you have the budget I would highly recommend looking into relocation services, the one I had costed me about 3k euro. Their services include:

* Help with your settlement (address registration, opening bank accounts etc)

* 6 apartment viewing with a rep

So the rep accompanied me through the address registration process, opening bank account, apartment viewings, and rental contract help. That’s really all I needed, if you have kids they also offer help with school stuff. To me the 3k was worth it, and it’s covered by the relocation stipend. The remaining 1k I used to to pay for my flight and transportation cost.

#Work
I joined the company at a great time, they just received substantial funding, so the company’s in high spirits. We also got a boost during the COVID times with the uptick on digital fitness trends. It wasn’t until this past year we started having financial issues.

We use agile and has cross functional teams. I was assigned to a product team that focuses on the core training experience. Worked out perfectly because that’s what I’m most interested in. Other teams’ setup are pretty much the same, but they focus on other topics like monetization, onboarding, marketing etc which isn’t my cup of tea. A full team consists of:

* Product manager

* Engineering manager

* Designer

* Scrum master

* 1-2 AND dev

* 1-2 iOS dev

* 1-2 Backend

Typical startup mentality, lots of different initiatives, fast paced, abandoned projects etc. Most recently we tried to venture into the fitness equipment tech space, and ultimately ran out of funding. The whole product had to be abandoned a month after release, and 30% of people had to be let go, I was part of that 30%. That’s OK tho since I planned on quitting the same month anyways and move out of Germany. Now I’m enjoying my 4 months paid time off haha.

My salary progression at this company (EURO):

* 2019 - 54k

* 2020 - 64k (Promotion intermediate backend)

* 2021 - 72k (Promotion senior backend)

* 2022 - 76k

* 2023 - Laid off

I did get equities but not sure if it’s worth anything at this point. We get 28 days of paid vacation, unlimited sick days, plus Bavaria has a bunch of holidays.

For the most part it’s just API development on RoR, a little bit of web dev react stuff here and there. Truly enjoyed my time here, even tho it’s fast paced, I never worked overtime, except for that one time when we were dos’ed, that was an interesting week.

Company is pretty international, so main working language is English. That should be the case for most tech companies in Germany, especially the ones in big cities.

#Life
I mentioned earlier that this company is the one I really wanted to join for 2 reasons:

1. They’re in the fitness business

2. They have an onsite gym

The gym part is quite important because it’s a place I feel comfortable. I figured if I get culture shock or homesick or something, I can hole up at the gym and de-stress. And that’s basically what I did after work everyday, sometimes even both before and after work (especially during the initial covid time). I’m quite introverted, so never really explored the nightlife in Munich, and every other week I would train for 4 hours to my GF’s place.

Spring and Fall were the best times in Munich, summer gets too hot, and winter can be depressing if you’re not careful. Best part about Munich tho is how centrally it’s located, I can travel to a lot of places with just the train already. Too bad COVID really put a damper on our travel plans, but we’re still able to hit some of the major European destinations, and a bunch cities in Germany.

In early 2021, I switched to be fully remote, and moved in with my GF. Her university is in a much smaller town in east Germany, Jena. While the rent is much cheaper, it’s a little inconvenient to travel here. If we want to train to a major city, we’d need to first take a 30 minutes train to a nearby bigger station and transfer from there. Worse if we want to fly, closest major international airport is Frankfurt, and that’s about 3.5 hours away. If we have an early flight then we’d need to stay overnight at Frankfurt, which adds to our travel cost. Another down side to living here is that racism is more prevalent. It was a pretty big difference compared to Munich. We’re both South East Asian descent, and came from a small southern town in Georgia, don’t remember ever being treated differently in the US. Maybe it’s the recent rise in Asian hate, but it is what it is, we just shrug it off as long as it doesn’t escalate to violence.

What I love most about Munich is how safe it is. I feel safe walking by myself on an empty dark street. Public transportation is also probably the best amongst German cities. Biking infrastructure is also abundant, tho I don’t quite like that the bike lanes are shared with the pedestrian side walks. As compared to Atlanta, where certain places are a no go at night alone, Marta routes barely covers anything, and barely any bike lanes.

#Cost of living & quality of life
To summarize real quick, cost of living is pretty equal between Munich and Atlanta, Munich might be a little more expensive because of rent.

Quality of life I feel Atlanta > Munich for me, mainly because of family, friends, and food. As a healthy young adult without a family, I won’t factor in childcare cost, and medical cost. I think it will heavily favor Munich if you have a family (maybe?), and especially if you have any medical conditions.

I didn’t see a difference in work life balance, on both companies I am able to nicely balance between them, no crazy work hours, no terrible manager, no toxic work environment.

One major difference is your net pay, I think there’s about a 10% - 15% difference here in your net salary. For example, if I gross 6k each month, in Germany I would net 3.6k, and in US, I would net 4.2k or so. Not to mention that US SWE salaries are way higher than Germany’s. If you want to stick with non manga and non unicorn startups, 90k is pretty hard to come by. When you factor in the usd and euro conversion rate, my income has steadily declined over the years despite my pay raises.

#Taxes & Retirement
If you don’t know, Americans are still obligated to pay their taxes even if they don’t live in the US, and you have to file your taxes each year. Most likely tho, there’s tax agreements between the different countries so that you wouldn’t be double taxed. That is the case for Germany.

In Germany taxes are taken out of your paycheck each month, that includes your income taxes, social security, health care, and unemployment. I guess it’s the same also for US salaried workers. If you’re single and don’t have other income, you probably don’t have to file your taxes for Germany, but if you change your mind, you can still retroactively file up to 4 years of taxes.

For US taxes, you usually have 2 options to reduce your tax obligations:

1. Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, form 2555

2. Foreign Tax Credit, form 1116

For the first option, it is exactly as it sounds, foreign income is excluded as your income in the eyes of the US federal and state government. The exclusion amount is quite large, 100 something thousand. One downside to this is that I can’t contribute to my IRA

I think the second option is the way to go if your country of residence has higher tax rate than US, which is the case for Germany. And since you have income in the eyes for US government, you can also contribute to your IRA. Additionally, any unused credit can be applied to future tax years.

I was never able to figure out option 2 because of the state taxes. I still maintain an address in Georgia, not sure if I still have obligations to file for Georgia state taxes, but I file it anyways each year just in case. Every time I try to do FTC on TurboTax and filing for state tax, I always owe a lot. 

Regardless of the tax and income differences, I’m still able to contribute about 10k - 15k in my investments and savings each year. That’s about the same as I was doing back in Atlanta.

#Conclusion
Working in Germany has been fun despite some major cons. It has opened my eyes to different cultures and different ways of living, but I’m ready to move on.

lncht4,Best tech companies in Berlin - 2021,"I hope I can help some people with this list somehow. Berlin is getting more and more attractive for techies looking for a relocation because of the low cost of living but also because the tech scene is booming for the past 10 years. So I wanted to have an overview of which companies are here in Berlin or hiring here at least. It's a bit opinionated of course but if you want to add some companies just write a comment. Probably have not listed all of them.

I have broken down the list into different tiers from what I find in their technical excellence + total compensation with a focus on the latter. I am now working in Berlin since 2017 so I have some overview I hope.

irbm2j,Got a ridiculous Full stack code challenge to be done in two days from a Dutch company (I said Nope),"What's up with software companies these days who think the only purpose a candidate have in their life is to spend weekends (and also weekdays after work hours) building a so called code challenges (a.k.a a full project with unpaid labour and possible idea theft)  ONLY FOR THEM. As if the candidates don't have any other company to interview/prepare for.

So, I got this ridiculous and unrealistic code challenge from a Dutch company who asked me to build both front end and backend in just two days (strictly timed). They even mentioned and asked two full days of weekend  to be given and strictly mentioned ""any commits made after Sunday night would be ignored"".

To tell you how ridiculous this has got I have an excerpt of my code challenge which mentions their unrealistic expectations in **2 days** (even if more time was given it is still a project size code for a process which was supposed to be an interview).  Also, I got this code challenge after 2 round of interview, and had I completed the code and assuming they would have liked it then it was supposed to be followed by more tech interviews and that too for a startup with average salary in NL.

Here it is:

    Bike share city finder
    
    We ask you to create a bike share city finder application. 
    We would like you to help us find bike sharing platforms around the globe.
    We found a great public API that is called citybik.es, which 
    you can query following the documentation: http://api.citybik.es/v2/
    For a working example you can take a look here: https://citybik.es/
    But we can do this a bit better with some more relevant information.
    We would like to know if we need to be prepared for any rain.
    We have chosen the following weather API to be used, OpenWeather where 
    you can subscribe to the free Hourly Forecast 4 day API: https://openweathermap.org/api
    In the attachments you will find the two specified screens that 
    we would like you to build. 
    
    You are going to build the following pages:
    - Intelligent search input box showing suggestions of the queryable names.
    This page will show the user a loader until the data is ready, 
    whereafter a page is shown with a search box, a 4 day hourly 
    forecast and the map.
    The weather forecast should:
      1) Show the forecast for the coming 4 days
      2) Every day it should show the average temperature for:
          a)  Morning (6am – 12am)
          b) Afternoon (1pm – 6pm)
          c)  Evening (7pm – 12pm)
          d) Night (1am – 5am)
      3) Show a relevant icon based on the weather forecast, 
         in the design these are represented by grey circles.
    
    -The map should:
        1) Show all stations for that city of all vendors
        2) Show indicators:
            a)  Green = bikes available
            b) Red = no bikes available
        3) Show the relevant station information being:
            a)  the station name (hint: check the naming format)
            b) when the last update was published, represented in human-readable format, 
           for example: 30 minutes ago/ 2 hours ago/ 3 days ago.
            c)  number of bikes available
            d) the total number of bikes available
    
    To scope the project we would like to have all queries of the 3rd party API’s 
    handled within a middleware. All data mutations should happen in this 
    middleware. The front end application should only consume the data. The 
    middleware should be written in Node.js and should make use of serverless 
    express.
    The front end should be built with React, TypeScript and may make use of a 
    component library like Material-UI. A small note all icons used in the designs 
    are from the Material-UI library. We expect to see reusable components and code 
    that is scalable and maintainable. Lastly we would like to see two unit tests. 
    You would get exactly two days. Any commits after that will be ignored.

Guys, beware of such challenges and no matter how much you spend time on the code they can easily reject your application and you would never know how favourably and unbiased the reviewer was. Instead we should invest time in companies who have reasonable interview process designed for humans and has a realistic timeframe in mind.",2020-09-12 12:22:00

## 1. How difficult is it to find a job as a Software Developer in Germany?

This is a very common question!

Germany is one of the best countries in Europe to work in as a Software Engineer.

The salaries might not be as high as in the neighboring [Switzerland](https://swissdevjobs.ch/?utm_source=gtj_blog&utm_medium=gtj_blog&utm_campaign=gtj_blog), but still higher than in most other EU countries, and you get a **high standard of living** with quality public services: education, healthcare and transportation.

The country has a vibrant tech job market with **over 30.000 tech job openings** and startup hubs like: Berlin, Hamburg or Munich.

At the same time, there are over 800.000 Software Engineers in Germany, so the competition is stiff. The following factors might work in your favor or against you:

## 1. Work experience and technologies

\- while getting a job in Germany is not easy, it is even harder as a Junior Software Engineer, especially if you are a foreigner. Most of the companies are looking for Developers with 2+ years of experience.

Having said that, it is possible to find a job even as a Junior, but you should be rather looking at internship or trainee offers (Praktikum in German).

**Do you need a degree?**

I wouldn't say you need it, but yes - without any work experience it will be your main bargaining chip. If you are experienced though (2+ years), then most companies will turn a blind eye to the lack of a degree.

The 2nd part is the technology that you specialize in. If you search through openings on [GermanTechJobs](https://germantechjobs.de/?utm_source=gtj_blog&utm_medium=gtj_blog&utm_campaign=gtj_blog) you can see that there are many offers for Java, JavaScript, and Mobile Developers but not as many for Ruby, C# .NET or C++.

## 2. Being German or EU / EEA citizen

\- if you are a citizen of one of the EU / EEA (European Economic Area) countries it will be pretty easy for you to migrate to Germany - it is a matter of filling the papers after you get the job.

When you find the job and move to Germany, after arrival you just have to visit the Residence Registration Office (Einwohnermeldeamt) or Immigration Office (Ausländerbehörde) and get registered.

That's why most of the time German companies prefer EU / EEA citizens when searching for new employees.

## 3. For people from other countries

\- there are 2 administrative categories:

a) If you are a citizen of the **USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Korea or Israel,** you can move to Germany to find a job, and after that apply for a residence permit from the Ausländerbehörde.

b) If you come from any other country, for example: **India, Brazil, Ukraine,** etc. - then you have to either get a Job-Seeker Visa or find an employee that helps you with a work visa. For more details please refer to the [official government website.](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa/kinds-of-visa/jobseekers)

## 4. Language skills

\- the only official language in Germany is, well… German :)

Speaking German fluently is definitely an advantage and many companies simply require it. However, you can still pretty easily find a job with English only, especially in startups or in big corporations.

Nevertheless, if you have the time and possibility - **start learning German**. Even if you speak it on a basic level (A2 / B1), it will vastly increase your chances on the job market.

📷

## 2. Step-by-step process for finding a job as an EU citizen:

## Step 1. Apply to companies while staying in your country:

It has 2 big advantages: first, you don’t have to bear the high costs of living in Germany and second, you can focus on the important things - interviews.

In this step, you need to find the job offers. For that, you can use [**GermanTechJobs.de**](https://germantechjobs.de/?utm_source=gtj_blog&utm_medium=gtj_blog&utm_campaign=gtj_blog) or any other job board. Alternatively, you might want to get in touch with a headhunter to help you.

We recommend that you apply to as many **job openings as possible (even 100+)**, because it is not easy to actually get an interview, especially with less than 5 years of experience.

If you want to get informed about new job postings in real time and apply as one of the first candidates, check our [**Job Alert.**](https://germantechjobs.de/subscribe-newsletter?utm_source=gtj_blog&utm_medium=gtj_blog&utm_campaign=gtj_blog)

It is good to mention in your CV and motivation letter that you are **committed to moving to Germany** (if you have a family there, bring it up too!). This makes the companies see you as a safe bet and not someone that might run away after a few months.

From our experiences, it is really worth to work with headhunters if you are on Junior level (0-2 years of experience) because German companies tend to be quite reluctant to hire graduate developers from abroad.

A headhunter might easily help you to get some interviews. You have to be cautious though - headhunters often work only with specific companies, and sometimes will not present you the whole picture (you will not have access to the entire job market). If you are working with a proven professional, you should be fine.

## Step 2. Job interviews:

Normally the job interview process consists of 2 - 4 steps.

It starts with an **introduction call or/and a coding task** where you will be asked some basic technical questions.

As the 2nd step, if you are not located in Germany, there might be a **video call with live coding.**

The last round will be an **onsite interview** where you visit the company's office in Germany.

The practice of reimbursing travel and accommodation costs is not widely spread, though some companies may offer it, especially the big ones. Therefore, it’s best to try to schedule a couple of onsite interviews on subsequent days, so you won't have to fly back and forth.

After the last interview, you should get a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer in the following days, max. 2 weeks.

If you have multiple offers, you might want to negotiate with the companies. Be careful though! **Do not give the impression that you only care about the money**, because it's still a taboo topic in Germany.

## Step 3. Moving to Germany:

Congratulations - you have found your dream job in Germany! After the hard part, there are only formalities left. :)

After signing the contract, you need to prepare to move. If the company doesn’t offer any relocation package / assistance, you have to save about **2.000-4.000 EUR** for this purpose.

When you arrive to Germany and want to find a place to live, there are 2 options:

**1) Rent a flat or house** \- this is probably your choice if you are relocating together with your family.

**2) Rent only a single room** \- it might be a good option if you plan to arrive alone (in Germany it’s called a Wohngemeinschaft - living together with other random people or friends).

Finding an apartment in some parts of Germany (especially in Berlin) is quite challenging! You will often end up competing with 20-30 other people that also hunt for the same flat!

The landlords are quite picky, and you will need to make a good impression, **show them your job contract and documents proving that you don’t have unpaid debts** (from an organisation called SCHUFA).

A good option might be to find a short term rental (for example with Airbnb or Couchsurfing) and patiently search for a long term place when you are already there.

For more details on this topic, for example why the apartment often comes without a kitchen, [check this guide.](https://www.simplegermany.com/renting-in-germany)

Be aware that, more often than not, you will have to deposit the amount that equals to about 3 monthly rents.**At 1.500 EUR / month it means a single payment of 4.500 EUR!** Therefore, if you are on a tight budget it might be a bit tough till you receive your first salary. You will get the deposit back when you're done renting an apartment.

## 3. Checklist of things to do after moving to Germany

## Important formalities after arriving:

After you arrive and get comfortable in your new place, you need to take care of the following:

* **Register your stay** \- If you are a citizen of the EU (or Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland), you don’t need any work permit. You will only need to register your stay at a local Residence Registration Office (Einwohnermeldeamt) or Immigration Office (Ausländerbehörde).
* **Open a bank account** \- There are a few types of banks in Germany:
   * **Branch Banks (Filialbanks)** are traditional banks with a country-wide network, but often higher fees, examples: Postbank, Commerzbank
   * **Local banks** in specific regions, called Sparkasse, Volksbank or Landesbank
   * **Pure online / mobile / FinTech banks** with almost free accounts, like: Fidor, N26 or Kontist.
   * For an in-depth comparison you can check [this article from Simple Germany.](https://www.simplegermany.com/best-german-bank-english-speakers)
* **Choose health insurance (Krankenkasse)** \- In Germany you can choose between **public and private health insurance**, but only if you earn more than 64,350 EUR per year (as of 2021). If you earn less you are forced to use the public one, but you can still pick a provider. Health insurance in Germany amounts to around **14,6% of your salary** and is deducted automatically [(Source).](https://www.howtogermany.com/pages/healthinsurance.html)
* **Other important things** \- if you plan to use the public transport then it might make sense to buy a long term ticket. Otherwise, bikes or electric scooters are also good choices.
* **Integrate and have fun** \- find local groups related to your hobbies and interests. In bigger cities, you may be able to connect with your own ethnic group, as there are some big diasporas living in Germany, like: Turkish, Romanian, Polish or Italian.

## How much does life in Germany cost and how high are the taxes?

Germany is quite expensive compared to other EU countries, but not *CRAZY* expensive like Switzerland. It is worth to mention that there are big differences in rent prices between the various cities, for example: Munich is quite costly, whereas in Berlin you should be able to find a place with lower rents.

Your first month or two might be a bit tough, but after receiving the salary you will quickly realize that the things are actually quite affordable.

Below you can find a breakdown of income and costs for someone earning **60.000 EUR and living in Berlin:**

**60.000 EUR** annually (according to [this calculator](https://www.bbx.de/grossnet-wage-calculator-germany/)) gets you **3.049,25 EUR** net per month. This is assuming that you are single and not a church member, because there is an extra tax (around 9% of your income tax) if you belong to one. It assumes that you are single and don't have children (Germany offers a generous tax reduction if you have kids).

Income tax in Germany is a complex topic. The taxation is progressive, which means you pay a bigger percentage the more you earn. There are also six tax classes in Germany - the rates are based on your civil status (being single or married, having children, etc.). We recommend checking the [gov resources](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/jobs/taxes/income) for more information.

To simplify, let’s assume **3.000 EUR** to spend per month.

Now let’s move to the costs:

* **Apartment: 800-1.500 EUR** (with 1.5k you can get a pretty, but not the biggest flat in the center) or a single room in a flat: 500-900 EUR
* **Food: 150-700 EUR** (150 if you always cook for yourself, 700 if you are a foodie and eat out every 2nd day)
* **Entertainment: 200–500 EUR** (a beer in a pub costs \~5 EUR, monthly gym subscription 40 EUR. Again, all depends on you, but you can have a lot of fun without spending much)
* **Other: 150-300 EUR** (phone, clothes, public transport, a car, etc.)

To sum up: if you are single and opt for *""live cool and don't care about expenses""* style, then an average developer salary will be enough (it might be harder if you have a family to feed).

On the other hand, if you choose to go the student-like route (living in Wohngemeinschaft and not eating out too much), you can easily manage with just **1.200-1.500 EUR** per month, and save the majority of your salary.

As you can see, both options are doable!

ru8yxa,"I am a senior staff engineer at a top tech company in London, AMA!","**tl;dr:** I am a L7 (senior staff) engineer at a MANGA company in London. I’ve been fortunate enough to make it there within a rather short period of time. Feel free to ask me anything and I’ll try to answer.

\--

I shared my salary in the recent thread and got quite a few direct messages and responses, asking for advice or other insights. And instead of answering these questions multiple times in private, I figured it might be useful to do this in a separate thread instead.

A couple of caveats first: This is a throwaway account and I will obfuscate some details on my background because I want to keep some level of anonymity. I am fairly sure that some of my close colleagues can make the connection, but I’d rather not go much further. I am pretty sure you can work out which company I work for though.

Secondly, I think big tech companies are too often seen as a monolith. But they are not. There are obviously many similarities, but also many differences. Even more, there can be significant differences across teams and organisations within the companies as well. This all goes to say: **This is just one single path.** It is a path that is in many ways exceptional and I am not sure it would have worked in other places. That being said, I will try to distill learning and insights from it.

I won’t focus much on compensation here, you can find it in my history. Instead I’ll focus on progression and what I’ve learned along the way.

**Background**

I come from central Europe. I actually do not have a CS degree. I studied business in my undergrad at some no-name university. I had a minor in computer science though. I wanted to deepen my technical background and also study abroad. I was able to get into a reputable university in the US for a masters program in software engineering. This then allowed me to get an internship at a MANGA company. Originally I wasn’t planning to stay at that company full-time, and instead return to my home country afterwards. But I enjoyed my time there so much that I accepted the full-time offer in the end.

**First Two Years (L3 -> L5)**

I first worked one year in the US full-time. I joined a backend (but not infrastructure) team as a full-stack engineer. I actually had a bit of a rocky start and got a basic rating in my ever first performance evaluation. I remember this troubling me. Part of it was a ramp-up. But it was also that on my project I focused more on building long-term features, neglecting some of the short-term benefits I could enable. My manager helped me balance this better and I had a good second half, resulting in a promotion to L4.

**Learning:** Balance short term value added with the longer term. This doesn’t mean you can’t build for the long-term, but don’t do it blindly.

I then moved to London and joined a new team. In the new team I was able to leverage a lot of my knowledge I’ve gained in the first year, but apply it closer to the product. We were on an early stage product and had a lot of greenfield code. I wrote probably the most code ever in the next year or two. We had a great team, with one very senior engineer (L7+) as a tech lead and I was able to learn a lot from them. I got a promotion to L5 after a year.

**Learning:** I learned to have an opinion during this time. A technical opinion, but also a product opinion. I think this mattered a lot. I would be able to be a counterpart to the tech lead, but also communicate with other stakeholders or even external partners.

**Senior Engineer (L5 -> L6)**

I’ve been at the company now for 2 years. I think two things happened here: First, I started to build a reputation across the organisation (when I mean org, I mean engineering under our director, not the entire company). I didn’t do this intentionally, and more by being passionate about certain things. In particular I started to care a lot about code quality. I would go out and clean up legacy code left and right. These were partially side projects and would go much beyond the codebase of my immediate team. So I became known for being the person that improves our codebase. Secondly, the senior tech lead left the team. This left a clear gap within the team that I could naturally fill. I received the L6 promo after another year. This was honestly the most surprising promotion. I didn’t even know my manager put me up for it and I did not expect it at all.

**Learning:** Don’t be limited by what your immediate team is doing. If you see opportunities outside, see whether you can pursue them. This needs to be done right though. Be clear with your manager and team on how you prioritise and also make sure you don’t step on other people’s toes.

**Staff Engineer (L6 -> L7)**

Now at the company for three years, on the same team for two. The next promotion would take 2.5 years.

For the first year it was really mostly me getting comfortable with being a staff engineer in the first place. I’d be a tech lead for my team. But I’d increasingly also get pulled into tech discussions that would affect the entire org. I noticed how my skip level manager (our director) would start seeking my opinion or ask me to look into certain things. My passion for cleaning up code became a larger program for the entire org to organise and encourage others to do the same. I also got increasingly involved in recruiting and performance evaluation for other engineers, including promotions.

**Learning:** As a staff engineer, you should stop optimising for your immediate team. You are much more responsible for multiple teams or even an entire org. Building culture, mentoring, growth plans for talent etc. became more relevant.

In the second year of being a L6, it also became clear that I am no longer really a member of a team. Formally I was, but the majority of my time would be spent on things that would go beyond it. I would often jump into things that were on fire and help stabilize them. I helped build a team from the start up (but within the same org) that focused a lot of reliability and scalability instead of concrete product features. My manager struggled quite a bit with the new situation of COVID and asked me to take over certain things usually managers do. This provided me with great insight into what is happening across the entire org and also gave me further exposure.

**Learning:** This is really the year I learned that a manager at that level is much more a peer than a manager. Sure, they technically do all the paperwork that people managers do, but in the end you are both responsible for the same thing: Team and org health. So you should collaborate together like peers.

When the third year started, I had concrete discussions with my manager how the promotion to L7 would look like. It felt like a challenging step, but within reach. I also at the time started a new project with a very ambitious but business critical goal for our product. This provided me with a lot of room to show that I could really tackle large problems and gave me a lot of exposure. I knew at the end of the half, that my manager would put me up for promotion, but I had no idea whether it would go through. My manager also was not sure, as I was the first promotion to that level they ever handled. In the end it was enough and I got promoted to L7 after 2.5 years at L6, 5.5 years at the company in total.

**Learning:** Be open to new challenges. This project was not directly in the domain I was familiar with, but provided me with excellent opportunities to both grow and showcase what I’ve already learned. But also understand how you are supposed to operate on such a project at that level. My time directly contributing code there is limited. I am much more helping other engineers make progress, aligning stakeholders and partner teams and building long term roadmaps.

\--

So, this is it. I tried to keep it as brief as possible while still providing an overview how progression can look like. There are many other things I could go into more detail:

* I am really active in recruiting. I do about 60 interviews a year. Mostly system design or behavioral. I also review packets before they go to the hiring committee.
* I had three interns over the years and I am active in internal mentorship programs. I really enjoy mentoring others.
* I am also involved in the release process for the main web server of the company. I find release engineering fascinating.
* I’ve dealt with imposter syndrome multiple times over my career, starting as an intern and I will expect to have to deal with it again. I got better at it, but I think it never really goes away.

So yeah, feel free to ask me anything. Or don’t. That’s also cool.",2022-01-02 12:48:07
jx8i7y,I'm giving up.,"If someone told me 3 years ago that a good degree and a few hobby projects wasn't enough I wouldn't have bothered. 150 applications later and I'm officially giving up. A career in SWE isn't for me. I tried - I failed. I didn't listen and didn't do the internships, I didn't grind leetcode after lectures 7 days a week, I didn't launch my micro-service to generate 3k/mo while still a freshman, I didn't intern at Google and build my network before I'd even lost my virginity.

yojnhy,Name and Shame: TeamViewer,"I was contacted by one of their recruiters on LinkedIn about a position in their Göppingen location.

The first call was a quick screening with the engineering director and was actually quite pleasant. He asked me some high level questions about how to reverse a linked list, what the difference between an array and vector is, and what's roughly happening when a web page is retrieved by a browser. I was then invited for a second round with the team I'd be working with.

This one was weird. I introduced myself and talked about what I've worked on in the past. Almost everyone had their camera disabled. Another team member joined a bit late after 10 minutes and asked me to briefly repeat the introduction. One person was leading the discussion and had to verbally poke his other colleagues to introduce themselves. To me it seemed like they had no idea what was going on and had no interest in participating in the interview.

I was told that I'd get feedback after a week at most. Over a month has passed and I've still yet to receive a response. The recruiter also kinda ghosted me. There were no technical questions, so they don't even have a lot of information to base their decision on. 0/10 - was just a waste of time.",2022-11-07 11:14:16

""What are the criteria?""

wdmbbu,Why do people in this sub act as if 100% remote job that allow you to live in rural Bulgaria with a Swiss salary are the norm?,"That's kind of a pet peeve of mine. People come here asking things like ""I have skills A and B, what's the best country to look for a job?"", and often an entire half of the thread is dominated by replies like ""oh just move to Eastern/Southern Europe with a remote job"".

It doesn't work like that. You don't just get one of those jobs with a 5 second search on Indeed. Those are still a tiny minority. Why do you think those countries have a brain drain? It's not because everyone wants to move to sunny Dortmund.

An employee has LOADS of paperwork and bureaucratic shenanigans to work with to hire someone living in another country. It's a huge hassle. You might have better luck as an individual contractor, but then you'll have to sort everything out on your own - you won't have all the benefits that make working in Europe so great (paid leave, sick leave, legally mandated work life balance...). And most likely a. you'll be competing against hundreds of people with your exact same idea and b. it'll just have a dumping effect because why would someone hire you living in Poland with Western rates instead of hiring a Pole with Polish rates (or, better yet, an Indian with Indian rates)? Are you really that good that they cannot find anyone better? Even in the US fully remote job where you can just work from anywhere are still rare, and it's not even that easy to work from anywhere within the US without taking a substantial pay cut that pretty much erases all the hypothetical gains. 

Bottom line, you CAN find a remote job that allows you to enjoy a sweet German salary while sipping cocktails on a beach in Algarve, but it will involve time, work and luck and it's absolutely not a wise move to structure your career choices around that. People during the pandemic thought that would be the future; while working from home or hybrid definitely is the future, cities in Western Europe are only growing and growing.",2022-08-01 16:53:13
1akmyn5,Moving to Germany as a software engineer !,"Hey guys 👋

In February 2021, I moved from my home country Lebanon to Germany after I got a job offer as a software engineer at a big tech company. This was definitely very challenging because of the new language , new culture, new environment and new people. I figured I had to adapt quickly. One obvious thing was the language , so I started learning German in July 2021. It was a long journey, but I can proudly say that I will statt C1 next week !

 In the past 3 years, I was able to achieve the following;

- Complete B2 level in German
- Get the Permanent Residence only after 21 months
- Get a driving license in Germany

Reflecting on the past couple years, I can see how challenging it was and is still is to integrate in a completely new country. 

If you are thinking of moving to Germany as a software engineer and you have any doubts or questions , feel free to dm me or write a comment below and I will be happy to help 🙂",2024-02-06 22:38:55

j2wevh,The amount of coding challenges and psychometric tests graduates have to do is a complete joke,"It's crazy. Every single company I've applied to that has gotten back to me in the UK/Ireland either sent me a psychometric test, this could be a situational judgement or an Aptitude/IQ test or a coding challenge or a one way video interview. What's worse is they put time limits on how long you have to do them, usually only a week. It got to a stage where I had over 10 hours of tests to do within a week while I'm in my final year of university. It's a disgrace that these companies expect you to put aside two hours of your week just for them before you even talk to them and they have no consideration that you have also applied to other companies who have the exact same bullshit tests as part of their hiring process. Really sick of searching for a job as a grad. I feel like a number rather than an actual human being with most of these companies.",2020-09-30 22:39:11
1847uhq,I got a job because of racism.,"If you wonder why you couldn't get a job in another country it might give you some hint.To make thigs even more weird it's a huge international company with a local branch in which almost half of the employees are already foreigners. I don't work there anymore so now I can talk about this. After I befriended the engineer who interviewed me I obviously asked why they chose me and not other candidates. I got two reasons:

""You were the only guy who answered all questions.""""Most of candidates where from \[that country\] that I hate and I was doing whatever I can so they don't get hired.""

As somebody who lived in foreign countries for many years it's kind of sensitive topic to me. Even though I answered the questions and it sounds cool I wonder would be the result if they didn't hinder other candidates like that.

thrsdy,India is experiencing huge salary hikes. Now it may exceed EU-salaries. Does it still make sense for Indian expats to work in the EU?,"Mainly, I'm talking about Germany because that's where I have experience. A high level frontend salary here is 80k EUR per year. In Tax Class I, after taxes, you will get 46,849 EUR per year.

In India, the frontend salaries are currently 15-30 laks per year, in 2022, the salaries are expected to go up by 60-120%. taking 100% hike, the ceiling would be around 60 laks per year. That is 72k euros per year. After taxes, you would get 54,400 euros per year.

That's a higher salary than Germany, yet the cost of living in India is close to one third or one fourth of that in Germany.

I can also personally confirm from my friends in India that currently, there is a salary war going in between companies and the salaries are going insanely high. A friend already moved back to India from Amsterdam.

It's hard to believe. How is this even possible? Why would companies pay such high salaries in a low CoL country? And does it still make sense for Indian expats to be working in Western Europe?

tl;dr: Switzerland or HFT pays about US rates but has low # of companies and jobs, Netherlands can pay US rates but you have to know which companies, then you get 2nd tier US rates (regions like Austin, or companies like blue chip companies) in Munich, Berlin, London. Most other cities and countries don't have US competitive salaries. Poland is a favorite pick for US companies to have US teams so they pay around 50k (junior) to 150k (staff+) and COL is very low so savings rates can be quite high.

10penho,Got fired on the first day,"Hello, I recently made the decision to switch jobs and applied to a company. After passing the interview process, I received and accepted an offer last Friday. We signed the contracts, and I was scheduled to drive three hours to the office today to pick up my gear. Upon arriving at the office, I collected my equipment and started my journey back home. Unfortunately, by the time I arrived, I received a message stating that the company had changed its mind and that they would be terminating my employment. They demanded that I return the gear as soon as possible, and refused to pay me even for the one day I spent collecting the gear and traveling.

My friend, who is a lawyer, suggested that I could sue for missed opportunities, as I had declined other job offers to accept this one, only to be terminated on the first day. However, it's important to consider whether pursuing legal action is worth the time, effort, and stress involved, as well as the likelihood of winning the case. In the end, it might be better to focus on moving forward and exploring new opportunities.

They turned me down because of my salary expectations, saying they pay a maximum of 48k for entry level dev positions in Berlin. This was after around 6 hours of interviews and coding challenges (5 interviews, 1 take home test).

Maybe the pay at higher levels is better, but 48k is less than the entry level public sector pay in Germany (TVöD EG13) with a Master's. And 5-10k less than the typical salary estimates I got from other tier 3 German companies.

q5hecf,The German CV is illegal in the USA,"What really struck me is that much of the information that the standard german CV has is illegal in the USA due to discrimination potential. For example, we are taught that a standard CV should have:

* **First and last name**
* **Date of birth -> illegal question in USA -> can deduct age-> age discrimination**
* **Nationality -> illegal question in USA -> ethnicity discrimination**
* **Marital status -> illegal question in USA -> discrimination against people with children**
* **Contact information**
* **Passport-size photo -> illegal in USA -> ethnicity/gender/looks discrimination**

Also in USA you don't put the dates of your university and jobs as an employer could deduct your age. For an internship one of my university colleagues even put the profession of his parents.

Do you think we need to implement the same measure as in USA? or do you think that our society is more tolerant and it doesn't have the same crony capitalism problems as in USA (for example firing a pregnant woman) and such measures are unnecessary.",2021-10-10 21:39:09

171yu2m,Salaries in Western Europe look like peanuts compared to ones in LCOL countries.,"The conversation of peanut like CS salaries in Western europe and the HCOL associated with these countries has surfaced on many platforms like reddit and Blind. One can find many posts on this sub too. Personally, i have also meet many people from countries like India, Poland, Romania and Czech republic refusing to move to W.Europe because the salaries in their respective countries and firms primarly US based companies/ FAANG takes them a lot further in terms of saving as they are LCOL countries, which can be also checked by those countries GDP PPP (Purchasing power parity).  

Even in W.europe the best salaries are given by the US companies while all the european firms are known to low-ball and downplay their engineers, why it is the case ? if this story of downplaying of engineers continue, the  W.europe will certainly lag behind in innovation. 

Also, if making money is the primary focus of any expat/immigrant then moving to W.europe is not a suitable option any more considering the peanut like salary combined with HCOL and a terrible housing crisis. 

To make enormous money with CS the only countries that comes into the mind are US of A, Switzerland, Singapore and UAE.  

What are your thought ? 

Will W.europe see more  drain of engineers to US of A ?  The recent trend also shows people from W.europe moving to Warsaw, Gdansk (Poland), Prague (CZ) and Romania etc. I was surprised that some employes  in my company a FAANG in germany  earn similar salary to the guy working in Bangalore  (India).  

To close, what is the problem with salaries in ITALY, which are joke ?

12af76s,Name and Shame: Bloomberg,"I have to vent due to my experience with bloomberg.  


I was approached by one of their recruiters over linkedin, they asked me if I was interested in starting there after graduating this summer. I applied and was invited to an interview. A few days before the interview should have taken place I got covid and therefore was not feeling well enough to do an interview. So I wrote an email explaining my situation to the recruitment person responsible for my case. I asked for checking in with me to make sure they got the mail. I received nothing and asked once more the day of the interview.  
An hour after the interview was originally scheduled I got an email stating that I missed the interview and if I would be interested in continuing the process. I answered and attached the mail asking for a reschedule, explaining that I tried to excuse me for the interview multiple times but that it must have gone lost.

More than two weeks later I got an email on friday explaining that they will move forward without me.

So basically this recruiter is so incapable organizing their email that they blame me for it. In my opinion that is highly unprofessional, even if I would have bombed the interview or if I wouldnt have got the job they should at least be able to handle simple requests for postponing an interview, but instead the interviewee is to blame.

1928f72,"""We keep a low median age for cultural reasons hehe"" - 2 companies in a row","I'm kinda getting fed up with this shit (Greece).

I don't know if anyone else had similar experience with mine. I'm 40 years old and got 2 years of experience, and so far I had two HR interviews in a row for Python developer positions:

Company 1: ""We keep the average low because we appreciate fresh ideas"" - because everyone over 35 literally stops thinking and experiencing new things, we're practically with one leg in the grave amirite? /s

Company 2: ""We're all young and around the same age to keep an informal environment"" - tf is that supposed to mean? Do people actually treat coworkers like their new fam/squad or some shit? Is having a 35+ person a threat to some arbitrary safe space protocols by merit of age? Or am I unfit for the laser-tag/escape room culture and I just want to do my own side-projects or go out with my actual friends and/or family?

I'm so glad I'm currently employed and I just interview to see how things fare in the job market because holy shit this is hot garbage.

13bkox5,[Meta] Can posts asking about immigration advice or from people currently outside of the EU with no citizenship be banned?,"Hi,

Lately the sub has been absolutely flooded with posts from people who do not have an EU citizenship and have a vague project of coming to work in EU, or even just getting a remote job from an EU company.

I don't think there's anything wrong with this goal, but I think they all invariably lead to very low quality discussions, because:

1. They are more about immigration than software engineering career,

2. The answers are always vague since the only tangible advice is to apply to jobs that sponsor and hope.

I do not think those posts add any value at all to the sub, and I think the topic should be covered in an FAQ and then related topics should be banned (or maybe limited to a weekly megathread if people really think their situation is different).

kdga5c,Universities don't really care about you,"I am currently a student at one of the Europe's top universities and pursuing my education in computer science as an international student.

Long story short, somehow I got entangled in a fraud case in the online examinations for a course which I had nothing to do with. I tried everything in my hands to prove my innocence but due to the similarity in the work submitted and the accusation of the other student to save themself, the university board does not believe me. And, I am going to be terminated as a result, since they seem to take this case very seriously. 

I even begged the board to at least not terminate me from the university as this would affect my future very heavily and probably ruin my career and my finances, but to no avail.

I spent a lot of money and was a good student but in the end, my university does not care about me. Never have I ever been so disappointed in my choice and more so because I had literally nothing to do with the allegation. 

I don't know what to do now after being fucked over nothing.

Yes, maybe my title might come out as an escapism technique or even misleading, but I meant exactly what I have written.

Also, a very big thank you for the wishes and ideas, I will look into some legal advice.",2020-12-15 06:14:49
oop9oa,My experience interviewing at six European companies to getting a job as a non-EU citizen in one month,"***PS:*** *Currently I'm waiting to start my next job in Europe and I'm also a bit bored so I decided to share my experience here in the hope that it would be useful to others. Being paranoid about my privacy I would like to share only as much as I feel is necessary however if somebody wants more details feel free to comment/ask.*

**About Me:** Software Developer with close to six years of experience. Currently working in South East Asia, although this is not my home country so I'm working on a work visa here. Java/Kotlin are the main languages that I work with.

**Motivation:** I decided to switch jobs a couple of months ago because I didn't think that the future of my current company was bright. Bad work life balance, saturation when it came to learning things and the idea of moving to Europe were other reasons why I decided to start my job hunt.

I chose Europe for several personal and professional reasons. But I knew it won't be easy since I was a non-EU ciztien so I had to find a job at a company which not only sponsored my work permit but also met other expectations like salary *(especially since my current salary was quite high for the country I am living in)*, company reputation and the opportunity to learn. Having had a bad experience in the past about which I wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d6xpep/fired_to_hired_with_40_raise_within_10_days_rant/) I was extra cautious.

**Applications:** I started looking for jobs online. I mainly used StackOverflow and Linkedin to find jobs in my domain that were ready to sponser visas and which met my expectations as mentioned above.

In the end I applied at **10 companies** in 4 European countries namely Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and Spain. Out of these 10 I got positive replies from **6 companies** and rejection from the remaining 4.

Initally I wasn't sure about the kind of response I'd get so I applied to several companies but then I found it hard to arrange and manage interviews for 6 companies at the same time. I'd say I was a bit overwhelmed by the responses.

*One thing to note is that I decided to not apply in any companies that asked Leetcode style questions because I didn't have enough time to be prepare and be confident with DS/Algo.*

**Interviews:** Interviews for all these companies were actually very similar and consisted of the following rounds in different order

1. **HR round:** HR chats with you. They ask about why you want to join this company, why you want to leave, why Europe (or the country in question), expected salary, expected joining date, notice period etc. This is the easiest round. I cleared this round for 5 companies out of the 6 that I interviewed at.I was expecting a rejection from the company that rejected me because during the HR discussion I got the feeling that these guys are probably looking for someone who has worked in a bigger team/company and had more experience with writing testcases, something which I didn't have.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_***My Advice:*** Research about the company and know your motivations for joining the company. Even though most of these HR chats are not technical but sometime they can surprise you by asking general tech things so be prepared for that. Don't badmouth your current company, colleagues etc. Sometimes they may ask were basic behavioral questions.
2. **Home assignment:** I personally am quite confident of home assignments. I completed home assignments for 3 out of the remaining 5 companies and all the 3 invited me for the next round. For the remaining 2, I had to decline the interviews after I got the offer from one of the first 3.The length of these home assignments varied. Surprisingly the most popular and well known of these 5 companies *(and the company which I accepted the offer from)* had the shortest assignment. Second company had a longer assignment which I still didn't mind because it was interesting.But the 3rd company's home assignment was too long and too challenging. The HR of that company even mentioned during the 1st round before sending me the assignment that many people don't submit the assignment and so she hopes that I'd do it. Now I can see why. I completed about 80% of the assignment and got the invite for the next round.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_***My Advice:*** Based on my experience with home assignments in the past and the experiences that others share *(both negative and positive)* I'd say that code quality is the most important thing about these assignments. You should be using industry practices and latest libraries/apis/approaches. For example, if you have to make api calls, you should use a well known and popular library for that and use it the correct way. I've seen a code submission where someone wrote all the boiler plate code for api layer using Httpclient in Java. It is no doubt that such a submission will not succeed. In another case I saw a submission where someone used RxJava in a rather simple app which made the code very difficult to understand. You shouldn't overengineer. Keep it simple, follow industry best and latest practices. This round is easier to clear if the code you write all round the year follows the above constraints because then this round will be like completing a ticket at your current job.
3. **Tech interview:** I reached the tech round, which was also the final round in all athe 3 companies where I submitted the assignment. Ultimately I decided to turn down 2 of them after I accepted the offer from the third one. The tech interview at this company was one of my best tech interview experiences. The interviewers actually put as much effort into the interview as me. The questions were very relevant to the role and there was a lot to think about after the interview ended.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_***My Advice:*** This round is mostly about your skills, knowledge and experience. In order to be confident and do good in this round it would help if you know the tech that you work with very well. You will of course prepare for the tech interview a few days before it but what would make the most difference in this round is the work you do all round the year. So knowing the whys and hows of technologies that you work with daily will make this round a lot easier for you.
4. **Interview with manager/tech lead:** These are behavioral rounds. I gave 3 such interviews in my journey and cleared all of them. My favorite resource for preparation for these rounds is the behravioral interview guide on Leetcode. Other than that you can prepare for it online from several sites.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_***My Advice:*** Being a good communicator helps. Try to prepare as many questions and scenarios beforehand so that you know what to expect during the interview. Even if you have an answer for the specific question asked, you may find that you may struggle to come up with it during the interview situation, so preparing a lot of questions beforehand helps a LOT.

In the end I decided to accept an offer from one of these companies. The pay is around 70k Euro before taxes. I don't want to disclose the the company or location but I've narrowed it down to 4 above. The whole process took less than a month.

If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask and I hope my post helps others.",2021-07-21 12:53:21

y5ad2f,Moving to the US from the EU: A selection of options,"I’m a lurker of this sub, and I often see posts from my fellow Europeans along the lines of “how can I move to the US?”, or just general comments from people who would like to explore the software industry in the US. As someone who successfully made the jump a few years ago, I’ve now seen a variety of other people make the jump, and I wanted to share some options for people who are really interested in moving to the US. (I also know that some people are tired of “how to move to the US?” posts and threads, so hopefully this can be a one-stop thread for people who are wondering about that, to avoid polluting other threads :-) )

Let me start by prefacing with this: moving to the US is **really hard**. The US immigration system has much more demand than it has supply, and with the current political gridlock, there’s basically little chance of the US increasing avenues for immigration.

In an average Western country, if a tech company finds a foreigner who’s able to do the job, they would sponsor them, and that new employee could be on a plane with their family a few months later. In the US, **the system is so clogged that there’s very little chance a company would even** ***consider*** **foreigners from abroad**, be it Europeans or others. The H-1B system (H-1B being the main visa for highly skilled foreigners) is completely clogged, to the point where the US government had to set up a yearly lottery that only selects one out of 3 petitions. (In 2022, there were 308,613 petitions, even though the yearly cap is 87,500 slots.) Recruiters mostly *won't even consider people outside of the US*. If you click on “Apply” for a job posting in the US, your resume likely **won’t even go in front of a recruiter** if you’ve checked the box “needs sponsorship” in the application. (There are exceptions of course, but mostly for very senior roles, or people who have an extremely specialized skillset.)  
This is also compounded by the fact that since US companies have a harder and harder time hiring locally (especially companies in Silicon Valley), **lots of them are actively trying to set up offices abroad**–so if they want to hire foreigners, it’s typically more **to try and base them abroad**, so as to start building up their presence there. (For example, see the Google and Meta offices in London.) So yeah. If you hadn’t noticed by now, it’s really hard.

(Last note before I lay out options: I know that America is not a country for everyone, and lots of people have strong opinions about life in America from abroad. This post will not try to convince you to move to the US. Just to provide guidance to those who are interested to move to the US, be it just for a few years or to immigrate permanently.)

I'll now get started on the options. If some acronyms are unknown to you, I’ve added a mini-glossary at the end.

* **(EARLY CAREER): Doing a Master’s in the US**  
If you haven’t gotten a Master’s yet, a serious option to get a foot in the door is **doing your Master’s in the US**. There’s lots of reasons for that. The main one is that doing a Master’s in CS in the US gives you a right to **a work visa called the STEM OPT, which is basically a 3-year post-grad work visa**. Once you’re done with your Master’s, you can apply for company in the US, and they won’t need to sponsor you to start working. If you’re doing a good job, many of them (especially the big ones) will try to get you an H-1B before the STEM OPT expires. And if your STEM OPT runs out before you get an H-1B, but that you’ve already proven yourself, bigger companies that have a presence abroad will often transfer you to an office abroad, then will transfer you back to the US once you're eligible for an L1.  
Now, you might be thinking: isn’t doing in the Master’s in the US extremely expensive? **Yes, it's expensive**. However, it’s good to keep in mind that with salaries being higher in the US, you might be able to pay it off in just a few years. In addition to that, it’s a good idea to look up if your home country has programs to help you study abroad while keeping costs down. For example, Sweden has 0% interest rate loans available if you want to study abroad.  
(Keep in mind that studying in the US technically initially *requires non-immigrant intent*: the officer at the US embassy will want to ensure that your initial intent, when getting your student visa, is *only* to study & possibly do an OPT, then go back to your home country. While US law recognizes that you might change your mind after you've been studying in the US for a while, it's good to keep this non-immigrant aspect in mind if you decide to go that route.)  
Doing a Master’s in the US has other immigration & career benefits:
   * You’ll start building a network with other folks who want to work in software in the US, who might be able to–for example–refer you to a job down the line.
   * US tech companies often recruit interns and new grads at career fairs and on campus, which you’ll be able to attend.
   * Your odds to be selected in the H-1B lottery are higher. (There’s a selection of slots reserved to applicants with a US Master’s.)
* **(ALL CAREER STAGES) Transfer**  
Because transfer visas (specifically, the L1 visa) are easier to get than H-1B visas (since they don't have the same yearly cap problem), **having a company hire you** ***outside*** **of the US then transfer you to the US** is a possibly effective strategy. Here are a few ways you could go at this:
   * **Apply for the job you’d like, but have them park you outside of the US until you’re eligible for an L1 visa**. Possible for extremely niche position, but in general, *most* job postings will filter out your application just from you having checked “needs sponsorship to work in the US”.  
In this situation, a referral can work in your favor. If you can be referred directly to a hiring manager by an acquaintance, they might be more inclined to pick up your resume from the list–and then, to figure out visa solutions if they decide that they’d like to make you an offer.
      * What's worked for some people I know was to reach out on LinkedIn to alumnae of their universities that are working for US companies, and ask if they were recruiting/could refer them.
   * **Get a job at a US company at one of their offices, then ask for a transfer to the US after a few years**. I’ve seen quite a few successfully do that: they worked for 3 or 4 years at a FAANG in London or elsewhere, then were transferred to the US. Typically, it’s either because they were offered to transfer without asking–but I’ve also seen some people apply for an internal job change for a US position after already proving themselves in a position for a few years.
* **(IF YOU HAVE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER SKILLS) Self-sponsoring**  
If you have lots of experience, or if you have experience in a highly specialized & sought-after niche, another option is **self-sponsoring** \- i.e. not relying on a company to sponsor you, but instead **asking the US government for a visa directly, based on your skillset**. If you’re a software engineer, the classic go-to option would be the EB2-NIW (National Interest Waiver). If you petition the US government for an EB2-NIW and that your petition is approved, not only will they let you in and let you work in the US, but they’ll also issue you a green card, meaning you’ll effectively be a US permanent resident, and that you’ll be free to do whatever you’d like (instead of being tied to a single employer).  
The bar for self-sponsoring is higher, and you typically need to demonstrate you’ll provide a unique and useful set of skills. A PhD, patents, publications, years of experience, online presence/personal brand, conference talks will help, although none of those are strict requirements. I’d recommend doing some research (just a Google search is a good start) on the profiles of software engineers who have been approved, and investigating whether it could be an option for you. There are quite a few immigration lawyers who offer to help you file on a “successful or refunded” basis–after they audit your profile, they’ll tell you immediately if they think you’ll be approved, and if you end up being refused, they’ll refund you their legal fees.

Those are some of the main options that I’ve seen used successfully. There’s also a few smaller options that it’s good to keep in mind:

* The United States runs a [diversity visa program](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html?wcmmode=disabled), where a small subset of entrants (less than 1%) are randomly selected for a green card. While the odds are very small, I’ve met a few foreign techies who moved this way. If you’re thinking of moving to the US, it can always be worth signing up every year, since it’s free and takes 10 minutes to do.
* Per US law, it’s easier for non-profits to sponsor foreigners in the US than for-profit companies. (They aren’t constrained by the H-1B cap, so they can keep sponsoring foreigners even if the H-1B cap has been reached for the year.) Aiming specifically for those companies can be an option.

That's it! Hopefully, all this information will have been helpful. If you have thoughts, comments, or think I missed an option, please feel free to comment in the thread :-)

**Glossary:**

* OPT: Stands for Optional Practical Training. Temporary 1-year work visa that international students in the US can leverage post-graduation.Graduates from STEM fields can ask for a 2-year extension, granting the total to 3 years. This option is called the STEM OPT.
* H-1B: The US’s classic high-skilled foreigner visa. It’s capped to 87,500 visas per year (including a portion exclusively for applicants with a US Master’s). Because demand has been so much higher in the past few years, the US government has been forced to do a yearly lottery. The US Congress could raise the cap, but it would be very difficult with the current political gridlock.
* L1 Visa: Intra-company transfer visa. If you’ve worked for a company in one of their non-US offices for a year, they can use this visa to transfer you back to the US.
* O-1 Visa: “Exceptionally skilled” visa, or the celebrity visa. (Justin Bieber was, at least at some point, living in the US on an O-1.) It’s possible to get an O-1 visa as a software engineer, but the bar is quite higher than for H-1B. Typically only accessible if you have lots of experience, if you have a highly specialized skillset, or if you’re influential in your field (e.g. patents, conference talks…)",2022-10-16 07:16:54

ctm1so,"My recent interview experience and tips for 3 years experience in London, with an offer of almost £100k","I've been reading and contributing to the main subreddit for about 7 years now, so I thought it would be fun to share my most recent experience as it may help others, and perhaps give another view to the standard one.


I have 3 years professional experience (2 jobs), and 2 summer internships before that, as a backend developer. This is the result of my job search that took place over 2 or 3 weeks. 


**SALARY PROGRESSION (Total comp)**

- Graduate salary - £41k
- Year 1 - £45k
- Year 2 - £51k
- Year 3 - (current) £55k (now) - £96k


**INTERVIEW PROCESS**

tl;dr 19 companies - 7 tech tests - 7 phone interviews - 7 final interviews - 1 offer (I rejected the other 6 before interviewing)


The results are somewhat skewed, as I actually did not get rejected from any of the 19 companies, but some were slower than others getting back to me. A couple of the final interviews also would have been a squished version of their normal process, in order to keep up with my other processes, so I may have had less final interviews than I actually did in other circumstances.


**JOB SEARCH:**

- Before anything, I started preparing myself. I will get into what I looked at in the later sections, but I did not look at leet code AT ALL. Every time I interview, I open it up for one or two problems, get horrendously bored, and close it. Do not force yourself through it unless you are running out of options.
- My CV is clear and concise. Everything a short bullet point and it is 2 pages with everything key on the 1st page. It has all the necessary buzzwords for each job, and also explains what I did (with notable accomplishments). My grades were very good at university, but I don't think that contributed to the good feedback on my CV, it really is just a developer's market at the moment.
- Started contacting recruiters (on LinkedIn) and gathering information a couple weeks before I felt ready. Figured out who had what I wanted. A quick tip here is to tell every recruiter you contact you cannot talk on the phone during the work day. You save a lot of time hearing what is written on a job spec, and you will not get constant recruiter phone calls when at work.
- Be very clear with what you want. I was not happy with my salary and so I said that was my aim, and if there is anything less than £85k then I was not interested. A lot said that was too big of a jump for me, and I said I am not in a rush to leave, and prepared to wait for somewhere that pays. Some companies said they would not pay someone with my experience that much, so I told them to set me at the bar of someone you would pay that much, and if I am not good enough then so be it. My other requirement was that I work in the finance sector and wanted to stay in there.
- On the day I had set for myself, I contacted all my recruiters with which companies I wanted to progress with, and also signed up to Hired. I prefer to get the whole interview process over as fast as possible. This is not for everyone, but it sets you up really nicely when you say you have a bunch of final interviews.
- The first thing I started receiving were phone interviews and tech tests.


**TECH TESTS** 

- This was the key factor for me deciding if I liked a place or not. If they had a leet code test that was harder than a leet code easy problem, I rejected them. I feel very strongly about what leet code tells you about a developer, and so have no interest working for a company that thinks it is a good metric. I apply this to anything they ask in interviews as well.
- Thankfully the majority in the UK finance sector, it's not a big problem. Of the 7: 1 medium leet code, 1 timed algorithm but well explained, 5 non-timed. 
- Tip for these really is just take your time (if it is not timed obviously). Make sure your code is clean, and make sure you have a good amount of tests. Look at your IDE warnings (seriously the amount of people that ignore these...). Have a friend scan it after you are finished for any glaring mistakes. If you are failing at this point, stop and improve further. Read books such as Clean Code.

**PHONE INTERVIEWS**

- Before the phone interview, I will read up on the company quickly. I will do some last minute reading in areas I am not strong in. Most importantly however, is I will go and talk to someone. Be it in person, or over the phone, it is good to get warmed up for talking. You cannot go from solitary reading to your best engaging, sociable self on a flick of a switch.
- These can be a mixed bag in terms of what they ask you. Make sure you:
	- Have your fundamentals down.
	- Understand data structures, system design (including distributed systems), concurrency, and so on. 
	- Can explain your current role and system well. If they ask you how it works and connects together, you should have that memorised. Understand why it was designed like that, and how it has worked well (and how it has not), even if you did not design it. 
	- Be humble. If you don't know something, that is fine. Admit it, say you want to make an educated guess, and then continue. Ask them for the right answer if they don't tell you.
- Some of these phone interviews were also pairing exercises. For these, make sure you:
	- Are confident in your ability to code (if not, go read, practice!)
	- Use Google (ask first), if they say no and offer no assistance - reconsider the company. 
	- Talk everything out loud, even if it sounds dumb.
	- Honestly these were always the weakest part of the process for me. It is something you get better at as your coding skills improve, but it is always nerve wracking having someone watch you code, sometimes you just have to fail a bunch before the nerves go away (if they ever do).
	

**IN PERSON INTERVIEWS**

- Similar preparation to the phone interview. This is probably my biggest (maybe saddest) tip: LOOK GOOD. I dress as though I am about to go on a date. I make sure my hair is nice, facial hair is neat, clothes fit me well and look good, and I smell good. I work out as well, and you should too. People are shallow (consciously or subconsciously), but how you look is something you have control over, so do your best. It will increase how confident you feel as well.
- As far as the actual interviews go, it is fairly similar to phone interviews in what they can ask. Some ask you to code, some ask you technical questions. Make sure you prepare for everything, but if you are failing interviews, then you will start to know what you need to work on.
- Also, SMILE. Make jokes. These are people too, and they will want someone who is fun to work with. And if you can't make small jokes with them, do you want to work with them? Probably not.


**TL;DR**

- In total it took 2 weeks of tech tests/phone interviews, and 1 week of in person/final interviews. I chose not to do 6 of them because the offer I got was exactly what I wanted (tech, sector, compensation), and so I thought it would be silly not to. I could have use other offers to possibly negotiate more, but I was not happy with the risk of losing it (the best advice probably would be to do the other interviews, but the heart wants what the heart wants!)
- LOOK GOOD AND BE SOCIABLE. If you struggle socially, you will struggle to find a good job. I have spent years improving my social skills, and there is always room for improvement. Never stop thinking about what you could be doing to better yourself mentally, physically, or technically.
- Have the fundamentals down. If you cannot code or talk about software with confidence, then you should not be applying to jobs. Spend the time to improve those skills first.
- Practice helps. If you find yourself a nervous wreck in interviews, just keep doing them. I did a fair number a few years ago (and failed almost all), but since then I no longer get nervous.


Also I realise there are higher salaries out there, I am not boasting about my salary (although obviously very happy with it). I am more trying to highlight that what I found helped me have a successful interview experience.

v7hcsf,"My interview experience for Amsterdam - Tier 1,2 and 3(2.5 may be) - Salary, benifits and process","So I have been giving interviews for senior Product Manager roles for the past 6 months and in all honesty, have got offers from all the three-tier companies in the Netherland, and I thought it will be fun to share the differences 

My profile :
Non EU, 
4.5 years of experience as a software developer ( non FAANG), 
4 years of experience as a Product Manager - non FAANG

Had offers from Berlin and Munich for Senior Product Manager roles with a total compensation of 80k and 85k respectively last year, October. Didn't accept both since I was looking primarily at Netherlands and a TC of at least 120-130 K.
Started applying to companies in the Netherland this year February. Here's my journey - 
 
**Tier 1** - Local Dutch company, a small-mid startup in the travel industry, Competing against other EU based start-ups 

Interview process : 3 rounds, HR screening, Head of Product interview, case study and discussion with a Lead PM, Heads of data and design. 

The difficulty level was easy and nothing out of the ordinary. I felt the interviewers were at times stuck and didn't know what to ask.

Total Compensation: **90000 Euros + 2500 Euros relocation** 

Benefits: meh, nothing special. Not even a flight ticket to AMS, forget about a hotel and/or accommodation. 

Overall I felt that the company was not bad but had no idea about how much is the compensation for Senior PM and was oblivious to the difference. 

**Tier 2** - Dutch company operating in various countries. Well knows within the EU region. Industry - Maps and location-based services.

Interview process: HR screening, Director of Product interview, interview with 2 senior PMs and finally, interview with VP and engineering manager.

Difficulty level: Easy to Medium, no product design questions, general PM questions and situational/behaviour questions. 

Total Compensation: **120k + 4k Relocation** 

Benefits: one-month accommodation, house search, one-time office set up coverage, 25 days of leave, pensions contribution and commute + WFH allowance. 

This was a very nice company with a great culture and an amazing WLB. You could log out of your PC by 5 PM and the org is very well known for being an amazing place to work. However, the relocation benefits were limited and the pay wasn't the best. Also, the place is generally slow and not very fast-moving, hence if you are someone who is happy with a 9-4 job, this should be a good choice, but if you are passionate and move at a higher speed, it might be a cultural mismatch. 
I think Tier 2 companies are actually a great stepping stone for someone trying to relocate to the EU or trying to change career roles. 

**Tier 3** (maybe 2.5, Borderline 3) - multinational company, very well known, travel industry. 

Interview process- very knowledgeable screening with TAC, interview with the hiring manager, 2 rounds of interview with Senior and above senior PMs, final round for cultural fit. 

Difficulty level: Medium to Tough. Extreme focus on metrics and tech knowledge. Strategic questions and a lot of situational and behavioural questions. 

Total compensation - **170k + 8k Relocation**

Benefits: 30 days of annual leave, one-month accommodations, 20 Sq ft container and pet relocation, bicycle budget, office set up, work from home and commute allowance, discount on travel, 3.2% pension contribution, free lunch and breakfast and others. By far the best set of benefits amongst the three.

I think this is a very well known org in EU, let alone AMS. I wasn't confident initially since the minimum product requirement was 4+ years and I had 4.5 but luckily for me, my strong tech background and previous experience in the mobile apps and the travel industry helped me. The interviewer panel was very knowledgeable and well-identified my strengths and weakness. The process was also very quick and the HR knew the existing market rates as well. 
However, I do think this doesn't fully fall within the tier 3 subset, which is occupied by FAANGS, DataBricks, Flexport, Uber etc. Another thing to keep in mind is that true Tier 3 companies will pay 200k + but those will involve you working beyond 9 hours owing to distributed teams and will be typically very high paced, so you need to be aware of what you getting into and for a lot of local EU folks, Tier 3 will not even be an attractive proposition since the extra pay might not be worth the extra hours and the stress that comes with the high pay; Job security is also minimal at these places so you need to keep pushing yourself constantly. 

There you go! So as a senior PM, I had offers ranging from 90k to 180 K. And I am certain some companies will even give close to 200k for the same role, Senior PM.  Again goes to show the range of salaries for the same position across different companies.",2022-06-08 04:59:36
vi8el3,How did it become the custom that the companies expects us to be perfect when their work env is shit.,"Basically I am a developer and have switched jobs lately. During the interview, just the usual, They want to know how I write code, if I practice clean coding, SOLID, patterns, unit tests, etc etc. 


Now I have been here a month. Let's say it's not the ideal codebase. They have all kinds of shit in there. Their team is all independent and don't give a shit if any of the team members are stuck. Yes, they are helpful and all, but the management sucks, which helps in being independent, but is terrible for a new member to onboard. They don't have proper reviews, everyone checkins and someone else approves without caring what it does. Within a month, I have seen one bug being fixed three times because the guy checks in some shit that gets approved, that doesn't actually fix anything. 

So my question is: How/ why did the interviews become one sided. Like they expect us to show/ prove our expertise technically and process oriented while they suck at everything and their codebase is worse than my college project.


Tldr: why are the developers expected to have linkedin github certifications etc, when a company won't show their shit before we get in.

18wotw3,After 6 months of job search (2 years exp.) I got a job... and it sucks!,"Are you familiar with the quote ""We don't truly appreciate what we have until it's gone""? This is where I am. The follow is not a joke, drill, or troll and all exist in the codebase I am magically solely responsible (the previous person left):

* HUGE codebase (think 10+ projects in Visual Studio)
* NO testing whatsoever
   * I have to manually test everything
* Classes with names like FirstClass and FirstClass1
* no code reviews
   * They used to work on one branch and commit on it directly - which is also the live branch
   * I tried to open a new branch to work on a feature and got scolded for it
   * The ""code review"" is my staff engineer logging in using teamviewer to see if everything's fine
* We don't follow agile but there's a 45-minute long meeting every day between 4 people (myself included)
* Documentation is 4 pages long and that's mostly whitespace

At this point I want to run away and never return, but I don't have enough money in my bank. I tried to suggest them to slowly fix things but they pretend like I didn't say anything. So now I'm stuck onboarding myself in an unfamiliar to me stack (they didn't mind, which I thought it's cool at that time).

I get that the advice will be ""grind outside of work and keep job searching"" but it's been only 1 month in and I must include the company as previous experience (the way it works in my country is, they can tell if I was employed and how long for health insurance). 

Will I look like a RED FLAG since I'm job searching just as I got a new job? I don't want to get into the badmouthing game and talk about why I want to leave.

qpju5s,I'm thinking of creating an International Tax Calculator app to compare what your total tax paid would be in different countries for any income - Thoughts?,"So I'm interested in comparing how much tax I would pay in different countries for a given income - I don't think a service like this exists yet?

So I thought of doing this as my final project for CS50 - You could input any salary and the app would output the total effective tax rate, take-home pay, and any other info.

This is because I'm always keen on comparing salaries & take-home pay in different countries so this would be interesting for me personally and probably useful for someone else like me too.

Any thoughts? Suggestions?

UPDATE: I’ve been  on a holiday trip, hence the delay, but I have now added UK, France, US(New York, California and Texas) and plan to add a few more before I’ll call it ‘version 1’.

Some FAQ:

1. “This is too complex because tax rules are too complex”: 

This calculator will not take into account every possible personal scenario that might give you some special defuctions etc etc, just the broad tax brackets / standard deductions that apply to the average, single (non-married) person with no dependents in working age, resident in the country etc etc.

I will thus make some simplifying assumptions.

2. “This is too simple, most of your time will be spent in researching tax rules rather than code and the code itself will be very simple”:

True. I am a beginner. I also really want to learn about differences in tax rules between countries so I don’t mind.

3. “How will you keep up with tax rule changes all the time”:

I will update the tax brackets every year, I’m writing down all the sources that I use as I go so tbis shouldn’t be too bad.

4. “What about state and local taxes (for example US)”:

In these cases I will just add the biggest / most interesting states / cities and have them as separate lines on the final output.

5. “Income taxes aren’t everything, CoL and sales taxes etc also matter”:

I aim to incorporate some estimated CoL data (Numbeo had been suggested) + the country’s sales tax and perhaps some note about other significant taxes to consider into the table. This will assume you live in the country’s capital / most important city.

But it’s true that I cannot account for everything and the primary goal of this is to be an income tax comparison calculator.",2021-11-08 18:30:33

1b3jwx8,TIL the average salary of a scrum master is 50k in the UK,"I find it a tiny bit insulting the pay is even close to senior developer pay considering the value to per pound delivered and responsibility dished out.

I truly thought it was in the 30k range... 

our scrum master makes a huge deal when they have to do anything to appear like they are busy...

Sometimes I've heard her actually say ""I'm just meant to facilitate meetings"" or ""I'm meant to be in the background of this meeting"" which seems like a crazy excuse to not do the ONLY real thing they do.

I've worked two places where we just agree that we were all scrum masters and did the meetings together or took turns on a weekly rotas.

I can justify POs and PMs because they often deal with customers, keep track of deliverables and graphs. If they are a good PO or PM they will shield the team from unrealistic expectations.

1aj7v4k,How does it feel when a company announce mass layoff when you just moved to Berlin?,"
It was the most frightening feelings in the world. Especially when you know your visa Status depends on this job.

So I moved to Berlin with a new job in Zalando. I was offered a good package of relocation bonus and 65k gross for a role in L&D with 6 years experience in HR. I heard some stories through the grapevine about Zalando’s layoff culture but shrugged it off and took a leap of faith.

Couple of months into role and boom…it was announced that they will reduce their workforce due to economic turmoil of the fashion and apparel industry. I really liked my team and the project and started to feel quite happy about my role. So, This announcement left me shell shocked. Even though at that time no one knew which roles will be affected by the layoffs - I didn’t feel safe about the situation.

I told myself in fact pushed myself to 
KEEP INTERVIEWING 
Within 1 week after the announcement I secured 3 interviews and started planning my next step career goals. Rather than being victim of a situation I wanted to take power in my own hand. 

After 15+ plus interviews with 8 plus companies in Berlin- I landed my next role in one the largest energy company of Germany. 

One week after joining the new company, my former team was given notice in Zalando to look for different jobs. 

A bystander will look at this situation and tell me how lucky I am. But it has nothing to do with luck - but pure strategy. Nobody will know about the sleepless nights, nightmares, panic attacks I had during those days. 

I am sharing my story just so that you can learn about the reality of job situation in Germany. Never put your all eggs in one basket. Even when you have an excellent work experience things can crumble at any time. Gather and lean on your allies during those times.",2024-02-05 04:25:04
195t9rg,East Europe colony feeling,"Hello, fellow Eastern  Europeans, who work for West Euro-owned companies!

How typical is the 'colony feeling' for you, by which I mean that everyone above a certain seniority level is Western European/American, with there being an uncrossable threshold after 2-3 levels of promotion, and an almost uncrossable one before that. 

For the latter positions, management usually fills senior positions with Westerners with 0 experience, from outside of the company, instead of promoting proven colleagues who have worked for the company for a long time. For projects where the 100% of Engineering is East Euro requires a Western project manager/PO who in many cases has neither expertise nor know-how, with one East Euro 'shadow boss' who is responsible for the technical planning, but  officially is just another subordinate. 

In the company's external communication, the company tries to hide the fact that it hires East Europeans at all, with all public facing roles are held by Westerners, and in product announcements and PR channels its always communicated that the company represents German/Dutch/Swedish engineering and quality, despite the fact that 80+% of the engineering staff comes from East Europe/somewhere else.  
It has been the case for me for the past few companies, and I wonder how common this experience is. I think this is kind of the operating norm for mid-sized firms.",2024-01-13 17:33:41
18mzqz9,3.5 Month Job Search for Senior Backend Developer in Berlin,"Sankey Diagram: https://imgur.com/a/rpALaBh

## Background
EU citizen in Berlin, Germany with a Bachelor's in CS, Backend Engineer with 5 yoe, some of it as fullstack. Lost my job due to my employer's (established startup) insolvency. Last salary 70k. Range looking for: 80k - 85k. Condition was an office in Berlin. Accepted Senior Backend Developer position for 83k at a FinTech.

## Language Skills
C2 English, and high C1 / low C2 German in addition to my native language. Speaking German was instrumental in getting my last jobs but counted for very little this time. Only 3 of the 25 companies interviewed me in German. The rest were in English.

## Application Timeline
Average amount of time to hear back from an application: approx 10 days. 
Shortest time: same day. 
Longest time: 59 days.

## Withdrawals
Reasons for withdrawals: archaic tech stack, bad gut feeling, just didn't like what I heard. In the end I had two companies in the running. I passed both technical interviews but one company was fast and I got to the offer stage. The other company could not schedule the team fit interview for another month (!). I was very interested in working there but I also liked the other company and the offer was to good to let go, and they wouldn't have waited that long so I would have had to reject it and gamble on the other process working out.

## Coding challenges
5 coding challenges done. 2 failed: one was very complex, the other one easy that I failed due to the tool they used (Codility - zero features of a modern IDE) and time ran out before I could close a parenthesis - compilation failure and automatic fail. Employer was inflexible when I offered an explanation. 

Challenges always take 2-3 times longer than suggested.

## Live Coding Experience
You'll notice that I refused live coding, but one company had both live coding and a coding challenge. I was not told about this when talking about the process. The coding challenge was complicated and I was only told about the live coding when I passed it. I agreed to do it due to falling in the sunken cost fallacy. It was a disaster.

## Job Search Challenges
The job search was not easy at all, and it felt like there was more competition than the last two times I looked for a job in Berlin. This is the first time I had to do it while unemployed, so that didn't make it any easier. The process was also very slow. Companies would have a maximum of one interview stage per week.

## Recruiters
Mostly useless. For the most part they don't listen to what you want, and will send you batches of jobs for you to look at that don't apply to your profile at all, and will try to sell you completely different roles. There are a few good ones, but they're very hard to come by.",2023-12-20 17:16:27

xvmynt,Name and Shame: JPMorgan Chase [Glasgow],"Got a friend who worked there for a while and gave a detailed account of the place. This included:

* terrible management (bullying, backstabbing, gaslighting, no tech skills, only office politics)
* extremely old tech (Windows 7 VM which lags, very buggy internal tools, Skype, Python 2, etc.)
* waterfall methodology (but pretending to do Agile)
* unrelated training (you join as a SWE, but the training is on anti money laundering etc.)
* almost zero onboarding (expected to work on a ticket the very first week - imagine the codebase)
* stack ranking team members (although calling it differently to avoid bad PR)
* BS yearly review where investment bankers have a say in your grade without knowing any tech
* zero career guidance or development plan from the management
* subtle discrimination of minorities and women
* huge turnover of staff

He did say that the place offered a competitive salary, especially for Glasgow CoL.

I used to think of Wall Street banks as workplaces that might be a bit behind the curve, favouring stability over fast adoption, not the most flashy etc. But I still expected them to be good places to work, with good earnings, some cutting edge tech (for example in algo trading), professional, stable, and overall desirable places to work.

Now when I see my friends who migrated to the US or who stayed back in India - they are all able to retire early and live comfortably in India with big mansions and all the help. Here I'm slogging day in and out and feeling frustrated that I can't even afford an apartment in India. I can't make a single payment to clear and purchase an apartment. Whereas friends in the US have multiple rental properties across the world and have a net worth of several million. Even friends in India who were working in FAANG are able to purchase villas in single payments. The irony here is they are all single-income families and here we both are earning and feeling like living paycheck to paycheck. I don't think I can retire to India in another 10-15 years.

The cherry on the cake is all or most Indians are able to reach top-level positions in the US or India but here in the EU, it's a big struggle to get even promoted to middle-level or first-level management positions. There is a lot of subtle racism, discrimination, lack of trust in immigrants, poor salaries, and worst of all most European companies do not offer stock options to create wealth.

It's all frustrating to think that I wasted 15 years of my youth and health in a land where I still live paycheck to paycheck. Please share your opinions or thoughts on this if others feel the same. I'm just venting out here. Maybe looking for opinions on how or where to structure my career in the next 10-15 years.

os2p4f,Why are salaries still so depressed in so many regions (compared to tech hotspots and the US) even though I keep hearing of talent shortage?,"I honestly don't understand this. Isn't supply and demand a thing? I keep hearing of developer shortage, keep getting spammed by recruiters, keep seeing the same jobs remaining unfilled for several months, and yet the salaries on offer don't seem to be raising at all to entice people to move jobs.

I'd understand if this was because the salaries hit a ceiling of what value a single developer can provide. But that clearly isn't the case. I live in Scotland now and have junior friends down South who make +£15k more than me in comparable companies. Most of the Scottish tech companies have all-UK or even global markets, so revenue (and thus indirectly value per developer) shouldn't be affected by them being located here. Why then the refusal to let salaries increase?

I get it that the costs of living are slightly lower up here but that's not a reason to justify offering disproportionately lower salaries and then crying that developers are running away to England.

Years of Experience: 3 YoE, mostly backend

Country: some Middle-eastern country

College: no-name college in my home country

Major: Electrical Engineering

These interviews happened April-October 2023. All the interviews are for mid-level Software/Backend engineer positions. and they're listed in chronological order.

I've categorized companies into 3 categories:

<200 employees = small-size

200-1000 employees = medium-size

\>1000 employees = big-size

* Location: Germany
* Profile: Medium-size German Company
* Interview:
   * 30-minute introduction about my motivation and past experiences
   * 1-hour behavioral interview
   * 1-hour Technical interview: LeetCode problem + General tech knowledge questions
* Result: Got an offer for 60k EUR gross. Rejected the offer.

**Company #2**  


* Location: The Netherlands
* Profile: big-size Dutch company
* Interview:

   * 2-hour online test
   * 1-hour leetcode-style interview
   * 1-hour system design and general tech knowledge interview
   * 30-minute behavioral interview
* Result: Didn't pass. The recruiter told me before that the pay range for this role is \~110k EUR

(I was very sad because of this rejection, the recruiter didn't give me any negative feedback, they told me I was really good but blamed the tough market and that there are A LOT of good candidates they've interviewed and decided to go with other people. I felt really devastated after this one because I thought I did extremely well, but the journey goes on...)

**Company #3**

* Location: Germany
* Profile: Small-size German company
* Interview:
   * 30-minute introduction call

**Main Takeaways**

* Yes, The market is kind of worse than last year. but there are still open roles and companies willing to offer positions out there.
* I've only mentioned the companies where I've completed the whole process in this post. there are HUNDREDS of automated rejections in my mailbox. and many more companies where I was rejected early in the process.
* My main approach was to apply to 15-20 positions every day. None of these interviews came from any referrals. It feels VERY DEVASTATING getting tons of rejections every day but job-hunting is a numbers game. If you're currently actively applying and you feel mentally exhausted you're not weak, this is a very normal feeling.
* Multiple times I feel so down and that there's no hope of getting any good offers. It's tough but stay hopeful as long as you're applying and studying.
* This post is not a humble-brag. but I'm hoping I'm helping the community by:
   * Sharing my personal experience.
   * Sharing the pay range for multiple positions from interviews I did.
   * Sharing resources that helped me prepare for interviews (next section)

**Resources**

* [This Is What A GOOD Resume Should Look Like](https://careercup.com/resume)
* Problem Solving interviews: LeetCode is your friend of course. I also really liked [interviews.school](https://interviews.school) and [grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) to help me understand which problems to focus on and to put a roadmap for me. You can also check [this repo](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) if your Data Structures/Algorithm knowledge isn't good enough to start solving or needs refreshing.
* System Design Interviews:
   * Designing Data-Intensive Applications book by Martin Kleppmann
   * System Design Interview book by Alex Xu
* General tech knowledge interviews: This part is more tricky, I usually get questions about databases, REST APIs, basics of System Design, Networking, OOP principles and concepts. so there's no one resource to prepare from. If you already have good knowledge about these concepts then you won't even need to prepare for this part as it's entirely just knowledge-based.  
but I'll mention some resources I liked:
   * Head-First Design Patterns (Book)
   * Cloud-Native Java (Book) (Replace this with the stack/language you're interested in)
   * [Relational Databases and SQL](https://www.edx.org/learn/relational-databases/stanford-university-databases-relational-databases-and-sql)
   * [Advanced Topics in SQL](https://www.edx.org/learn/sql/stanford-university-databases-advanced-topics-in-sql)
   * [Databases Modeling and theory](https://www.edx.org/learn/databases/stanford-university-databases-modeling-and-theory)
   * Computer Networking A Top-Down approach (Book)
* Behavioral Interviews: Make sure to prepare your stories, and definitely read ""Cracking The Behavioral Interview"" This small book is amazing and I'm not sure why not a lot of people know about it.
* Obviously, these resources are very backend-focused. so if your experience is frontend/mobile application/embedded systems or something else. And you're applying to these roles you'll need to study some different things.

I hope this post can be helpful to some people out there.",2023-11-24 18:24:56

1avimlo,UK - Got a mid level .NET job fairly fast,"Hey, I just wanted to create a post to hopefully help anyone feeling down. I was made redundant at the start of the year. I've got 3 years experience, and in those years I didn't do anything significant really, we were a start-up consultancy, so lot's of minimum viable products, as well as working on the METAVERSE (oh god) for someone for a while. Just learning the ropes, becoming a good engineer, primarily using .NET C#.

I just got a new job after 6 weeks. Fully remote in the UK, market rate salary, nice medium sized company, I'm very happy.

I think I sent about \~150 applications out, I used LinkedIn primarily. I got 6 interviews, 3 tech tests, one third stage interview, one offer which I took straight away, it's the one I wanted. COUNTLESS phone calls with recruiters that went nowhere, my data must now live on 1000 servers across LinkedIn. So much recruiter ghosting, so many fake jobs (NOIR being the worst), almost every role asking for some kind of front end experience.

The thing that really boosted my success was tinkering with my CV until I feel like I cracked the code. At first, I had a 2 page CV which was a generic 'Software Engineer', because I have good experience with Flutter and mobile dev, as well as interests in Elixir, some tiny projects in NextJS etc. My work summary was wordy, almost like a story.

I trimmed it down to one page, bullet points for my experience, put keywords in bold. Removed everything that wasn't .NET related, put that in a little Skills summary section at the bottom, so my 3 years of Flutter experience was now just 'Flutter' in a list. Changed my title to '.NET Developer' on my CV and LinkedIn, though technically my job title was 'Software Engineer'. And the week I started sending applications with this CV was the week I was getting immediate interest, I had 4 interviews in the first week.

The first tech test was a red flag to me. It was one of those that you have to have a webcam recording and screen sharing, timed. First question was a tricky 30 minute Leetcode style question which I failed because I don't do that stuff. Didn't go further with that job. The next 2 were great, no time limit, building a small project. One was basically a Bitly clone using .NET MVC, and the other was building a .NET API POST endpoint. Super simple. The company I went with didn't even do an interview after the API test, they just hired me 1 week after getting the phone call introducing the job.

Got the job without doing any Leetcode stuff! I'm so annoyed for working on that stuff for 2 weeks. Honestly I have no interest in working for FAANG so if any company demands me to know how to implement AVL trees or do a breadth first search on a binary tree I'm just rejecting the job.

&#x200B;

So there is hope out there!! I was fully expecting months of no work. The market is so bad right now, but there were new jobs being posted all the time. I feel like here in the UK and EU it's so easy to hear about the US market and assume the exact same thing is happening here but I don't think that's always the case. I'm so thankful for our stronger employee protections. Personally I'm really happy, it's the first time I've looked for a job after having prior experience in the industry and now I feel safe going forward that I can find a job. I'm earning more than anyone in my family ever has which is great, I can finally start giving back to them. I was hugely underpaid in my previous role, this job is paying 50% more than my previous salary which is just crazy to me.

Good luck to those of you looking for a job! You got this. I'm happy to answer questions if you've got them, send me a DM or whatever and I'll try and help.",2024-02-20 14:14:51

gohufb,How much do you need to earn in German/Austrian cities to adjust for rents? I ran the numbers,"# Data sources

I exclusively use data from numbeo for this because they have the biggest data set

- [average net salary](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/region_prices_by_city?itemId=105&region=155&displayCurrency=EUR)
- [rents 1 bedroom](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/region_prices_by_city?itemId=26&region=155&displayCurrency=EUR)
- [rents 3 bedroom](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/region_prices_by_city?itemId=28&region=155&displayCurrency=EUR)

Another great source on rent statistics is [this article](https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2019-11/mietpreise-steigerung-mietspiegel-wohnungsnot-gemeinden) from zeit.de which has a very cool interactive map. That level of web competence is unusual for a German company, so kudos here. You can see how Munich and the island of Sylt have become playgrounds for the rich. You will also notice East Germany is cheaper to rent. As is the Ruhrgebiet (which is essentially invisible on that map), but that is due to industrial decline and [declining population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Germany_by_population), not due to affordable housing policies.

Note that in Germany we typically give the total number of rooms rather than the total number of bedrooms as they do in America. So a ""3-Zimmer-Wohnung"" is usually around a 2 bedroom apartment, because you'd use the other room as a living room. To add even more complications, we do not know if the numbeo survey takers knew this.


# (Net income) - (rent 1 bedroom)

This is basically taking the claimed average net income per city and subtracting the average rent of a 1 bedroom apartment in that city. The 'Rent(1-3)' column has two values, left one for 1 bedroom, right one for 3 bedroom, which is roughly twice the cost of 1 bedroom in most cities.

      Value City                 Income Rent(1-3)

      1,010 Leipzig, Germany       1530  520-1000

Dresden is the big surprise here, seemingly having ""West-like"" incomes, even on par with Düsseldorf. I checked and they have pretty much identical tax rates in East Germany, even paying the Solidaritätszuschlag (special tax invested into propping up East Germany), so gross incomes must also be as high.

As expected, low-earning deindustrialized cities (Essen in Ruhrgebiet and Bremen) and East cities (Leipzig, Dresden, both in Saxony btw) and Austria (Graz, Linz, Vienna) are near the bottom because the rock-bottom rents really just reflect incomes below 2k.


# (Net income) - (rent 3 bedroom)

It's also important to consider 3 bedrooms because while you might be single now, you could meet someone and maybe even have children, and a 1 bedroom would definitely be inadequate for that.

        460 Munich, Germany        2730 1270-2270

Aachen is where I went to university, so I'm happy to see it at the top of the list (or rather: salty that I ever left). Perhaps demand for 3 bedrooms is low because the student population is looking for 1 bedrooms mainly. Aachen is the smallest city on that list which contributes to low rents. Numbeo probably only has enough data points for Aachen because a lot of young and tech-savy people live there. Sadly I wasn't able to make out a tech scene in Aachen, even with its large student population. Note that they mainly cluster in mechanical engineering and not computer science however.

Munich is dead last, stripping you bare so that you only have EUR 460 left for groceries, utilities, transport, technology, entertainment, saving and perhaps childcare.

The Big 4 of German cities (Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne) are all in the lower half. I personally prefer the atmosphere of a smaller town and being close to nature anyway.


# Rent-adjusted gross

So how much money should you ask for? For the following list I subtracted 40% in taxes, social security, etc. from gross (the effective ""keep rate"" for a 50k income is 61.6% and for a 60k income is 59.7% for a single (Steuerklasse 1) and should only minimally differ between different Bundesländer). Note that for a married person this would hover around 70% keep. I then subtracted 1 bedroom rents from net. I then inverted the whole formula to see how much gross you have to earn to have EUR 1,800 left after taxes and rent (so this does not include higher CoL in non-rent ways, such as higher cost for services). This is the result:

      Value City                 Income Rent(1-3)
     61,340 Munich, Germany        2730 1270-2270

     46,360 Essen, Germany         1820  520-1010

Of course, no employer in Munich is going to pay a junior 61k. German employers in general seem to add very little based on location, as is evident from the 'Income' column (Munich isn't even the highest-paying city in Germany). So one might think it's a good idea to avoid Munich (also: forget about ever buying property there, you need to be a millionaire for that), but sadly a lot of companies and especially tech companies think it's a good idea to locate in Munich. Home office is also nearly nonexistent in Germany (8% of workers), especially compared to countries like the Netherlands (32% of workers) ([source](https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.niederlaender-sind-vorreiter-home-office-ist-fuer-deutsche-kein-thema.cf39ecf1-32f7-4d6c-87e7-ee57d7838430.html)). Most companies I've spoken to want to avoid home office after Corona is over.

For reference, a German public sector job with no experience after university currently pays EUR 49,911 ([according to TV-L](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tv-l/west?id=tv-l-2020&g=E_13&s=1&f=&z=&zv=&r=&awz=&zulage=&kk=&kkz=&zkf=&stkl=)), and they are desperately looking for applicants. If I had a private and a public sector offer around the 50k level I would prefer the public sector job because it will be more relaxed, you don't have to bend over backwards for someone, you actually contribute to something meaningful rather than exploitative, and they actually need and value your skill.",2020-05-22 11:45:09
s9fhqc,Netherlands consultancy rant,"I have a CS degree from EU uni and 5 YoE.

Got approached by a recruiter for a consultancy position (for the name and shame: T[OPIC embedded systems](https://topic.nl/en)). Their [glassdoor rating is abysmal](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TOPIC-Reviews-E1019108.htm), but I still took it into consideration.

 The recruiter outright asks for my salary expectations and I honestly say that I expect 55-60k gross. Then their HR calls for an interview, where I repeat my expectations and add that they should not even come up with an offer <50k because then the 30% rule does not apply (or rather it becomes 8% rule).

I do technical interview with the company which has gone well and then after some time they start to negotiate an offer not directly with me, but through the recruiter. 

I comply and again reiterate that <50k is non-negotiable,since it is 2022 and inflation is 5%. Then we go back and forth for multiple phone calls and I ask the recruiter to stop calling me and schedule a call with the employer if they are interested in me, so we can discuss the issue.

Two hours after talking with the recruiter, another recruiter calls me from a hidden number (no word how he found my number), offering me the same position in the same company. I said that I am in contact with them and am sorry that somebody has beaten him to it. He proceeds to say that he has no incentive in continuing the call, but anyway would like to know my salary expectations for the position. Then goes on to teach me that 55k for 5YoE is above market rate and I am asking for a lot (again, this was a cold-call, he has no way of knowing my seniority level anyway). So it was them again, letting me know to lower my expectations. At this point, I knew that the glassdoor reviews were accurate.

We get to the final call with them and they offer 2700 monthly as base salary (with holiday allowance and various budgets included, barely 47k TC). The actual rulling percentage was 6%. I ask them why would they have spent my time on multiple phone calls, technical and HR interviews when they know before staring the process what my expectations are. I cant comprehend how and why they are willing to spend their time in vain like this. Seems like I dodged a bullet here, but the writing was on the wall when I read the reviews.

TLDR: Avoid TOPIC Engineering, consultancy trying to lowball you because no SW engineer should work for 2700gross monthly in a place where rents are 1200 for 1-bedroom cold apartment.",2022-01-21 17:06:08

v979hm,LC Grind won’t get you a Top Job,"I work at a Tier 1 Investment Bank, and recently I have had the opportunity to interview candidates alongside my colleagues. 

Look I know, interview preperation is cumbersome. However, it's necessary. Solving coding problems have been part of interviews for decades (so I'm told).

Anyway, it's abundantly clear that candidates are merely ""grinding Leetcode"" in their preperation for technical interviews. Look Leetcode is a useful tool that I've used before. However, we're getting candiates that have obviously memorised a set of solutions that they do not understand -- and when the question is slighlty modified or we ask them why they've done something ... they panic.

From an interviewer side we're not looking for you to dive right in and immediately code the optimal solution. We want a discussion. How do you try to firstly understand the problem? What initial approaches are you thinking of? We want to hear you evaluate different options. Yes an efficient solution is important but we want to see you reach that naturally -- and we're more than happy to give you pointers.

But we get so many people that barely communicate and try to write an optimal solution off the bat. (We also evaluate communication skills).

Want to prepare for technical interviews? Learn your DSA, and apply it. Understand how recurrsion actually works so you can apply it to any problem. DSA are tools. Communicate well.

It's not a binary pass or fail (at my firm anyway), we weigh up so many things.

I'd be going from a engineer role to dev. They are offering a lot more money and less work. It sounds so much less stressful. Also, the commute would be 20 mins walk instead of an hour on two tubes.

My current role consists of me being micromanaged and SUPER stressed. My team also shrank due to multiple redundancies and I'm being forced to work with an unrealistic workload. My boss doesn't care about my complaints.

I asked Apple if my final interview could be remote and they said no. So next week I'll have to come into their brand new Battersea office and meet with the final people. I haven't remotely met the final people so I'm a little nervous. They'll go over my CV and ask me more questions.

I'm trying to think of what questions I want to ask them. 

Has anyone else interviewed at Apple or a FAANG? What was it like? Any tips to help me ace the final round? I've no idea what the candidate pool is like.",2023-04-21 19:19:48

16p6f7j,Initial Interview Experience at Apple,"I figured I'd make a post about my initial interview at Apple, since I couldn't really find anything about the first round of interviews when I was doing my research. I interviewed for a position on the hardware team in Munich doing embedded systems stuff. 

The initial interview was online and took about an hour (45 minutes for the questions, 15 minute chit chat). There were no behavioral questions and the technical questions felt very cherry picked to my resume/experience. Like I reviewed the completely wrong things (data structures and algorithms) for the interview but all of the questions (signal processing and digital logic) were so... in my wheelhouse that I had no problem answering them. Additionally, the coding questions weren't your typical LeetCode ""Here's a prompt, start coding"" but rather smaller questions where we (me and the interviewer) walked through them together and the solutions were <10 lines of code. 

All in all, I would say that the interview was more of a ""Did you lie on your resume? Are you who you say you are?"" and less of an actual ""We're evaluating you for a job."" It was super chill and I did not need to be as stressed as I was. ",2023-09-22 10:11:10

noo3ob,How was it normalized to have personal projects?,"I know there is a lot of differences between software engineers and any other kind of job out there.

One of them, is that it's so normalized to have personal projects, different from whatever you do as a full time job. Be it freelance, training, adding to your github repo or just something you felt like working on.

I'm in no way attacking having personal projects, but I feel like it was way too normalized that if you do NOT have side projects then something is up... Especially since for some reason, recruiters as well, expect you to have something on your github (for some reason, it's not enough to prove your worth with your day job but that's a different discussion anyway)

k0rhw7,"I made it, I've got a job!","2 months ago me and my wife decided to move to Wien, Austria from Hungary. I started to looking for jobs in early October and today finally I've got a contract.

I have 3 years experience and in the past years I developed in C#,  C++, C++/CLI, Python and [VB.NET](https://VB.NET), but mostly in C# and that is also my favourite language. I sent my CV about 50-60 companies - most of them never responded and a few of them declined without interviewing (probably because I don't speak german or because I wasn't the perfect developer for them).

I've got an interview, where they declined me in the 2nd round (of 3), and there was another company who sent me a task after more than a month of my application - I sent back them mine a week ago, but there is still no respone (I sent my CV them in 8th of October).

I've got about 5-6 calls after sending my CV, but none of them told me anything since then (okay, probably 1 but I'm not sure).

Last week I've got an invitation to a company, but after realizing that it's a bit too far from me (1.5 hours to get there) I told them that I'm looking for companies which are more closer. A few days later I changed my mind and told them and they invited me a newer interview that was today. There was a test related to UDP/Networking - which I thought was a joke - comparing to other companies, thus it was quiet easy to do even thought I had no idea what is UDP (I mean I never worked with it). So after 10 minutes I told them that I'm ready - they asked me a modification that I made, so after another 20 minutes I told them again that I'm ready - they checked my software and invite me to the office and they said that they would be happy if I worked there.

I'm not a native english speaker and I wasn't sure that I misunderstood something or what, but they start to explain that my offer (salary) is quiet good depends on my experience and so on.

So I'll start on Monday.

Btw, I missed the train in the morning, and the next train went only 2 hours later so I got another random train just to get closer to the destination, but the ticket machine didn't want to accept my cash and surely I left my credit card at home - both credit cards -, so after I successfully bought the ticket but I nearly missed the newest train (again) - 'cause I spent too much time just to buy tickets - and I had to still figured out where the train is - but I got it at the last moment. After I got off from the train I installed Uber (I nearly didn't have enough mobile net - cause why not) and called a driver to get me to the company. The driver arrived with a black Mercedes Benz Vino - and randomly laughed as an insane - so I wasn't sure that he just kidnapped me or what - but as you know finally I got there.

So the traveling was harder then the test.

jblijy,"Rant about interviews, salaries, and more","I know these are hard times and I consider myself lucky for still having an income. A round of applause for the pandemic, recession, Brexit, and people who take off their masks to sneeze before I start to rant about serious issues. 

So yeah, f*ck the interview processes. Why do I have to go through 5 stages of interviews for a small company (my record is like 7, excluding the screening calls)? 

Why do I need to complete tests and quizzes that, although related to the actual work I’d be doing there, are just an opportunity to do unpaid work for their business problems. So that they can reject me, without any feedback except for “we found someone better”, and still keep the job ad half a year after the rejection. 

Not that they’d be paying anything more than peanuts. It’s still the fault of those who accept such a low income, isn’t it? It is, but when you’re young and excited about work, you accept under 30k in London because you’re gonna grow and survive somehow. 

I didn’t accept that and they brushed it off saying “ok, you’re too experienced...wanna interview for a higher position?” Uh, sure, here we go again. Months and months passed, rejected. “You’re not experienced enough.” F*ck you. At least provide honest feedback. At least admit you don’t wanna pay more.

Oh, but I did get offers too. Last time I got one, an employee (50+ years) messaged me on LinkedIn saying he was sorry I wouldn’t join their team but he would like to ask me out. I ignore him, he gets mad. HR calls and apologizes for the false rumour, I kindly decline the offer, imagining how I dodged a team of old incels who gossip like highschoolers.

People say we chose the right path, computer science is today’s oil, uh yeah, then why are Diversity Champions and Gender Consultants paid more than a someone with a PhD in STEM? Why do people who have no idea about production and development become Scrum Masters? 

If I ever have a kid and they come to me saying “Mommy I wanna be a Scrum Master”, I’ll disinherit them. 

Oh, and speaking of studies, profs who sit in their warm chairs and contributing to research papers only with their name while PhDs and postdocs struggle to get results and publish something: I don’t know how many of you are like that, but I was very unfortunate to meet a lot. We didn’t even expect you to change an old curriculum to something closer to the real world, we know you like not getting out of your comfort zone, but at least give some f*cks about the students who do well. Let them grow outside academia and don’t get triggered when they get real-world jobs. Or write bad recommendations out of frustration. 

I come from applied math, it was just like pure math but with profs who tell you to program their models because they couldn’t even type “Hello World!”. Which is fine, except they don’t understand the process and limitations, it was kinda like talking to the middle management at work. Perfect preparation for the industry.

I’ve been seeing a lot of people who worry, struggle, who have it much worse than me on this sub. I don’t know what encouraging words to say, but I wish you find a place and environment that appreciates you and values your work.

Obligatory sorry for the rant.",2020-10-15 11:08:41

1078zkf,Job markets for SWE in EU and US are very different," 

Hi,

We all know that the compensation level for Software Engineers in the US is around 2-3x the EU.  
The surprising thing is that the chances to get offers from your applications are the opposite.  
I read on reddit posts like ""I got 1 offer out of 100 applications"" and that this is the norm, not the exception.  
I thought if competition is low, the salaries should go up and vice versa. Seems to be not the case.

I live in Austria and my career application stats look like this:  
15 applications -> 15 interviews -> 14 offers  
Applications were during my whole career, most of them after 2 years of working experience.  
My compensation is high for Austria, and low for the US (80k $ TC) with 8 years of experience.  
I studied business informatics with an average grade and have 1 side project which earns around 2000 $ per month which I included on my CV.

l1viwa,Think twice before getting in touch with a recruitment company,"I'm looking to switch jobs so I figured it would be advantageous to finally reply to one of the recruitment companies in my LinkedIn message.

Right now I'm in the interviewing process with two companies - one where I've applied for a position, one where a third party recruiter talked me 'in'.

Here are some reasons why applying yourself is better:

* Recruiters tend to call you on the phone for just about everything. This might be personal, but I'm not a big fan of calling on the phone, especially if it's only to transfer little information like: ""the company was excited looking at your CV"". I think they have phone call quotas, and this can be mentally taxing if you're holding a job currently.
* When you apply for a position yourself, and for example you fail a technical interview, you can at least get some feedback about what went wrong. With a recruiter, you'll likely just hear ""they aren't interested""
* You don't know how a recruiter 'sells' you. Maybe they over/underestimate you, and this can mess up your chances in salary negotiations
* If you decide to decline an offer, you only have to 'disappoint' the company you're applying at. If there's a recruiter involved, you need to do it twice.

Google Munich:

Base Salary : 76,500 (Eur)

Bonus: 15%

Sign-On: 10,000 (Eur)

Equity: 70,000 (USD) (front-loaded, meaning it will vest at 33%, 33%, 22%, and 12% per year over 4 years)



Facebook London:

Salary: £60,000

Semi-Annual Bonus: targeted 10% of salary (plus individual and company multipliers)

Sign-On: £10,000 (upon joining Facebook)

Equity: $125,000 (USD) - (25% 25% 25% 25%)


The salary and bonus (with taxes accounted) are similar. However, the biggest difference is the Equity.

Any opinions? I feel like Google's is a bit low on the equity side.

j3fpc1,I will try to share a little bit I know about building a career on tech for earlier Juniors,"First, congratulations, you chose well. Tech is the place to be. The world gets more tech dependent at daily rates. Companies are always pushing the change from an analog world to the digital one aiming for an increase in human productivity where sometimes, a few of those projects, are able to discover whole new applications and become unicorns. I do worry a little bit that the education systems are not ready for the tech dependent world that we are creating, we should be teaching logic in preschool.

&#x200B;

I have 8 years of professional experience in embedded systems development, got Master on microelectronics, did graduate on a very weak University for US and EU standards and I am now joining a FAANG as software engineer.

&#x200B;

If you, like me, graduated not in a top university do not worry, you can make a very, very fruitful career as any MIT boy. The difference that people get when they graduate in top unis is a pretty good starter boost and the quality of mentorship they will get early in they career since they may be able to start as an intern to FANGS or other big techs. Their advantage only exists on the beginning of the career because every one of us are \_bound to learn\_ to the rest of our career lives. I will say it again: you need to learn throughout your daily activities ALL the time. And that is how you will build value up to the point you will compensate the lack of better training on the student days and then far beyond that.

&#x200B;

Technology is a very wide field and the more you have knowledge and experience more valuable you get. There is a huge difference between software written by seniors and juniors, your goal is to accumulate knowledge as soon as possible to get out of the junior stage, and this will be your first big salary bump. The learning will not stop after you know 3 or 4 languages and a bunch of frameworks that are key to your daily activities. The domain you work will require learning. If you are building an airplane you will have to learn the physics, the certification processes, etc. If you are doing an marketplace, you will need to learn transactions, user experience, and so on. You may be working in an early field like robotics, then you will be thinking novel ways of solving problems. And it is not only about language, frameworks and domain. Software architecture will be a recurring topic on your career, the question how to most effectively organize data in memory and code into modules to permit scale and change control over a complex codebase will offer you challenges on every project you work on. As you get comfortable with those items you will probably be no longer a Junior.

&#x200B;

There are many ways to learn, each person has its preferences. Mine is to read an introduction book on a topic that I am starting on and going straight hands-on.

&#x200B;

The career game is played in the free market. Your value as a professional is what they pay you. The market will try to pay you the least salary as possible but not so low that they cannot have you. This is how the dynamic of competition works. FAANG will pay the best salary because they want the best people, and because competition for good professionals is really severe, the salaries are HIGH. Sometimes startups will overcome a FAANG salary for a Senior engineer to lead a project full of juniors and intermediates. When that happens is because data shows that projects are successful in shorter time when there is a very experienced engineer that knows all about it (because they have done similar projects 3 or 4 times already), in opposition to having only people doing a project in a given field for their first time. It is my long term career goal to become that kind of senior, some company call them Principals or Staff.

&#x200B;

The growth throughout Jr, Experienced, Senior and Staff is only about experience and learning. Theory and hands-on.

&#x200B;

I know many of you are very anxious when leaving the university and joining the marketplace for the first time. My advice is to stick to fundamentals, and the fundamental is learning. Not only our trade, but how to approach the market.

&#x200B;

First, they say that to build a successful career you need to work hard and be lucky. Luck in this context means that landing a job is random, and it is, some people will land fast and other will take a while, there are way too many variables in play to try to model them, so we approximate it as a random system. And how do we engineers approach stochastic systems? Correct, we have to throw the dice many times. Persistence is KEY to land a nice job, all you need is one yes, and to get it you will hear a LOT of negatives. As humans we get demotivated when we receive a no, but hear my advice, do not let it put you down, stick to the fundamentals: this is random, so keep throwing your dice. if you feel down remember you are not human, you are an engineer (just kidding). I am Brazilian and you have no idea how much effort I had to put to find a job abroad that would provide me enough trust to move my family. Also, previously I have worked as a remote robotics engineer, and that was extraordinarily hard to land.

&#x200B;

A job offer requires a match, like a tinder match, but 1000x more selective. The match is composed of knowledge (incl. experience) and profile. The company expect the candidate to break a minimal barrier of knowledge, therefore they apply tests, and also they expect a great profile fit, this is the hardest part as you get further away from the Junior stages. Because you did not match a given profile that doesn't mean you are not valuable. There are so many different profiles that different companies look for, when you are rejected because profile didn't match, do not feel you are not good enough, profile is not comparable, it is style, none is better than the other. I have heard once ""You are too dynamic for us, our style of working is boring, you will feel bored here, we will not make you an offer"" (it was from auto manufacturer). That was quite important to make me realize I had to be smarter about the places I was applying.

&#x200B;

Also profile changes as we grow.

&#x200B;

Google and Amazon have a nice description of the profile they are looking for:

[https://www.realtimeperformance.com/the-8-most-important-qualities-of-leadership-at-google/](https://www.realtimeperformance.com/the-8-most-important-qualities-of-leadership-at-google/)

[https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)

&#x200B;

Try to find the those principles for the company you are applying, if they don't have it explicitly, send them an email asking ""what is the profile you are looking for? How do you expect your engineers to work in the project? You prefere hands-on or more paper working engineers? etc"". If it is too far off from what you like, do not apply, and when you do, tune your sales pitch toward it, but avoid going in the dark for the interviews.

&#x200B;

Now remember, you work in a team. You gotta get well along teams and people. If you are shy and introspective, do not worry, those people you will be interacting with are similar to you, have similar backgrounds and went through the same experiences that you did and will, they will like to talk about the same things that you do. Try overcoming your shyness on the matters of engineering, everyone of us started very ignorant and learned our way through, and probably most of us are eager to help less experienced people, so, ask questions and you will quickly find a mentor.

&#x200B;

Working in a team means sharing work load, if you don't literally get stuff done other will have to do for you, that is when you will get low feedback. If you take the weight off the other team member shoulders you will receive good feedback. You are not expected to know what to do if you are in the early phase of your career, but you are expected to ask questions and try to take ownership of whatever you believe you can. Failing is fine, as long you fail quickly and don't hide, but ask for help. If you are a Jr and show learning capability people will trust quickly, and hand you more challenging tasks. Trust is key to build exceptional teams to work with.

&#x200B;

Now I will share a one profile item I value, you may disagree: Work with data. Do not trust your intuition as ground truth, use it as a source to ask the smart questions and collect data. With data collected you can make good decisions that are the ground truth. There's no space for opinion in systems, only data. If you work in a data driven manner early in you career I believe faster you will grow. Also data is the ONLY way to make a good decision when you have engineers with different opinions on a subject.

&#x200B;

Use the 5 whys technique to debug systems, as the Lean Manufacturing at Toyota recommends. When something don't work, try understanding why, and then why again, until you get to the fundamental, and then unit test the whole thing until the top.

&#x200B;

My point about salary: Most significant salary boosts will be in steps trough promotions or offers outside the company. While you work you will be learning and making career decisions toward what you like and what you believe will pay well. Try to balance joy and money here, if you either lack joy or money, you will feel miserable. Collect data from both the market and within your organization to assist where you want to focus your development, and develop BEFORE you get the title (THIS IS KEY). Promotion doesn't happen because they believe you CAN BECOME a given profile, but because you already are. So become the profile that will match with the role and promotion you expect. If you want to become project manager, start managing project from wherever you are. If you want to become space engineer, start making enthusiast rockets now. The youtuber Bernard from BPS wanted to be an space engineer, he applied and was rejected, then he stated his youtube channel registering his learning toward rocketry and later he got the offer to join the field, which he refused because he was happy building his youtube channel. Including, there are roles that are literally learning to be roles, like internships or trainee programs. The rules apply, understand what are the profiles they are looking for and adjust your approach.

&#x200B;

So, the dynamics are: you get a promotion or relocation, you do what you are expected to do from day zero while you start learning the trade for your next promotion or relocation. On each jump your salary should bump, as long the macroeconomics of the field are positive (which usually always are in tech).

&#x200B;

In an interview, they will not want to hear promises, they will want to hear stories of your past that sustain a given behavior or profile. They will want to know how did you accomplis something, how did you learn something, which methodology did you use to solve a problem, etc. Get those stories ready for the interview already matching the profile they are looking for. This will boost your chances of being hired.

If you come to an interview and say: "" last semester I asked my professor for a project to work on, I worked on it and finished last week, it was a project doing X Y Z"" you will show proof you can be trusted to take ownership. That is what the hiring manager is looking for, proof. Even if X Y Z are not that related to what the job descriptions is, the ""I asked my professor"" and ""I finished"" are the keys. It was a story similar to that that I was fed back as the major point I was offered a job at a FAANG.

&#x200B;

How to land your first job: you need to show stuff in the terms of the profile explanations I made above. If you discover you lack stories to tell in an interview, go out and build some. Start open source projects. Go ambitious with your final university project, ask for professors to give you some stuff to work in your free time. Join a group of students in a project. Participate in coding challenges. Join a research team and publish something. Do not let yourself only finish the university without those stories to add to your CV, but if that is too late, then try making opensource project while you are looking for jobs.

&#x200B;

Now my last point is about CV building: Try making your CV to reflect bigger and bigger challenges as you jump over roles. Do not let yourself get too comfortable, push yourself always toward harder challenges. I know it is hard and require a lot of work, but this is how you will get to the big figures later in your career.",2020-10-01 19:42:18

ukbn00,Colleague (F30+) snitched on me (M26) on my 3rd week at new job. Should I look for another job so soon?,"Sorry if I am posting this here, but I was not sure where else to share it. I tried on relationship\_advice but it didn't get much traction there.

 I am an expat from an European country that moved to another European country around 5 years ago for work reasons. This is not my first job in this country, and I have worked in 2 other companies, and something like this never happened before to me. Honestly I am still shocked and in disbelief.

3 weeks ago I started a new job at a new company with great benefits and compensation, and where people seem really nice and relaxed.

Except yesterday, on my 3rd week on the job, just 20 minutes after I got in the office, my direct colleague turns to me and tells me that she will report the fact that I’ve been arriving late to the office to our manager. Now this is where it gets interesting: nowhere in the contract is mentioned that I should come in the office before 9, but it says that the working hours are based on a floating scheme (arrive early, leave early - arrive late, leave late). Before this happened, I would be in the office sometime at around 9:05, sometimes at 8:55, even 8:30, other times at 9:10. Except the 2 days before whole of this happened, and I arrived at 9:30 and 9:20.

On top of that, she never bothered once to just turn to me and say: hey mr\_walter\_f\_white, here we need to make sure to get in the office before 9. That would have been enough for me.

I tried to explain her that honestly I didn’t know, it wasn’t mentioned in the contract, and nobody told me anything. She wouldn’t listen to any of my reasons, and she told me that it was my responsibility to ask (which I can understand, but how difficult is it to just tell me beforehand?). So she went ahead and reported it to our manager.

Luckily our manager understood that it was indeed an honest mistake from my side, and that now that is was made aware, I should try to come at the office earlier.

Now the problem is that we both work closely together, and we are in a room just the 2 of us, and our manager is based overseas. I am honestly scared at what else she might come up with in the future that could get me fired. And even if I don’t get fired, I still have to work closely with this person. Now I feel like she’s watching my every move, and waiting for another opportunity to screw me over. Like I said before, this has never happened to me in 5 years of working in other companies, one with a floating scheme and one with floating scheme and core hours between 9am and 3pm.

My question to you dear redditors is: what should I do? I was thinking to start looking for another job already, just to be safe, but I left my previous company after just about 1 year, and companies might flag my profile as a job hopper. Any advice?

TLDR: direct colleague snitched on me to our manager on my 3rd week at new job, and now I don’t know what to do.",2022-05-07 11:49:26

w0kpml,Aren't EU salaries are too low compared to Eastern European?,"**All numbers are AFTER taxes for ease of comparison**

I'm a Python dev(backend) with 1 year of work experience with no CS degree (but Master's in another engineering sphere if it matters)

After couple of months of applying and interviews, I can expect $2k/mo net salary in Belarus or $3k/mo in Russia at middle SW engineer positions. I know salaries where even higher than that in Ukraine pre war, I was planning to relocate there...

When I ask Polish companies for $2.5k/mo NET they are trying to bring it down to $2k

**Like what the hell?** You want me to earn the **same** when rent is like 3x more?! And in Germany rent is again double from Polish.

It gets even worse for senior positions, typical[I guess] $5k NET ($10k gross) for senior in EU is just middle class, while typical $5k ($6k gross) in Eastern Europe make you the damn 0.1%, it is like 10x more than what doctors, engineers and professors earn. You can literally build a mansion and hire maids for your family lol. And no, healthcare and universities are free here too, typical PTO is 25 days. 

To account for cost of living EU devs should be earning $7-10k net.


So is it just me, or EU devs are fucked up? Or EU companies actually DO pay $10k net/month to seniors (3-5 years) and $3-4k to middle (1-2 years) devs?

onb3y9,My interview experience for a Senior position in Berlin,"Hi everyone! Spoke to the mods about this and cleared that it's ok to post as text here, originally wrote it on my blog.

[Graph of my interviewing numbers](https://arbeitnow.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/07/sankeymatic_3000x1200--1-.png)

----

### A brief introduction

I have been programming since 2012, primarily in PHP, Javascript, MySQL. I did an internship and worked full-time for a year or so as a Business Intelligence consultant in India and figured out that it wasn't for me.

I got back to development, worked remotely for a year as a Software Engineer for MODLR - where I learned a lot. When an opportunity came to move to Berlin as a Backend Developer, I took it  (required only English for the job). In April 2021, I decided to look for a new challenge in Berlin.

### Interviewing Numbers

Six applications over the course of 3 weeks in Berlin for a Senior Software Engineer role

The numbers above are over three weeks. In 2018, it was difficult to get a call back for interviews. Either the resume got filtered out, or companies did not want to assist with relocation and visa sponsorship.

In 2021, all the companies that I applied were remote friendly, required only English and no German, as is the case for most tech roles in Berlin.

Usual Tech Interview Process for full-time software jobs in Germany

1.  Send an application
2.  Screening call with a Recruiter (sometimes a small automated code challenge, but I didn't receive any)
3.  Technical call
4.  Take home or coding challenge
5.  Review from Step 4 / call with the team I would be joining
6.  Offer

### Stage one

Picked out six interesting companies (small to mid-ranged sized) in Berlin, looked them up on Linkedin or [Kununu](https://kununu.com/), checked their own careers page, and applied. The only one that didn't get back was for the application via Linkedin - most likely lost in a sea of applicants.

### Stage two: 30-minute screen calls

Initial calls were either from an internal or external recruiter who worked for the company. Spoke about work experience, why I'm leaving my current job, why I'm keen on joining the company, what piques my interest in the job description, how flexible their remote (home-office) policy is.

We went through my resume & I got to ask questions about the company as well. At the end of the call, some companies asked for a joining date (3 months is generally acceptable) and a salary expectation.

Salary expectation is weirdly a common thing in interviews in Germany. Most Applicant Tracking Systems require an expected salary on the application form. I always fill it with 1€. If & when it is brought up at the end of the call, I politely refused to negotiate at that stage in the interview process.

### Stage three: Technical call

Usually a discussion over the things I have worked with, tools I have experience with and tools that I don't. A fairly relaxed conversation where we both got an overview of how we generally built & deliver software, how we handle when things go wrong, a little bit of high-level system design (no whiteboard, trivia, or grilling!)

Something that caught the attention of all technical calls was my [jobs board in Berlin](https://arbeitnow.com/). It was on the top of my resume and everyone opened it on their screens during the interview. Thankfully it didn't crash.

The conversation switched to how I built Arbeitnow, with a focus on

-   Frontend - What is it built on, if it could have been a Single Page Application using Vue.js or React, testing tools used (Shout-out to [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)!)
-   Backend - built on [Laravel](https://www.cypress.io/), powered by Elasticsearch, familiarity with Docker
-   Database design, tradeoffs, Redis Queues
-   If I have any AWS or Cloud experience, which I don't have a lot of - I was upfront about
-   CI/CD Pipelines and experience with Unit and Feature tests

All of the above felt like a conversation. Interviewers weren't looking for right or wrong answers. We discussed trade-offs, making changes to system design. I was able to get some ideas during the conversation so I can say this was productive. I went through all four technical rounds.

### Stage four: Take home or coding challenge

We're at the exciting part that programmers in Tech love to talk about (apart from their *disgust *for PHP). In 2018, I did several coding challenges and take-home projects which companies mention take a couple of hours.

They don't because companies (startups tend to do this more) want a fully functioning application with test suites and estimate it around two to six hours. Or trivia questions. Unpaid.

Earlier this year, I built a section for [companies that don't require Leetcode or Whiteboard Interviews](https://arbeitnow.com/hiring-without-whiteboard), so this was a no-go for me. Two companies waived the next round without asking (which was genuinely surprising and refreshing) and I refused to proceed further with two companies that insisted on sticking with the process.

If I didn't have a side project (or an equivalent), I'm not quite sure if this round would have been waived or not.

### Stage five: Review/Call with team

This round was initially supposed to be a review of the take-home or coding challenge. Since that round didn't happen, we spoke a bit more with a different engineer from the company. With one company, there was a casual chat with the team for 30 minutes.

### Stage six: Offer

HR called back within 2-4 days after the last call. We spoke about the €€€, the benefits (in detail), remote flexibility and a starting date. The entire process for all companies happened in 3 weeks and the company I accepted the offer for took around a week. Quick turnaround and feedback from all companies involved kept this a smooth process.

Funnily enough, the job offer that I accepted was one that I found on my job board. If I didn't use it, who else would - right?

ly16uj,I decided not to proceed with any interview process that has an LC (medium/hard) interview,"I tried to grind LC problems, I did good with a good portion of medium problems and most easy ones but it depended on the topic (so for example trees/graphs I'd perform much worse and I'd fail doing an easy problem while with other topics I'd solve medium ones)

I always hated this part of the interview but used to wish for the best and do it anyway

But recently (before I get hired back in Sept) I took the decision to stop applying/proceeding with companies that has an LC medium/hard step in their process

**Why? Well I have many reasons:**

* It is against my beliefs to examine someone with something they won't work with. I understand when I apply to FAANG they wanna check if I have a good understanding of Graphs because there is a good chance I will work with it, but if I'm applying for a pure backend position then please don't ask such questions.

* I want this company to hire me for what I'm good at. My strong points are not solving LC problems. You want someone good at it then I'm not your guy. But you want someone to build good backend with a good understanding on infrastructure, cloud, security... Then yes I will be happy to work for you

* The randomness... Everytime there is a LC problem part of the interview process you will end up usually with a couple of random problems... The company/interviewer tend not to care how they are selecting these problems, meaning you might get lucky and get easy stuff (or simply things you are more familiar with) or the other way around! Which make it less fair!

**What does this mean?**

It means I will never consider applying for FAANG and many other companies but I'm personally find with that. As mentioned in the beginning that I already got hired in Sept., and I had plenty of more companies to apply for. Yes the pool is smaller but it exists and it's not small exactly.

Also one more thing to add, now I don't need to keep grinding LC even when I'm not applying just so I can stay in the game, I don't have to waste my time AND the interviewer's time on interview process that doesn't fit my set of skills.

**tl;dr**

I no more apply to interviews that have LC problems as part of their interview process, it gave me more time and energy to focus on the remaining pool of companies that don't do this kind of process and it's working just fine for me",2021-03-05 01:53:47

mgagaj,My boss turned into a monster,"Well, not literally of course. I work at a small company with 7 developers for a few years now. At first it had a really relaxed culture and it was fun to work. About 1,5 year ago my boss got the idea that the company had to become big and ambitious. The work culture slowly changed from a relaxt culture to a fear culture, my boss changed, making mean comments to people for no reason, getting angry when people disagree with her decisions. Forcing us to work at office during Covid lockdowns, to write billable hours to customers we didn't actually make and to listen to her totally irrelevant personal stories. It also doesn't feel right to me how customers are treated while she expects us to tell customers that we are a company with integrity (we are not). She also seems to have a lot of distrust, we have to write down every 15 minutes of the day what we are doing. She also has weird fantasy ideas of expanding to countries like Japan while we know absolutely nothing about the language or culture of these countries.

Last year the company earned prices for the fastest growing and most profitable companies in this area. We have discussed the salaries among colleagues. They are generally low but when we ask for a raise we simple don't get it with excuses there is now money for it. Some colleagues are even afraid to ask for it. In the meanwhile she has bought a new house and a new sports car.

So I eventually had enough of it and decided to accept a new job. I still have a 2 month notice, of course she got pissed when I told her I got a new job (I'm working on the most profitable project). I wanted to keep things friendly so I didn't tell her the real reasons for leaving. But I hear from my colleagues that's she is now trying to make me look bad behind my back, this is causing a lot of stress for me. I still have the 2 month notice but I'm starting to feel burned out, I'm not sure if I can do it. How can I deal with this situation?",2021-03-30 07:30:32
lhshj6,I just did an 'onsite' for Amazon and there were no Leetcode-style questions?,"Today I did a virtual onsite for a software engineering intern position in Amazon. What suprised me is that there were no Leetcode-style questions. Nothing like ""get the nearest leaf in a binary search tree"". The questions were ""how would you program a tool/method/program that would do this"", and I had to write a rough draft of the code (not abstract pseudocode, but not 100% complete code either). Completely realistic questions that are about how well can you program ""more-or-less everyday"" things. The interview was actually much easier than I expected (I'm bad at LeetCode), but because it was so different from what I expected I was a bit unprepared and underperformed.

Has anyone had a similar experience? I'm just baffled because it's completely different from everything I have ever heard about Amazon interviews.",2021-02-11 19:29:29

lx2zul,I just got offered an interview at a FAANG but I’m awful at algorithms and data structures,"As a back story, im a dev with 5 years experience with positions at small businesses (<200 employees), I have never gone to uni and I have just never really had to use or even study algorithms properly, I just got invited to a technical phone screen interview at a FAANG. 

The interview is 5 weeks from now, is it possible to go from no knowledge of ADS to enough to pass the interview in 5 weeks.

Do I spend 5 weeks studying extremely hard every day (which I can definitely do as I’m self taught) or do I just email the recruiter back and say I don’t think I’m ready and maybe try again in another year or so. I’m just concerned that I might never get this opportunity again.

Honestly no clue about algorithms right now...

[EDIT 0] Don’t know why I didn’t include this originally tbh, but to make things more complicated, I’ve had actual job offers through for 2 other medium-large sized enterprises, so if I want to pursue the FAANG I will have to turn down 2 actual offers.

uriw8m,Rejected because of my lack of passion,"Feel a little down right now and just wanted to post what happened.

So just over a week ago I had an interview that went really well. The interviewer was impressed with my portfolio and even commented my answers demonstrate I have all the traits of a good junior developer. I then had a take home assignment to finish in two weeks. I was always going to finish well within the deadline given, however, I had a holiday literally that weekend so I couldn't find the time to properly sit down and work on the assignment.

Upon my return I immediately worked on the assignment and finished it. Granted I may have taken too long as I wanted the styling to be perfect and I even journalled my experience on the readme doc. However, after submitting my solution, their response was that they would not be progressing my application as the assignment was a short exercise that could be completed within a few hours. Someone who was eager to complete the exercise would find the time, and they felt I wasn't passionate enough for the role. I told the interviewer during our chat that I had a holiday and he said that wouldn't be a problem and I can take two weeks. I completely misread what he meant. If I could go back I would have completed the assignment straight after work that day.

I'm aware this is a lesson learnt but as it is still fresh (I only got the email last night) it stings a lot.

EDIT: Just want to say thank you to everyone and your encouragement and words of wisdom. I honestly wasn't expecting so many responses. It means a lot to someone who's just starting out and figuring how the culture within tech companies work.",2022-05-17 09:53:36
iyx0r9,I can't focus on my software dev job because I'm mentally tired,"I'm writing this out of despair. I'm working as a software developer, since February (I graduated last year).

The thing is I can't focus on my task. Hours pass and I barely make any progress. They're mentally-intense tasks. Programming things that are new to me, they require a lot of ""mental processing power"". We work remotely, every morning we do a daily meeting (*edit: group call) where we say what we did the day before and what we're doing today. This meeting is what I fear the most everyday because the progress I make from day to day is so small. I fear being fired or shamed for low productivity.

I'm mentally exhausted because:

* I'm working as a software dev (that is mentally tiring)
* I live alone and spend my time alone (that makes me lack of that ""social energy"" or ""social joy"", I don't know how it's called but it's that phenomenon that when you interact with others you feel better)
* I'm processing my childhood trauma (that is an intense mental process)

In order to fight this fatigue, I'm already doing physical exercise everyday, eating proteins, veggies and not carbs (*edit: okay it's not exactly 0 carbs, it's low carbs, I still eat Mexican tortillas every other day). I sleep good 8+ hours every night. I go out to exercise, take fresh air and get the sun. I've already been in therapy for 5 months and it has helped me with what I needed.

Everyday I'm using a lot of ""mental processing power"" but I'm not getting a proportional ""relief"" for all that effort. **This makes that everyday when I'm front of my computer to work, I'm exhausted and can't focus**.

I guess what I need the most is socializing, and I can do it, but it's not that easy. I know no one here, so I can't tell anyone to introduce me someone else. And with the coronavirus issue, it's hard to approach new people to meet. They're focusing so much on social distancing and masks (which I understand of course).",2020-09-24 13:13:15
v9lnj8,I've lost the ability to program after a brain injury - what now?+,"I've been programming for the last 14 years. 4 of those As part of a CS degree, and 3 as a junior developer. Roughly 12 months ago I suffered a [TBI (Link to wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury) on a bike accident (yes, I was wearing a helmet). I was hospitalized and lost the ability to memorize things for roughly a day.

Every programmer has good months and bad months. But over the last 12 months, a clear pattern has emerged that I just can't write software to the level of a professional developer anymore, and I wasn't the sharpest tool in the book beforehand.

Things that I would of been able to do in an hour take a day, and that which I would of been able to do in a day take a week. My coworkers are without doubt aware of this (manager isn't a software guy and I've only spoken to him once so not sure about his knowledge of all this).

But cutting to the chase, what now? Is there some kind of ""side-step"" I can make that'll mean my 3 years as a dev aren't completely wasted? Devs with 3 YoE aren't exactly rare.

p0csez,Full-Stack doesn't seem to be a good career investment anymore,"Something I have noticed over the past two years, which I think correlates to the increasing complexity of Frontend Development.

&#x200B;

I have noticed that besides smaller startups, companies do not really care/look for full stack developers and are mainly interested in specialists in React/Vue/Angular and Frontend tooling.

&#x200B;

I think that's understandable as it really takes so much time, outside of our working hours, to try and catch up with the constant changes/new libraries/new tooling/new architectures that have emerged over the past years.

&#x200B;

It seems to me that, besides obviously Node.js, it's less and less valuable learning another backend language for the purpose of being more employable, as full-stack positions are usually less common than specialist roles.

&#x200B;

I have been wanting to learn Python and Django for some time, but I feel that between Leet codes for interviews, day to day learning for my jobs (React, TypeScript, new building tools, new ES features, new architectures, etc), unless one code for 70 hours a week, it's pretty much impossible to be involved across the stack with new languages.

&#x200B;

And if we consider the trend of also adding native  (React Native, Flutter, Electron) it just seems less and less a good way to spend our time.",2021-08-08 11:10:08
10c2f1n,I'm a junior developer and I can barely pay my bills,"I work as a junior developer since July 2022 in Manchester, UK. I received an offer of £25000, which is like £1700/mth after tax. I accepted it thinking that money doesn't matter as long as I get more experience.
Last month I could barely pay my rent and bills out, and honestly I received more money at my previous job as a forklift driver.

I have several friends around Europe and even in Romania and Hungary they receive around 35000 euros as Junior Developers, where the costs of living is the fraction of the UK.

I'm wondering how long should I wait to ask for a raise? I spent so much time learning and studying to get into the field, and I planned to wait for a year, but now I feel like I can barely survive.

Do you have any recommendations? Is it appropriate to ask for a raise after a few months?

onl4dy,USA junior developer considering moving to France.,"As the title states, I'm a new developer (> 1-year experience) and I'm considering moving to France. This move isn't going to happen anytime soon, maybe like 2 years at the earliest, but it's something I'm very much considering. So if anyone could help me answer my questions/advice, I would be very grateful. 

# Questions:

- How difficult would it be for me to get a developer job in France?
    - ill be an EU citizen (more on that down below) and by the time I look at moving to France, I would have about 2 years of developer experience. 
- How are remote jobs for the EU?
    - like if I wanted to live in the French countryside but had a remote job in the UK?
- Would it be possible to have a remote job in the USA but just live in France?
    - I have no idea how this would affect any retirement plan in France/taxes/pay.
- Would my wife be able to come over with me and find a job?
    - She does speak some French right now and with her thinking about going to school could she just apply for a school visa? Or would me be being an EU citizen, this isn't too much of a problem? She is currently a hairstylist.
- Can people have a good life on minimum wage in France?
    - in case my wife can't get a job in hair, plus I'm also just really curious how minimum wage is over there compared to here. 
- How much french would I really need to know before getting a job?
    - yes i wouldn't mind learning the language but I'm just not sure how much of a roadblock this can be. 
- Do you think me moving away from the tech salary mecca of the world is dumb?
    - yes, this could be a case of ""the grass is greener on the other side"" but I feel like my issues are much more core than that. 

# Background
I recently graduated back in December with a CS degree. I am currently working my first developer job out of college (about 2 months right now). My wife is currently a hairstylist and is considering going back to school for some degree in biology (we are not sure as to what construction yet).

During a conversation with friends, it was bought to my attention that I could apply for Greek citizenship and by that, I would also be an EU citizen. My dad and grandparents are Greek so I could apply to show my lineage with them. My wife has no ties, so she would prob need to get some type of school visa.

# Why France?
Honestly, I think France is just cool. I like how the language sounds and the look of the French Riviera. While yes, I could prob make more money living in a Germany or Switzerland and probably get away with only speaking English. But the fact that I like France's vibe so much, it's going to help me get over some social hurdles of living outside the USA. Where if I lived in Germany, I don't think I would really care enough to give it a shot of fitting in and learning the language. Plus I really like wine and cheese, so that's a thing. 

# Why do I want to leave the USA?
I am coming to the realization in my life that I don't value the same things that Americans value. my dad would always say things like 'well that's just how the Americans do it I guess' and I never really thought about this much until the last year or 2 of my life. I don't like the way Americans do things, the things i value in life are not the same things Americans as a whole value. I am currently moving across the county right now too new england, which i think might help in this situation but I don't think its going to get to the root of the problem. What i value is probably not going to happen here in my lifetime. I value things like:

- good public transportation
- outdoor markets
- time off to spend with my wife / just watching the breeze
- going to a doctor 
    - I'm 30 and have only been to the doctor a handful of times in my life. it's too much $ and plus if they ever find anything i wouldn't be able to pay for it so why even go? This is not ok and i don't think American is ever going to get around to fixing this. 
- less fast food/shit processed food
- ability to travel. 
- a simple life, not a hustle self-made /'reach for the top' life.
- cobblestone / historic buildings

I often get told 'you know they are going to tax like 1/2 your income right?' and my answer is normally that i don't fucking cares. If a government wants to tax me that much but can provide all the things I listed above and then some to its citizens then cool? I'm tired of hearing about how my friends can only eat fast food because that's all they can afford or they have to take a car to the hospital because the ambulance ride is like 1,000$. Its not right and i dont think a lot of people here really think that way so I dont see it changing any time soon. It's very much an 'it's not happening to me my life is good' type of lifestyle here. 

yes, you could say ""well once you have a few year's EXP in America, none of the problems you have in American life will really affect you"". But that doesn't make it ok. Ya, I'm making 90k, and I'm out of the lower class of the American lifestyle but i don't want to be a part of a system that supports that life I had to everyone else because they didn't get lucky and made it out. 

my wife asked me awhile back, 'do you even have a lifestyle where you need 100k+'. and the answer is no. All i want is to be able to walk to a baker and get some fresh bread, take time off to spend with my wife, go to the doctor and not worry that ill have to make a decision of 'can I afford this treatment or not, Have some type of retirement plan so when im old i can still live, and buy a raspberry pi sometimes. I feel like Europe can offer me that life right now, where American might one day but who knows.",2021-07-19 19:20:41

pijh1l,How do you separate life and work in 100% remote job?,"I recently quit my last job because of burn out, and I started my new job for several weeks now.

What hits me really hard is that I struggled to ""turn off"" my brain for work-related stuff after work hours. Which burnt me out on the last job. I always think about work stuff, especially stuff that I could not solve within the workday. Even worse if it was a nontechnical stuff like conflict with colleague, communication, etc. which I was not trained in.

It was much easier to keep work at workplace before covid. Much harder after covid. It came to a point where I got panic attacks every time I see the door of my home office on weekends.

Now with the new remote job, I signed up for a gym, and went 3 times a week after work, to ""mark"" the end of work, to tell myself workday is done. And on the days without gym, I try to have a walk directly after work without seeing my family first. You know, a clear separation between work and life.

How do you guys handle this stuff? Or is it even a problem for you?

Appreciate your comments on this.",2021-09-05 19:23:58
hujs4v,How is it even possible to survive in EU?,"I was super excited about moving to EU after graduating in CS. But I'm looking at the numbers and it seems completely unreasonable to live in most European countries. I really hope I'm missing a zero somewhere or forgetting to add something, cause otherwise this EU dream is much harsher than I'd hoped.

Let's say, for example, that I wanna live in France. Average SWE salary is 40k euro. That's 24k after taxes. So 2k euro per month. But that would mean working in a more modern city with an IT field, so let's say Paris. Google says the CoL in Paris is 960 euro, let's say 1k to have some extra flexibility. With the remaining 1k I can barely afford a shitty 30 sqm 1-bedroom apartment. Maybe a slightly bigger one further away from the city center.

So I'm working a stressful full time job in, supposedly, one of the best fields currently, after years of study, to barely be able to afford a little studio and save 0 euro a month? While americans are easily making six figures? I don't really get it, I must be missing something. How does anyone survive in EU then, especially those working lower-paying jobs? How does one ever afford a nice house?? Is that just not a thing in EU, does everyone live off of rent in ultra small apartments?

I chose France cause it seemed to represent the European average in CS. I was personally excited about Italy, but the salary would then be 30k euro (!). Germany has higher salaries, so maybe it's not that bad. Switzerland is not part of the European Union, so I can't even work there without all the visa stuff. And then there are the dozens of countries that seem to be even lower-paying then France. Did I get the wrong idea and living in Europe is more of a millionaire thing? My math just doesn't add up to a livable life.

Please let me know if I'm making any wrong assumptions or missing any details. I always had the idea everyone had it great in EU, living with great quality of life as long as you're working any job at all... But maybe it's the other way around entirely. Please shed me some light. Thanks in advance!

Edit: Used Payscale and Numbeo to get those numbers.

Edit 2: People corrected me on the tax calculation and the fact that 40k is the average in France as a whole, not Paris specifically. If we calculate tax properly and consider the salary in Paris to be 45k, we get to 33k a year, not 24k. That's a huge difference. That leaves us at around 1k extra savings per month. I guess its a matter of accepting that you'll live in a cramped apartment for the  most part. If we peak at, say, 60k, we can actually afford a pretty nice apartment, and maybe save enough money for a mortgage at some point?",2020-07-20 11:40:57

g2hlh1,"Is FAANG really the only way to get a combo of high pay, good experience, healthy work-life balance and job security these days?","So I am in my 20s, based in London and have been in the industry for 5 years now, first as a software engineer and later - after completing my Masters - as a data scientist. Never had a full-time job at FAANG, partially because I'm not that good at reversing binary trees on a whiteboard (had a summer internship at Google but failed the conversion interviews), partially because I never really saw getting there as my goal and haven't interviewed with any of the big companies since then.

Now, I always had this idea that at start ups, there is this trade-off that your work-life balance might be not as good - but you are much better off in terms of getting interesting experience, having more personal growth and flexibility, as well as often more money.

My personal experience so far, however, has been kinda frustrating and I can't help but feel like FAANG is superior in every single way:

* **Getting good experience:** this has really been the biggest pain for me as a data scientist. Most people I met had no idea what data science is and expected me to work on ETL pipelines and dashboards, completely ignoring my desire to get better at Machine Learning and predictive modelling. At my last company, I ended up changing the team trying to get more relevant DS experience but in the end it turned out to be even worse (even though the team lead promised otherwise). As a result I am in this kinda weird situation when with my YOE I'm expected to be at the mid-senior level, but to be honest, I don't feel that my ML skills are much better than that of a junior. Don't think this could ever happen at Google or Facebook.
* **Personal growth:** there's been little to no mentorship at my previous company, just when I needed it the most when I was still fairly junior. My impression is that at start ups people are just too busy firefighting to actually invest their time in mentoring junior colleagues.
* **Flexibility:** if there is any flexibility then it is that sort of flexibility with which the CEO at my last job could ping me on evenings and weekends. When I tried moving to a different team, it took me 10 (TEN) months to finally finish this move (the company keeps lying to people in interviews that it is easy to do so).
* **Salaries:** to be fair, I think my salary progression so far has been better than what I would have at FAANG. But given how low my starting salary was as a fresh grad I'm still lagging behind my FAANG friends in terms of saving money (which means that they will sooner be able to buy a house, have a family etc.).
* **Sign-on bonuses:** none of the smaller companies I've had offers from over the past few years (even those with 1000+ people) offered cash bonuses. You can get something like £25k in share options, but the more I learn about these share option schemes the more they seem like a scam to me (the 4-year vesting period in particular is a joke). My friend with the same YOE as me just got an offer at FAANG and got a £15k sign-on bonus in CASH which seems ridiculously high (again that's the difference between this guy buying his first house later this year and me MAYBE getting rich in 4 years when the options fully vest and if the company doesn't blow up like my previous ones did).
* **Performance bonuses:** I basically never had any performance bonuses despite being promised so and having good performance reviews. It just turned out that none of the start ups I was working for had sustainable business models and all ended up being sinking ships.
* **Job security:** the current COVID crisis says it all really. Everyone at my current company is suffering pay cuts and / or furloughs, but I keep seeing ads from Facebook Recruitmens saying that they still want to hire 1000 more staff in London this year.

It feels a bit like I've reached my ""fuck it"" moment and that I should just start spending all my free time on LeetCode practicing binary trees reversals to finally land a job at FAANG. So I am really just looking for opinions here. Is there indeed such a big gap in the quality of life of the FAANG people compared to everyone else? Or does anyone have any good stories about working for a small company where they would still feel safe, get a decent pay and good experience, and have time for their hobbies and families?

**TL;DR:** Spent the first few years of my CS career at smaller companies and can't help but feel inferior to my peers who have been enjoying their time at FAANG. This makes me think I made a bad mistake by not following the same path. The risks just don't seem worth it and this COVID crisis is kinda the last straw",2020-04-16 15:57:33

ohgu0u,"Working as a developer at large, slower-moving international companies has its benefits, why don't more devs consider this type of work?","I've been a software consultant for the last 12 years right after university. The consulting firm I have worked for mainly sells contracts to very large international companies (10.000+ employees scattered across the world) in a wide variety of industries. These companies are very slow moving and often use outdated tools and technologies, but the job security is usually good and the workload is extremely low. In fact, a lot of the time the workload is so low that there are people who have been consulting at these companies for years that have multiple days per week that they do not do anything, but they still get paid a full-time salary.

These companies usually also have some fully-employed devs that aren't consultants, and these guys do even less work than the consultants. The company I am currently contracted with has over 50k employees based in over 30 countries around the world and I have worked here for about 3 years now. I'm based in the Nordic region, and in this office there are entire teams where most people aren't doing anything. There is a team located on the same floor where I have my office and out of the ~15 developers on that team, only 2-3 of the younger engineers actually do work. The others are mainly older and have kids and pretend to do work from home, but going through their commit histories some of them haven't committed any code in over 6 months. Any time they do actually get something done its just to have a commit history, but the work is meaningless and it is just to get their name in on the story alongside someone who actually did the work.

Now, despite there being quite good job security, the downside is that the pay is average. You won't be making FAANG salaries here. However, having a super low workload and often days where you don't need to work makes up for it. You have a ton of time you can spend with your family, or you can just work as a free-lancer to make extra pay. One of the other consultants I work with also works as a freelance graphical designer since he is single and doesn't have a family obligation. Another one works in his family bakery most of the time when he ""works from home"" so he can help out with stuff over there on his off-time (which is most of the time).

Why do people not consider careers at companies like this, either as a consultant or as a fully employed developer? Sure, you are not making FAANG salaries, but obviously not everyone is going to be fit enough to work at a FAANG company in the first place. These companies offer very good work-life balance and with the right negotiation skills you can still make a good salary and live a very good life. Pension plans are still standard, as are benefits, and if you ever want more of a challenge you can always job hop if you want to. But for people in their mid 30s and older looking to start a family and have more free time these companies are great in my opinion.",2021-07-10 11:14:48

 I would also love German developers to review my post to tell me if I'm wrong about something, since I don't actually have first hand experience in the German market (I'm an Italian interested in moving out, at the moment).

According to glassdoor, a [""junior software engineer""](https://www.glassdoor.it/Stipendi/milano-junior-software-engineer-stipendio-SRCH_IL.0,6_IM1058_KO7,31.htm) in Milan earns 27.7K gross per year.  A [""junior software developer""](https://www.glassdoor.it/Stipendi/milano-junior-software-developer-stipendio-SRCH_IL.0,6_IM1058_KO7,32.htm) just 23.2K. While this doesn't give us any information about specific skills or degree types, it gives us an idea on how much can a junior make.

For a typical single person without kids, these gross figures correspond to

* 27.7K => about 1520 euro net per month (x13)
* 23.2K => about 1300 euro net per month (x13)

If we look at official data from universities ([here](https://www2.almalaurea.it/cgi-php/universita/statistiche/tendine.php?lang=en&config=occupazione)), the average monthly salary a year after graduating for someone with a bachelor degree is 1340/1440 euros (depending on the uni). If the person has a master's degree, then the salary a year after graduating jumps to 1530/1560 euros.

This data seems consistent with glassdoor, but keep in mind that those salaries are actually infuenced by those that work abroad (about 5.6% in my uni, a year after obtaining their bachelor degree).

&#x200B;

There is obviously a salary growth the more experienced you are. According to glassdoor, [senior software developers](https://www.glassdoor.it/Stipendi/milano-senior-software-developer-stipendio-SRCH_IL.0,6_IM1058_KO7,32.htm) make 35.7K, and [senior software engineers](https://www.glassdoor.it/Stipendi/milan-senior-software-engineer-stipendio-SRCH_IL.0,5_IM1058_KO6,30.htm?countryRedirect=true) 41.7K. That means 1850 to 2100 euro net (x13).

&#x200B;

So, this is the data we can gather. But how expensive is Milan?

Well, it's expensive. According to numbeo, Milan is significantly more expensive than Berlin in all areas (e.g. 26% more expensive for housing), and basically the same as Munich.

>  
>You would need around **1,963.82€ in Munich** to maintain the same standard of life that you can have with **2,000.00€  in Milan** (assuming you rent in both cities).

It's cheaper than Paris, but not by much (< 10% on average), they're in the same league.

***

Now, a **junior** software engineer in these cities makes (according to glassdoor)

* 43.4K in Berlin, which should be 2070/2115 euro net (x13), depending on if you pay church tax or not
* 49.5K in Munich, which should be 2300/2350 euro net (x13), depending on if you pay church tax or not

What this means is that a new grad in Berlin makes about the same as a senior in Milan, while living in a cheaper city.

A new grad in Munich, a city about as expensive as Milan, makes more than 50% more than a new grad in Milan (with a master's).

Let's look at senior salaries now. A **senior** software engineer makes

* 68.6K in Berlin, which should be 2980/3085 euro net (x13), depending on if you pay church tax or not
* 73K in Munich, which should be 3135/3250 euro net (x13), depending on if you pay church tax or not

As a reminder, a senior sw engineer in Milan makes 41.7K, or 2100 euro net (x13).

1674trk,I find salaries on this sub much inflated comparing to the job listings.,"Few times I have literally checked salaries in certain locations after reading about them on this sub and for typical stacks the salaries in actual job listings were at least 30% smaller on average than what this sub gives as ""average"" for regular / senior.

I don't say that all of those salaries here are fake, I'm sure some are. But maybe discrepency comes from a few exceptions that try to set the narrative. In such situations can we just always say honestly that these are for a very few jobs. Most important statistic is that which is accurate for vast majority of candidates.

And if you can save 6k in Germany congratulations on realizing that rent is such an unnecessary spending and sustaining yourself with air. We will get there soon too.",2023-09-01 11:43:51

kihdac,London Tier 4 return to office enforced,"So I'm a software engineer working at **G-Research** in London, and we have been working remotely for the last 6+ months due to COVID. This has been proven to work very successfully.

However the company has started pushing a strong return-to-office propaganda. London has now been flagged as tier 4 with the media around COVID spread going out the roof. Despite this the company appears to be passive-aggressively threatening to lay people off if they decide not to go to the office and work from home instead. There is no value to being in the office other than physically meeting the team instead of through virtual calls.. aside of this we are all just behind our computers. The office is claimed to follow COVID safety standards. However there is an absolute disregard of the fact that people still must actually get to the office, and the risk of physically meeting other staff members ""COVID-safe"" or not is in my eyes simply a huge unnecessary risk.

Do I have any rights in this situation? Or can the company genuinely and lawfully kick developers out? I obviously do not want to get infected, especially not unnecessarily, and furthermore contribute to risk spreading anything to others. The company makes it seem like my thoughts are completely irrational, and no-one dares to speak up. I'm not quite sure what to believe anymore at this point. Aside of these politics I do not want to leave the company as the work itself is very interesting.

**Edit**: Thank you so much everyone for your replies. I did not initially include company name, being G-Research, as it seemed immature in some way. However from your responses I see this may actually be the only ""sensible"" thing that can be done without legal implications and have a slightly > 0% chance for the company to decide to change the rules (suddenly, and as if they always intended to do so).

I sincerely hope that more of my colleagues dare to speak up, as it is absurd that despite having proven of being perfectly capable working from home, the company forces everyone to further contribute to the spread of this outbreak. Not only for G-Research, but anyone who finds themselves in a similar position.",2020-12-22 23:56:30

joo14p,"I finally got a job. Learn my hacks, tricks and improve your chances of getting the job.","TLDR: Got the offer Pre-COVID-19,offer got canceled then got job offer in a different manner. Learned a lot along the way.

Hello, **This is my story and here it goes. First and foremost clean up your LinkedIn and GitHub(Only for computer science && graduate students).Refer to your career services department in your college.**

I started my job searching in October of 2019 as the job market was good at that times and I was too eager to get one. I started by bookmarking many top-medium sized IT, software companies career. Also join all the recruitment companies present within your locality.(They get paid by getting you a job) I got all the details from google search. This helped me in reducing the time to go to individual website--->clicking on career section etc. I even set the filters already in order to reduce the time.

Also join all the recruitment companies present within your locality.(They get paid by getting you a job) I got all the details from google search. DO ALL THESE ATLEAST 2-3 or even 6 MONTHS before the completion of your course.(I should have done this before but later I realized my mistake).

***#Tip 1: Indeed, Monsters cannot be always trusted because sometimes they would post a job opening which would never be present on company website and vice-versa.*** ***So be careful.***

***#Tip 2: Indeed, Monsters cannot be always trusted because sometime after submitting application on Indeed, I would contact recruiter about the update on my application but they would say ""We have not received your application and would advice you to submit directly from our website"".SO DO THAT IF OPENING IS AVAIBLE ON COMPANY's WEBSITE instead of Indeed,Monsters.com etc.***

This helped me in becoming aware of many opening which were niche and not posted on every job website. Also this helped me in reaching application to my company and avoiding **job portals brutal ATS system.**

I got through first stage of interview which was resume screening almost 90% of time by tailoring/editing/tuning according to the JOB REQUIRMTNERS(Priority) and cover letter according to the JOB SPECIFICATION.

***#Tip 3: Change your resume according to required skills only  and for cover letter include some company research and try to answer one important question ""How does your skills fit this job profile ?""***  

The next stage would generally involve coding test or video interview or aptitude test. This was the stage I was getting tensed about during initial days. Afterward I got comfortable in by practicing a lot.

***#Tip 4: For video interview, try to time your answer within 1-2 minutes(Include only key points) always use STAR method for delivering answers. For coding test use hacker rank and leetcode.If the test is going to be online, they mostly using codility(which is going to be the standards for the future) so practice on that nothing else.***

Afterwards I would get the information about the next stage which would be one-one interview about your experience, work history(if you have experience).

***#Tip 5: ALWAYS ask if you could bring any sort of document/presentation with you EVEN IF THEY DONT MENTIONED IT.*** **Make a presentation of 6-8 slides about your work experience final year projects or projects you are comfortable with to explain it to the employees/recruiters of the company. ALSO read glassdoor profile of company to get an idea about the questions that might be asked in the interview.**

Now here's what happened to me. I got selected but due to COIVD-19,all my offers were canceled. 

**NOW COMES THE MOST STRUGGLING , BORING BUT IMPORTANT PART OF MY JOB SEARCHING PROCESS**.

Since I got a lot of free-time as I was unemployed during this period(my part -time shifts were also cancelled).I used it in a manner that helped me later.

***#Tip 6: CONTACT EVERY RECUTRITES THAT OFFERED YOU A CHANCE FOR INTERVIEW AND ASK FOR FEEDBACK.THIS WILL HELP YOU LATER(TRUST ME).I EVEN GOT PRAISE FOR FEW RESCRUTIERS STATING THAT NOT MANY REJECTED CANDIDATES BOTHER ASKING FOR FEEDBACK.***

Afterwards I started improving my soft-skills by recording the questions that I was asked in interviews, and later assessing. Also, I started learning new skills relevant to my degree. The best recourse I came across was [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/udemyfreebies/new/).I also took many hacker rank test and starting posting the result on LinkedIn. This caught the eyes of many employees of the companies. I added them on LinkedIn and requested them to refer me if ever they or me came across any suitable opening in their company.

In these last few months, some companies started opening vacancies, so I stared my asking employees to refer me on LinkedIn.

First I got an unpaid internship in a small company for web developer. In next few months, I started applying to small methods in and unusual ways.

**HERE IS THE UNUSAL WAY: Since I was a computer science student, I went to CONATCT US page of every small to medium company that could hire a computer science student. I got email address of every company which were of format info@, career@ etc. Then I drafted a email which was of format ""General Introduction --> project worked on --> skills --> soft skills --> ""I have attached my CV(General) I am looking forward to be hearing from you.""-->attach CV"".**

**HERE comes the important part NEVER SEND YOUR CV Instantly. Instead schedule your email to going at next day morning 9-10 am .So that you job email is the first(or among the first) thing they see in the morning.**

After few weeks I got a call from the company .There was a simple interview regarding my current internship and my past projects. Afterwards they reviewed my LinkedIn, GitHub and I got the job offer the very next day.

z9lwqi,"Graduated in CS at age 49, but I've ended up doing tech support for GBP £19,500 and I'm at my wit's end","After making hundreds of applications to a range of graduate schemes, junior dev jobs, a a few junior data-related jobs such as junior DBA and junior data analyst over the course of six months, I only had one offer, which I felt I had little choice to accept, so now I'm doing (100% remote) tech support for £19,500.

It's not an entirely bad job, but it's not at all what I want to be doing, obviously the money is lousy, I feel the prospects and training/development are practically non-existent, even the equipment they give us is lousy (we're expected to remote in to user's PCs with only a laptop with a 14"" screen). So I have been really miserable, and on top of that I seem to now be having problems with high blood pressure and have been sweating like crazy at night and in the mornings. I'm hardly really eating and have been very stressed due to a neighbour who has made threats against me in the past making a lot of noise and disturbing me when I am trying to work, sleep, relax and of course when I am trying to improve coding (which is now only at the weekend due to working full-time).

My situation is even further complicated by a) not owning a car or even being able to drive, and b) not being willing to move from Scotland to England, because I couldn't possibly afford to own my own home there, and besides which, almost all my friends and family are here.

I just don't know what to do any more. Sometimes when I've got a bit of idle time at work I look on various job sites and fire out a few CVs if I see any junior dev jobs in Scotland I think I might stand a chance at, but often they are highly technical, like robotics and stuff, and I just think there is really no chance. If I manage to find a 100% remote junior dev job I will always apply, but more often than not they are really hybrid. I get recruiters call me here and there, but it goes nowhere after they learn I don't want to move down south.

I would be well up for anything like junior database admin / junior data engineer / junior cloud engineer, but these jobs are few and far between, and OFC they want experience even at 'junior' level.

This is my CV: ~~https://i.imgur.com/p8sLlLw.jpg~~ https://i.imgur.com/IzmLA93.jpg (more recent one)

Anybody got any bright ideas please? Right now I'm thinking about putting my flat up for sale and trying to find somewhere better, but it's very nerve-wracking to think about buying a new (undoubtedly more expensive) place and sending my mortgage payments through the roof (I expect them to as much as quadruple) on the basis of a poorly-paid job that I hate. And what if I move but then get a job offer somewhere else? I just don't know what direction to turn in now. I actually took a couple of annual leave days just to try to recover my state of mind a bit and try to work out what to do. TIA for any input.",2022-12-01 11:51:32

xlzafp,"I'm being offered 88k EUR which is more than double my current salary, is it a no-brainer to accept?","I just got an offer that comes out to around 88k EUR per year gross.

I'm from Croatia and I currently make around 40k EUR gross which comes out to 27k net.

However the company is a startup that's been around for 4 years, and it has around 20 employees. They are in the Fintech industry and are located in Zurich in Switzerland and Helsinki in Finland. I've never worked for a startup, and I don't know if this sounds good or not? This is why I'm asking here for advice, in case someone sees some major red flags.

I'd be working remotely for them from Croatia.

My current salary is considered pretty high here and what they are offering sounds mind-blowing to me tbh..

In my current company I'm pretty comfortable, and have an amazing work life balance, but I'm not the happiest with the projects and type of work we do.

pnje8u,Happy to see Spain's tech scene improving!,"I just wanted to share with the subreddit some optimism about the tech scene in Spain. Although it is still years behind, in opportunities ([linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?geoId=105646813&keywords=software%20engineer&location=Spain)) and salaries ([levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/comp.html?track=Software%20Engineer&search=spain)), of let's say the UK or Germany I think that in the last few years it has improved a lot.

If we look at, let's say 7 years ago, there were almost no international companies nor startups and the best you could target was working in a big Spanish company like Telefonica or Tuenti. However, little by little big and small foreign companies have opened offices, which has been a huge boost.

For example Amazon currently employs \~400 folks, with offices in Madrid and Barcelona, and recently Microsoft and Apple decided to open small offices that can lead to future expansions. You can check in Linkedin job posts of these companies to see what kind of projects there are.

And the same with startups, small, mid, big companies which have opened/expanded in Spain, some examples: Datadog, Twilio, Unity, Eventbrite, Adobe, SkyScanner, Vodafone, Ericsson, Klarna, N26, Expedia, Oracle, MongoDB, Criteo, HP, Glovo, etc. Game companies: EA, Paradox, 2K, King, Gameloft. Or even traditional companies that are creating a tech division: Seat, Ikea, Adidas, Santander, Mercadona, etc.

Thanks to this, now it is possible to work on something interesting and well-paid in Spain without being forced to move abroad. Although the salaries are still low compared with West-North Europe (e.g. Amazon: 3k/m net new grad, probably 5k for seniors), it has been a massive improvement since before you needed to be super lucky to find a job paying that much and now there are way more options. Hopefully salaries will continue going higher like it has happened in Easter Europe.

So yes, this is all that I wanted to say. Although sometimes it may seem like the market is very hard and competitive (specially for junior folks), we should keep in mind the many things that have improved.

Thank you for reading!",2021-09-13 16:52:31
hr6dyb,Are most software engineering jobs this chill?,"I started my first software engineering job a month ago in a fairly chill and relaxed environment. In a single day I work from 9am to 5pm.

vaq3l9,Graduate developer 8 months into first job and being told I will be dismissed if my technical progression doesn't improve.,"UK, Total compensation 21k, Frontend Developer, Self taught with no CS degree. 

First developer role, at just under 8 months and have completed all work set for me with very little requested changes in my pull requests and am often given good feedback for my 'soft skills'.

Issue seems to come from my one to one sessions with one of the lead developers where we essentially do classic tech test style exercises. 

I've done a lot of pair programming since starting work but I very much struggle with this kind of ""test scenario"" style of assessing skill where I'm given no preparation time to research the problem and roughly ~30 minutes to code a solution. 

I'm investing a lot of my personal time heavily in upskilling and coding exercises, the lead dev says there is improvement between these tech test style sessions but I was recently called into a meeting with my manager and the lead developer where they said there was concerns about my progression and it was heavily implied that I would be cut loose without a rapid significant improvement in my ""technical skills"". 

I'm confused as there is seemingly no issue with the quality of work I produce and other members of my team enjoy working with me on a personal level, as I stated earlier the issue seems to be the lead developer is not satisfied with my performance in these one on one, tech test style exercises. 

Looking for any insight or advice as this is a particularly confusing situation that I really wasn't prepared for. Really appreciate any perspectives from other developers who've been in my position or the position of the lead developer who has concerns about my progression. 

Thanks guys.",2022-06-12 16:53:32
na6vmh,At which point do you no longer suffer from impostor syndrome but are just bad at what you do?,"I (almost 27, Germany) have just been let go from my new job after merely 5 weeks. I've graduated with a Bachelor's degree last year and have been working on a Master's degree since. I was working part-time as a C# desktop app developer for over a year but looked for full-time jobs in a different field because I felt like I didn't learn about any popular skills/technologies like Web Development or Machine Learning. 

I applied for a position as an Android developer because I've worked on Android projects at uni and enjoyed it. I think I made it obvious that I wasn't a seasoned Android developer. I got invited to an interview in which they told me that they need an iOS developer and asked if I was interested in that as well. I said yes, but made it clear that I have zero experience in iOS development. They said it wasn't a problem and I got hired without having to do a coding challenge or answer any technical questions. 

Well... today they told me that they do not believe that I'd be up to speed and a productive developer in the capacity they were looking for anytime soon. Now part of me wants to believe that they shouldn't have expected a recent graduate in their first real job to immerse themself in a completely new project and technology with minimal guidance and turn into a productive team member within the first 5 weeks. But they told me that this is what they expect from someone holding a Bachelor's degree. So how bad do you have to be to be let go after 5 weeks without warnings? I'll get paid for this month but they don't even want me to keep working until then.  

I can't deny that I'm slow and not a good programmer to begin with. None of the content of my degree came easy to me. I've struggled in every coding project I took part in and always was among the weaker group members. I've graduated with decent grades but I feel like none of it matters because I didn't learn any real world skills. And I'm not great at Math or CS theory either. I've dabbled in Android development, Web development and Machine Learning by myself but I'm not proficient by any means. Yeah technically I have over a year of real world C# experience by now but I relied on Stackoverflow more than anything. I even have 3 years of part-time experience as a Software Tester but there was no coding involved and all that I've realized was that I do not want to do any more testing than necessary for a standard developer role. 

I just don't know how to proceed from here. I was super happy to finally be able to build up that real world experience that employers actually care about but I can't put those 5 weeks on my resume. I'll keep working on my Master's degree and hopefully finish sometime next year but I don't feel like it'll prepare me any more for a job besides the qualifications it gives me on paper. I'm also really worried about not being able to switch between technology stacks in the future. I mean, even Senior Developers start at zero when learning new technologies and it takes years to fully grasp every relevant concept.  

So I'm guessing what I really want to know is: how can I prepare right now to find a software development job when I'm not really good at any specific technology and want to stay as flexible as possible?",2021-05-11 20:30:26

- Compensation range: £55 - £75k (based offers; but it's no all about £££)
- Location: London
- Years of experience: 4-5
- Languages: Python, Java
- Infra: AWS, Kubernetes

- For Monzo - they went into a hiring freeze
- For SuperAwesome - I didn’t feel like working for a marketing platform for kids so I stopped the process 
- For Huma - they overemphasised how hard they work 12h+ days, didn’t sound right so I stopped the process
- For G-Research - I’m a bit of a tool snob I guess but I didn’t want to work on Grid computing and manage releases using Confluence so I stopped to process
- For Farfetch - my recruiter over-indexed on my recent experience with Data engineering so I was given pretty simple SQL to write in coderpad but flopped.
- For TikTok - I was given Iterator over Binary Tree basically a variant on [Iterator over BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-iterator/), I hadn't done much LC but got to a solution but flitted between too many things so got rejected.
- For Cassini - I really overemphasise tech being used, and I didn't want to write CloudFormation templates again and a lot of it seemed to revolve around that so I said that to the interviews so I didn't progress with the final stage, meeting the CEO.
- For GoCardless - I applied for an SRE role and SWE role in the Growth team. I got offered a Core Banking role a couple of months later, due to hiring restrictions. The domain was totally different from my preference and it was in Ruby so with some regret I decided to decline the offer [read more about it in this previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/iacz7e/should_i_do_it_for_the_money/)
- For TouchSurgery - Since the start of my journey (24th of March 2020) when I decided to take voluntary redundancy I said to myself I wanted to work for a company with a social good aspect to it. So I found TS, they were recently acquired by Medtronic (one of the biggest medical companies in the world).

g9otyy,Tired of the work culture in the USA. Considering leaving for the EU. What country (or countries) are my best bet for what I am looking for and how can I qualify?,"So, I live in the USA and have a CS degree. I also have about a years experience as a full stack developer so far. I also have a few years experience working in another industry before I got my CS degree.

However, over the years of working in a couple of industries and also just observing things, I just don't like the work mentality in this country. I don't like that people seem to want to put work over life. They seem to think ""live to work"" instead of ""work to live"" is the best way I can put it.

There really are no unions in this country and very little to no workers rights. Basically, you can get fired at any time for really no reason at all, and that is completely legal. Boss doesn't like you for whatever reason (personal reasons)? Cool, your fired and not given a reason and that is completely legal, even if you were doing your job.

Healthcare is also linked to work. So, if you lose your job, you lose your healthcare unless you can magically pay for it on your own out of pocket. 

Maternity and Paternity leave is not guaranteed and paid time off varies and seems to be on the whim of the employer. Even if you get a good amount, they may not really let you take it that often for whatever reason.

Overall, I'm just tired of it. Part of me wishes things would change and get better. But, after seeing the past election and the one coming up and how people seem to act, I don't know if things will ever improve for a while.

All I want to do is live in a country where healthcare is guaranteed, no matter what your employment status is. I want a place where the 40 hour work week (or less even) is the norm, not 50 - 60 hours. I want a place where maternity/paternity leave is guaranteed and paid time off is guaranteed by law.

msysat,Share my experience with salary negotiation service on levels.fyi,"I just want to share my experience so others can be more cautious.

TLDR:  Overall, I received some good advice but the recruiter from levels.fyi who claims to have previously worked in the FAANG company which I has received an offer from has never worked at any FAANG, according to his LinkedIn profile.

I have recently received an offer in London from one of the FAANG companies. I decided to pay for the salary negotiation service on levels.fyi, thinking the potential returns over investment (0.7k-1.5k euros) can be quite worthy. In the worst case scenario, I won't get a better TC after negotiation and I lose the money for the service fees, but I will still learn some tips and tricks, which may be useful in the next job switch.

On their salary negotiation page, the written copy is ""*In each session you'll get 30 minutes 1-on-1 with a former recruiter (from your target companies if available).* ""   I explicitly selected the FAANG I got offer from and understood that I might not be paired with an ex-recruiter from that company due to availability.  That's ok.  A few days later, I had the first call and the guy from levels.fyi introduced himself as a previous recruiter from that company. The call went somewhat ok. Then I started to negotiate with the FAANG recruiter based on the advice received.

A few days ago, I looked up this levels.fyi guy on LinkedIn, with his first name (last name is not part of his  levels.fyi email address) and other job experiences he shared.  I found a guy with the same name and the same guy in the profile picture.  Well well well, everything matched, except that he has never worked at any FAANG ....  Most of his career is in different recruitment agencies.  None of his past jobs' description mention any FAANG as clientele. So at max, he may have worked as an external sourcer for FAANG and he 'forgot' or was not allowed to list that due to NDA ???

Side note, I didn't end up with a better TC \[for the offer at this company: Edited for clarification\]. But this could be the result of multiple factors. I can't attribute it all to the service itself.  Just I hate it when people lie to my face and I end up paying them for it . I only found out the guy was bs-ing me at the end of the negotiation, and it was kind of too late \[Edited for clarification:  too late for the negotiation part\].

Hope my experience can be some sort of a cautionary tale.",2021-04-17 20:47:28
j4ygn4,My Horrible Startup Experience as a Developer Employee,"(repost from r/cscareerquestions, didn't know this EU sub existed)

Hi fellow programmers,

Your personal interests matter, right?

It is in your interest to keep growing as a developer, being able to pursue your own dreams, living your life outside of your job, and so much more.

These interests aren't always respected by employers. Please take a moment to read about my experience working at a startup with rougly 30 employees, most of which are not developers.

tl;dr at the bottom

**About me**

To begin, let me tell you about myself. I am a mid 20s male living in a Northern EU country. I have about 4 years of professional programming experience. The startup was my second job. I love programming, and I am the type of person who codes in their spare time as well as a hobby. I'm very motivated to grow as a developer who recently started their career.

I am also ambitious, and would like to one day have my own parttime or fulltime programming business selling products and or services. This was part of the motivation for me to start working at a startup: to learn more about building such a business. Being able to create a product from scratch is one of those things I've always loved about being a developer.

**Starting at a startup**

Before I started my first day on the job, my employer asked me if I could pick a laptop I'd like to work with, so I spent some time researching a laptop and found a good one.

I was so excited for my first week on the job. This was going to be a real step up from my last job, which was a fine first job but I couldn't grow my technical skills any further there.

The first day: I arrive at the correct time, but the people who were supposed to set me up with my gear weren't in the office yet. That's fine, I didn't mind the wait.

When they finally got there it turned out they didn't have a laptop prepared for me. I was then given an old laptop they had laying around. I was then told they weren't going to order the laptop they asked me to choose. Every developer would be working on the same type of Lenovo laptop. Not what I wanted, but also not that big of a deal. The research for a laptop was a bit of a waste now, but oh well, not a big deal.

After getting my machine setup with Linux I was going to start working on an existing SaaS of the company. This was great, except there was no developer onboarding, and they were using their own framework which was poorly documented. Not great, but I was able to look at the source code and ask questions to the framework's authors because they fortunately were still employed at the company.

A few months later I was tasked with a solo project for which I only had a month of time and I also needed to use the company's framework. I ended up needing to do a lot of ""hacks"" because the people who wrote the framework didn't have the time to help me out. I would've missed the deadline if I was going to wait for their help.

These are all pretty inconvenient things, but it wasn't the end of the world. The lack of support for newhires was a common occurence during my time at the startup, however. I've seen other newhires using their own laptops for months because the employer didn't manage to get their gear in time.

**Not being allowed to do programming work outside of my job at the startup**

My employer prohibits their employees from doing any paid work related to tech outside of their job. They are however allowed to do anything that isn't related to tech.

This means you cannot make a website for someone else, or launch your own product like a SaaS or an eBook.

For someone with my ambitions this had killed my motivation to code outside of work. Not only did it suck to be less motivated, but this restriction also prevented me from growing faster as a developer because I just ended up spending less time coding outside of work. It also made me less productive at my job.

To be honest, I doubt this is actually enforceable in my North European country, but at the time I did not feel like risking getting fired over it.

Being the ambitious person that I am this however was a good reason for me to start looking for another job.

**No trust to allow working from home**

Working from home was not allowed. That was fine with me, I wanted to be in the office anyway for face to face mentorship (which I didn't get, more on that later) and to get to know my colleagues. And then Covid-19 happened. We all started working from home fulltime since April.

The Sunday night before we would start working from home we got an email instructing us to install some sort of employee monitoring software on our work laptops. This software measures your activity level throughout the day by monitoring how much you use your mouse and keyboard. I believe this isn't allowed as per the GDPR and it didn't really feel right to me (lack of trust), but the software was also configred to take a screenshot of your desktop every 15 minutes, which essentially made this spyware and this is also a huge violation of the GDPR.

Naturally, some employees made remarks about this and refused to use the software as it a breach of their rights as EU citizens. Our boss claimed their legal counsellor said it was within their right, but it clearly was not. After a lot of debate our employer ended up turning the screenshot feature off, but the message was clear: they did not trust us enough to just do our job and did not respect our privacy.

**Lack of direction**

Management was very poor. For the first year I worked at this startup we weren't even following agile, scrum or similar methodologies. We just had a backlog and a daily ""standup"" meeting with only the developers. That's it.

This ended up being really demotivating because we were just mindlessly going from task to task, without any real idea what was important to the business.

Occasionally someone from management would join the meeting when they had changed their minds about something. This always happened sporadically and without discussing anything with the development team.

**Lack of personal growth, no mentorship**

This startup had multiple small offices. I was under the impression that I would be working with other developers face to face, but that didn't end up being the case. I was the only developer in my office location. I only saw the people I worked on the same project with during the daily standup meeting, which was just a Zoom call.

This wasn't good for my morale, since those other devs were all working in the same office and had a noticably better bond as colleagues. When I was hired it was never mentioned to me that I would be the only dev in my office location.

Ever since finishing that solo project I mentioned earlier I had not really worked on any interesting projects. It was a lot of the same stuff over and over again.

**Working overtime**

When I was in the interviewing process for this company they mentioned that employees are expected to be flexible.

I don't mind working overtime much. Especially at a startup it was to be expected.

What I did not expect, and what I *do mind,* was that we didn't get compensated for working overtime at all. No pay. No leaving early on another day.

When I worked overtime I asked if I could leave early on another day. My manager said ""we don't do that here. It wouldn't be fair to the others who frequently do a lot of overtime"". When I learned that others do a lot of uncompensated overtime I genuinely felt bad for them. Why would extra work that benefits the company not result in compensation, especially if it occurs frequently? It just does not make sense.

It makes me so angry when employers exploit their employees. These people have families and personal lives too. While they are hard at work during overtime, their managers are just enjoying their spare time. It's disgusting.

The boss always said they're a ""work hard, play hard"" kind of company. I suppose the ""play hard"" part of that generally didn't apply to their engineers.

**No tests**

This company also did not bother to write tests for their code. My first employer also didn't do this, but the work I was doing there was much simpler.

At this startup we worked on SaaS applications which are the main source of income for the company. Not writing tests has many disadvantages as you probably know, but combining this with uncompensated overtime has resulted in some pretty terrible events where bugs that could have been prevented by tests had to be fixed in evenings or weekends without any compensation except a good pat on the back.

The other developers also didn't seem to be interested in writing tests. I had tried to convince them that we needed to at least test some critical things, but those tests probably still don't exist.

**No signs of improvement over time**

By the end of my time at this job the senior developers still didn't have time to help out newhires. Even though they wrote the framework, they also didn't bother writing documentation for it. Things still broke occasionally because there were no tests, resulting in uncompensated overtime. When I left there still weren't any tests.

**Compensation**

My salary was good enough. After leaving the company I noticed that larger companies did generally offer more money and better benefits though.

**My advice for those considering working at a startup**

If you're a junior, be sure to ask how they will mentor you and help you grow. But I would urge you to look for a larger company where they actually have the resources to help you grow.

Most importantly, ask them about things you think are important. I know this sounds obvious, but not being able to make any money outside of my job wasn't obvious when I signed the contract.

**TL;DR**

My experience at a startup has been pretty bad. No respect for the employees, software that screenshots our desktops for employee tracking, no compensation for frequently occurring overtime, poor management, no mentorship, being the only dev in my office location, not being allowed to do my own thing outside of the job, uninteresting projects.

But hey, at least we had a foosball table.

If you're considering working at a startup, consider this before signing a contract:

* Find a company that *enables* you instead of one that holds you back
* Ask how they manage their projects and if they write tests
* Make sure you get the gear you need when you start the job
* If you want to work from home, ask if that's allowed and how much
* Ask how they will help you get started at the job, if they have employee or developer onboardings etc.
* Know what their overtime policies are
* Consider how much you value a good work life balance
* Ask what kind of work you are allowed to do outside of your job

**What are your thoughts on working at startups? Should juniors consider this at all?**",2020-10-04 12:52:59

iwbxfs,My experience with 3 junior job searches in the last 12 months (statistics) [Germany],"
# Search #1 (2019-10-02 - 2019-12-18)

Basically this would be my first job after completing my Master's degree at a relatively prestigious German university.
I did start looking for a job early but I had very lackluster results, which I blame on applying to too many FAAMG companies,
    and not enough companies overall.
By the time I handed in my thesis at the end of November I only had a single on-site to look forward to (the one from October 2).
Despite the job being over 500km away in Munich I signed the job just before New Year's because the company seemed cool
    and I really didn't have any other options.

23 applications -> 1 offer


# Search #2 (2020-05-01 - 2020-06-21)

I worked well with my team in the first job, but sadly one of the bosses of the company got a bad impression of me,
and basically single-handedly terminated me. People also wondered why I took a job in consulting, as I'm autistic and
lack soft skills, which is also the main reason he cited for terminating. This is why I'm avoiding consulting now, 
but honestly those skills are needed in any company. Plus I suffer from depression, so they repeatedly mentioned it 
""seemed like I didn't enjoy working there"". 

I took the lessons from last time and tried to send around 2 applications every day. I did send many applications in the 
Munich are but I ultimately felt like leaving Munich because it's a different culture, I don't know anyone there, 
I don't like big cities, the cost of living is unfavorable, and because of the pandemic. 
I was also living in an unsanitary dilapidated basement apart so I really wanted a motivation to finally get out of there. 
So I kept interviewing. 

While I really only dealt with 2 recruiters during the last process, I got contacted by many more this time around.
I got a total of 3 or 4 offers depending on how you count, and they all came through recruiters, my own applications
were essentially worthless.

I took a job offer in the Rhine-Ruhr area that allowed me to move (again over 500km) back in with my dad.

29 applications -> 3 offers


# Search #3 (2020-08-01 - 2020-09-19)

I got laid off again after a month, with the person again citing communication issues. 
I worked 100% remote due to Corona, and there was really no Einarbeitung (induction?). 
So I was the only DevOps engineer in the company, with no previous DevOps experience, 
    so part of why I couldn't communicate what I was doing was me having no clue what I was doing really.

I was kind of excited about DevOps because I really loved working with Docker, but this was more sysadmin-type work
(e.g. setting up a Cassandra cluster, so instead of ""you build it you run it"" it was just ""you run it"") 
so I also didn't really enjoy it.

I did get contacted by a fair share of recruiters, but almost exclusively in the DevOps field which I have no interest
in, or for positions either in Munich or somewhere else entirely. I felt it was hard to find job openings around here,
especially compared to Munich, I know that the Ruhr area specifically is experiencing economic decline right now.

I was looking for a regional job so I don't have to do another pointless move. I feel like as a junior in Germany 
I cannot command better conditions anyway without getting 3+ years experience first, so I might as well take a close
offer.

28 applications -> 2 offers

TL;DR: OP talks about how everything is process oriented, hours of meetings, old management style, reducing cost at every aspects of the company, crazy work hours in startups, low salary, etc.

 

>Mid/Upper 30s developer w/ 4 years at MANGA level company in the past, US Citizen.  
>  
>I left SF because of the screaming high rent and a desire for a better work life balance. It turns out that the low cost of living, rent, and free health care still made me poorer overall because of the massive salary cut. Working hours are less but the working quality is much less too. No one here knows how to run a tech company or a startup, everything is process oriented. Committee based decisions requiring consensus mean that there's meetings for hours on end and another meeting is scheduled until a final decision is achieved.  
>  
>I'd love to say it's isolated to one company, but now that I've been at 4 different places and talked to many devs, it's clearly everywhere. Since Spotify is the darling child of the EU tech scene, everyone copy-pastes their management structure into their employee handbook but not a single bit of effort is actually spent on implementing it. Old management styles from the 80s and 90s reign, I've had PMs insist to me that Waterfall is The One Truth Way. Companies penny count equipment purchases for their engineers like it's going to bankrupt them to give them the tools they need to do their job. The companies themselves are nothing like the SV companies where tech is revenue, instead tech here is a cost center and must be done at the cheapest price. So everything is about efficiency and cost reduction, quality and building a product or exploring the market are completely neglected. Product Owners go out of their way to avoid talking to customers, design is an afterthought, and engineering practices like Code Reviews are shunned because it slows down the rate a Jira ticket moves across the sprint board. Nevermind testing, which is all done manually by the overworked QA role that doesn't have a single automation script on their machine.  
>  
>Since I'm experienced, whenever I join I end up getting promoted very quickly to Tech Lead or higher because I'm the only person with some knowledge of how to build things. This immediately takes me from where I wanted to be, writing code, into meeting hell. No matter how clearly I ask for a hands on role, it is inevitable. Then I resign and the same story plays out again. In a SV company, I was a lead often but I did 80% coding, 20% meetings, but here it's 100% meetings, 10% coding on free time. I dreaded taxes in CA, but in the EU I am taxed from both the EU and the US after 6 figures, which means I am extremely demotivated to make any money past this point because it's a huge bill every year.

>One of the major things I wanted in the move out here was to be able to travel and have more time off. Corona really didn't help with that dream, but what killed it more was that because a trip is the same cost basically anywhere, the salary hit just cut my dreams off entirely. I did not really think that through when I moved. So now I have more time off and no money to spend on it.  
>  
>On top of that, the work life balance here is actually worse. Yes, you can get 40 hours a week and not get fired for underperforming, but startups here still expect crazy hours, and those who don't give them quickly are giving the worst work and never get any advancement, then are ""managed out."" It's basically impossible to get fired, so there's a huge amount of people at every company that are just chilling out and doing the bare minimum to get by, taking up space and holding everything up. Overall I spend about 10 hours less at work per week, down from 60 to 50, but the quality of those 50 hours are abysmal. Yes, it was 60 hours at work each week in SF, but I spent them in a beautiful office with each company competing to have the best cold brew on tap and an emphasis of doing good work with a top of the line computer. Here it's a spartan, no frills experience with back to back meetings talking to people who think I'm crazy to suggest that maybe, we stop adding features for 2 seconds and fix the broken mess of a code base written only half in English, or actually ask if the customer wants this feature, or re-iterate that no, while a 3 hour unmonitored take home test does in fact save interviewing time, it is not a great way to hire.

>Outside of work, learning the language and making friends is much harder. Despite a lot of effort on my part, and I know Corona didn't help, I've been only able to make friends with other immigrants.

17ng91x,Is big tech abandoning EU?,"Hi!

It looks like despite economy is slightly improving, companies are still not hiring across most of the EU, especially well known tech companies.

I only see offers by consulting firms, a few small startups and a minority of bank/insurance jobs.


Is it because these companies learnt the hard way that worker rights laws in many EU countries prevented them from firing whoever they wanted during 2022-2023 layoffs cycle?

It looks like so, because I am seeing lots of new positions in US, UK, in eastern Europe (Poland, Estonia), a few in southern Europe  (Spain), and in Asia (India, Vietnam). 

Apparently only staff/principals are hired in western Europe, while mid/senior technical jobs have been delocalized elsewhere. Junior positions don't exist anymore.

I don't have any supporting data, but I've been looking for new job opportunities on LinkedIn for three months now and I am noticing this trend.


Is this the new normal? Am I totally wrong?

Edit: I know Poland and Estonia are in the EU, but maybe their worker rights laws are a bit more permissive from an employer's perspective?",2023-11-04 07:15:19
r6a3vy,Company wants us to track 100% of our time. Thinking of jumping ship but I need some advice,"Tldr: My current workplace started asking us to track 100% of our time. Since then I’ve been resenting my job and I’m considering a change but I’m seeking some input from other developers in Germany before starting a job search. 

Some info about me:
- I live/work in Munich.
- I have 3 years of experience (2 of which at this company) and a MSc from a German university.
- Almost fully remote.
- Full stack with focus on backend (Java).
- The work is project based. My company bills my hours to the clients. 
- I speak German and work in german (almost B2). 
- TC is €65k but will increase to €70k starting January. 

Now to the story:
My manager noticed that I tracked 85% of my time last month and explicitly stated that I should make sure to track all 40 hours per week. Up until that point I’ve been tracking 32 - 35 hours depending on the week and nobody complained.

There is no screen recording or anything of that sort. This is more trust based. I have to enter the time I worked on each task in our time tracking system. 8 full hours per day. 

Previously I skipped on tracking some small portions of time which eventually add up to around 1 hour per day. Things like reading an email and checking the code to find an answer to the question in the email take a couple of minutes sometimes and it’s just too much effort to keep track all the time. 

Additionally, on some days I just don’t have enough energy to be fully productive for full 8 hours so I just book that I worked 6.5 hours that day. I don’t want to sound lazy but working full 40 hours per week down to the minute is pretty damn draining and I feel underpaid for the amount of effort I’m putting. By Friday I have almost no energy left and have to really squeeze all my energy in order to work 8 hours. 

I’m mostly working on 5 or more projects at a time and this strict time tracking system is becoming really tedious, stressful and makes it difficult to focus on the tasks themselves because sometimes I might work on like 3 different projects within the same 10 minutes and I have to keep in mind what I did when all the time. 

Now I’m considering switching to a job where the value of my work is not quantified directly in terms of hours. I’m thinking something like in house development where I can leverage a couple of hours of extreme concentrated work and then take it easy for the rest of the day. 

My question is:
For developers who work in platform based roles, Do you usually work full 40 hours per week? If not, how is your performance measured?

I always thought that writing code is a creative task in which the bulk of productive work comes in deeply concentrated sessions.  

This per hour based style makes me feel like a cash cow. I mean I might as well switch to freelance and make double the money if I’m already doing project work like this. 

Especially with the current market situation being on fire, I feel that I can get the same salary for much less work somewhere else.

- 1 database query (complicated if you are out of touch)
- 1 practical log parsing
- 1 API request/response


Notes:

- Questions were original unless you get lucky.
- It will really push you (exceptions are there of course)
- All questions were fair except for one hard DP.
- DP: I coded recursive solution but only half test cases were passing so I ended up wasting too much time on fixing it.

My verdict is that it was too much to ask for screening unless you are paying 200k. But my motivation for doing it was that I am little out of touch with all this, so took it as an opportunity to practice in a pressure environment.

I find it almost impossible to cold apply to remote jobs, almost instantly you get a rejection.
The only time I could meet with the real person was through referal or directly contacting the recruiter. But even that is hard because most of the recruiters don't allow direct messages if you are not connected to them.

I can only guess how hard it is for newcomers and people without jobs to find them now.

1. should i get myself piped and negotiate a handsome severance pay? Would this impact my career? I'm not sure how much severance i would get (6 months pay?)
2. Leave before i complete focus period i.e. before starting pip. So i don't get severance.

The results can range from

* dull (from the odd company which thinks everything is confidential, or where the data you get has little about your performance itself)
* weird (had one asking me to post a confirmation using snail mail)
* useful (which is what one is looking for - when the data you get gives insightful detail into how well you did, and ideally tells you how to improve in the future. It can also give you implicit data - for instance whether the company even watched your Hirevue response)

The results are usually more helpful than not.

144asst,Working at a startup might not be a good idea,"I’m a machine learning professional who has worked for a startup in the past. I’m writing from an EU and UK perspective, but generally speaking, tech startups are very American in the way they operate. This can result in some nasty shocks. This article will give you an honest take on the upsides of working at a startup—and the downsides. You’ll notice that I’m writing anonymously.

## Myth vs reality

Years of media propaganda, often written by journalists who have never worked in a startup, have painted a very rosy picture, which I fell for in the early years of my career. The image of the startup is that of a small, Agile company that isn’t afraid to innovate, unlike big bureaucratic corporations. The startup is typically located in a sexy area (like a garage in Silicon Valley); likewise, the work they do is sexy. Your colleagues will become your friends. You can play videogames or ping pong, and drink beers. The startup is diverse, with people of many different nationalities and backgrounds.

And all of this is true, but this is a classic example of lying by omission. Here are the realities:

1. Your colleagues may be from diverse nationalities and/or ethnic origin, but they will almost all be men between the age of 25–40. They are also less likely to be parents. If you’re young, you’re considered too inexperienced to work there, and if you’re old, forget about it.
2. You may drink beers and play video games, but on a Friday afternoon after 5pm, when you should be enjoying your weekend. The other 4 days of the week will be spent frantically working, often with longer hours than well-established players. Early stage startups, and senior employees, might spend time working on weekends and holidays.
3. Sexy areas = high cost of living, and startups are often resistant to remote work policies (despite being “innovative”).

It doesn’t get better, I’m afraid.

## Startups and the Agile methodology

Startups like to bill themselves as Agile, which means (roughly translated for non-software folks out there) as doing things interatively and not getting trapped in analysis paralysis. What actually happens is that startups write a lot of untested code which constantly breaks. The requirements change all the time, and not always because of good reasons (like the client wanting something else) but because management is fickle. There is often not much time for a formal design process, which results in poor abstractions; and nobody is responsible for writing documentation or doing QA. Likewise, there was no model review at the startup I worked for.

If you want to learn industry best practices, you are usually better off elsewhere. I would be especially careful about any startup that operates in healthcare, defence or finance. “Move fast and break things” might work for a social media site, but it will be a *disaster* in these fields.

## Are startups innovative?

Some startups genuinely do innovative work that pushes the envelope of software engineering and/or machine learning. But this is the exception rather than the rule. Plenty of startups are building just another travel app, ecommerce site or payments platform – and it’s often a product that nobody wants (which is the reason so many startups fail). In machine learning, another extreme is the startup that tries pie-in-the-sky ideas which are academic projects, not serious commercial ideas.

And there is plenty of anodyne work in startups. You’ll end up doing the same thing as in a big company, but with worse management, benefits, and (especially) job security.

Furthermore, tech startups can often have messianic leaders. I personally find this very annoying. Startups are rarely solving world hunger or climate change, and no, your smartphone app doesn’t count. This particular criticism can be levelled at tech workers in general, not just startups, but I find many techies boring. They talk about tech during dinner parties or drinks, and rarely know much about current affairs or art. At best, I can talk about my gym routine with them.

## Management can suck

Of course, management can suck in any company. But startups are often run by people who have no management experience. Furthermore, startups have a tendency to be extremely disorganised.

## Job security sucks

Job security sucks for two reasons. One is that startups can go bankrupt quite quickly – they have a high burn rate, and are very dependent on investor capital, often with few clients and not enough revenue to be profitable. The second reason is that startups can be very erratic and unpredictable – and they operate with a short-term mindset. They might not need your skillset in six months or even weeks (!) from now. They don’t have the long-term mindset of keeping employees around so that they can train them.

This mindset results in a litany of problems:

1. Lots of technical debt, with complex systems in production and not many people that know how they work.
2. High turnover is demoralising, and a lot of people decide to leave fearing they will be next.
3. An inability to gain a competitive advantage by building up in-house know-how.

(If you are wondering, yes, I have seen a startup fire an entire department weeks after hiring them.)

From the perspective of the employee, it will be stressful, especially if you have children depending on you to put food on the table.

## Is there any reason you should work for a startup?

There are some. Let’s get the bad reason out of the way: while you may get rich, it’s unlikely. What you *do* get out of working in a startup is lots of experience with a wide variety of technologies, which you won’t get if you’re pigeonholed somewhere in a big company. You will learn faster. And you will often get a stronger grounding in business problems (if you’re a technical worker) or technology (if you’re from a business background). Finally, there will be less red-tape at a startups; you will have greater freedom to try different things.

The compensation varies but I have not found startup salaries to be markedly different from the industry norm. You might want to work for a startup if they give you the best compensation (but keep in mind the downsides).

## Startups from an EU perspective

Pundits admonish the EU for having way fewer tech startups than the US. Frankly, I’m not sure that’s such a bad thing. Startups:

1. Can burn millions, yet never become profitable even years after being founded. The startup I worked for wasn’t profitable in 3 years after being founded, and didn’t plan to be profitable until 5 years in the future.
2. Can cost the clients money when their product fails unexpectedly.
3. Most never develop a useful product.

luhviv,Thinking of moving to Switzerland... How is the Tech sector there for an English speaker?,"Hello folks,

I am 26yo software engineer (Italian citizen) in the UK with 3 years of experience (1.5 years of React web + 1.5 years of Android) and I am looking to relocate to a new country. Ideally I would like to work in a country that has a great quality of life (UK isn't great) but still pays well and companies have a relaxed workplace culture. I don't like coding outside of my office hours and I like spending time on my hobbies during my spare time, so I am looking for a like minded workplace culture.

I've scrapped options like Northern Europe, the USA and Southern Europe for various reasons... Currently I am considering options like Canada, Australia and Switzerland. About Switzerland I read that most of the good paying jobs in Switzerland are in the French and German areas, in cities like Zurich, Bern and Geneva. So they possibly require knowledge of French/German. The Italian part of the country doesn't have a great/competitive IT industry, basically the same as Italy.

So I wonder, can you find well paying IT jobs in Switzerland if you only speak English/Italian? Do you get a good pay compared to the cost of living? How is the workplace culture/work ethic? How long would it take me to get employed once I get the residence there? Which city is best for my field? What are the drawbacks of life there?

Thanks in advance for the advice you will give me, and I hope I will also hear from someone with a similar background to mine :)

My working area is backend development and cloud platforms. I work comfortably with Java, C#, Nodejs and Python on Microsoft Azure for the last 3.5 years. So I applied positions including these features.

I used LinkedIn Jobs only to search.

Interviews include

* Phone call with recruiter
* Personality and abstraction tests
* Video call with managers or team leads
* Video calls with technical team about assignment discussion, high level technical talk, system design
* Video call with recruiter
* Take home assignment

1. Why does zalando recruiter has the fetish of comparing themselves with Amazon/ Google , every time I speak? I tried to renegotiate the lowballed offer and was thrown terms like work at scale , no lay off , we compete with big names etc.

2. Do they really work at scale? How do one get to learn and prosper eventually here ?

3. What is the policy of changing teams internally?

4. What are exit options from Zalando on high level , that pays good.

r8x9i2,How did I get a job in Switzerland - Senior Data Scientist/Engineer 7YoE,"**tl;dr**

*Senior Data Scientist/Engineer moved from Western Europe to Switzerland.*

*35 job applications -> 2 job offers; in 6 weeks; after 6 months of preparation.*

*Finding a job was easier than I thought, moving and settling down was the hard part!*

&#x200B;

Dear fellow redditors,

long-time lurker, first post here (although using throwaway account for privacy reasons). Always inspired by everyone here working hard and trying to make a better living by moving abroad or changing jobs. So I thought I'd add my two cents here.

Originally from Central/Eastern Europe (depending on who you ask), moved some years ago to western part of Europe. Probably the best decision of my life! After some years, with my partner we decided that we would like to move to Switzerland (good tech jobs, nature, standard of living).

**Getting that job**

I was scared and wasn't really convinced that I could get a job there. Plus my German is very poor and my French isn't much better. I am *Senior Data Scientist/Engineer*, 7YoE, introvert but can fake being extroverted pretty well for a short period of time, usual tech stack (Python, SQL, AWS & Azure) and education (masters in applied math).

**This was my job search funnel:**

* all applications sent: 35
* companies that refused me: 25
* companies that I declined: 8
* companie where I interviewed: 10
* got offers: 2
* accepted: 1

I worked pretty hard for half a year on polishing my CV, leetcoding, studying extra materials and getting cloud certified before firing my first application. I wasn't aiming at FAANGs or such. My goal was to get to a company with minimum bullshit, good team lead and interesting projects.

I was pleasantly surprised that I was getting lots of responses. The interviews were all pretty chill and uniform. Only once I had to do a leetcode style interview (one of the big McManagement companies, afterwards I sent them a strongly worded feedback about the usefulness of this). Two or three times I had a take-home assignment, but nothing crazy.

With most companies, we just discussed some technical topics, mostly tool-oriented (How does Python do garbage collection, What is a stage in Spark...) and less system-design (few asked how to improve their current data stack). Nobody asked about my German/French.

If I can give one piece of advice here, tech skills matter so much less than soft skills and presentation! If you present yourself well and can articulate your answers/questions, you are 80% hired! Everybody prefers a pleasant guy/girl over a smart weirdo.

I was aiming at somewhere between 120-140k CHF salary. Most companies offered 120k or under. But eventually got almost the middle.

**Moving abroad**

It took me around 6 weeks from first application to signing a contract. Once we had that out of the way, the moving part began. Most companies offer temporary housing and a relocation bonus, which helps a lot. Obviously YMMV, but it tooks us a few trips, probably 5k EUR for moving costs. The funny part was surviving with a non-swiss salary in Switzerland. Have a buffer of about 20k EUR.

If you search for ""finding a place to rent in Switzerland'' you will probably get really scary Reddit threads where it takes people months to get an apartment. The process is definitely a pain in the ass (million forms to fill in, renter CVs, cover letters and whatnot), but we got lucky.

**That's how our apartment search funnel looked like:**

* applications: 35
* invitation: 16
* viewings: 7
* offer: 1

And all that in a week! But we are probably outliers, most of my colleagues really needed a few weeks/months.

Even after you get a job, move to Switzerland and find a place to live, there are still a million things to take care of (how do the busses work, which health insurance to get, where to register...). However, I have to admit that Swiss administration is really efficient.

Obviously very grateful that I was given the chance to move to Switzerland. If any Swiss people are reading this, thank you! I take it seriously, trying to learn the language, integrate and contribute to the country in any way I can.

Happy to answer any questions!",2021-12-04 19:36:15

* What's the most frustrating thing for developers working on X projects?
* Who is going to be the line manager for this role?

uq1qgf,Working culture at German companies,"Hi all, i have a question about work culture in Germany (specific reference to IT, and startups etc). I am currently freelancing at a company , and it has been rocky (I'm from an asian country). I am facing some communication challenges with the team - and I have to ask for a repeat multiple times. This Team has English as a second language, so I can understand why communicating complex ideas in a language they are only conversant, and not comfortable with - can be a barrier. My questions are not understood or answered and their answers are not clear to me - and don't address the central point of my question. However, I am held accountable for not doing the work exactly as they wanted it, when in fact I try to understand as best as I can and show them proof of it. 

1. It seems as though an instruction is given- with limited room for debate and conversation and I'm expected to follow it exactly they want it. This feels controlling and I'm not used to this. Add the communication barrier and now we have it harder. 
2. The culture seems a bit punitive. i got scolded when my work was not exactly the way they wanted it - when in fact it was supposed to be for feedback, and I was told I am holding up the project.
3. They don't appreciate too many questions and I cannot challenge the deadlines in the face of new data coming in, dependencies or constraints. When I raise this, it is not addressed correctly and the impression is that I am not doing my work correctly.

So, am I just working with a difficult person (this seems to be the tone at the company however), or do companies in Germany follow a hierarchy? I'm used to working with American companies and there is room for debate and ideation. I feel like a misfit here and it's getting difficult to operate like this. Is there a cultural nuance I am not aware of here or maybe I should communicate differently? Thanks all.",2022-05-15 08:35:17
oyje75,"Extremely discouraged, can't find a job.","I am a developer with 2 years experience, doing stuff in Azure, logic apps, function apps and that kind of stuff.
I was hired right out of university into a large company with only 2 other developers, immediately I realized that both were ""rockstar"" developers that didn't like to talk to me, didn't like to document their work, no code review, no tests and preferably didn't talk to each other either. I tried learning from them at first but eventually I stopped talking to them because they would either ignore my questions or yell at me for saying ""I don't know"" when I was stuck on a problem.

I honestly thought this was the normal as this was my first job.

I mostly just bugfixed their stuff since they never planned anything and just created things on the go, any interesting projects were taken by those two. I often tried to improve our situation by adding unit tests (there were none) and documentation where I could, but it has been a losing battle. Sometimes my suggestions would just get me yelled at, and then implemented the next week without credit to me.

When covid hit I sometimes went a whole week without either answering my messages on slack which was extremely stressful, we hired new employees that have higher salaries than me (salary freeze due to covid) that *I* have to train because the rockstars don't want to.

Our team had a manager but he was mostly hands off but quit during Covid and we have not hired a new manager yet.

You might ask why I haven't just found a new job but, I can't find anything!

I was able to get some azure developer certs to make myself seem more hire-able but now that I've been applying for almost 6 months, I can't get a developer job anywhere. I have no confidence in my abilities after this job and these rejections, because I always get to the technical interview but never further. Just today, after 2 months in the hiring process and 4 interviews, I was rejected from an application, I really thought I was going to get this position but they found someone with more experience.

i40iq0,How to deal with a overworking colleague?,"We have a colleague, tech lead, who's really good at the job, I would say he's the most close thing to a 10x developer I ever saw.

The problem is that he's also working a lot of nights, weekends and holidays, much more than what everyone else feels acceptable to do once in a while. He's done this for the past 4 years.

Everyone knows about that but since his high productivity is good for the employer and it is also sometimes handy for colleagues who see their workload shrink just because he's doing so much work, no one talks about it.

Except sometimes this becomes kind of a pressure on other people that rightfully want to do their 9-18 (maybe half an hour more) and go home enjoying their life. They look like underperformers in comparison and they start to feel the pressure to also take work home.

He's also known to do aggressive ""refactors"" of other people's code. I often come in Monday just to discover that my previous week work has been changed according to his preferences ( not because it was broken code or anything else ).

I see this as some kind of psychological problem and l don't know what to do expect hoping that I won't work in his team for the next project.

They can easily work on their own and I literally have around couple of hours of tasks to do every day, half of those are meetings.

I literally work for 2-3 hours every day and spend the rest on something like:

* My side projects and/or side gigs
* Reading up on tech I want to get better at
* Playing games/watching Netflix (procrastination)

Options I see at the moment are to either keep quiet and use this time for something (hopefully something useful like side gigs to earn extra money) **OR** to have a talk with a CTO and ask for more work, projects or any assignments I can help out with.

ixq2t9,Just graduated with a First Class Honours in Computer Science from a top 20 UK university and got top mark but can't seem to even get an interview,"Hi.

I graduated in compsci in July with a First Class and was even awarded for getting top mark in my course. After applying for roughly 70 graduate/junior jobs, I can't even get an interview.

Is this normal? Is it because of covid? There are lots of job openings and since it's easier to WFH in this field, I expected to be able to land a job but I can't even get to the interview stage.

These are the questions:

&#x200B;

1. What is the monthly salary after taxes for a junior developer - it is very important for me because I would not have any financial support.
2. How much does the rent + bills + life costs in general
3. How many hours a day do you have to work 8 9 10?
4. Is it an easy task to find a job in the IT field as a junior?
5. I want to work part-time for an IT company during my last year so the company can get to know me and I can get to know them and once I finish the university we can decide to go ahead and how, do you think it is possible?  and no I don't want an internship, I just want to work 20h/week. The hole idea of the part time is to put some money apart so I can move to the country where the company is and after I graduate I would like to work for that company full time so the part time part is for me to get to know the company and save up and for the company to get to know me.

In parallel, I have been mentoring interns who were hired later which I’m still doing. 

Despite being praised for my performance all year by my manager, in casual conversations and also in our 1-1s, I was told that I was meeting expectations and that’s what he’s told his superiors, even though I feel I have been doing well above beyond the expectations set for me. His reasoning was that he felt I have a lot of potential and can’t wait for it to come to fruition. It left me a bit disappointed to be honest. Shouldn’t my performance be judged on what I delivered rather than what he thinks I can do in the future? How should I go about this?

Note: we were looking to hire a developer to my team in the summer, where I referred my friend who just graduated. He negotiated a higher salary than me (my own fault I suppose), but was eventually ghosted due to a hiring freeze at the time.

xp18e3,Got laid off from my first job before starting (germany),"I will be graduating in December with a B.Sc. in CS from a German University. Something just happened that  I would like to share:

I started applying (too) early and already got 3 job-offers three months ago in July (from a large gov. infrastructure company, an online retailer and a large fintech company) . I accepted the fintech offer, singed a contract for 49k compensation with a starting date in December and turned the other two offers down.

So I signed my contract 5 months before my starting date and have been feeling very secure and hopeful since.

Just now, I got an email from the board of directors telling me that they ""had to make some difficult decisions"" which entails that they won't actually be able to give me that job I already signed for. He will be personally calling me tomorrow morning to give me ""further background"".

A quick check of the company website shows that  just a few days ago the board decided ""cost reduction measures"", citing inflation and recession as a reason for missing financial goals. I am guessing that I am part of those costs to be reduced (...oh boy).

My contract specifies a 2 week termination notice and  contains a clause that makes it impossible to be terminated before the starting date. So I am hoping that the director calling me tomorrow will agree that I am at least entitled to two weeks of salary...

Any advice for the phone call or in general would be appreciated.

&#x200B;

Update:

The call was basically the director (who I've never had contact with prior) personally apologizing to me and owning up to the failure on their part. He also assured me that I will be getting the two weeks compensation.

""In my experience as a software developer, most developers will be in the top 10% of income in their region in the middle of their career. This may not make you rich but is about as high of a guaranteed ""floor"" of any career that doesn't require far more education or a far more prestigious education""

**When you graduate you are guaranteed to be earning above minimum wage, with a stable career:**

""CS degrees are basically guaranteed jobs at above minimum wage.

mlfrw7,How to stand out as a junior developer,"Hi all,

I'm a 33-year-old who has recently changed careers into tech. I taught myself to code last year, focusing on Javascript and React, and I'm now a full-stack software engineer using Vue and Node at a tiny London startup (only 3 of us). I'm currently on 30k, which is half of what I was on in my previous career, so I'm keen to raise my wage as quickly as possible. I was hoping for more, but I was advised to take the job because the most challenging part is getting your foot in the door. After a year, I plan to jump ship to a medium-sized company to get a more significant raise. I also would like to work with React, as it seems that this is the most in-demand stack.

My question is, how can I increase my chances of having a significant pay rise? What industries pay the most, and is it possible for me to break into these industries? It probably doesn't make a difference, but I also have a BA and MA in unrelated fields (if that helps).

I'm prepared to work hard to stand out as a developer. My plan at the moment is:

* write one blog post a week
* have different side projects focusing on React
* network on twitter
* practice leetcode
* attend networking events

I would love to hear any of your thoughts!

Thanks",2021-04-06 16:35:54
elyifh,"Don't be fooled by ""quality of life"" claims","I want to share my experience as I've seen far too many people give misguided advice citing the ""quality of life"" that Europe is usually associated with. 

My main point is: YOU have to decide what quality of life means to YOU. The usual metrics for quality of life, apart from usually being the average across the entire population, may not (and usually do not) apply to you. 

I am an EU citizen and have worked in two EU countries, in the US and now I'm in Canada. I'm a SWE at FAANG, and I'm in my mid 20s.

I see a lot of people repeating the same mantra that ""while the US pays more, the high COL and the quality of life is not comparable to that of Europe"". Many (especially European) people just take this as a fact, I believe due to a lot of misinformation about life in North America. I'd strongly suggest you try out life here and see for yourself, because it may very well be that this kind of life is what you want. It was the case for me and while it's definitely not the case for everyone, you must try it out before taking a potentially terrible decision about your life.

I'll address most of the points that are usually raised about quality of life here vs Europe, *through the lens of a software engineer* (this matters and this is what is usually not mentioned):

1) Healthcare. While I was in the US, I had absolute zero problems receiving free and excellent care (through employer's insurance, I didn't pay any premium). I have an invisible disability and it's quite a big deal, but I've never been refused care or made pay extra because of that. I can actually live a normal life due to the treatments I've received. That said, people that have a problem with the healthcare systems are mostly in the bottom of the social ladder. I'm not saying this is not a problem (because it is), but you will never face any problem as a software engineer. Canadian healthcare is similar to Europe so nothing to say, the only problem is waiting times.

2) Cost of living. I don't know where this myth/fear comes from, but any decent company will give you enough to rent and live very comfortably. Rent is usually the only big factor, but apart from that, the costs of groceries and everyday items are very comparable to Europe's costs. Even taking everything into account, you're left with much, much more money in the US or Canada. No, potatoes do not cost $10, they still cost 10 cents. In the craziest areas (Bay, NY), the salaries are adjusted in a way that no matter how much you pay in rent, you're gonna have a lot of money left over.

3) Walkability/public transport. Obviously this depends, but I've never owned a car and never felt the need for one. Public transport is very good, at least where I worked (east coast). Same for Canada, no car and don't even live in the city center. 

4) Safety. Can't speak too much about this since I've never had any incident, but if safety is a concern for you, is usually enough to avoid areas known to have problems. For the record, I used to do the same in Europe, so no change for me.

5) People. I feel like I shouldn't even be mentioning this, but there is the idea in many people's mind that North America is full of angry, rude, stupid, uneducated grunts. This is obviously false. There are smart and dumb people like everywhere else.

6) Vacation. This really depends on you, but more vacation is not always better. For me, I don't need more than a couple of weeks a year. I don't want to take more than a couple of weeks a year. If that's you, you won't have a problem here. If you need more vacation, then Europe may make more sense. Another option is a company with unlimited vacation, even though there are some catches. In FAANG, you can easily ask for more (even unpaid, as you're already making so much money) and you'll usually be granted an additional week or so.

7) Work hours/WLB. I work 38 hours a week in FAANG, and nobody is required to stay overtime, nor is anyone penalized for not doing so. Overtime is paid in Canada, and in the US as well (with some catches). Personally, I've seen people getting burned out regardless of whether they are in North America or in Europe. Don't think working in Europe means you won't be required to crunch: if a company is known to require its employees to work crazy hours, they'll do that regardless of location. You should avoid those companies altogether.

This is just to say: what you want from your professional life is not what other people want! Don't follow blind advice quoting better life because that may not be what you are looking for. Personally, it has been the best decision in my life to move out of Europe, especially after I realized all the misconceptions I had about North America while living in Europe.

Don't let other folks dictate what you want, do your research!",2020-01-08 20:40:04
y2i92o,What are your experiences in working in the USA vs Europe?,"I am currently working for a very large USA software company. The pay is mid 200s. 

There is a lot of pressure in my job. We have “unlimited” vacation, but in practice people take 2-3 weeks, plus we don’t get very many holidays (used to be more before the unlimited vacation). While on vacation, people constantly check emails and messages, and respond.

This level of being always on brings a certain level of stress and anxiety. So I am thinking of moving to Germany. I have already seen offers around 100k eur total package (base, bonus, stock). With the current exchange rate, this is less than half of what I currently make. But I would have the flexibility of moving to a smaller city, where the cost of living looks to be very low.

So, if you have experience with both worlds, what is your impression? Are European software developers more mentally and physically healthy? Is it worth giving up the money?

Also: in my product, it is ~90% foreigners from Countries with bad work cultures. I feel like they bring that work culture with them which stresses everyone out. So I am very cognizant of not bringing my America culture to Germany, and to enjoy my Feierabend!",2022-10-12 22:56:39
s9zi8t,10 months gap for recovering from burnout. am I screwed?,"27yo, italian, programmer, no degree (dropout), 3 yoe, mainly backend
(java/spring), but also did some frontend (js/jquery/angular2).

last year I burned out at my previous job due to toxic environment, pressing
deadlines and lots of responsibilities and overtime for low salary (22k gross).

I didn't look immediately for another job, I have savings and I don't have to
pay rent so I wanted to properly recover and relax before going back to the rat
race. during this period I spent much more time with my friends and family, I
went on vacation 2 times, I watched a lot of movies, I started running regularly
again and in general enjoyed life again.

on the technical side, I learned a new programming language (go) and did a few
projects with it, I read 3 books I wanted to read for a long time, I did the
advent of code challenge (r/adventofcode) and contributed to some open source
projects I use (mainly bug reports).

and that's it.

now it's 2022 and I'm updating my cv because I want to start looking for a job
again (possibly abroad) and I have this 10 months (or more) gap which I think
will look very bad in interviews (if I can get them).

I spend about 80% of my time coding, with a little team-level planning every once in awhile. Give some guidance to the junior engineers on the team. Review PRs. We rotate scrum master every 2 quarters so I'm occasionally doing that.

I look at the Senior Engineer/Tech Lead's life on my team and REALLY don't want that. He barely codes these days, is always working on architecture designs, collaborating with product or other engineering teams on department wide projects, figuring out requirements, monitoring SLOs, planning etc. 50%+ of his time in meetings based on his calendar.

This does not appeal to me at all. I make enough that I don't really care about making more. 1:1s with my manager though are all about 'what can I do to get to the next level' and I just can't get excited about more stress and responsibility.

I am not sure if I forgot to mention any missing education that I could squeeze into the list. But, what would you say are the pros and cons of each of these educations? What do employers usually want in their employees? What qualifications lead to jobs more easily?  From what I know, ""Computer Science"" is a sought-after education worldwide.

Anyway, I would rather have a good education and flexible career choices, as well as being able to switch between universities if I get into a worse one, because there are two days left until the deadline to apply to most universities, and I don't even know much about what these courses in the syllabus entail yet, much less what jobs it can make available for me. Some educations can lead to programmers, and others not (they are separated as chaff because they lack skills, one prefers e.g. engineers in computer science (?), or computer scientists (?)).

I would like to study something that can allow me to work around the world, and therefore I can increase my chances by studying at a good university. Someone had asked a question to the ”study and career counselor” at Uppsala University regarding how their education compared to those offered at other universities, whereupon they said something like this:

>Our education contains more mathematics and therefore requires more mathematics \[from High School: trigonometry, complex numbers, etc.\]. Educations that require less mathematics, such as the one at Stockholm University, are usually closer to what we in Uppsala call Systems Science/Information Systems Analysis. Computer science is more technical and, for example, goes more in depth on why programming languages ​​look the way they do. It's not just about learning the languages ​​as they are. Systems science/information systems analysis educations, on the other hand, usually address everything else that happens in programming development project, but don't address much of the programming itself. They study ”Project methodology”, for example. (Of course we address that as well, but not to the same extent, I think). It's not so easy to switch to us later unfortunately, no. Among other things due to the math, but also because we use different programming languages ​​in first year. We start with functional languages ​​here (Haskell). Most other educations begin with (and often **only** address) imperative object-oriented languages, which we begin with only in year 2.

So, what can one conclude from this? Is a more mathematical curriculum better? I'm studying Mathematics 4 by myself now (a high school course), and plan to finish it before the end of May. My grades add up to around 18.00 in the BII selection for admission, 1.0 of which is a ”merit credit”, which is from the course called English 7. I have the advantage of studying at Stockholm University as I get 0.5 in credit from Mathematics 4 if I finish it in time. Stockholm University has the eligibility requirement of Mathematics 3c, which is a step below Mathematics 4, whereas Mathematics 4 is the eligibility requirement at Gothenburg University and Uppsala University. Mathematics 4 is called Matematik 4 here in Sweden.[ Here's where you can find all the admission results for past years Autumn 2020, Spring 2021, etc.](https://statistik.uhr.se/) You'll have to type the name of the education in Swedish, though.

jiey14,Got to the final round of interviews as a senior front end dev at Twitter - there’s an hour algorithms section. What should I expect?,"Hi all,

I’ve made it to the final round of interviews for a senior front end position at Twitter. It’s a few hours of interviews back to back, the final one being an algorithms section.

I’m confident in myself as a front end developer, but as a front end dev I don’t get much exposure to the theoretical side of things. It’s pretty much 50/50 as to whether an employer will even test front end candidates on DS+A.

Algorithms knowledge for a front end dev doesn’t usually need to be much more in-depth than understanding why complexity is so important and being able to communicate with back end devs and data scientists in meetings. Because of this my knowledge has stagnated and since I got my CS degree 6 years ago my knowledge is patchy at best.

I can explain big O notation, I can tell you why it’s so important, I could tell you binary search is O(log n) - but that’s about it. What should I study? And what should I expect?

1b800wk,"people who have settled down in EU, which countries in your opinion are better to live?","In my opinion, it is the Netherlands. 

As you may know, ASML is considering moving out of NL according to [a recent report](https://nltimes.nl/2024/03/06/dutch-govt-scrambling-behind-scenes-keep-asml-netherlands-report), while more and more expats are concerned about the new 30% ruling policy and thinking about moving to other places. Ironically, the country and its people are getting upset about expats and more anti-immigrants. etc etc..

However, as an international student in NL from China, I have no better choices whatsoever. And I believe many others feel the same way. 

NL is still quite a balanced and good choice for studying and working due to following reasons: 

- loads of good programs in universities feature English teaching. And it's easy to just speak English language to study and work, at least in my industry which is tech and engineering. 

- if I want to stay longer and get a citizenship, Dutch itself is much easier to master than French and German languages. 

- Tech and engineering industry itself is good. Amsterdam and Rotterdam for high tech, while Eindhoven for manufacturing-wise Engineering. The job market of this industry is better than most Nordic countries/France/Belgié, if not better than Germany. 

- You asking why not English-speaking western countries? Well, the UK, the US and Canada right now are much harder to stay for people from China even though they have pretty good CVs and graduate from their universities. Not to mention Australia and New Zealand, their job markets for high tech and engineering are bad. 

- What about nice countries in Asia, such as Singapore, Taiwan, Japan? Well, I really want to have work-life balance and if you are living in Asia you basically cannot do that. 

- Why not go back to big cities in China, such as Shanghai and Hong Kong? Well, I don't like how Chinese people rule Chinese people from the very beginning.

* Not freezing cold the whole year (e.g Norway,Finland, Iceland).
* Good work-life balance.
* Things to ""just work"" (even in some degree) and not be a corrupted country with a ton of bureaucracy. In comparison to Greece where you may pay high taxes,but you get back absolutely nothing in exchange (if you get sick, better stay home than go to the public hospitals)

During my 30 minutes call with that technical recruiter, everything went well. When she asked me for my salaries expectations, i told her 70-75k€. I think it’s a bit high compare to french salaries for dev, but if no ones gives a shot, salaries will be always super low.

Today, she came back to me and told me that my expectations were too high and because i have 3 YoE and we are in France, i should get 55-60k. 

My question is, where all that money goes? 240M over 7 years is > 100k a day. + they have VC money and other customers for their computer vision software. Will the company be in trouble if they offer a guy 80k instead of 55? They have like 60 devs, even if they increased their salaries by 200%, I am pretty sure the financial impact fir the company would be close to 0 but they could hire more talented people.

Over the last two years the systems we are building and running became stable and we started to generate consistent profit. I think it was the point at which work has become chill and relax. Effectively we can do whatever we want as long as we keep the wheels turning and implement new features every now and then. Also, it doesn't seem like we are going to build something completely new any time soon. So as I know all the ins and outs of our platform and worked on almost every system eventually I found myself bored at work.

k91kc1,Seriously what is up with Wipro?,"My company has a big agreement with Wipro and their guys are everywhere. I’ve been on four teams here and 3 have been 80%+ Wipro people.

All I want to know is what the hell are they teaching their devs and what is their hiring process like? Has anyone else here had the misfortune of working with Wipro teams?

Most of them are nice enough people but the devs I’ve worked closely with have been clueless. Tech debt is an alien concept and they seem almost insulted when I suggest we shouldn’t be working with outdated tech - and I mean seriously outdated, like using deprecated libraries with known vulnerabilities.

I can get over bad developers, even if it is ridiculous to have to teach “senior” devs basic stuff, but their scrum masters are the worst. They take the “master” in scrum master literally and instead of facilitating agile processes for the team just lord it over everyone and bark orders at people. Their processes are childlike, we’ve got an intern who has been on my current team a month longer than I have and she is already highlighting issues and getting slapped down, I have to weigh up whether I want an argument each time this happens because I know even if I weigh in in a measured way it’ll be taken as personal criticism. I hate the idea of arguing at work, I think people who get heated in the office are scum, we’re all here to do our jobs and you shouldn’t take things personally.

Wipro must be training their scrum masters this way because they all act the same and seem to have this power complex. They’re nice to me as a lead, but I’ve seen how they talk to the juniors and it disgusts me. One even rang up one of *my* juniors 1 on 1 to berate him after he questioned whether we were doing agile properly (hint: we aren’t) and almost made him cry. Thankfully he recorded it and I took it to the head of engineering who gave the guy 1 more chance (if I had it my way he’d be gone on the spot).

It’s got to the point now where in future if I ever see Wipro on a CV it’s going in the bin. I hate to make sweeping judgements but I’ve seen enough. Even if they’re a nice person Wipro clearly teaches their devs some funky stuff and it isn’t my job to retrain people.

Sorry for the rant. I’m genuinely curious what the hell they teach their staff, because it’s beyond a joke now and something is systemically rotten with that company.",2020-12-08 09:57:07

1bi1a7b,Withdrew from a job application after receiving the take home assignment,"I'm a data engineer, currently employed, although not really happy anymore at my current job. A couple of weeks ago a recruiter reached out to me for a senior data engineer position which sounded interesting enough so I thought I'd give it a try. Had an interview with the hiring manager and a senior manager which went very well. After that, I had to do a live data modeling/whiteboard exercise which was quite difficult but I also passed it. Then, the take home assignment came. It was noted that most candidates finish this assignment in 1-2 hours. But when I looked at the requirements and started coding, I came to realize it would take me more like 2-3 full days to finish the assignment.

Add to this that in the next interview round, this assignment would not only be reviewed, I'd have to pair up with the interviewer and extend the app with some undisclosed feature.

All in all, the whole interview process (5 rounds in total including a whiteboard data modeling session, a take home assignment and a live pair programming interview) seemed over the top and disproportional to the job I was interviewing for + the company (a name I had never even heard of before), and just not worth my time.

I sent more than a thousand of application to different entry level position even though they required 3-5 years of experience. I tried calling to the managers of the job ads asking questions related to the position and there is a little bit of hoping that they will notice me.

I only received 3 interviews so far and the rest just straight up rejection emails. Honestly, it is tiring and then I met another non-EU neighbour in the same building just hammering on me about how hard it is to get a job in Denmark as non-EU and non-Danish just because she obtained her Danish permenant residence permit through her marriage. At this point, it feels like it is impossible to make the Danes to see that I have the skills and I am willing to change myself to what they are so used to.

I moved to Germany because it was cheaper than in Denmark back then after my boyfriend constantly travelled to my country in the first 3 years of our relationship. I moved to Denmark because Germany basically did not give me any chance of continuing to contribuite. Denmark always says that they welcome international workers who are willing to do and to think in the Danish way but they do not want to open the opportunities at all from my experience. 

What should I do? I do not want to go back to my home country because I haven't lived there for the last 6 years and I actually prefer my freedom in Europe. Also my boyfriend hates the idea that we will be seperated again just because the Danish government worries that I just want to use him to get a Danish passport. ",2024-01-08 12:48:22
1498p1l,OffMyChest: My manager doesn't believe the bugs I encounter are real,"I honestly don't know what to do other than scream into a pillow.

And I explain to her that the code logic, and this bug happened cause of so & so, and I have an idea of how to solve it. And she just says... ""well no that bug doesn't make sense, why do you have it?"". 

She offers absolutely no constructive criticism or any help on how to circumvent it. It's always.. ""why do you have roadblocks? It's impossible"". UGH Goddamn it",2023-06-14 14:01:55
x7ds35,Just quit my job cause of stress,"Hi everyone,
I just quit my web dev job (3+ yoe) and it was my first full time job. As a context, I live in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Non EU/EEA) country, and even though I had great salary (As a reference average salary in my country is 400 €/nett, and I had 2k €/nett) stress was killing me, multiple burnouts and complete loss of motivation for web dev, even though I enjoy working as web dev.

I still need to talk to owners and managers to define all details since I carried a lot of responsibility, but I just want to move to a country in EU so I can have more opportunities.

What would be your advice for me todo now, since basically I hadn't started applying anywhere and haven't updated my CV in a very long time?

Also, would appreciate any job recommendations that offer visa sponsorship options and ideally small relocation package (But not required).

Thanks",2022-09-06 15:41:16
vgm8sc,New to FAANG. Feeling exhausted.,"Hi,

I am working at a FAANG(Rainforest) in Berlin. I joined the team in Nov last year. Overall it's an okay team. My manager is good I think. But I am feeling exhausted by it. 

Even within the org they are on a pretty outdated stack. There are no plans to modernise and most of the updates we are doing is because they are being forced by other teams via deadlines.

Moreover I don't feel like it's a team. This maybe due to covid. But everyone has their own project. Everyone is making a doc to explain what they'll be building for the next 3 months almost. Moreover there's a lot of parallel WIP that is interdependent. I don't like this or enjoy this type of work. It feels like building on air.

I am finding this extremely overwhelming and stressful. When I joined I assumed that this was just ""growing pains"" because I've never worked at an established company before. However I have 0 motivation in this team right now.

I'm thinking about looking for new jobs or new roles within the company. I don't want to change the company right away since I believe a recession is coming and I am past my probationary period here.  I wanna bring this up with my manager but I'm not sure if I should.

So my dearest reddit, what shall I do? Should I talk to my manager about this? How do I ensure that the next switch is a good one? Am I just lazy?

FYI I'm a Mid-level dev with close to 8 yrs of exp now and I feel like I want to settle down in a team were I can stay and work for a while and learn and level up. That was part of the reason to switch to a FAANG so I could up my skillset but I feel like I'm just stuck in the dumps here. 

Or maybe I'm just no good enough and should go open a diary farm or something! Probably too dumb for that also.",2022-06-20 14:03:13

fd8xe5,Why are the tech salaries so low in EU/UK compared to USA?,"Hey there, here’s a little bit of background about myself...

I lived in the UK for 8 years and then moved to the US and am currently in my second year of college majoring in Computer Science.

Why do the tech salaries suck so bad in the EU/UK? Why don’t the people get paid as much as they do in the US? Or even 80% of what people make on average here? What’s the issue that makes companies feel like they don’t need to pay the employees as high as they do in the USA?

What’s hilarious is I recently got an internship in a High COL and if I match my per annum pay, it’s around $55k which is about £43k in GBP and €49000 in euros. As an intern, I’m getting paid much more than the average graduate in UK/EU, and I get all the benefits that a full time employee would get. Why is this the case? Seeing these kind of salaries make me want to continue living in the US rather than coming back.

15yifce,Time to leave UK?,"Hi all,

I've been working in the UK ever since graduation and now working for a big Tier 2 US company. I don't ever remember feeling this level of dissatisfaction as over the course of 5 years - I've settled and built a whole new life and adapted many different things. But it seems like the conditions in the UK are just going worse. 

- There is a massive rental crisis in major cities such as London and Manchester, many houses are not up to standard yet the rents are increasing at 20% rate.
- Salaries are wiped out with the inflation/COL crisis. But we still see the same salaries that was paid 10 years ago. 
- Employment laws in the UK are really poor. Basically you can be let go without any severance if you work less than 2 years. More than that? it's at maximum at about £630 per each year of service. I see many people are overworking, doing so many hours a week. For instance, I don't get paid for on call, which is extremely busy for our team.
- Climate... seriously, this whole summer was pretty cold and rainy. I am worried a lot as it's going to be a lot worse in the upcoming months and heating a poorly insulated house is going to be quite costly.
- Poor healthcare: thankfully I get a private health insurance from the employer. Though always experience a lot of pain when I need to see the doctor. You basically have to anxiously call the surgery in the early morning awaiting for an hour only to be seen over the phone or get redirected to pharmacy. Unfortunately the private healthcare is quite poor as it hasn't been quite common. Got referred to a specialist a week ago and I'm going to be seen 17 days later for a private appointment!

I am not quite sure if it's me being this way due to heavier work load recently but I can't really see the light in the end of the tunnel with the current government and seriously considering of leaving here. Am I overreacting?",2023-08-22 20:59:55

yvulc1,Being treated badly/weird as Junior Dev,"Hi Everyone, throwaway account. I started a junior dev role about 5 months ago and I'm questioning whether this workplace is right for me.

So I'm 23 and have a degree in CS, with some internships that involved coding, so I'm relatively new to it. I love coding so far and was always honest with my abilities to my employer. My current workplace has some issues that just strike me as odd, namely bad management: (Note, I am the youngest by far in the team, the next oldest person is 10 years older than me, most are in their late 40s-50s

\- Tickets commonly only have titles, and I get told off for not researching/asking for the acceptance criteria and ticket details the MINUTE I'm assigned the ticket at standup. I also get told off for not estimating completion time properly

\- I was never told about the company's infrastructure, the documentation is all out of date and I have to teach most things myself

\- I was told to be curious and ask a lot of questions at work, which I usually do anyway, but my manager and seniors get overly upset at most questions, or tell me things like ""what do you think, try to figure it out yourself"", ""This isn't relevant to your ticket, so you don't need to ask about it"", and most of my suggestions in meetings are insulted or called ""madness"" or ""ridiculous"" (example below)

\- It feels like I'm watched much closer than others, There is a task that rotates every week. When it was my turn, my documentation, work and progress was constantly criticized. I thought that's fine, guess I have a lot to learn, especially since I had to figure out what exactly to do myself by asking co-workers. Turns out for the last 4 months other team members did NOTHING for that task, with no consequences or call-outs from our manager. I was regularly criticized openly during standups

\- I am given HUGE tasks, which I take a longer than others for, without any senior to work with or approve any PR's. I regularly have to chase seniors, and it will take half a day to have them even look at a PR

\- When I book holidays I make sure to get written proof that I was allowed to take it (ie. via email). My manager never remembers and asks me why I was missing the day/week after

\- We have catch-ups with our manager every week, I would say that he attended 25% of them so far (I'm not exaggerating), never responds to me asking if we should reschedule and usually just ignores that he missed them.

I will give you an example of the above:

A few months ago I was tasked with moving data from an old table to a new table, with different, but mostly similar schemas. My thought process was to alter and update the old table to make sure the schemas match, then insert the necessary rows into the new table. Simple task. I asked a senior if this was ok to do or if I was missing something before making any changes. Instantly I was told that I should know to just select the required data with what's missing in the old table and insert it to the new one, and never to consider schema alterations since we aren't supposed to change the schema (due to reasons related to the company I could NOT have known). This turned into a rant about how I should be enrolled into a starter course if this is what I do, which was not professional in any way, it was rather rude and insulting tbh. I know sql, I have used sql in this very company, I just made a mistake, one that I even double checked to be sure? This person even knows I can do sql from past queries they saw me work on, which were a lot more complex.

Sorry for the long post, but is this normal? I feel like every bit of work I'm given is too vague, and I can never ask or suggest anything without being insulted. I know I have a lot to learn still, and I look forward to it since I really enjoy programming, but isn't this a bit intense? I feel so unguided and heavily criticized, considering they know I'm not that experienced yet",2022-11-15 11:34:33
x9k98f,"offer recinded in the salary negotiation phase, I am lost...","Here is the story. I got an offer from a company in Netherland, they send a contract where they decide to give base month salary xxx. 

After reading the contract, I had a meeting with them, asking a few questions about the contract, also saying that the salary is lower than market. I would like to have xxx + 1000 per month. They send an email  later that the salay asked is higher than their budget, they want to keep the original xxx a month.

So I thought maybe I can lower the salary. I write them an email asking if xxx+ 500 is possible? Then I receive an email from them that they decide to rescind the offer.

I checked some youtube video on salary negotiations. One people say company usually do not cancel offer if you try to negotiate a better salary, and you should always negotiate. Am I doing someting wrong in this process or it is simply because of this company? 😂 I am lost.

In January I verbally agreed with my boss that when I graduate then I will go for full-time, starting from September.

About a week ago I got a job offer which looks really great, so I have decided to leave my job. The notice period is 2 months, starting from the next month.

Today I had a call with my boss, I told him about other offer and that I really want to switch a job. Well, he was really dissapointed, saying that we had agreed for the full-time, that I should tell him earlier and discuss it..he didnt understand why I would do that...All of this made me think that I am a bad person and should have told him earlier.

 We decided to have another call on Friday. My boss is a great person, never had any problems with each other, I was always satisfied, but I feel that I want this change. The colleagues are also great. Salary also good.

smbkmt,How do you stay motivated at your job knowing fully well that it is a means to an end? #FANG,"I (40m) have been working in Germany for the past 15+ years, mostly in IT project management, sales and consulting. 

Besides the first few years, I have not been committed to my work as it didn't not offer anything meaningful anyway. I knew that the business is dying, performance review system is rigged, and management wants us to fight for peanuts.  It was not that I was bad at my job, in fact reasonably good but I knew that progress would come only from switching jobs. I didn't care for my job and they didn't care for me either. However, I knew that in order to stay sharp i need to do something meaningful and this way of working cannot go on forever.

Now for the past two years, I have been working at a FANG (not Amazon).  Here I feel that the pay is good, but every morning I don't get up to do anything meaningful but with a worry of how to manage my peers and other teams I am working with. At my other companies, at least we used to have a good time with colleagues and no one was super competitive, but here everyone is super competitive and often trying to self project. I feel it may be golden cage but is it a cage. There may be a potential to do some good work here but most of time is spent in managing my manager, warding off politics plus long hours and the stress which I take with me during my off time.

Rant below  
I'm 28 years of age and a developer in my second dev job now with 3 years of development experience. I have a Bachelors in CS and live in Europe.  
Been in my current job (React developer, some backend) for about 2 years now. Before worked for 1 year as a iOS (Swift) Developer which I've quit because I became so depressed somehow and felt totally unmotivated and without a direction in my life. After I quit I started psychotherapy to deal with my feelings and depression which I'm still doing.  
For the last 6-8 months these feelings of depression and being totally unmotivated creeps back in ... I go days without opening my IDE and just ruminating about how my life basically went to shit to where I am today... I have always been highly motivated in uni and graduated top of class and since then I have the feeling life is slipping out of my hand .... feeling totally lost in life.  
My first doubts about working as a dev came up when I had to do my bachelors thesis in a company for 3 months, then regularly again working full time as a dev...  
I have so many regrets not having taken these doubts more seriously and maybe started something else when I was younger... I have totally lost all my passion for this industry, have zero motivation to practice silly interview questions just to end up with writing dumb code for irrelevant jira tickets again and fighting management and stupid decisions.  
I wish I was younger and could start over again... I have developed a huge interest for medicine in the last years but my age is really holding me back (and the fact I need to go abroad to be able to study this). It is really hard to distinguish what thoughts are my depression and what is objectively the right thing to do..  
Am i depressed because of my job and direction in life or is my depression causing these problems itself..

I have had this job for the past 5 years (in hindsight, I should have left 1 or 2 years ago) and while I know we are currently in a tech slump and it's end the of year, I see plenty of companies looking for BE devs, but few looking for FE in comparison. I can't imagine what Juniors and people fresh out of uni / bootcamps must be going through right now.

Granted, I have backed myself into a corner and only worked with Vue for the past 5 years, so I kind of avoid React job postings. I know they are somewhat similar, especially with Vue 3, but the companies looking for React devs straight out reject any applications or frown when they look at my React coding challenge solutions which work, but probably don't have the years of experience and best practices implemented in them.

19cd7gd,Considering moving out of the Netherlands - where to?,"Apologies for the long post!

I am an SWE living in the Netherlands for almost a decade. Started with embedded, moved to general C++ work along with a bit of Android. Making around €75k a year. I'm getting more and more dismayed about the increasing CoL vs salary situation here. Saving maybe a €1000 on a good month. I could maybe find something higher-paying but the insane taxes don't help. On top of that and a housing crisis, we have a newly added special wealth tax for owning stocks. All in all, getting really hard to build wealth here.

So, I'm considering moving to another EU country, but really need to think this through. What I value are:

* Big-city vibes with fun things to do: bars, restaurants, concerts. Jam sessions, I play some instruments
* Friendly people: ideally love to have local friends, but I'm ok if its only expats
* Good travel possibilities
* Good healthcare
* Good work-life balance and QoL, with good career growth possibilities
* Hopefully decent social security
* I'm ok with not-so-great weather

The countries I have considered till now:

**Poland**  
Poland seems almost like a hack in EU from what I have read so far

* Salaries close to Western Europe and increasing fast
* Low-ish tax, not even considering the B2B contracting scheme which is insane (\~12%)
* I've lived in Krakow a few months and found the people to be welcoming
* Warsaw seems to have a good number of international companies to work for
* Affordable housing and CoL

Seems in the end you save way more than Western EU. Like at least 3-4k per month.

Concerns I have are:

* Are those €70k+ salaries easy to get or are outliers?
* Is it possible to have good career growth? Or are higher up positions mostly filled by locals?
* Probably going to have to go for Warsaw for more opportunities. Haven't lived there, is life there as nice as in Krakow?
* How is the healthcare there?
* Social security, unemployment benefits? NL is very strong in this area in my opinion
* Strength of Polish Zloty, inflation, etc.
* Any other catch that I'm not aware of?

**Hungary (Budapest) / Czechia (Prague) / Spain (Barcelona, Madrid)**  
Thinking of these in the same line as Poland and have similar questions about them. In addition, Spain (Barcelona/Madrid) will have amazing weather, but not sure about the economy and CoL.

**UK (London, ?)**  
Pros:

* English speaking, hopefully easy to integrate
* Lots of big companies, startups, fintech in London
* Seems like enough high-paying companies

Concerns:

* No practical idea of how good or bad the economy and QoL is realistically
* Are there enough high paying jobs or only some FAANGs? In which case I'd only move I can get a FAANG offer
* Is the salary/CoL ratio actually better than in the Netherlands?
* How bad is the housing market if you are on SWE salary?

**Switzerland**

* Great salary, even considering the higher CoL
* Beautiful country from my only visit a few years ago

Concerns:

* I keep reading and hearing that it is boring! How bad can it be? Don't people have fun?
* Hard to make friends? Can it be offset by making friends with expats?
* Are there enough jobs?
* Career growth for non-local people?
* I hear there's not much social security/unemployment benefits?
* Is the savings rate actually better than being in Poland for example?
* Probably impossible to buy a house, gotta live with that

I'm curious to hear your opinions. Feel free to write about any or all of the countries that you know of, and also suggest any other options that you think are interesting. Thanks.",2024-01-21 20:42:07
17v0fr5,My experience of finding ML/AI job in France.,"I am fresh graduate and have been looking for jobs in past 3 months.

In Paris,  US based startup and many multinational offered me a salary in the range of 54k-60k (Incl. stock+bonus) and in some cases it was just the base but without bonus or stock option . 55k base in france will be around 3200 Euros net in hand. As it comes in the range of 30% tax bracket

Companies in the province (outside Paris), offered me something in the range of 45k - 52k + stock options. However again i received some offers from american startups and big multinational that quoted Paris like salary in smaller towns.Most of the companies also had many perks in terms of restaurant tickets and transportation passes bonsus etc.These are my experiences.

To add some of my HR interviews were in French while techincal interviews were all in english.

And my Masters is from top 15 universite in france with a research based internship in the industry.

I hope it helps others!",2023-11-14 11:40:13
12ycsty,Microsoft offer (EU) - Software Engineer,"Hi everyone,

So, I got an offer for **Software Engineer** role from **Microsoft** and they are offering me two relocation options one in **Milano, Italy** and one in **Prague, Czech Republic** (Actually, Belgrade, Serbia and Dublin, Ireland are also possible choices, but I already decided that I don't want to move to these two cities). As I am not an EU citizen I need visa sponsorship, and they will cover everything with their relocation package (so full visa expenses, relocation costs, shipping my stuff, airline tickets and first 3m of housing). Basically, it is up to me to ""choose"" to which country I want to relocate (not exactly but details are not important for this). So I am curious if people here can give me some advice on these two cities, the pros and cons and everything you think is important to consider.

Please note that I don't speak any Italian or Czech language. I am good with English, my native (I'd rather not reveal which one), and German (a B1+ or even B2). So, I consider a quite important that I can live/communicate there in English or possibly German (but I am quite sure that's not gonna happen).

Something about me.

* about 5+ YOE primarily Backend, Databases and DevOps. But also experience with large scale Distributed Systems
* Degree in CS, tried Master after it but then decided to focus on job and more on a real industry career...you can say a MS dropout
* White, male, late twenties (if that is important at all)

So, I am looking for some advices preferably ""first hand"" from the people from these two cities and even better if they are working in Microsoft (experiences from other people that moved to these two countries are also welcome, and overall exp of the people that moved across the Europe). I would like to hear your experiences with these cities, companies there, the culture, prices, housing, people, life, well basically everything that is relevant for you.

Additionally, people who are working for the Microsoft, wherever, your experience with the company culture, coworkers, teams, work-life balance, perks, etc. are more than welcome.

Currently, I am not able to disclose my offer but I would like to know what is a good amount of money to life in these two towns. So, a good life with decent apartment, engaging in sports activities, eating outside, traveling, saving, etc. What I can disclose is that I got a good base salary (at lease I think), really great stocks option (vesting on 4 years), sign-in bonus (two monthly salary), relocation package (above mentioned) and yearly bonus (in percentage).

I am planning to spend at least two years there (in specific town, country) and hopefully learn local language to at least B1+ level. All the experiences, advices, your pros and cons, and everything else, are welcome :D

&#x200B;

EDIT. 

My TC is about 100k EUR gross (that is base salary + stocks) for the next 4 years (vesting period for the stocks). The salary is the same for both Milan and Prague. ",2023-04-25 08:20:37
10874sv,Dev from Ukraine looking for a life advice," 

Hello, I’m a Ukrainian software engineer who recently left the country for good with my wife, due to working conditions there getting absolutely horrible.

Currently, I’m temporarily based in Poland, and then I need to figure out the country in the EU for legalization.

I’m a 26y.o. 100% fully remote US contractor software dev 7y.o.e.(Python/js), making around 6600$/mo, and my wife works as a 100% remote product designer making 3000$/mo, that would be 9600$/mo before taxes as a household income not bound to the location

I’ve done some research and for most countries in the EU, I see that you can open up a kind of self-employment account that might have special tax rules/regimes or even temporary tax reduction programs.

We just need to sign new contracts with a newly opened up account in a country we’ll settle.

The long-term goals are - getting permanent residency or a passport, and getting a mortgage deal. Also, we’d like to plan for children in the nearest future

**What I need is advice** or general ideas for which country in the EU has more or less reasonable taxation for self-employed contractors like us, where the banks will happily give a mortgage to self-employed, residency plans, and child expenses(Also I like a warm climate, but that's not a priority).

I’ve done my own research, and I have a couple of countries in mind, but I don’t want to introduce a bias in the thread",2023-01-10 11:02:44

l1dpnl,LeetCode or projects in the UK? What's more important?,"Hey, I've been unemployed for about 3 months now. Seeing as I'm mostly applying in London/major UK cities, I thought it'd be worth it to brush up on my LC, and so I've just been practicing that, solving about 4-5 Medium problems a day for some time now. Whilst I'm definitely better than when I first started, it's going rather slow. I'm quite worried that whilst I'm dedicating all my time and brainpower into learning algos and data structures, my SWE skills and framework knowledge are slowly deteriorating.

I've only worked for about 7 months before being made redundant due to the virus, so I've got nothing exciting in terms of projects on my CV, I also barely know anything about SQL, React, or AWS, which seems to be what every company wants. Am I making a big mistake by sinking all my time in grinding LC instead of learning new frameworks/doing projects? I'd love to be able to do both, but I'm honestly finding LeetCode + DSA theory kinda exhausting, and can't imagine doing anything else after I've spent a few hours on it.

Being unemployed for so long, while hearing about how the tech market is ""booming"" all-around has been so mentally taxing I literally wanna kill myself at this point, so I need to get out of this and get good at *something* ASAP.",2021-01-20 17:22:54

1blsiox,Opinions on taking 90k€ vs my current 150k€,"My current job sucks. Only legacy code, tons of micromanagement, no desire for change, new ideas are always shut down immediately, etc. I have worked for 5 different companies before, everywhere is legacy I get that, but the extent at this one as well as the culture around it is just insane.

However, I hit the lottery in terms of salary and it’s growing to 190k over the next 2 years according to the vesting schedule of my stock options. I have an offer of 90k from a pretty cool company. My lifestyle wouldn’t change, just my savings rate would.

Am I dumb to even consider it? I would leave so much money on the table for potentially more fulfillment in my work but who knows, could be similarly bad…

I’m 28, if I just stay at this company I would save so much money but I can’t imagine not doing proper software development ever again. I really enjoyed my work in the previous companies... There’s so much more to consider but I want to keep the post concise.. what would you do? Any perspectives that could help me decide?

114rfcy,My job search experience in France and Switzerland: New grad landed a job as MLE in Switzerland," I wanted to recount my experience trying to find a job in France and in Switzerland as a new graduate and provide some advice for those still looking in this area of the world or who plan to look more. This is not a post to brag, I'm interested only in sharing information and my perspective.

A little background and context in which I found my position as a MLE :

* Searched from August 2022 - Jan 2023
* 28 years old
* MSc Statistics
* MSc Physics
* BSc Energy Engineering
* Couldn’t break into the market between the two MSc degrees (CV gap)
* Relevant experience at time of employment for position:
   * Did some analytics at a small company for 8 months before Covid hit
   * Got an internship (6months) at a big household name tech company doing R&D (not in France or Switzerland)
* Returned to study and coding for MSc in Stats (Covid years)
* Personal information (becomes relevant later):
   * Name sounds French
   * Speak fluently French (no accent), English and some German
   * I am an EU national (not French)
   * I am not white, I am a man
   * I live in France

I applied 359 times in 5-6 months, witn ⅔ of applications in Switzerland. I got into 28 interviewing processes (at least HR screening), I performed in 11 technical interviews (hackerrank, leetcode, technical know-how, take-home), 1 assessment centre and the longest recruitment process I got through is 6 different interviews for the same company. I rejected 2 invitations to interview, and rejected 1 other offer when accepting my position.

I looked for jobs on different job boards with most success in finding positions that fit on Linkedin, Indeed and Jobup.ch (I got Jobup ads that fit, the job searcher experience is just bad if you go on their website). I then usually tried to apply through company websites directly and otherwise through those platforms if I had to. I limited my search to my geographical region (East of France, Paris if full remote and Switzerland as a whole with a focus on West).

# Experience of job search in France:

It was absolutely horrendous to search for a job in France. If you don’t come from one of the Grandes écoles, Engineering schools, or famous universities, companies don’t understand your resume and why you have moved around the world. It even said in job ads for EY Lyon: your application will be considered if you come from an engineering school….for a financial auditor position(?!?). I know financial engineering is a thing, but there is a serious problem of ageism and “not in the right box”-syndrome in France.

I was told that I was too old, traveled too much, and wasn’t attached enough to France. I speak perfect French (I went to a French school as a kid), my partner is French and I live in France. I really don't think you could guess I'm not French if you didn't know it before. Make it make sense for this company that I interviewed for who needed someone to do everything from data engineering, MLOps and analytics while interfacing with their biggest american client.

Candidates are treated like shit. I can safely say that after 100+ applications. When applying, you’ll either have to get in through recommendation (understand nepotism from your uni/school contacts and alumni) or then get an automated answer to your application saying that if you don’t hear from them in 3 weeks, then you should consider not being retained. There was even a job advert in Grenoble saying as the first recruiting point “Do you want to work with people coming from these prestigious schools? Work in a competitive environment? Then come work for us”. I went to look at their website and lo-and-behold, it’s just a bunch of white dudes 30-40s with brown hair and variations exist only in presence of beard and/or glasses. Not a single woman and not a single person not coming from the schools advertised. Do you mean to tell me that they couldn’t find anybody qualified from one of those schools that doesn’t fit this bill? I don’t know if it says something worse about the company, the people working there, the state of higher education ,diversity of origin and walks of life in France or all at once.

**Interview experience in France:**

I had three interviewing pipeline experiences in France. First one was great, it was at a scale-up (turned towards global markets) that allowed full-time remote and I was just not a good fit for a dev position. I got this interview through recommendation because there was no way to get it through their recruitment page. For the second one, it was clear after 5 minutes that the person I was talking to didn’t want to be there and was just doing due diligence and asking generic questions. I got a generic answer that they were not currently looking for anyone after the call….but then why the hell do you have a job ad still posted on your website (job ad dated from 2020)? The last interviewing experience was honestly weird and I am going to let you make your own assumptions about it. I first got a phone call from the recruiter who talked to me about the position. It was the one that was advertised as “Data Analyst” but after some questioning, it looked more like it was a bit of everything and there was no Infrastructure on which to rely on so DE, MLOps, DS, DA jobs all rolled into one with extra hours not counted and being on probation for 8 months because you’re a “cadre” (management status role in France). I told I was interested and wanted to pursue the interview process (I like myself a challenge). I then had a video call. I could see the surprise in the face of the interviewer when they saw that I apparently didn’t look how they expected. I was then grilled about my CV, why I travelled so much, where do I live, why do I speak so good French, why do I speak so good English, what school and Uni did I go to (it’s written on my CV…..). Anyways, I got the talk about being too old (“a certain age”) and all the other stuff after that. So I never really got to do any technical interviews for any of the positions. I got HR’d out of all processes.

I don’t want to be pitied for the things I’ve gone through because I don’t want to work for people who behave like this. I honestly believe that France loses on talent and fosters a culture of bitter workers because of how hostile upper management culture vs. management vs. anyone below is. If you don’t fit the French mold and plan from highschool to prépa to école d’ingénieur to company, I would advise you to look at another job market. The market is missing out on talents, people who think out of the box, people with diverging and innovative opinions and that’s too bad for them. I could go on about French history, the labor market evolution in France and divestment from democratic processes, but this is not a post about that.

# Experience of job search in Switzerland:

It seems that there are a lot of companies that are hungry to fill in positions at all levels but like for everything, they mostly want experienced individuals. From my understanding of the market when I was looking, people who have 3+yoe and do front-end or fullstack dev should have an easier time than others. There are a lot of positions that don’t have a very good pay (for Switzerland) that will hire more junior people, but they probably have a retention problem once people hit that magic 3 yoe number. These positions are in academia and public sector usually.

There is a federal obligation for the employer to answer every single application that comes their way. It can be generic, it can be 2 months later, but it HAS to come. This seems insignificant, hard on morale when you’re looking for a job, but at least I didn’t feel as dehumanised as my experience in France. Some people are even open to giving you feedback about your application.

So that’s the good news, on the down side, the companies can sometimes be quite picky and not give you a lot of room for mistakes during some of the technical interviews. After all, they do have to filter somehow since they get so many applicants who are after that good swiss pay. You need to have your wits about you and your nerves under control for this. I guess that is general advice, but good to keep in mind here. Practice makes perfect and will get you a long way ahead.

**Interview experience in Switzerland:**

I’ve had several kinds of interviews from behaviorals, OAs, take-homes, video interviews and I can say that I mostly had a positive experience. I got better as I did more interviews of course and it’s a shame that I didn’t get to show my best for some of them, but that’s life. Sometimes you underperform or bomb interviews. 

Swiss companies like remote interviewing and will ship you out for on-sites if they’re really interested and there’s only a few candidates left. For my current position as an MLE, I had an asynchronous interview with generic HR questions, a 1 week take-home project (honestly, this was fun, but quite time consuming) and then a technical video interview before receiving the offer a week later.

# Conclusion:

It’s rough out there for new grads. The hiring gets hot usually starting in August for the end of the year for the most part. I am not enthusiastic about working in France and I remember seeing the post on this sub of a 40+ year old dev in France who bemoaned the job market situation and it being difficult to change jobs at his age in France. I completely believe and understand him. In this case, it seems the pastures are greener elsewhere. My search process is skewed because I didn't look very hard in Paris that has a lot of job opportunities as a DS, but I don't want to live in that city and friends who lived there have moved back to Lyon. The job search in Switzerland is hard, but companies are looking for people even now. I still think I got quite lucky to find this job especially at this time. I am working in western Switzerland where knowing French is a perk, but did not come in the balance for my position. I use English mostly at work with occasional French for informal conversations with some colleagues.

 My best advice to job-searching new grads or prospective grads is to get your CV checked by people who are in the industry, people with HR experience, prepare well for interviews by finding resources and finding the kind of questions asked on glassdoor and finally expand your network and meet people outside of your circle of tech people. You’d be surprised what other industries need your talent.

I'm looking forward to providing more information if anyone is interested and clarify my perspective.",2023-02-17 16:47:23

t93ump,What I noticed from applying to over 40 companies for new grad/junior jobs in the UK,"First of all, I need to thank kind random strangers in this sub for your advice the last time I asked about my CV and job finding in the UK [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/rpcc7n/need_advice_for_an_entryjunior_levels_job_in_the/).

So this is somewhat a follow-up thread of what I have faced after around 2 and a half months of applying to over 40 companies (FAANG like, non FAANG like and startups) for new grad/junior jobs in the UK.

- The CV screening was really brutal. Even though I am currently studying in one of the top universities in the UK + having full-time work experience back in my country, I still got a whole lot of rejections at this stage. I think my experience is not half bad, according to what people said about my CV the last time I asked. It might be because of the way I organise my CV, idk, but the fact that I got rejected during this phase still stands.

- HR interview. Well, if I have to rate my English skill, I would say it is on the lower side in the UK I suppose. I could comfortably communicate with the interviewer, but I oftentimes couldn't convey what I thought in such details without the interviewer having to ask me questions or repeating what I said. I did not fail at this stage a lot, but I did still fail.

- LeetCode is what most companies care. Even if I passed the CV screening, oftentimes, I would be failing at this stage. I could be the best candidate as a junior software engineer, if I couldn't ace all the LeetCode problems they gave, I would still be rejected here. Up to 40 companies I've applied to, there was only a couple of companies that did not give a single LeetCode type problem to solve for the online assessment (note that they were still coding problems nonetheless). And those companies are ones of the companies that I got moved to the next stage.

- Final/Onsite interview. Out of 40 companies that I applied to, only 3 companies that I managed to get into this stage. I still haven't gotten an offer from any of the companies, however. One company told me that I have quite strong programming skills (obviously), but I might not be the best when it comes to communication or expressing my thoughts.

I am slowly getting better at this though. I feel like the more I get into the interviews, the better I am at it, at least that's what I feel. The first few rejections were somewhat heartbreaking for me, but after it passed a certain number, I just feel numb towards them.

The following things I am going to say might be somewhat hot takes and could straight-up be wrong, but they are my collective feelings during the past 2 and a half months.

- The problem I have is people here do not seem to care about my work experience from my country AT ALL. For some of the jobs I applied to, I felt like I could easily do the job right at the get-go because of my experience, but nah, I didn't even pass the CV screening. 

- Also, I felt like I am somewhat gatekept by the LeetCode wall that sometimes I just couldn't pass. I grinded LeetCode occasionally when I was going to have a coding interview in the upcoming days, but I did not grind it outside of those time.

- Communication skills (English) might not be the most important factor, but it is something that can be determined if you would get the job or not.

- What people say about being in a software engineering field is easy to get a job is an awful lie, well, at least for non-EU people here I suppose.",2022-03-08 00:26:32

1al074e,all i do is copy code - is this normal?,"hey there!i'm a junior java developer. i've been out of university for two years now and i'm working full time at a telecommunication company. my team develops microservices.

whenever i get a story, all i really do is copy and paste code. if i get the task to add a GET request to one of our services, the seniors always tell me to look at another service and just copy the exact way it was done there. maybe the name of the query parameters are different and i need to do some adjusting, but that's it. i copy and paste the resources, services, even the unittests.

last year i got the task to create a whole new microservice from the ground up. i was so excited to finally learn how it's done step by step. but then i was told just to copy an existing one adjust it. most of my ""work"" was changing method and class names to fit the name of the ""new"" service.

i feel like i'm not really learning anything. sure, i know how our projects are structured and how the components communicate with one another but i feel like if i ever get a task where i wouldn't be able to copy and paste something i'd be screwed.

is this normal? i know that it's common for developers to copy and paste certain parts if they get stuck and can't come up with a solution themselves. but copying every single line of code and never do any real coding seems a bit unusual for me.",2024-02-07 10:46:25
15qlr4c,"Those of you who have 10+ YOE, where and how do you find meaning outside and in work?","I'm 35 have just 2 years of experience (in commercial tech). Although I'm earning a lot ($100k/year in total compensation in quite well-known company) and have more money/things than I even knew a regular person can have (grew up poor) and I *like* my work and colleagues - I have this feeling of it not being meaningful *enough*. 

I'm just coming off my vacation, and it struck me during it that even if my job is meaningful, my labour is being used to make the people at the top of the company even more obscenely/disproportionately rich. They are also undermining workers and treating them in callous ways. They lie/make what look to me like uninformed/damaging decisions to both workers and users (caveat, I am a layman so may be wrong) - then dress those actions in *very* pretty words. Focus also seems to be on company shareholder price and money, money, money rather than actual value for people.

And there seem to be no consequences to those at the top for doing this. Even when they decimate people's lives/projects, they get massive checks and promotions anyway  - then sometimes quit to jump onto the next company to possibly do the same there.  It feels dysfunctional and I wish my time and labour wasn't used to support people and systems like that.

It struck me that even if worked at like FAANG and earned twice as much (what would I even do with the money?) I would probably see the same thing there and feel the same discontent. 

On top of this there are truly existential ongoing global problems - climate change, rise of fascism, people not having access to healthcare, poverty, violence against minorites etc. And here I am spending 8h every day making rich people (that I don't even like) richer.

So my question is to those of you who have lots of experience and have seen your fair share of this, how do you cope with it and find meaning in your life and work? I don't want a family, and I have been considering going into an academic field (I know academia has massive issues too) but at least I would hopefully be working to advance science for the betterment of people and the planet. How are you approaching work and life with all of these complexities?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: just want to thank you so for all your thoughtful responses, they have really made me feel like I'm not alone in struggling with this, and I appreciate your perspectives on how you view yourself and how you personally cope. Truly, thank you all. It's been weighing heavy on my heart. Some comments have hit extra right for me, so I will try to act on those for now and see how it feels.",2023-08-14 05:45:14
122i4fn,"salary sharing thread does not give enough info - can we elaborate further? how would you describe your living standards, considering the job you have and the city you live in?","i feel like this is more essential than a typical salary sharing. how can we spend the salaries at that location is more valuable info right? so generally an answer including these info would be very good ->

* firstly: the city/country you live in and current job/salary with the level you are in. obviously after taxes are deducted.
* how long it took to get to that level? what salary did you start with and what do you expect as the highest when you are a senior?
* then for the budget for your life in that location:
* are the necessities like rent bills and food hard to cover? if you live with roommates or family that is relevant.
* how much extra money is left after the necessities? what that could be spent on?
* for example, how many times in a month do you eat out? do you buy unnecessary stuff like cosmetics or stupid decorations, does that push your budget?
* do you travel, or have any hobbies, perhaps art or a sport you picked up? how much does that push your budget?
* how hard would it be to achieve a budget for building your life there? i mean, can you buy a car or a phone easily? furnish an apartment with the basic household appliances and minimal furniture?
* does the workload you have (because every country differs in this considering the work culture) reflect you salary and give you enough space for a good work life balance? i mean, do you get enough time (in your opinion) to enjoy your salary?

i hope this isn't too much to ask and i hope this doesn't get blocked for being the same as pinned thread - i do feel it's different, and i kinda need the info to choose a city i'll move into because i am applying to master's studies and don't want to land in a city where i will struggle studying and working at the same time without outside help tbh...

thank you in advance.",2023-03-26 10:29:49

He received an offer for the equivalent of $60-70k for an on-site position in a northern European country with effectively the same title (e.g. Sweden, Norway). He's married, sole-earner, and has two kids - he's currently got a mortgage on a house here in the US. If he left for Europe, he presumably could sell the house or rent it out. He's pretty dissatisfied with the general political / social climate in the US and seems to think going to Europe will be much better

172srvk,Where are the high paying SWE positions in Switzerland?,"I'm a software engineer from Germany. On this and other CS subs I often read about Switzerland as being one of the places where SWEs can make really good money. My question is though ... where are these positions? 
The ones I see and get offered on LinkedIn top out at 130k CHF, which is not little, but when you factor in the increase in cost of living in a city like Zurich it's really not a lot more than what people make here.",2023-10-08 07:08:55
1608da6,French salaries aren't actually *that* low...,"...it's just the taxes are absurd.

This is based on an analysis I had to do recently for some salary negotiations between a few different countries. Details may be off (there's a *lot* of exceptions in most tax systems), but the general idea should hold.

Let's consider three countries: France, Germany, and the Netherlands. For simplicity, we'll use the capitals - Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam.

According to level.fyi, median gross salaries for the three cities are 61k, 81k and 91k respectively (all in EUR). So French companies are just super cheap and underpay developers, right? Yes, but not by that much.

The thing about gross salaries is that they're actually a pretty arbitrary midpoint between the total cost paid by the employer, and the net salary received by the employee. 

The question we should ask at this point is - how much does the median salary actually cost the employer? Again, details will vary, but using an [online calculator](https://www.deel.com/employee-cost-calculator), we can see that the salaries correspond to respectively 90k, 97k, and 103k. Still a difference, but not that drastic.

Looking from the other perspective, let's consider what's the real cost of a 100k salary is. Turns out it's 112k in the Netherlands, 117k in Germany and a whopping 152k in France. So no wonder you can't get a 100k salary in France, even if you get a fairly generous employer - it's just too expensive.

Does the level of public services in France justify such a huge discrepancy? No, so I still don't recommend working here. But maybe this will be helpful to negotiate salaries with international employers who think that 80k of total cost is a good salary.",2023-08-24 17:27:45

11sob37,How salary progression should be,"There's a lot of questions about the salaries on this sub. Here i will describe how i see how optimal salary progression should be.

First of all, my experience. I came from non-EU country. Moved to Germany already with 5YoE(commercial, had some YoE as a hobbyist before that). Here is my salary progression before relocation:

* 1st year -- 8K. Was very much lowballed. Another person with less experience(0 commercial, 0 as a hobbyist) earned 30% bigger salary than me. My problem was the lack of formal edu and of confidence. I worked there for 7 months. After which took a break to do my own project(which i really hoped would turn to the startup, but, ofcourse, it didn't). Which contributed to more than doubling my salary.
* 2nd year -- started with 18K. Worked literally 12 hours a day in the office. Plus a lot of learning on the weekends, no social life helped a lot.
* 2nd year and 3 months -- 22K. My first promotion. Without me asking for it.
* 3rd year -- 26K. Started with promotion.
* 4rd year -- 36K(+ 4k bonus) = 40K .switched the company(and tech stack from Python to Golang). Started getting familiar with cloud native technologies. Worked on Kubernetes controller. Contributed to open source, most significantly to controller-runtime project(which was in the yearly stage), Gave 3 talks at the conferences.
* 5th year -- 42k(base). Started with promotion. And immediately jumped to another company. Located in Germany)

So from here starts the sad part of my story. First of all, if i only understood the CoL and taxes in full, i wouldn't relocate to Germany. Then German companies(the smaller ones that i worked for now) NEVER do promotions, no matter what, if you don't have an offer on your hands.

* 5th year and 6 months -- 67K. First company in Germany. Worked a lot outside of work hours. Did some initiative projects for them. Despite the company being recently funded(30m$, they talked about it very loud publicly), they refused to give me the promotion, stating that they don't have any single contributor positions higher than Senior at the moment and they don't do salary raises without promotions.
* 6th year -- 77K with 65k base, the rest is bonuses. Switched the companies, as i loved the tech and the project of the new company. During the first year, contributed a lot of to related open source projects(K8s and networking related ones). Written few blog posts on the project blog. Gave one online talk about the project(basically an ad of the project, of which i'm a little bit ashamed right now). Learned a lot about networking stuff during this, which i loved.
* 7th year -- the same salary. With the same bonus. To be clear, i didn't asked for a raise. I expected that they would notice and do the raise themself. Didn't happen. So i became disillusioned and started to interview with other companies.
* 7th year and 5 months -- 80K with 71K base, the rest is bonus. Basically, i got an offer from another company(85K(including bonuses). Decided to stay at the company despite the lower salary, because i did interviews with FAANG and hoped to jump there really soon.

Now, I interviewed with few FAANG companies during the summer last year. Actually past HC in one of them, but hiring freeze then layoffs came. And so, i'm 7 months in, still waiting for TM, still talking with my recruiter. Meanwhile, my 8th year started without promotion. I didn't even tried to ask.

The point of this story is, from my point of view, Germany has a real problem with salary raises. Even when you try to be exceptional. You guys, shouldn't be as naive as i'm. Ask for what you think your worth is!

For all the beginners, 60K, in current economic climate and recession, it's your minimum worth. Take the offers with less salary, for sure, but start interviewing immediately. Aim at 10% increase in salary each year. Stop simping to employers. Demand your worth!

P.S. Happy ending, i guess. I have an offer for 110K(base, no bonuses, no stocks unfortunately, although the company is publicly traded) from one of the, somewhat known(non-startup), German companies.

P.P.S. I believe, that good salary progression will benefit everyone. Seniors and Juniors. Currently, it's easy to see that someone with 8YoE works for 70K. While Juniors would cost 50K or more. So not that much of the difference. Companies just don't see why they would want to invest in Junior which costs almost the same as the Senior level engineer. We, as developers, need to organize and make salary progression real.",2023-03-16 08:38:51

lkafw0,I feel like I have not learned too much as a new graduates after 1.5 years,"I work as a Software Engineer in a US bank in London.

I started in 2019 as a fresh graduate with a background in engineering rather than CS.

The programme is structured such that I will experience 3 “movements” around software engineering disciplines throughout the 2 year programme.

I started in a _____ role in a backend team, am currently in a ___ team, and will be moving to an mobile team as an iOS dev in the coming months as my last movement.

The thing is I feel like I haven’t actually done a lot of programming, and that which I’ve done has been relatively basic. I have set up a lot of infrastructure in AWS, which seemingly takes forever since there are a bunch of corporate hoops to jump through.

I imagine if I were in a startup I’d be a lot more hands on and getting my hands dirty and experiencing a lot more (with a lot of stress to go with it).

The life I currently have is fairly stress free, it doesn’t really matter if I don’t complete work on time as there aren’t any strict deadlines. I try to be quite disciplined and do the work I have assigned, and I’ve spent a lot of time outside of my team practicing soft skills and developing my influence across the tech department outside of my core role, for example, helping the new graduates settle in and working with the grad programme team to improve the programme.

Ultimately I want to use this time in my career to learn as much as possible, but as it stands I feel that I spend most of my time in meetings and have little time to spend learning the core function I’m employed for.

My question is this: is this a normal experience as a fresh grad in a large corporation? Does any one have any tips or advice?",2021-02-15 09:49:54

I'm 23 and got a bit more than 3YOE but one is part-time , do you guys think is a fair offer ? The market is a bit shitty, so i guess most of the companies are rejecting application if they need visa sponsor.  
In any case it will be a big jump salary from what I'm currently making (i know that London is expensive) but in any case from what i was looking around I should be more than good.  
I think I'm mainly moving to London to get the ""next step"" in my career and progress technically.  Hopefully in the future, because i already live in London will be much easier finding new jobs even in FAANGS.  


Thank you guys for the help!!",2023-12-13 09:44:30

z5w5j8,Am I getting fired?,"I'll keep this short. I was hired three months ago as a junior developer  to simply run a pipeline on different data that a senior developer had developed. It was expected that there would be a few bugs and those would be simple to fix. I had two months to make sure the pipeline worked.

I fixed a couple of bugs, rewrote a bunch of scripts as they didn't work well and improved a lot of other things. However, I missed the deadline and the pipeline still didn't work. Unfortunately people always kept reminding me how the other developer never had these issues (basically it is/was always assumed that I destroyed working code).

Today, I am either finally getting some help or getting fired. I was asked to onboard new people to help with the project. In retrospect, I should have asked to work with a team instead of solo.

How do I recover?

wv0lvd,Called incompetent by senior and scared to face my team now,"Hi!

I have been working as a software engineer for a few months now and recently I asked a senior for feedback on my first PR. One of the suggestions the senior made was something I had tried before but it didn’t really work as I wanted it to work, hence I informed the senior about this. The senior proceeded with instructing me on how to implement it that way and so I followed his instructions. At some point he asked me why I didn’t try to implement it this way before and then I mentioned again that I did try that method and it didn’t really work, hence why I chose this other method that seemed to work. The senior proceeded with telling me that if I don’t know why it works then I lack knowledge. He then proceeded with saying that he doesn’t know how to talk to someone who lacks knowledge and is trying to dumb down his way of speaking to me in a way that he has spoken to someone unknowlegable he knew before.  He said this loudly in the open office space so everyone on the team overhead the conversation. Another senior also informed me the day before that I lack some knowledge, but he said it in a nicer way and when we were alone. I haven’t been to the office since that day and I feel uncomfortable facing my team now as I fear they‘ll judge me even more. I’m trying to do spend my weekends and also evenings on understanding the code syntax better, but I guess I’m just not a fast learner.

Would anyone have any tips on how I should proceed from here? I’m considering asking for an internal transfer or even resigning due to not being able to face my team anymore… But resigning is really my last option as I rely heavily on having an income.",2022-08-22 18:02:50
tq99ft,The other side of the IT workforce shortage,"On one side I am happy the our profession is in high demand, it means it is easier to find a better job or to get raises. On the other side my company is struggling to complete all the scheduled projects and the hiring process is going really slow, this translate into undersized teams and too much workload on some people, which leads to worst results in terms of code qulity (skipping tests, wrong abstractions, permissive peer reviews  etc.).

rkuq45,I worked 3 weeks as an unpaid intern at a Swiss startup,"A little bit of context : 

I thought I was hired at a Swiss startup based in Geneva to work as a backend dev in Python. But when I arrived at the workplace on Monday 29th November, the hiring person who is also a member of the dev team announced me that my employment contract will only be established in mid-January because they said they were really busy for December (to me, it was just a lame excuse to not pay me at the end of the month).

Nonetheless, I accepted their offer to do a trial period because my goal was to be truly hired as an employer but also to gain experience in the CS field. In fact, I pretty much had no experience with the technologies they used so I needed to follow tutorials for 1 week. For the first week, my dev team also needed to order computer pieces at the workplace then build a desktop computer with Linux installed on it. But I think it's something they should have done before my hiring...

Anyway, I started to work one week later on web scraping/spiders, configuring Docker and my dev environment first and foremost. I had a discussion with them to talk about my salary because it was unclear, but they told me that it was not a trial period but an unpaid internship... so they lied to me in the first place and made me believe wrong (on the recrutment website and on the calling interview, it was NEVER mentioned that it was an unpaid internship). They said they absolutely needed to hire a backend dev and that they would consider to hire me in mid-January if I work hard and prove them I'm worth it. I was not guaranteed to be hired but I decided to continue the internship for the experience and have a chance to be hired.

So, I continue to work for them for 2 weeks full-time until the 17th December and pretty much finished my web scraper (so I added some value to the startup and consequently should be paid). On the previous day, I received a call from my unemployment advisor and informed her that I would NOT be paid at the end of the month and that it was an unpaid internship instead. She said me that it is illegal in Switzerland to work for free and advised me to leave the internship as soon as possible. She also asked me to give the startup's phone number to call them for illegality, which I did...

What happened after the call is that I informed a member of the dev team about it and soon after, they decided to end the internship and offer me a gift of 200 CHF (without taking the restaurant outing prices in consideration). But now, they could pay me way more because my unemployment advisor will call them and ask to make a contract for me. If it happens, then it would totally be deserved because of the fact that they lied to me in the first place and their dishonesty concerning the employment promise.

What do you think about my story ? Do you agree with me that they should pay me more for the work I've done ?",2021-12-20 19:13:38

kbms5t,"American working in Sweden, wondering if I should consider working in one of the other Nordic countries in the next few years","I'm from the US and I have been working in Sweden for about 3 years now ever since I graduated with my masters. I work in Stockholm as a backend developer and I make 46,000 kr/month before taxes (~4500 Euro/month) which according to the Swedish engineering union statistics is a bit higher than average for someone my age and with my years of work experience. I'm honestly quite happy with my salary. I can live very comfortably in Stockholm on this salary and have no problems affording a 2 bedroom apartment, a car, and other expenses.

I'm planning on staying in Europe for the foreseeable future and eventually gaining Swedish (or other Nordic) citizenship and renouncing my US citizenship if necessary. I know not every country allows dual citizenship so I may have to renounce my US citizenship and I have no problems with that at all. I'm wondering if it is worth considering a move to another Nordic country (Denmark, Norway, Finland, or Iceland). From what I have heard the social services and lifestyles are very similar to Sweden so it could be a compelling opportunity. Just from browsing online it does appear that salaries in the IT/software industry are similar to here in Sweden, though in Denmark and Norway they do appear to be a bit higher, but the cost of living is also higher in those countries. I do speak conversational Swedish (passed svenska för invandrare and also svenska som andraspråk grundläggande courses 2-4, but not SAS 1-3 yet) so I think learning Norwegian/Danish wouldn't be too hard, especially since I can already understand a lot of them when they are written since the written languages are very similar to Swedish.

But what about non-tech skills related to the job? Or minor things like some chart library, or a big well known API like Google Maps API? And as a front-end developer, should I even mention HTML?

As an experienced software engineer (15+ years), I often get offers from these two cities and as an immigrant myself in another European city, I was wondering why not attempt for another move before settling in indefinitely.

With a toddler and a newborn, Berlin seemed like a good choice since schools are free and the cost of living overall is lower compared to London. However the recent elections, the rise of AfD, hate against immigrants on the east side are concerning. 

London is a multicultural city just like Berlin, expensive, no free kindergarten, but England and the uk overall seems to be more tolerant in this case. Especially now that it’s not so easy to move, so foreigners that are arriving in London or any other city are generally skilled ones. 

So given the current scenario, with a good offer in hands from both cities, as an immigrant, which one would you consider to go? Is the rise of far-right in east Germany to be concerned?

I’m already leaning towards London, but didn’t want to discard Berlin right away, but political scene seems scary.",2023-07-08 08:01:50

Few months ago I applied for dozens of jobs on NOIR website, on different locations across Europe, and different domain areas... and guess what happened.

Red flag #2: After a while, I contacted several NOIR recruiters on Linkedin and again, I did't get a single word back. No reaction whatsoever.

Red flag #3: Then I looked on employees' pages more carefully. They all look like bots with ML-generated photos and descriptions. They have some activity, such as likes and reposts... and again, it's all can be automated. They produce no unique content, no human-made posts or articles.

In the end, I've excluded NOIR from my job search filters and reported it as a scam on Linkedin.

14zhx1c,Will Germany's new immigration laws bring down the market salary for software engineers in the country?,"The minimum salary requirement to bring non-EU workers was 58k. Now, it will be around 42k. For tech people (shortage occupations), it was around 45k, and they will bring it down to 39k. The basic economics I learnt in school makes me feel that this change will bring down the overall salary of software engineers across Germany because companies want to pay the least amount of money to get max value, and they can hire cheaper workers from abroad due to the lower Blue Card limit.

Theoretically speaking, this won't happen if people don't accept low-ball offers. However, different forces affect micro-economics vs macro-economics. For example, theoretically, if you don't ask for higher wages and just deal with the rising prices due to inflation, it will actually help the economy from a macro-perspective (there will be fewer money chasing goods instead of too much money chasing few goods). However, individual's minds don't work with macro-economics in their head. Similarily, on a large scale, the current market salary of software engineers in Germany will only sustain if ALL potential new employees reject low-ball offers, which is unrealistic.

Here I was hoping that the market salary increases due to the recent inflation. However, the opposite will happen. Living expenses will rise due to inflation and wages will go down due to lowered limit.

fcsitt,State of software engineers in London,"Recently I interviewed for a company [cuvva.com](https://cuvva.com) in London for a backend position (my overall experience is 9 years). The full process took 42 days and and was set in different stages as below:

1\] **Introductory** call

2\] **Code challenge** (they say don't invest more than a couple of hours but that's a lie and you will not even finish in couple of hours. Also, even if you do manage to  finish in few hours, they will reject it because you invested less time so it may not be to their standards and so it's completely a paradox. I invested more than 2 full days completely, wrote documentation as asked and luckily it got cleared)

3\] Tech interview.

4\] A **2 hour long tech** interview split as design and coding questions

I managed to **clear** all of their rounds and moved to step 4 (last step) of the interview process which was 2 hours long. With all honesty I would say that the difficulty was fairly average and I did put in a very good interview (even explained surrounding concepts to the asked questions which would show deeper understanding) as I was well experienced with the questions asked and also completed the tricky coding questions by sharing my screen.

I also cross verified the tricky questions I answered and they were all correct. It was one of those interviews where I felt I did put on a great interview overall right from code challenge and in all 4 stages there was not a single question which I answered incorrectly (also cross verified after each interview while preparing for next interview).

After almost 42 days of process (all 4 stages combined) I got the call from the company HR saying that they are rejecting my candidacy. When asked them what happened they mentioned for ""a few"" questions I explained ""more deeper concepts"" than required and for 1 tricky question asked, even though I answered correctly, I took ""a bit"" more time to finish it (though it did not extend the interview time at all and ignored the fact that I answered it correctly). They also mentioned they would like to keep my details  as they enjoyed chatting to me in an overall process of 42 days and would like to keep me as a backup option if something comes up in future or they didn't find anyone suitable (I said them no and not to bestow me with such a power ;))

I really felt they were looking to reject for any damn reason and the feedback was not at all credible. Yes any company has the right to hire anyone they want but atleast the review should be credible and trust based but companies like cuvva.com get away by treating their candidates in any way (whiles expecting unicorns from them for poor salaries) as they know there won't be any consequences and people will continue to apply to their positions regardless how how they treat them.

This was my 5th poor experience in London where I felt the interviews went good and didn't had much substance to reject and they still end up being rejected (those companies ended up looking for candidates for those roles for a very long period of time a few of them even after a year). Hence I thought I would share my experience here with the community. 

I interview for senior positions where the competition (albeit high) would still be okay but then I think if this is the case here with 9 years of experience then what would happen to candidates who are junior or mid senior and looking for software dev roles in London. Companies know they are desperate for a job and can literally make them dance on their tunes in the hope that they would give them job. 

Companies in London these days are expecting **unicorns** from a software developer and so many positions have requirements spanning multiple pages while **benefits** are **mere** few lines (they really find it difficult to come up with anything good) with **poor** **salaries**. 

**These days most of the job description will look like below:**

1\] Should know front end frameworks such as React.js/Vue.js/Angular.js

2\] Should not worry with HTML5/CSS/Saas/Less

3\] Be fluent in backend languages such as Java, Node.js, python, golang etc. preferred Node.js/golang

4\] Should have strong inclination towards devops with docker and kubernetes

5\] Should have good hands on with NoSql ex. mongoDB and postgresql.

6\] Should know your way with various AWS services.

7\] Build CI/CD pipelines with CircleCi/jenkins etc.

**Bonus points for:**

1\] Automated testing with cypress/jenkins etc.

2\] Know your way with CSS preprocessors and those concepts are not alien to you.

3\] Prior knowledge of python 

4\] Active in stackoverflow/github open source contribution

5\] Lead/mentoring experience

**Benefits** (Generic to most of the companies but the list won't be this extensive):

1\] A salary for 50-85k GBP based on experience (it will always be way lower than 85K and is just a trick to attract candidates)

2\] Free snacks and drinks on friday (which always gets finished with the blink of an eye or have to eat leftovers like hyena ;))

3\] Opportunity to do challenging work (seriously? can't come up with anything ?? A red flag that expectations would be high for nothing in return)

4\] A laptop of your choice (without one how can a software engineer even work, using pen paper?? )

5\] Flexible working hours (which will hardly be the case. BTW do they mean candidates flexibility to do overtime ;) instead of being the other way around)

6\] An opportunity to work with diverse international team (yawn)

7\] Occasional remote work (you have to beg for one in most of the companies)

8\] 33 days of holidays including bank holidays (well the minimum vacation time set by UK government is 25 days and 8 days are public holidays so 33 is the minimum EVERY company has to give so how is that a benefit when it is bare minimal?? It it were to them they would be more than happy to set it to 10 days vacation and proudly sell as a benefit)

9\] Birthday off (yeyy the only time you are proud of being born)

10\] Stock options available (which are worthless most of the time)

11\] Opportunity to join a growing company at right time (but you will never be promoted nor will get a salary raise;))

12\] Beautiful office space located in central London (but you will still commute for 1+ hour to get there)

I mean seriously the above requirement are job of almost 4 people they expect in one developer because apparently these days there is a fashion of fullstack developers and everybody should be one and are expected to know all or most of the above things. Also the code challenges are like projects and can take even a week (for full time working people) with no guarantee that they will even look favourably and give right assessment.  Also benefits are absolutely a laughing stock something which they themselves struggle to come up with.

xalm87,How to leave a job when the bus factor is 1?,"I have been at the same company for a few years now, and I have (mostly) been the sole ""true"" developer, the rest being mostly marketing and sales employees. It's also a rather small company where time and money are tight, so the quality is the one we often compromise on. Specifically, it has been documentation and removing legacy code that have been chopped whenever possible. I have been warning about the risk of this approach for years, often jokingly suggesting that with my hobby of mountain climbing it might be wise to increase the bus factor. But the response was always: ""we can't afford it"".

Now, I have a good offer from another company that I really would like to take up. I am longing for a place where I have equal or better peers that allow me to grow as a developer. This new place would be a great opportunity for me, as I would join a team of pretty good web developers whom I could obviously learn a lot from.

However, I also have a lot of sympathy and respect for my current boss. While the company is sometimes chaotic and I don't really have a technical sparring partner, he has always been a reliable and understanding employer. He has also proven to be a determined entrepreneur who always put his employees first, even when results were poor. He has always had great trust in me and given me enormous freedom, including unlimited WFH. I also \*know\* it will potentially get really hard for the company if I leave. It is a company that is heavily reliant on automation and on being able to respond quickly to the changing market. I also know it will be really difficult for them to find a replacement soon, as the required skillset is a bit unusual (combination of CRM platform and web development) and the company can probably afford a medior at best.

To make matters worse, the new company would like for me to start within less than 2 months. The likelyhood of my current employer finding a replacement within that time is slim, let alone having time for knowledge transfer.

So I'm torn. I really would like to take up on that new job, but I can't really forgive myself for potentially setting my old employer up for a seriously hard time. Has anyone here had a similar dilemma? Does anyone have suggestions on how to handle such a situation or tips to mitigate the damage?",2022-09-10 10:05:26

However, I've several concerns/doubts, and was wondering if you might help me with them:

1. How is its job market in Italy/Europe/U.S? Would you say that it's a field worth going into?
2. I do know that it's becoming increasingly difficult for DS fresh graduates in the U.S. to find jobs, and I feel the same is going to happen in Italy/Europe in 5 years. Would you agree? And why is it so?
3. Tbh, I really can't quite understand why people think DS creates a lot of value, and some people even said it was the sexiest job in the 21th century. I mean, I can easily think of scenarios in which other branches of IT generate value/income (for example developing an app offering certain services so it gets downloads/payments), but how would a data scienst generate value?
4. Following my point/doubt 3, I feel this job position is/will be very shaky. It might be one of the first roles to be cut when the company goes wrong/the economy enters into a recession, because I can't quite understand why it would be useful and generate revenues for the company.

Dublin office in particular,"**TL;DR: Anyone with recent/current experience working in Engineering teams at Microsoft, Dublin? What is the culture like? Especially in terms of mentoring, growth opportunities, feedback, performance management, diversity?**   


Hi, first time poster here.  


I'm currently working in an unfulfilling job in one of the big silicon valley tech companies based in Dublin, Ireland.

I'm not complaining about my current situation overall, but unfortunately there are issues specific to my team/organization that make the dynamics very toxic, and growth pretty much impossible.

I have been interviewing widely, and I'm about to get an offer from Microsoft here in Ireland. The role itself is what I've always wanted to do, and would allow me to move into a real Engineering team (as a non-technical person).

The people I met throughout the interview have been nothing but pleasant, interesting and interested - also pretty diverse. At the same time, I can't shake the fear that Microsoft is an old school, hierarchical, white-boys club, and that by following the role rather than prioritizing company culture I could end up having an even worse time there than where I currently am.  


Does anyone have recent or current experience in Microsoft, particularly in Dublin and/or Engineering teams? Is my fear just a bias from pre-Satya days?

Not sure if this is local job market specific or global phenomenon - but I've noticed growing pressure to move into some kind of leadership position, for example, to become technical leader. 

The thing is, honestly, my social skills are rather mediocre, and I don't feel well suited for that line of work. I'm 100% aware that software development now-days, to large extent, is social activity. I understand value of code review, design discussions, clear and respectful communication. But still, I feel best when I can fully focus and dig deep into some technical problems. 

Unsurprisingly, I would like to maximize amount of activities that I like and reduce what I do not like. Seems simple - I can stick to the individual contributor path and refuse to do anything else. But I have some doubts, if this is feasible long-term career plan. As I mentioned, I feel there is expectancy that you gain some leadership experience over the years, and I'm not sure how interviewers would react to someone with, say, 20 yoe, who did not do any leadership whatsoever. Also, there is a battle to stay current with the state of the technology: new frameworks, libraries, language features. Constant learning is common part of many CS jobs, sure, it's cool to learn something new, but I'm afraid it can get tedious, and if you want to stick with the technicalities, you can't just take a break.

I found another .NET development job at a much smaller IT company in stockholm in April of this year, but now that I am coming towards the end of the 6 month probationary period in this job I am starting to see the signs of this company also terminating my employment with one months notice.

To be honest, I am a sub-par developer. I have always enjoyed tech and thats why I went into university to study computer science, but I just suck at software development, plus I now realize that I do not enjoy it very much.

As some people may be aware, it is widely regarded in certain circles (https://youtu.be/rrkrvAUbU9Y) that the 3 key aspects of a motivational and rewarding career are:

- autonomy

- mastery

- purpose

zrywo3,Salary by Years of Experience London Guide,"Interested in what sort of salary progression should expect by years of experience (what is sort of average salary progression). Seems to be quite obvious up to about 5 YOE, but after that doesn't seem to be much on this sub on how pay progresses from there in terms of 10 YOE, 15 YOE etc. So interested in people's view on what sort of salary to expect with following YOE. Have put my estimates as well, but these may be way out as don't have much experience or data sources.

New grad - 1 YOE - £40k avg - can get £70k at places like Bloomberg, FAANG etc

3 YOE - £60-70k - if at Bloomberg FAANG etc maybe £90-100k

5 YOE - £80-90k - £120k+ at FAANG

10 YOE - £110-120k - if at FAANG cap out at senior eng so Meta E5, Amazon L5 as most ppl don't make staff SWE, so maybe £200k TC for senior SWE at FAANG is average cap out

20 YOE - £120-130k

Where my view may be wrong is salaries platauing as get more experience - from what I've read, seems like you get fast comp growth early on, but then levels off quite a bit, but interested in whether this view is wrong and 10 and 20 YOE should be a lot higher.",2022-12-21 19:52:37

I'm a Romanian-American dual citizen considering moving to Switzerland. We all know that Software Engineering is a very very lucrative field in the US. It combines skill, challenges, medium working hours that can be adjusted to own need and ambition and a great salary. Great Software Engineers can easily surpass 150k and even approach 200k in their late thirties, some found own businesses and go well above these numbers. But how is it in Switzerland?

l0vxiw,What companies should I look for if I don't want a stressful job?,"After working for years in embedded software with large domains, I am looking for companies with less stress and honestly an easy day at work. All of my experience is in c++ but am willing to learn other languages. I want a software engineer role. I am usually much happier when the work that I have to do is straightforward and easy to implement. I don't care if it's boring. I don't care if it's repetitive. I get stressed out when I have to find my way in a million lines of code in a complex system or chase people who are experts in certain portion of the code.

It is important that those companies could sponsor me for a visa. I currently live in europe but want to move to either the us or uk.

What type of companies should I look for? You don't have to list names just point me in the direction so my search is much easier.

From my research banks could be what I am looking for. Although I am not sure if they work with c++. Would the fortune 500 companies also fit my criteria?

**Edit:** It seems like some people misunderstood me. Let me clarify what I hate about my current job. Companies in my region have been producing systems for decades. Which means there is a large codebase (> million lines of code) and it's usually very complex. Me and colleagues started two years ago and everytime we get a task we need to find  experienced people to explain where to change. Most people lack knowledge which can sometimes lead to debugging hell and weird confusions. I know someone who left cause he couldn't take the stress.

 There is no doing overtime and we are not forced to work extra hours. But even with that there is a lot of stress.

What I love is changing places where I know the code and don't have to chase people. I like easy software development and enjoy my day knowing what exactly to do. 

**tldr: I want easy and relaxed coding with visa sponsorship ( if possible with a good salary that can help me survive in London or new york)**",2021-01-19 23:14:32

e3y76u,My experience applying as a fresh graduate in Germany after Bachelors.,"Hey there,

so I finished my bachelors degree this summer in one of the top universities in germany. And have since been applying somewhat actively in the three biggest german cities (Berlin, Hamburg, Munic).

So far I've sent around **15 applications > ~7 Interviews (might have been 8) > and got 4 offers**.
I initially took my first offer immediatly (43k+3k bonus as a data Engineer in Hamburg) but I quit the job after 1 week as it wasn't what I expected, mostly my bad on not realizing what I got myself into though.

I always applied to open positions that seemed interesting and at least somewhat fit my skills. My ways of application included: **Company Website, Campusjäger, Honeypot, Indeed/Stepstone/Glassdoor**.

Applying directly via the company website had the highest response rate for me but it is also the most tireing as you have to manually copy your cv and fill out everything.

Honeypot was a bit of a mixed bag:

* 9 Interview invites in the 3 weeks.
* I got 4 of those on the first day. 
* I only accepted 4 though.
* Serious interviews with 3 companies.

Companies included consulting, gambling sites and early stage startups. I got very far in the process with a consulting company in Berlin and got an offer from them but it didn't match the initially discussed salary at all (I said I wanted 45k they responded with 50-60k but only offered 38k in the end).

Right now I have an offer from a company in **Munic for 55k** (also got this via honeypot) and am expecting an offer in **Hamburg** next monday (probably around **45-50k**). I am not sure yet which I will take as rent in Munic seems to be quite a bit higher than Hamburg and therefore the salaries are effectively almost the same.

I didn't have to leetcode in a single interview. I did have to do coding challenges at home three times though and did in interview coding twice (once FizzBuzz and once something a little more thorough in an online pair programming session).  
Otherwise interviews mostly consisted of techinical questions and questions about previous projects/experiences.

Anyways if you have any questions about interviews or whatever I'll be happy to answer! Also I obviously take recommendations for Munic or Hamburg :D",2019-11-30 15:38:27
164c73f,Best European tech hub to move to.,"I am a soon to be college student, looking to study in europe, i want to study in a countr/city where its cosnidered a tech hub, not just a tech hub but i am looking for a place where i can earn the most compared to my CoL while still being in a ""tech hub"" with plenty of oppourtunities, startups and internatioanl companies. like i said before i am a soon to be college student, while i will be studiying in english, i am very confident i can learn the language fairly easily so language requirements i no issue for me. berlin and germany are out of the conversation tho for their inaccessible universities (for me).  


I am going ot list some infromation of each european ""tech hub"" i know of. please correct any mistakes i make, also if you could rank them based on my criteria that woudl be very appreciated. 

London seems to be the city with the most oppourtunities but salaries seem not the highest, especially comapred to the Col even if you are not living in zone 1.   


Amsterdam seems a good ammount of oppourtunities and international companies with a bit less pay compared to london, but with a way lower CoL especially if you compare downtown rents in the city.   


Stockholm from what i know it seems to have alot of oppourtunities especially startups, but the pay is lower than almost every other city, while still being one of the most expensive.   


Pairs while being an international city with many international companies, the french language requirements and taxes seem to make it a bad city to go to for tech cs.

11rwjoi,Are there any developers working a 4-day-week at your company?

I swear it’s making me more productive overall than if I was forced to log on that one extra day. Not to mention the wonders it did to my mental health.

When I was joining my current employer I was in quite a strong negotiating position because of a tricky embedded dev hiring landscape and already having another offer, so they agreed on a 4 day week contract with a 80% pay. It’s the kind of thing I see myself really struggle to give up, so they’ve probably bought themselves a higher likelihood of employee retention.

That said, the working culture is changing and I feel like more and more employers might be open to non-standard working arrangements.

ufaxst,I'm very doubtful about the long-term QoL for an average CS employee in (almost every place in) Europe. Am I missing something?,"By long-term QoL, I mean being able to afford a house near to the place where you work, being able to retire in your 60s/FiRe, having a good savings and so on.

And let's define an average employee in CS sector as someone wanting to build a career and therefore wanting to work in big tech hubs (London, Berlin, and so on)

Now, we should all agree on the fact that literally every pension system in any Euopean country is unsustainable/shaky. Germany/Spain/Italy blah blah. There's maybe a few exceptions, but again even those are very shaky. So there's a huge likelihood that if people can't fire, they're gonna have to work until they die, or until 75-80 yrs and receiving a tiny part of the pensions that they've paid for.

Housing-wise, after doing some research I found it incredulous that even in IT hubs where supposedly there's a lot of opportunies (and therefore big salaries), it's very hard to be able to buy a nice apartment/house if not before your 40/50. Let's not even talk about cities like Milan where salaries are so low and CoL so pricey, so people there are left with little savings after each month. But even in European tech hubs where the pay is much better, it's the same. Putting aside cities infamous for their housing crisis such as Munich/London, even in the ""relatively more affordable"" cities like Berlin it's  difficult to buy a nice house if you don't earn 80k pre-taxes and have lots of savings. And really, it's not a very accessible wage even for those working in IT.

Taxes are also a big problem in literally every EU country. According to a report in 2018, usually people earning 100k per year get 55-65k after taxes, except for Switzerland. Then if they earn 200k, they take home 95k-120k. Tbh, that's really a lot of taxes. I mean yes I know healthcare, social security blah blah. But are we really supposed to pay this much for taxes? Are these taxes really worth it? In the meantime, don't forget that middle-classes carry the burden of taxes in Europe. Just to cite someone working in Germany/Munich who summarized this nicely:

>I mean right now it is probably a lot better to take a shitty job and get a social apartment from the state. Work as little as possible to get this flat for free than work 9/5, pay your taxes, your flat etc. and live in a WG, because you cannot afford anything better. The problem is that the free apartment is subsidized by our taxes.  
>  
>Don't get me wrong, I am not against the social welfare program, but I am against the fact that you can get a lot better standard of living just by exploiting the system in comparison with the honest work.

So just to summarize:

1. housing prices in big tech hubs are beyond reach for someone without heritage/housing before. Even if they work in IT and work their asses off, it's very unlikely to buy a house before 40-50. That's just absurd
2. Considering the demographics trends and the fact that in most European countries the pension that you pay now goes directly into a pensioner's acccounts, it's basically working class filling the holes of the state governments. Literally all that money is like being thrown away, because the likelihood of you retiring before 75-80 (assuming you'll be still alive and heathly by then, which is really not guaranteed) and receing a good pension is very slim
3. taxes are just purely outrageous, even more so for people like me who will never want to marry. The taxation system is taking money away from hard-working middle-class and giving lots of benefits for the poor. This kind of taxation system means that it's very difficult to save money (so more difficult to buy a house/retire/feel secure). Sure sure, you get all the ""supposed""benefits like heathcare or retirement. But still the heathcare costs are just too high for young unmarried people. And retirement is becoming a myth for young and middle-aged people

So really, not many things left to do. For an average employee in the IT sector, he/she has to

* be lucky enough to live/work in Switzerland
* do a remote job for a company paying a lot but living in a low CoL place
* move to the US and suffer from other problems there
* save a lot of money and accrue experience then move to a CoL and how housing city/area, which means little career opportunies/pay rises and living away from big cities

So would you agree with me or am I missing something?",2022-04-30 13:19:31
s2bg1b,Are consulting big 4 offers really this poor?,"Recently went through the interview mill and got an offer from a big 4.

I hold a quantitive masters (1st/summa cum laude), extra-curricular at UN and 3 non-consulting tech internships. They offered me to start as Analyst at the bottom rung together with fresh undergrads and then expect a promotion after 1, max 1.5 years.

pwdfd0,"3 months ago I was sending CVs to multiple companies. Now I’m starting a new role in 2 weeks but Facebook has just replied to my job application (London, UK)","As title said:
Back in June I applied to a few companies, including Big Tech and non-big tech.

I have accepted an offer (a month ago) and am quite pleased with the role and the company. I’ll start in 2 weeks.

However, Facebook has just emailed me about the role I applied and want to schedule a call, etc.
( I had actually forgotten I had applied to them)

I am bit torn, because I don’t really feel like studying for interviews now (I didn’t need to do LeetCode studying for the companies I interviewed at) and I feel that I should focus on the new role to make impact. 

On the other hand, it seems it could be a bit daft to throw away the FB opportunity.

In an ideal world I would probably want to stay at least 1 year at this new role and then apply to Big Tech, etc. 

&nbsp;

  


My background:
This is in London. I have 8YOE but I  got too comfortable and coasted for a large part of my career and worked at  consultancies and subpar and tiny software companies so I don’t feel like I’m really a senior. 
The places I worked didn’t do things like code reviews, ci/cd, testing, no cloud.
I have a lot to catch up on.

This new role will allow me to get hands on with all the stuff I have not learned and they seemed to have a great engineering structure and internal initiatives. ( I feel the potential growth here would also help improve my CV to land a job at Big Tech in a years time)

How hard would it be to have Facebook accept your CV again? Would I be throwing away an opportunity or would Facebook be accepting of me in the future again?

nzwgn7,Burned Out - What to do next?,"Hi All,

As the title suggests I'm currently feeling burnt out in my current role. I find it very hard to motivate myself day to day and it's beginning to impact my personal relationships as I'm constantly irritable. Even during time off on the weekend I find it hard to switch off and enjoy myself without the dread of Monday morning at the back of my mind. This hasn't always been the case throughout my 5 years in software.

I suspect Covid has probably been a big factor in this; I'm someone who likes to meet my teammates face-to-face and enjoys working in a very collaborative environment. I also find that working from home full-time has, to some extent, removed the separation between work and home-life (Not to mention having holidays abroad to look forward to throughout the year).

My current role is also no-doubt contributing as I'm not happy in it, it's a tech-lead role that I would consider a mix between senior developer and scrum master. This means I spend most of my time context switching between trying (and failing) to get development tasks done and acting as an interface to the team.

I'm certain that I want to move on to something new but unsure if whether or not I should take some time off after resigning to recharge or jump straight into a new role and would be curious to hear opinions from anyone who has gone through a similar situation.

I have 10 years of experience, soft skills + proven leadership skills (not sure if they care). In last interview I will have to give my salary expectations. My previous interviews in process went excellent. I’ve read that 90k EUR gross is „good”. 
Estimated renting cost is quite overwhelming: 2-2.5k/mo for my family needs. I’m also used to save 3~k right now living in city that is twice cheaper that Munich (without renting). I would like to have same quality of life in Munich as I have now in Poland. So: 
2.5k + 3k + 4k (expenses) = 9-10k net monthly. 
Is it real or I shouldn’t even say that? :) Gross salary for my needs would be probably around 140-160k. Taxes in Germany are nightmare.

Lead Software Engineer here.
For quite some of the time I l’m thinking about starting with contracting instead of full time employment.

Pros:
- I know that daily rates are much higher than my current earnings.
- And I’m thinking to maybe step down a bit with my position and even work one day less, to have a better work life balance and earn more.

Cons:
- contracts duration (6 months+)
- less stable and insecure


My questions are, 
- do you regret it that you didn’t start earlier?
- are you thinking to move back to standard full time employment?
- are you actually working less for more money?
- did you improve your work life balance

u718ml,Signed contract/offer in Netherlands withdrawn by company. What are my options?,"TL;DR : Company based in Netherlands withdrew the signed job Contract. Declined few other offers for this job and now I do not have anything in my hand. Looking out for assistance on what should be my next steps.

A bit of a background about myself. 
I am based out of India(29 M) with 7+ years of software development experience. I was trying to relocate to EU region for a better quality of life, preferably Netherlands.

I left my previous company based in India on December 2021 and started looking for new opportunities from January 2022. I got an offer(Indefinite employment contract) from a large multinational software consulting firm from Netherlands as a Senior Software Engineer in 1st week of February 2022. The pay was decent but the role offered was exactly what I wanted. Needless to say, I was really happy with it and I signed and accepted the Contract in Feb 1st week and was looking forward to join the firm.

Joining date mentioned on my contract was on last week of March so I expected them to start with the relocation process to get my residence permit as soon as Contract was signed from my end. Post this, there was a serious lack of communication from their end with respect to my relocation process. Till March I was patient with it but always followed up every week without fail, but the most that I got from them is my relocation is pending some internal approvals.

I started following up rigorously from April and asked for the status, finally I got a call from my recruiter today that my contract is retracted/withdrawn because it did not go through their internal approval; reason being they do not have any projects wherein I can be part of for foreseeable future.

I really wanted this job as it was perfectly aligning with my long term goals. Apart from this I had another 2 offers in EU region and few more really good offers in India which I declined for this. Also after accepting the above offer I stopped looking for any new jobs.

Now, as this Contract is withdrawn, I do not have anything in my hand and I'm completely devastated. I'm am out of any income from December 2021 though I do have saving through which I can take care of me and my family for coming few months.. I'm not sure what to do right now and it seems like I have wasted last few months and few coming months of my life.

Looking out for some assistance from this sub as to what options do I have as I'm not able to think straight? As the contract is being terminated by company, am I eligible for certain severance amount? I am planning to email the practice head(who declined my relocation) & HR but need few pointers from you guys on what to write. Really appreciate any help that I may get.",2022-04-19 09:42:04

So what would you do here? Is having a brand name on your CV worth it? Or should I just take the startup offer and stay in Berlin?

Currently I only have work experience in small startups in my CV (about 2-3 years of experience). So I’m leaning towards going for a brand name, but not sure how important it is.

The market rate of an engineer is pretty much the lowest number that someone available to work is willing to accept at a given moment.
So if nobody accepts offers less than X€, then the new market rate is X$.

Maybe this is already working, I don't know, but sometimes it feels like we're being short-changed

I've been told in a job offer that what they offer is ""market rate"", and I think it's too low and am prepared to walk away.

If they are in a hurry to find someone and I fit the profile, they'll have to adjust their view of ""market rate"".

ndud3z,"25 years old, where do I even begin?","Apologies about the title. I was just asking myself this and I got stuck, so I then thought to ask you about some perspective.

I've never been a programmer, at best I can set up a WordPress site with some basic PHP and JavaScript edits. I don't have a degree and I've never had it explained to me or okay, I just don't know how to go about everything and what path to take.

I do want to have useful hard skills and feel like I'm being productive, so I think CS may be for me. But since I was 18, I've been working manual assembly jobs in the Czech Republic, though right now I'm unemployed and (almost) broke. Obviously, I can't work anything else, so now do I just suck it up, find another factory job and study in the meantime? Is this it how it should be? A plan of some sort I've been thinking about, is finding a low-paid job in Germany or the Netherlands (netto 1500 EUR/month at best), have some finances and what would be the plan then, sign up to a University in CS and just practice? I don't see other solution.

I'm desperate to find a path. I had a passion about videos and motion graphics, even VFX, but that lead me to nowhere. I've had interviews for Junior positions and I always knew that I'm just not good enough and have no real hard skills to earn my paycheck. CS is also very scary and reading about the thousands of libraries, technologies and languages, I get overwhelmed, but still, I'm willing to learn.

Guess I'm looking for the recipe of success, but a bit toned-down. I'm not looking to be extraordinary or the best, just someone who won't have to work deadbeat jobs in factories forever. High school was fun in the way that everything was organized and you had a clear goal - graduating. I miss that feeling.

I'm grateful for being born in Bulgaria. I have many opportunities to study, travel and work in Europe, and I think I'll be okay with moving to any country within the EU, as long as I find a clear path for my life, and that starting with a stable income. What paths did you guys take?

196f0r2,85k in Vienna,"Dear All,  
  
I have received an offer for 85k in Vienna as a highly specialized Exadata engineer (Oracle DBA). The net income would be 4.7k (including 13th and 14th-month salaries). With 15 years of experience, currently residing in Hungary, the offered 85k is only slightly better than what I currently earn here in Hungary ( in HU we have lower taxes ). Additionally, considering the PPP calculators, it appears that I might not achieve the same quality of life in Vienna as in Budapest.  
  
However, due to the unfavorable political situation, education, and health system in Hungary, my girlfriend and I are contemplating a move. I am aware that I can potentially earn better wages in the next 2-3 years. Here are my specific questions:  
  
\- How competitive is the 85k wage in Vienna, especially in the IT field? While I understand the average is 51k, I am particularly interested in the IT sector. What standard of living can we maintain with this income? (Hint 1: We plan to rent an apartment in Döbling, 19th district, or possibly in the 2nd or 3rd district. Hint 2: No children)  
  
\- For those working in IT, how feasible is it to get an annual salary increase, and at what percentage? (I am aware of the Kollektivvertrag)  
  
\- Is there anyone here working in IT administration fields, such as DBA, Linux admin, Network admin, Cloud Engineer, etc.? Any advice regarding our profession and the market in Vienna?  
  
Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.",2024-01-14 12:40:05

xxu5ub,Take Home Challenges,"I got recently a call from a team leader of a mid-size embedded development firm, offering me a position with a decent pay. The interview process consisted of, among others, a challenge. 

The challenge involved officially 8 hours of work, although the TL said himself that no one ever finished it in 8 hours. The task itself involves the creation of two embedded applications (server, client), a communication protocol, two state machines, and an encryption method[1]. I estimate that it would take 40 hours to do it properly. 

I presented my approach to the solutions with a pseudocode, and a short explanation. Overall, I invested two hours to come up with a solution suggestion.   
The TL called me later and asked me for feedback, explaining that they have many applicants, and that most enjoy solving the challenge, and even go way beyond the 8 hours. My response to the TL was that my lawyer or dentist would tell me to pound sand if I asked them to work a day for free. He said:""Well, everyone is different. Our colleagues enjoy programming, and do not see it as work "".   


How do you approach such situations?  Do you take on take home challenges? What would be a fair time limit?

I am not sure why but I always have been an anxious person in general. I always tend to assume or look at the worst case and feel anxious/terrified whenever I see things going even a little out of my control. It's one of the reasons why I am afraid of job changes but still I have always tried to overcome my fear and currently I am on my 4th company.

The new org I switched to a couple of months ago has quite a different tech stack to which I used to work in before. It was actually one of the reasons why I switched because I felt I was stagnating and wanted to learn more. But it's been quite challenging, the codebase is huge and there are so many things that I don't know, it's giving me huge amount of anxiety.  I am always fearing that I am learning so slow, plus economy is going down so they will fire me for being a slow developer and it's very nerve wracking.

I am a non-EU guy, working in Berlin since 18 months. Since my residence is tied to my job, the thought of losing job gives me even more stress. I don't have any issue with savings. In the past 4-5 year I have managed to accumulate >50K euros so on the financial side, I would be secured but I really don't want to go back to my home country if I lose my job.

Sorry if this is all over the place. I would really appreciate if someone can give some inputs/pointers to deal with the uncertainty and the anxiety it brings. Thanks!",2022-06-26 17:14:30
ua4235,"In Europe, which country do you think has/will have the best CS-related job market and give CS people the best quality of living?","I'm interested in the long-term job market and livability, i.e., pay, job opportunities, general welfare, CoL, housing prices and things like that.

I live in Italy, but as you'll have heard of,  the job market here is a total mess: low-pay, high CoL, few job opportunities, low high-pay potential, and so on. So while I'll start my career here, I'm already thinking about moving to another European country after some years of work experience. I'm not a big fun of countries like USA or Canada, even though my English is good and I don't know another European language besides Italian, largely because I think their enviroments are too ""competitive"" and have their own problems (e.g., gun-control and welfare in the U.S.)

I've done my research, and in the end it really comes down to two countries I think (?): Germany or U.K. After some quick research I think I'll go with Germany, for the following reasons:

1. Work Visa can be a real pain, and I think I'll have to keep my job to not get sent back, which is really annoying
2. Basically the ""sole"" allure of U.K. is London for its job opportunies and high-pay possibilities, but its CoL is notoriously high, and housing prices too. So in the end not that attractive unless one's really capable (not me).
3. Also in general I feel like Germany will prosper more as a country than U.K.
4. I've heard that Germany has a much better work-life balance than any English-speaking countries, i.e., more vacation, more sick days, and less working hours.
5. Idk I just like Germany or the idea of staying inside EU more, even though London is supposed to be more friendly towards Asians like me lol

So in my view: Germany has a bit less opportunities than U.K. (London), and its pay and high-pay potential are also less. However, its housing prices are much more affordable and CoL is also much lower compared with U.K.'s

The only pain for me would be to master German, which from what I've heard is much harder than English...

So would you agree with me? Could you kindly correct me? Thanks in advance!

p33wwd,Asking for a raise for the first time since starting over 5.5 years ago in a startup,"I moved to Germany and started working for an English speaking startup 5 years ago. The CEO is also the owner and primary investor of the company. Previous to this company I worked as a .NET developer for 7 years.

I started at the startup as a front-end developer, however I was the only front-end developer at the company so I've had autonomy over building our frontend apps.

When I started I agreed to a salary of 43k. Since starting I've never requested, demanded or been offered an improvement in compensation. I had no signing bonus, stock options etc. Just the salary. The years have just quickly passed by. 

I don't speak German well enough to interview outside of primarily English speaking companies and I suffer with imposter syndrome and low confidence in my abilities. But I have had no complaints from the CEO or CTO who seem happy with my performance.

I enjoy working here. It's low stress, I only work 7-4, fully remote, I have autonomy, but the work isn't that interesting. We build and maintain a business communication product.

Tomorrow I go on holiday for 2 weeks and I'm considering telling them I want a salary increase to 60k. This seems reasonable based on the market and my knowledge of our product, codebase etc. 

I've never negotiated a raise before. And I think I haven't until now because I it's a startup not making much money, I may struggle to get another job (which perhaps they realise) and I've been doing my job so long for 43k, so why should they pay me more to do the same thing.

1bayiqg,My Experience with the UK job market with 2.5 YOE,"Currently I have a good fully remote job but recently I’ve been thinking about looking for something that pays more money, so here is my experience for the past 6 weeks.

**My stats:**

•	2.5 YOE

•	£50k / year, no stock, no bonus

•	UK, fully remote

•	BEng in EEE + coding bootcamp

•	British citizen

**Applications:**

•	Cold applications: 190\~

•	1st Stage interviews: 10

•	Take home tests: 4

•	Final Stage interviews: 4

•	Offers: 1

**Offers**

•	Only got one offer which was around 40k, lol, when I told them I make 50k they were willing to negotiate to around 45k or so, but that was it, so had to reject that offer

**My thoughts:**

I am usually not very good, sometimes unlucky with live tech interviews, one they asked me leetcode easy, I completed it but were unsatisfied with my devops knowledge , another I completed everything in live coding but got stuck on a simple if else cuz I didn’t spot one of the conditions ( I was perfect until that part ), lost focus or something and then they said in rejection email that others could solve that without trouble unlike me, bla bla.

I usually do OK with take home tests, as I tend to do them during the weekends and spend 8-12 hours to make them nice-ish ( I have lots of free time anyway).

Overall my impression is that it is super competitive and even if you solve the problem with some help or some questions they would still fail you just because somebody else solved it without asking questions or thinking too much about it . Basically , you need to be almost perfect.

Also, there are very few remote roles and those are quite competitive and want you to have exact experience in most if not all libraries/frameworks/languages they use. For example most of my experience is with C#/.Net and Angular with a bit of NodeJs, but whenever I apply to NodeJs/Java roles, I don’t even get a callback, only for .Net roles.

It’s much harder now compared to when I had 0 experience coming off a bootcamp in 2021 (the peak of the market).",2024-03-10 01:49:18

rbofjt,UK VS Germany Comparison,"Hello everyone,

Before my question I wish to give background information:

I'm Software Engineer currently working and living in Munich. I have been to several other EU countries for holiday and also London and a few major US cities before. I'm from a non-EU country. I like living in Europe but some things make me question whether I made the right choice with Germany. I intended to settle here and set up my family. Therefore I will appreciate any comments on life quality and career comparison between Germany and UK.

When I was in London for holiday some years ago, I fall in love with the city. I'm also from a big city like London so I found it really easy to live there. Doing shopping, using public transport etc was very easy and the people I met there were friendly. But unfortunately currently in Munich, even the simple things like having a decent internet (as far as I understand, infrastructure here is terrible), doing grocery (stores are closed after 8pm and on Sundays) is hard. And I'm still on temporary housing because finding house is very hard and everything works with regular post instead of email which drives me crazy. Some people are very narrow minded and I feel like they have been living in their remote villages for a very long time and had no idea about outside world. I mean, I heard that life in London right now sucks too because of high rents, crime, political issues, pollution etc. but maybe other cities are better. Career wise, in Germany, I see more open positions especially if you know German but I think UK has more cutting edge tech positions from Big Tech companies.

psi0ni,~£100k Tech Lead with >10 yoe. What to do next?,"Hello everyone,

As the title says I am a tech lead in a semi well known fintech company with ~£100k salary ( ~120k total comp). 

I wonder what can I do to improve my salary, rather than moving to FAANG or Hedge funds?

I mostly get messages from recruiters and they almost always top around ~130k total comp and in my opinion that’s not worthy of leaving.

My biggest concern is work life balance as my current company is excellent on that regard. I don’t mean we don’t work or we work less but we definitely do not make overtime and it’s openly frowned upon. We even have >25 days annual leave ( compared to classic 25 days).

One of my options is moving to management side which requires great investment on your soft skills and losing your tech skills gradually. Although I am kinda annoyed by never ending new trends in technology, I really love to learn and use them ( I am done with stupid people defending new tech just because it’s trendy and they are simply stupid to understand its real boundaries and use cases).

My other options is moving to FAANG which I think I can do if I wanted to as I was always the smartest in my classes and able to focus and grind for it. But I know competition in FAANG will be fierce even after joining and it definitely
won’t be a relaxed work environment ( right ? ). Also moving to FAANG might restart my managerial path progression which is part of my tech lead journey in my current company. I mean if I want to be a manager I need to follow similar path to my own, not a path full of leetcode and O(n). 

The disturbing thing about picking the managerial path ( for me ) is the realisation of not moving up or promoting with your tech skills anymore. I was always good at tech and it’s relatively easy for me to shine on the tech side. I am afraid managerial wouldn’t be the same.

So in summary, >10yoe, ~120k tc Tech lead, what are my options and have any of you regretted moving to manager path or had similar thoughts?",2021-09-21 12:46:56

myksh9,Best way to explain why I was fired from AWS?," I was fired during my probation period at AWS within the first 6 months.  


My manager didn't give me an explanation besides his feeling that I would not be able to survive at AWS. There were no metrics that I missed or other conduct issues. Since in my country an employer can fire within the first 6 months without any reason, after that it gets complex, therefore he opted for me to be out.  


A major contributing issue was that my role was new to the org and not well defined. I was supposed to be customer-facing and taking care of all the post-sales activities, whereas the account manager didn't want me poking into his business and be customer-facing. As a result, the account manager did not like me doing my job and gave me bad feedback.  


I was hoping that my managers (L7, L8) would support me in setting the scope for my role, however, they were also in-term managers therefore they didn't have a real stake in having my back.  


Long story short, I have an interview this week.  


**What is the best way to explain why I was fired without jeopardizing my chances?**

ol8pl7,Rejecting a FAANG in favour of a local startup,"Hi!

Last year I did an internship at Amazon in Dublin (I was half done by the time Covid started so I basing my experience on the first half) which I really enjoyed, the work was interesting, people were amazing and I loved Dublin. After I finished I got a return offer for when I graduate, starting this fall. Ever since, I've had my mind set on that and it seemed like a pretty good way to start my career. 

However, recently I got a call from a successful local (Croatian) startup inviting me for an interview. Their pitch was very interesting so I asked around, heard that their interview process was really difficult, but the offer is worth it, so I gave it a try, just for the sake of it. The interview was horrible, I didn't think I did well at all, but somehow I got an offer.

Now I'm in a big dilemma of which offer I should accept. I know I like Amazon since I spent almost a year there, I know what to expect, it looks better on my CV and it's a good chance to live abroad for a few years at this point of my life. On the other hand, the startup job sounds a lot more engaging, work/life balance should be better and I think the experience I'd gain would be much broader. The people there all seem like geniuses, most of them with Silicon Valley experience, so there's a lot to learn too.

My biggest problem, which might (or might not) just be the imposter syndrome talking, is that I feel that I lucked out with both offers and that in Amazon I could easily stay for long enough to make myself useful, while I might be deemed not good enough much quicker in a small company. In that case I'd be out of both options.

Financially, both offers are pretty good. Amazon is offering a typical new grad package which is very good and more than I could ever make in Croatia, but in Dublin it wouldn't make me rich, 'just' comfortable. The second offer is pretty incredible in Croatian terms, monthly salary is almost on par when accounting for rent (in Dublin I'd spend at the very least €1k on rent, while I own an apartment in Croatia) and basically unheard of for a new grad here, but still just over half in absolute terms. It also comes with a pretty significant stock option package, but as with any startup, that might be worth millions, or be worthless.

So yeah, I have a couple more days to decide and I have no idea what to do so I'd appreciate any of your thoughts. 

Also, is there a blacklist of some kind of if reject the Amazon offer now, after I accepted it already, but my start date being in a few months? Just to keep that as a backup if I decide to go for the startup, it would be good to know if I can get an interview again.",2021-07-16 03:36:06
oktbvt,Advice: don’t come to big German cities as a junior,"From a native German, hailing from Munich

Don’t come to the bigger German cities, espcially Munich, Berlin and Hamburg if you’re just starting out (new grad)

Your salary will not be high enough to be on the top of the list for *decent* apartments. Plus, as a foreigner you’re already in the disadvantage. 

So either you live in a shitty 1br with hour-long commutes or you have no money whatsoever.

It should be mentioned here that landlords here consider 40% of your net-pay the maximum rent u can afford. They don’t care you can live of ramen and tap water

So I’d recommend 2-3 YoE, find a senior position and get yourself (and maybe ur SO and kids) a nice place.

kvvw96,"I'm roughly 6 months into my first job out of university and have a bad gut feeling, would appreciate some advice","Hi everyone. As the title suggests, I have a bad feeling about my current job and would appreciate any advice. Also, sorry in advance for the long post. Here's my situation. 

I'm 22 years old, living just outside London. I graduated June 2020 with a 1st class degree in compsci from an average uni and have 1 year experience as an automated tester (as part of my placement year). 

In August, I landed a job at a small company (\~15 people) working as a full stack developer. I was really happy to be employed and even negotiated beyond the upper bound of their salary range (although their range was quite low). I felt like I'd done well.

The feeling didn't last very long though. Since the very first week I joined, I noticed that the quality of work here is pretty sub-par. During my interview, I was told the company had some technical debt, but I was not expecting it to be as bad as it is. I'll provide some examples and hopefully you guys can tell me if I'm being unfair - bear in mind that this is a company who's sole product is their software:

\- There is no real technical lead or CTO type person. 

\- There is no automated testing and no code reviews. There is basically nothing stopping me as a junior developer from causing damage and introducing terrible code. The quality of the existing code is also low.

\- Our frontend is a nightmare to work with compared to the current go-to tools (we don't use any modern frameworks like Vue, Angular, React etc). 

\- Some of the database structure (it's a NoSQL db) is really bad. Duplicated data across tables, gigantic documents that store everything, etc. I have no official dev work experience but I can see that it's wrong.

\- We have tons of bugs, things that don't work properly and features that are confusing. We frequently have issues in production that we have to firefight.

This whole time I've been questioning whether I am in fact the problem. Am I being too harsh or expecting too much? I know it's common for fresh graduates to be arrogant and wrongly think they know it all, but I really don't think that's me. I want to be in an environment where I'll learn good habits, and learn from people who are much more knowledgeable than I am. The lack of quality is really starting to wear me down.

On top of this, even though I negotiated a higher salary, it still doesn't seem like much (£25k in a London commuter town). I am paid less than my friends who are in far less demanding jobs. The sum of all these things gets to me a little.

Does anyone have any advice? Should I find a different job? Am I being entitled? Please feel free to let me know either way. Cheers.",2021-01-12 17:15:19

16cop4n,I regret getting into deep learning.,"I was doing a natural science masters a couple of years ago, and was specializing in a field which I then realized had no future. So I decided to switch to machine learning and in particular focus on deep learning, because there were lots of research groups applying deep learning in the sciences at my university. 

I did that and got hooked. I worked as a student researcher for the last two years and have recently graduated. In the meantime I have collected a sizable deep learning toolkit. I can build whole training pipelines and train them on multi-gpu, multi-node clusters, and of course I learned all the theory behind it as well, so I am not doing things blindly. 

I thought I had a good chance of getting a Ph.d position, but after months of searching, nothing, not even enough interest for a single interview. Despite lots of relevant experience. I also have above average grades which should qualify me for a Ph.d as well.

I looked at industry jobs, but from what I can gather there are pretty much no actual truly deep learning jobs where I could make use of the skills I learned. Pretty much any job that gets even close to what I was allowed to do as a student researcher requires a Ph.d and/or 5+ years of research experience. 

Now I feel stuck and not sure what to do. I can take another job, but that means throwing away all that I have learned so far and probably end up doing something for which I am overqualified. ",2023-09-07 20:00:49

My focus was on moving from Brazil to Europe, getting healthier, getting married, buying and renovating a house, having a baby, and figuring out how to survive all these new realities emotionally.

Until 5 years ago, I was an outstanding backend developer, decent architect, and was working on my management skills. I had about 12 years of experience on my belt and had maintained and built several systems from scratch - things from network monitoring tools to large-scale media enterprise systems. I was fluent in Java, C, and Python and had a solid understanding of principles like SOLID, OOP, GOF, SOA, and microservices. That made me good enough to be hired by multiple large companies and accumulate glowing reviews throughout my career.

At that point, I stopped working nights and weekends and started doing my best for 8 hours a day. That was it. All my *extra* time was spent on personal growth, and I can't say I regret it; it has been the best years of my life in many ways. 

Unfortunately, *I can't eat happiness*, and every day that goes by makes me feel more inept at dealing with the everyday issues I face at work. I'm not fluent in big data, cloud deployment, or machine learning, and since I've been mostly programming in Perl lately, I feel like I even lost fluency in Python and Java.

That reality creates obvious short term issues in this market since the thought of firing me must have come up in someone's mind at this point, but honestly, I'm more worried about the long term issues and not being able to provide for my family in the future.

I need technical and career guidance.

Regarding the technical side, I know I need to put more hours in sharpening my skills that have gone dull and learning new skills, but it's hard to know where to start, honestly. Should I make a todo application with every new framework that has come by in the last 5 years? Should I join an open-source project? Should I install Hadoop on a server and play with it? Should I join a class? Should I do random projects on GitHub? I'm lost.

Regarding my career, I think it's even worse. Over the past few years, I've been toying with the idea of moving into the machine learning field since it seems unavoidable to clash into the big data world; why not take it by the horns, right? At the same time, I'm great at dealing with people. I actually enjoy talking to other human beings, so I've been pushed into management positions over most of my career but have always been afraid to commit to a career change in a non-technical direction.

In terms of innovation (another complaint on here), I feel this is very misplaced. France has raised some of the highest VC rounds in all of the EU, coming only 2nd to Germany and Top 3 in all of Europe. Before any of you claim ""but they are all copycat startups,"" lemme assure u as an American, that there are plenty of ""copycat"" startups here, in SV as well. Lots of ""uber for _______"" startups. 

Innovation doesn't always have to involve reinventing the wheel. You don't need to always be producing the newest, most cutting edge AI chip in your company. Sometimes innovation is in the form of providing a convenient solution to an everyday problem, which is what most of these startups do. 

Even so, France's investment into AI, Biotech, Agricultural Tech, etc., really has produced a lot if heavy hitters (look up Owkin AI). Yes there's still a ways to go before they catch up with the UK, but acting like France is some technological shithole is also very disingenuous.

I've worked in 4 countries. I used to think working abroad was cool. However, these days I feel that hopping around from country to country is just a waste of time and money. By moving around countries, you'll need to:

1. make new friends from scratch
2. set up a new life again, including finding an apartment, buying new furniture, creating a new bank account (good luck on finding an English-speaking bank), finding a GP, etc
3. do the paperwork for a visa (if you're from outside EU)

(The 1st one is particularly important for me. As an introvert, I'm usually fine with spending time alone by studying, working out, etc. Still, I do feel lonely from time to time and definitely don't want to be alone forever)

On top of that, depending on where you move to, you might not receive the pension money that your employer deducted from your salary if you move to another country in the future.

15mo0ha,Romanian government hits IT sector with a death blow,"One of the reasons Romania started to be a hub for IT services is due to IT sector being somehow exempted from some small part of the income tax. The tax system in Romania is a weird one with several taxes hidden under the term ""insurance,"" but actually they are just part of the income tax. 

In total the total income tax for IT sector in Romania is currently around 36% from the gross salary. Not small but not big. 

The planned death blow from the government is basically to increase the total income tax to around 43% to 45% for gross salaries over 2000EUR (like 80% of the IT employees qualify for that low threshold). Yeah it will be cheaper to employ someone in Germany for the same NET salary :( 

For freelancers it will be even worse, the tax rate will be around 51%, yes 51% (10% health tax + 25% social security tax + 16% income tax) !!! Basically every IT freelancer is discussing now how to move their fiscal residence outside Romania :(

Romania will become the most expensive Eastern European country to employ IT professionals.  We are bracing for massive emigration of IT staff and closing or drastic down scaling of FAANG and other similar big IT corporations branches, the disappearance of freelance IT specialists.

Latter edit: There is already a 3rd ""leaked"" draft of the law, so some numbers may be off. The government parties are testing the waters to see where the outrage threshold is :)

Latter edit: There is a propaganda war going on now, with government party members flooding reddit threads where the taxes are discussed with fake news and denials, even here I see some of them posting nonsense.",2023-08-09 18:53:55
15acpv7,Is it common to “grill” candidates you don’t like during the interview?,"So I work for a big tech. We had a candidate. I did the pre screening with him. This is for a mid/senior position. I asked him a medium LC and a system design in the screening which he did well on. Not perfect, but good enough to pass. The 5 we interviewed before him always completely failed one of them.

When we got to the team interview, my teammates really grilled him on the experience and knowledge. Lots of this stuff I’m not sure if I or they even know. I’m one level above the guy they interviewed. I’m thinking maybe they disliked the guy or the resume? He had a bit of a character.

Or maybe there is more to pick from now? Our team is also growing and has more visibility since I joined. They asked much easier questions to me. Maybe also why?",2023-07-26 17:53:17

13weoi7,"What are the honest reasons so many tech companies are forcing ""Return to office"" for employees?","I've understood that CEOs copycat each other [(one source: CEOs copying layoff-behaviour even when the net consequences are negative)](https://www.businessinsider.com/stanford-professor-mass-layoffs-caused-by-social-contagion-companies-imitating-2023-2).

Via that I've gathered that there necessarily isn't any real, research-backed reason people at the top of companies do what they do. They may make certain decisions because that's what their peers are doing. CEOs may also claim they do something to get one outcome (for example lay off hundreds of employees to 'save money'), while research/evidence points to it yielding the exact opposite outcome ([source:
Article about mass layoffs costing more money than they save](https://hbr.org/2022/12/what-companies-still-get-wrong-about-layoffs)).

So I understand CEOs can and do things that harm their companies - and that their reasons for doing things can ignore research and be grounded on mainly social dynamics within their group/peer behavior.


With all of that in mind I still do not understand the widespread spread of ""Return to office"" (RTOs) policies that CEOs and people at the top of companies have started to enact.

RTOs are:
1. Wildly unpopular ([source: Vox](https://www.vox.com/recode/23161501/return-to-office-remote-not-working)). 
One argument I've read is that they're using RTOs to get people to leave/get headcount down.
2. Research indicates remote workers are more productive ([source: Forbes)](https://fortune.com/2022/10/20/remote-hybrid-workers-are-more-productive-slack-future-forum/) so the argument that it's to increase productivity falls mute for me.

I genuinely don't understand, is the social/peer pressure behind the RTOs or is there some other good reason I'm missing? I've heard people mention expensive real estate as a possible factor but I have yet to understand in what way that could be. 

Does anyone here have any insight, what are the genuine reasons for the spread of RTOs?",2023-05-31 06:46:31

zbc4ut,Strangest interview experience I ever had.,"The first incident happened almost 3 years back. I was looking for a job change and I applied to this food delivery company. I cleared the first two rounds and I was supposed to have my video interview with a manager a few days later. Strangely the person didn't show up even after I waited for 10 minutes. I sent them an email and they apologized and asked me if I am still available. This was almost 1 hour later and I was still available. 
I had an interview with this guy and it was a very strange experience because of the following reason. He repeated the same questions I had in my previous round and even the follow-up question. He also sounded very ill-prepared and was scrambling for the next questions. Anyway, I didn't clear the round even though I answered the questions pretty well.

2 years later, this time I was looking for a change and I applied for a position in this rainforest company. I cleared the initial rounds and I was scheduled to have an interview with a manager. This time also the person didn't show up. I asked the recruitment team and I got a reply a few hours later and apologized for the inconvenience. The person got sick and could not reschedule the interview on time. They also asked for my availability in the next few days. I gave one and the next round was scheduled. This time the person was almost 5 minutes late. Anyway, he showed up and started the interview. Again it was a pretty strange experience. He sounded ill-prepared and was scrambling to ask the right questions. Eventually, he gave me one scenario and many things didn't add up. I explicitly asked for clarifications but still, his replies were unsatisfactory. 

I've reached a point where his explanations are not making sense at all and if it would have been in any other situation, I would have heated arguments with this guy.
Anyway, I thought this is what it is supposed to be and maybe he is trying to test that particular skill of mine.
The interview got over and I didn't have much expectation and I got a rejection within a couple of days.

After a few days, I was a bit curious and I checked my old emails, and guess what. It was the same person who interviewed me in these two different companies. In a way, I am lucky that I did not clear the interviews. Otherwise, I would have ended up working for this horrible person.",2022-12-03 09:07:47

tyzd4w,Company laptop tracking/monitoring software policy,"I've been working at a company in Europe for the past few years which was recently acquired by a USA company. They made us all install monitoring and tracking software - not just malware and anti-virus - on each laptop and to sign a document listing the security policies, among others there are polices like those below:  


* "" XXX employees shall have no reasonable expectation of personal privacy concerning the use of XXXX' computers""
* "" data created and stored in XXX devices is property of XXXX, and there is no official provision for individual data privacy, nevertheless XXX shall avoid exposing or disclosing employees' personal data wherever possible""
* "" logging systems shall always be in operation where appropriate, and investigations shall be commenced where reasonable suspicion exists""
* "" XXX retains the right to monitor activity, including Internet, telephony email, and chat use""

I can believe that everything done on the laptop is logged, even seeing personal email, log in and log out times, which can be seen as time-tracking - the polices are so vaguely described that I believe they can just track, record, copy, delete, everything you do on the laptop.

My working contract with Europe/Germany refers to none of this, this is an extra document coming from the USA that they want all of us to sign, who doesn't sign cannot continue working.  


How legal is this in European law, specifically in Germany, can someone point me to a lawyer or institution to proof this? Anyone working in Europe or in Germany has similar policies?

lin8bz,"STEM major, got offered a graduate developer job with Barclays for £40k pa. Should I take it?","I have been working at my very first graduate job for a month in an engineering (non-CS) company in which I've been having a good time.

On the side, I have been learning how to program for about 6 months now and I really enjoy it, and even before I had this job I applied to a bunch of grad schemes for software development since my hackerrank/leetcode got good enough. I don't see myself being in my current role for the long term.

My question is to other senior developers that have ""been around"" the market in London for a long time: 

What is the difference for jobs that offer this higher salary? Are they generally tougher to get into? Is the work-life balance generally worse? Or is it completely random where often the salary doesn't directly correspond to this?

I do often see the higher paid positions offering 30+ days leave on top of bank holidays, so that would suggest that some of these have a good focus on work life balance (or conversely work you like a dog outside of you extra holiday days).",2020-05-04 10:58:29
9iqu35,My experience for preparing for Big N companies,"I have just received an offer from a Big N company (Amazon, Google, FaceBook, Microsoft, Apple, Bloomberg, etc) , I just want to share my experience on the preparation process while the memory is still fresh in mind.

I have been a lurker on cscareerquestions/cscareerquestionsEU for a very long time and this is me giving back to the community.

(Keep in mind this post is based on personal opinion.)

I also want to mention why I wanted to join a Big N. I have worked as a software dev for 2 years after graduation in two start ups. The problems with small-medium sized companies are their lack of scalability and good practises. Not to mention there is not enough interesting work to go around so most of the interesting stuff is often taken by senior engineers. Some companies don't prioritise tech so engineers are treated as second class citizens. The lack of mentorship / senior guidance was also a struggle for me so I have to spend my free time learning how to be a better software engineer. (These might also happen in Big N companies, but I would like to think they happen less often.)

I also think that if you care about your career, it's good to spend a few years at a Big N. Just for the experience and freedom to choose where you want to work after your leave.

They also pay quite well, and I love money.

Below is my process to prepare for the interviews.

### Data Structures and Algorithms (DS&A)
You **MUST** have complete mastery over your algorithms and data structures before you apply to these companies. The reason is that it doesn't matter how much leetcode you have practised, there is always a different question in the interview.

Unfortunately the DS&A interviews are very binary i.e. you can either solve it or not. Unlike the other parts of the interview where solutions can be more varied.

**The questions are always based on a combination of existing data structures and algo** e.g. using dynamic programming + a custom linked list or using part of merge sort + a stack, etc. Hence if you don't have them ingrained in your head, you will struggle to utilize them creatively during an interview.

Try to find a friend in real life or online to practise solving DS&A questions. You need to get used to coming up with an optimal solution, explaining your solution verbally and write bug free code on a whiteboard, under time limit.

(This is the hardest part of the interview for me, even after spending close to 6 months practising multiple times a week.)

Resources: Leetcode, Cracking The Coding Interview and videos from this [guy](https://www.youtube.com/user/tusharroy2525/videos)

### Object Oriented Design
I would suggest choosing a Object-Oriented language (Java or C++) and learning OOP design patterns. You should be able to explain things like Encapsulation and Inheritance, and demonstrate them using code. For design patterns, it is a bit harder if you haven't spent  some time reading/dealing with different code bases because design patterns are there to help structure/architect your code. But you should still try to find examples online to know when and how these patterns are put into use.

If you can also demonstrate SOLID principles and things like dependency injection in an OOP interview, they will gain you extra points because they are good practises in my opinion. If you know MVC, Reactive patterns, etc then bring them up in the interview as well.

Try practising by designing things like a chess game, airplane or coffee machine.

Here are two short guides [1](http://snowdream.github.io/115-Java-Interview-Questions-and-Answers/115-Java-Interview-Questions-and-Answers/en/oop.html), [2](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans) I used for quick recap before an interview.

### System Design
My favourite part of the interview! To prepare for system design interview I would suggest reading everything in the [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) and watching videos from these playlists [1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrmLmBdmIlps7GJJWW9I7N0P0rB0C3eY2) [2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMCXHnjXnTnvo6alSjVkgxV-VH6EPyvoX) Learn the trade-offs between Relational and NoSQL databases, microservices and monolith, etc. You should be able to answer questions like: How would you scale different services? Where are the bottlenecks in the system? How do distributed caches and databases work? What are the applications of UDP and TCP? When to use a message queue? How does an OS handle multiple processes?

Once you have a good grasp of different tools available to design a system, then try practising by sketching out the architecture of existing services e.g. facebook chat, uber drivers-passengers matching, google map, etc. Ask yourself how the design will be different when you have 500, 500000 and 5 billion visitors to your system. Keep in mind there is no right or wrong answers, but you should be able to justify the design choices during the interview.

During the interview, treat it as a conversation and keep your design as simple as possible at first. Then asks questions like ""Where would you prefer I focus more and expand on?"" and ""Am I going in the right direction?"" (so you can backtrack and re-adjust your solution if needed)

That's it! :) I hope this post helps those of you interested in working for a Big N or any other companies. It is not an easy process but it doesn't matter what school you went to or if you didn't have a lot of interesting work experience/side projects, it comes down how well you perform in the technical interview. Ultimately they just want to hire people who meet or exceed a certain threshold of technical competency.",2018-09-25 10:03:41

Germany: 120k

Would you guys prefer living in the US to have a higher TC?

- Cost of Living: Remote vs In-Person
You could do remote while living in a cheaper place to save money — at least from what I know in the US — especially considering how vast it is. Many opportunities for cheap housing if you look correctly. 
- Healthcare
I know Europe generally has free healthcare. US healthcare is sponsored by the companies and are generally good depending on the company. 
- Political Beliefs 
US is more conservative than Europe and Europe is more liberal than US. If those sort of things matter to you.

But after I finish with my studies I really want to reach my full potential, so for me looking for an opportunity abroad is the right thing to do.

The real thing that concerns me now is how limited I am from the fact that I don't speak German. I have a lot of friends and relatives in both Germany and Switzerland, so immigrating to one those countries seems pretty reasonable at the time. On the other hand, my time is really limited, so I don't know if it's worth learning a new language just in case I found a job there. I mean, maybe it's better investing that time into a side project, enhancing my portfolio, interview preparation etc.

Do you think that in our field as long as we speak English, the language is not a constraint ? 

It is worth worrying about Switzerland and Germany, or I can find better opportunities in England or other English friendly countries ?",2021-12-25 14:14:52
r3nb2o,How do you work remotely internationally?,"Hi, I currently work remotely since a couple of years (pre-covid) in a nice city in France.

I want to keep working remotely and at the same time increase my TC, the best way to do this would be to work remotely for a US based company. I was wondering, for people working like this, how did you do it? How are you currently doing it (tax & shit, going through a service like [https://remote.com/](https://remote.com/) or freelancing to said companies)?

And anything you'd like to add on the subject.

nsqumv,[UK] Offer for 45 hours a week. Am I wrong to have assumed 40 hours? How many work hours is standard?,"Hi! 

I just signed an offer letter negotiating leave and salary based on what I expected to be a standard 40 hour week (US company, so I never assumed lower hours to be on the table, even if I would love 37.5).

Problem is, now that I see the contract, they're trying to make me sign for 45. This is a significantly lower hourly salary (I'm getting ~50K which I see as honest, but not high tier either, so it's like 44.5K, I do get stock options though). There's also a clause saying weekly average may be more than 48 hours with 3 months notice to withdraw consent.

Question is, am I wrong to have assumed 40 hours to be standard? Of course clarifying would have been good, but I'd never heard of contracts for more than 40 hours.

I'll gladly work some extra (I expected that to be the case), just don't want my weekly expectation and hourly pay to be based on that figure.",2021-06-05 08:10:18
kl6t73,Is Stockholm worth it despite lower salaries?,"So Stockholm has lower salaries when compared to Germany and Netherlands, although net salary isn't that much lower, and cost of living is higher in Stockholm. 

Are there government benefits (that dont exist in Germany or Netherlands) that compensate the lower salary? 

By the way, I know Berlin is cheap as hell with a good salary but I dislike that kind of city/vibe, Im not interested in city nightlife and prefer a peaceful, clean city with nice people. Munich is an option, maybe Rotterdam or Eindhoven. Can any people who have lived in Stockholm tell me if it's worth it over those other cities despite the lower disposable income?",2020-12-27 16:50:36
gzx8f7,What's it like working as SWE at Google Warsaw (or in Poland in general)?,"Hello everyone,

I'm considering applying to a SWE position at the Warsaw office of Google, but I just want to first gather some insights. It looks like most of the positions are related to Cloud, so I'm wondering how, as someone who has mostly worked as a Web app developer (mostly in the backend), I'd fit in such role. My impression is that you'd need some sort of system engineering background for that. I do have some background in operations, but that's about it; I know how to run things on Kubernetes but not to build or maintain Kubernetes itself, for example.

In general, how is it like living in Warsaw compared to other more popular cities in Europe like? Is the food better than in the UK? How is the tech scene over there?",2020-06-09 21:56:12
1bkw18n,Soo… what now?,"Hey folks, so I come to you with a first world problem.

First of all, I know there are many of us CS folk out there struggling to land a job that pays anything. I truly understand that. I hope we all land a gig that we enjoy. That being said...

Little bit about me, I’m a non-eu immigrant living in Germany. I’m married to a EU citizen which gives me access to the market. I have around 6 YoE professionally but I’ve been developing stuff since childhood. I have a bachelor’s degree with a crazy high GPA. Actively learning German, currently B1.

I’ve been working in Germany for last 2 years. Recently, some unfortunate events happened in my company and I decided to look for a position. I got interviews, even offers.

Now for the ""problem"". I know this has been discussed a lot before but my issue is the salary ceiling. I’m making 86k atm, zero benefits. All the companies I interview usually have a mini heart attack the moment I mention 90k for salary. Feels like the ceiling is 85k. There are no staff levels, no growth etc. as well. At this moment

So the question is… what now? Do I aim for outstanding companies, just go with the flow etc.

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t expect to be rich just for working an average job but how do I push myself if there is no next step? How did you deal with it? Am I overearning already?

1b0n9xf,Google AI Engineer: last round,"Hi guys,

I made it to the final round of the recruiting process for an AI Engineer L4 position at Google Cloud, Paris (France), and I am having questions about the last round.

Here is how the process went so far:

* **Coding Interview**: passed with optimal solution, solved 2 problems and still had time left (recruiter told me the interviewer was extremely pleased with my performance)
* **Role-related Knowledge Interview #1**: correctly answered most questions, though I lacked some business related experience (recruiter told me the interviewer thought I had solid knowledge and did a good interview, though it shows I am still a junior (1.5 YoE) and I could've answered some questions better)
* **Role-related Knowledge Interview #2**: correctly answered most questions too (similar feedback)

I am having my last interview (Googleyness) in a few days. I am currently preparing for it.

People around me tell me it is as if I already had the job (I am usually good when it comes to communication), but I don't want to find myself guilty of counting my chickens before they're hatched. Do you think the last round is ""easy"", and one only gets the job denied if they really failed at it? What do you think are the odds I get the job, if I do an ok performance for the last round, based on the three precedent rounds?

I know I should just focus on working on the interview, but I swear it is so hard not to ponder all the time lol thanks in advance!",2024-02-26 17:31:08

11a6xe6,Is my company's recruiter bad or is the dev market bad?,"Please everyone I realize this is one of those titles and posts that are asking for aggressive responses but please please just read the whole thing before you judge  


I am a 5YoE senior backend engineer working at a small startup in Berlin.

Recently we lost our front-end senior and our fullstack mid and started to look for 2 full stacks instead. 


The front-end mid, the tech lead and I have gone through over 40 interviews so far. Being a small team, it has heavily impacted our productivity. We don't have time to work anymore and it's all just interviews, interview assessments, preparations etc. 



Out of the 300 candidates we screened and the 40 we interviewed, only 5 fit the bill for a fullstack senior role. We gave up halfway looking for seniority given how hard it was to just find someone qualified.


Our definition of good was pretty simple:

- Know react.js
- Know some design patterns
- Know how to test well
- Know some SOLID
- all backend stuff (spring boot, sql, etc.) are a plus 



We have legitimately not been able to find more than 5 candidates who fit that bill, 3 of which have rejected the offer, one which got accepted and the last one got his VISA rejected. Not a single candidate interviewed had the seniority for the role, however.


I am just wondering if it is our recruiter that did not have the right reach or ads for this role or if the market is very dry right now? Because AFAIK it's a bad market for job seekers but not the other way around, no?",2023-02-23 19:52:21

oolecp,75k+7k eur for tech lead in Frankfurt?,"I'm a software engineer with tech lead and architect experience totaling 16 years in my home country (in central america) and some foreign countries, remotely. Currently I work for a US company remotely leading a small team on backend, frontend, and devops stuff.

I recently got offered a job for a tech lead position in NodeJS, NestJS, TypeScript, etc in Frankfurt am Main. I will have some architect responsibilities, but limited until a possible promotion.

I consider myself an excellent engineer and tech lead. Always outstanding at every company I work for. Salary raises and early promotions are what I'm used to. However, I do lack experience working in bigger companies.

This job seems like a good learning opportunity as they work with a heavy microservice focus, Kubernetes, etc. Stuff that's not easy to be exposed to in my job market. The most important thing to me is they are offering relocation/visa sponsorship. The salary is 75k euro and with bonuses and benefits it comes out to around 81k.

I should mention I find it hard to interview with companies since I am new to dealing with Europeans and I also have Asperger's so I have difficulty self-promoting and negotiating.

I make a very good salary at my current company. Actually, considering taxes, my net salary would be higher where I am now (edit: coupled with a lower cost of living). But I want to live in Europe.

Should I be counting my lucky stars and take this job given the fact that it would essentially change the trajectory of my life (and career) by moving to Germany or maybe try to hold out for something better? Thanks.

So I did my Masters in a good university with good grades, met few contacts while graduating and got the job at my very first interview in a very small company. The pay was good, so I didnt think much and didnt apply anywhere and joined the work, and everytime I felt like applying for a new job, my laziness stopped me and I felt comfortable at my workplace, 4 years down the lane, I literally feel I havent learned any new technologies as my company works mainly with old technologies which people wont even hear nowadays! 

I feel like a stupid when I talk to my other friends from university who are working in other companies. I regret about my choices in the past, and I feel I have wasted my prime in this dead end job. I am thinking of applying for jobs now, and the companies would expect a lot more from a 4-years experienced developer.

-	Office culture and WLB from the perspective of the most junior engineers
-	Confidence and mental well-being - was it stressful? Confidence-building? Supportive? Did you feel overwhelmed beyond a comfortable level?

-	How did it compare with grad/entry-level peers in other companies, esp. outside London or in (ostensibly) less competitive sectors?

m2qmt8,I always fail coding challenges. I need help," So I am kind of a new grad (2019), I had a job that I really didn't like right out of college but I quit last June due to several reasons. I have been on the job hunt ever since. You see I don't have a problem with getting interviews that much. I got many interviews. I just have a specific problem with coding challenges. No matter how easy they are and no matter how many I have solved on leetcode. I have been practicing on leetcode easy and medium problems. I am not consistent. But I did solve many problems. But I failed every coding test no matter what. Some are with very small companies, medium and three Big N interviews.

I feel like its also a mindset issue. I somehow have it in my head that I fail all coding challenges. I feel like I sometimes do sabotage myself and fail the challenge. Is that even possible? I sometimes know some people who solved challenges by similar companies and I have it in my head there in no way I am as good as them. Just I have some bad beliefs about my abilities that I feel maybe a factor here.

Another issue that happens sometimes is when I have practiced some difficult problems before the challenge or the interview, I sometimes start off thinking about the problem the wrong way just to make it similar to something I solved recently, I start thinking about it in a more difficult way and I end up getting blocked. Sometimes this even happens with a problem I solved before.

I dont have a communication problem, I have always gotten feedback about how good I am at sharing my thought process and explaining and dissecting the problem from small companies and some Big N companies. I just never passed whether it is a challenge on a coding platform or in person.

I have two upcoming interviews, one on codility and one in person and I really really want to do the best. They are both in four days. Small companies so I am expecting easy to medium kind of problems. What do you suggest I do this time? Please help me out I really need it. How do I change my mindset? How do I prepare and practice?",2021-03-11 13:59:20

Had no contact with the company itself, only with the recruiter who forwarded a take home coding challenge as a first step in the interviewing process. I was like okay why not but honestly the scope of the project is too much. The requirements are fairly simple as it is a three page CRUD React app, however the deadline is two days which seem way too soon for an app like that. Mind you I'm no senior.

The features are as follows: a login page with firebase authentication, three pages - each with data fetched from an api, search option, pagination, a new form to add new entries to api, a form to edit entries and delete option for each entry.

I ran the requirements with ChatGPT and it gave me an estimate between 20-30 hours which seems like my guess too. There is no way I'd be able to complete it within two days, unless they expect me to spend 10+ hours a day working on it  and I haven't even had an initial call with them.

I assume that the interest rates being increased so dramatically fast by the ECB is finally taking its toll on european companies and new projects are almost non existant (higher investments costs)

(Also I live in The Netherlands and the other community is too american-focused so I will paste the other op here:  


Long story short, a friend of mine with a track record creating another startup (he got an exit) came to me with an idea that he has so I build everything (I am a senior full-stack software engineer). I’ve been looking for an opportunity like this for a long time and I got excited until we discussed equity (I want to be a cofounder and divide cost and work 50/50) but he sh3ut me down.  
  
Basically, he said that the idea is his, and he has the experience in the business side and he basically wants to hire someone to build it. Also, I don’t have any experience in the business side so it seems unfair to give me such a big equity (according to him and I could agree that 50% is too much but he offers 0%...).  
  
He offered a nice enough salary (same I am making already but with the freedom to choose my own stack and work in whatever way I want which seems nice), but still, I feel I would be working for him (he promised that’d not to be the case but I don’t believe it) and I wanted to be equals instead. I have a few questions:  
  
1. Why would he be so reluctant to giving any equity considering that he has nothing built or the ability to do so?  
  
2. Should I try to negotiate or consider this a red flag since it’s happening so soon and just move on?  
  
3. What could be my move here? (Considering that I really like the project and the business idea and I would love to partner with him to learn the “business side” from him)

147r95r,Canadian Software Engineer looking for simpler life,"I am a software engineer in his late 20's working at tech company in Vancouver, Canada. At my company we have many levels from an Associated SWE to a Principal and even Fellow SWE. I am personally L3 (one level below senior) and on track to be promoted to senior within a year-ish. 

I don't care about moving beyond Senior. I never want to be a Software Architect or a Senior Expert SWE Etc. I don't need a super high paying tech salary forever. I just want to continue investing in my skills until im senior and then having a simpler life (thinking about work less, working less in general, spending more time with my hobbies and volunteering). I want better balance between my career and my life. 

My parents' background is within the EU and I can live and work there. I think it might be easier to obtain a better work-life balance in the EU. How much is true about work-life balance (specifically technical roles) in the EU? I have some questions:

- Is the work-life balance as good as people say it is? How often do you do overtime? 
- How common are 4 day work weeks in your region/area?
- From conversations you guys have/hear, do you think a 4 day work week will grow in popularity in the future? Which countries do you think are most open to the idea? 
- Do you feel quite secure in your job or do you feel you could be laid off at any moment? 
- I have a STEM masters but not in computer science, are many companies open to diverse educational backgrounds? Do you coworkers have such backgrounds? 

(I have researched these issues for aggregate statistics as well as job posting criteria but I am specifically interested in hearing the thoughts of you guys).

I know I will not be working 5 days a week forever, it just steals my life and I have no time for anything. Understanding where the discourse is moving in terms of the acceptance of 4 day work weeks is a big one for me.

Any general recommendations for obtaining a simpler life while continuing in Software? 

Thanks.",2023-06-12 16:32:17

uqvpmv,I don't like my job,"Throwaway account because I'm afraid that this post could affect my career negatively.

One year ago I left a small company with an outdated tech stack for a bigger multinational, hoping that it would positively affect my career. There aren't many big tech companies in the country I live in, so this looked like a good option.

One year later I've realized that this job is emotionally draining, but I can't find any company in the area that excites me. Yes, they use modern stacks, but everything else frustrates me to no end. Other than being able to put some buzzwords on my resume, I'm not sure if this has helped me at all.

\- Constant reorganizations: Over the course of one year, I have had 4 managers, worked on 5 projects, and been part of 3 teams. So far all projects have been trashed, since management decided to change course.

\- Too many meetings that talk about nothing. Dailies take one hour. Weekly planning sessions are 2 hour monologues from one of the most senior engineers.

\- No clear goal of what the company wants to achieve, goals keep changing.

\- I've joined the company with no knowledge of their internal grades. After one month it became clear that I should be 1 if not 2 grades higher. All 4 of my managers have stated the same. Promotion is promised ""but can't be guaranteed"". Feels like a carrot on a stick.

I don't know if this is normal in large companies. I come from a small company where I knew everyone. Direction was clear, growth was slow but steady. I feel like my current company might be shrinking, and management is just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.

I'm not sure what to do. Should I leave for another company that doesn't interest me for a lower salary? Or stay hope the situation improves?",2022-05-16 13:14:47

nm89a5,How long would this coding challenge take you?," I applied to a company for an Front-End Developer position. I was sent this assignment to complete.

They said it would take about 3-4 hrs to complete. I am not a big fan of really long take home assignments where everything needs to be done from scratch as it does not make sense to spend more than a few hours on one interview round, so I am kind of contemplating whether to do this or not as to me this would take more than 4 hours to do given the fact that I have start from scratch, and some of the optional ones will take more time as well (excluding that last optional as that sounds preposterous, never going to do that for sure)

kg87hx,Bloomberg (London) vs Amazon (Cambridge) - Internship,"I have been incredibly lucky to receive internship offers from Bloomberg and Amazon and am having trouble picking one. The pay is about the same (Bloomberg has a slightly higher relocation bonus)

Pros and Cons:

**Bloomberg**

Pros:

* Higher Graduate pay (60-70k)
* Better location
* Mainly use C++ - could be better for HFT in the future
* Better wlb/culture
* Get to state a preference on which project interns work on

Cons:

* Legacy codebase/older tech
* Maybe less prestigious 

**Amazon**

Pros:

* More prestigious/easier to get into F/G in the future
* Better tech stack
* More interesting product (devices)

Cons:

* Worse wlb 
* Lower grad pay (45-50k)
* I prefer London over Cambridge

My goal is to transfer to the US in a few years and I've heard that Amazon US has extremely bad WLB which worries me too.

I got Amazon's offer after I already accepted Bloomberg so I would have to reneg. 

I'm leaning towards Bloomberg for grad $$$, would passing up Amazon be a mistake? How big of a difference in prestige is there? Would BB's legacy tech hold me back in the future?

This is usually happens when I finish technical task and I already spend at least 3 days overall for interview. You know the researching, preparing for and having the interview - sometimes you have technical take home challenge as well.

With all of that when I reply back to the rejection letter I either get ghosted or they refused an specific answer to my technical abilities to what they went wrong. This happened for more that 8 times now!

12a40om,Corporate World & Money killed all the passion I had for coding...,"Some years ago I felt in love with programming. I was so excited by the idea of being a dev, everything related was so sexy and atractive. I could dive into books, courses and katas from CodeWars for hours and lose track of time. But then, I finished my degree and got a job. It was all about maintaining an old project filled with very smelly code, rushing timelines, high stress, dealing with a paranoid client... The art, the love and passion dissapeared.

What's this thing called money that makes people lose the ability to love things? My father told me once he wanted to be a geographer but he had to become a lawyer because it was more money-secure. How sad this system is, where greed, fear of poverty and consumerism turn people into soul-depleted zombies.

I betrayed myself, I fell into their vicious game and now there's only slavery ahead. I can only call this slavery and we should do something about it. What an insult is to turn the noble art of programming into such a thing.

I'm targeting Google specifically because I love its products, I feel it's one of the best companies to develop myself on all areas of my life, and from several talks with ex Google employees, it was a liffechanging experience for them (who later launched their own startups).  


I'd love if you could share your experiences with the company, what do you like and dislike, if the interviewing process is still leetcode stuff, what resources would you recommend for someone who is willing to be a part of Google, and some HR contacts you would point me towards to on linkedin and anything you might think of (also a salary range would be nice considering I'm not fully aware of Switzerland's economy and what 5000 euros might mean here in Romania, in Switzerland might be considered poor, I dunno).

mmnfbz,I think I shot myself in the foot by learning JS as my first programming language,"Hello!

So, I'm guessing you already read the title. I started programming about 5 months ago, and naturally, I chose JavaScript as my first language to learn. Well, had I known what I know now, I do not think I would start with JS again.

I am more interested in web backend, I do not like styling with CSS at all. But then again, you would say that you do not necessarily have to write CSS 24/7 if you are a front-end developer, and you can concentrate on JS. Well, the thing is, I took a look at the job market for front-end development, and there is indeed a large number of jobs, but there is also a large number of candidates for each one of them. And that is true even for jobs that require frontend frameworks knowledge.

And so, I thought about going forward with JS and eventually study Node.js and SQL. But, there is a problem: most Node.js jobs are actually full-stack positions, which means that I have to come in contact with the frontend, and I am also afraid of being overwhelmed. And those that only require you to know Node.js and some database skills are not many.

That's my dilemma right now. My objective, for now, is to raise my chances of landing a job, and I am afraid starting with JS was actually a mistake. I am now on the fence about continuing with JS and then Node.js, or starting anew with PHP or Java.

Note: the job market I am talking about is Europe, specifically Germany.

Every few years i will get a promotion. Currently im aiming for lead engineer around my 30s and architect around my 33s. After this i would probably need to jump to management to still have good growth opportunities. 

Ever since the netherlands have been in lockdown again, ive been thinking that i am quiet happy as an dev and do not want to grow to a position past architect where i will no longer be coding. This can ofcourse change in the future, but im happy as is because work is dynamic with different projects. Worst case, i can always quit and join another company as a dev where i have a new environment again. 

Im currently working in a f500 company and have always worked at similar companies ever since i got my msc at 22. During my bsc and msc i worked as an analyst/engineer at similar companies and always had growth in my mind. As im growing up i care less and less about money as ive hit a decent paycheck. Nowadays im caring more about my enjoyment of work.

vem9cp,Got an offer too quickly,"Hello,
I applied 3 weeks ago for a junior developer job (with a focus on cybersecurity) in Germany (I'm from italy).
After a week I had a call with the hiring manager and a team member, the call lasted 30/35 minutes and at the end they told me that I was matching their expectations for the job and that I would fit well in the team.
I received the offer few days later with a gross salary of +60k euro/year. The weird thing is that the interview was not so technical a part from a couple of questions on REST api, clean code, code testing and other broader topics. I was competent on most of the technology stack that they use at work but not everything.

I already have a work experience of 6 months and an internship on the same small company + few projects of mine have around 100 stars on github.

utcu6d,How much anti-Russian sentiment should I expect?,"I'm moving out of Russia for good due to the ongoing crisis, and looking for a new home. I've always considered moving to Europe at some point, so countries like Germany, the Netherlands or UK are my primary candidates.

While I have many years of development experience, I'm afraid the whole situation can make the job search much more difficult than usual, and want to know what to expect.

I suppose that most reasonable companies do not hold anything against ordinary citizens, but they may have valid practical concerns: what if the company's country suddenly stops giving visas to Russians, or banks refuse to work with them? While this is not *really* the case (visa applications are still handled; many banks agree to open an account after providing a proof of residence), I worry that these rumors introduce a lot of bias against hiring developers from Russia.

Are my concerns valid? How much actual bias there is when it comes to hiring decisions?

The answers probably won't affect my decision, but knowing what to prepare for would give me some peace of mind.

I already spent 4 hours on this company and they want 4 more hours of my time. They are not Google and they don't pay as them or give benefits they do. Is it a new thing in the industry to be interviewed for close to 8 hours? I am not applying for CTO/CEO position and it is a bit ridiculous.

They recruit for mid-senior person but my current job was 2.5 hours of interviews in total. And it felt right and I have no complaints with position.

e3iaap,I feel so stupid and angry. Please dont make the same mistakes as me.,"I am a 31 year old guy. In the last two years I decided to improve myself and give my 110 percent  to everything I do in life. I achieved many big goals in my life due to my changed mindset and recently passed all the five dutch language exams to qualify for the nationality. A task which seemed impossible to my old self was two weeks of work for the new me.

I decided to apply the same principles everywhere, including my work. The cream rises to the top after all right? 

I have been killing myself for the last ten months. I finish a task as quickly as possible and pickup the next without wasting time. While some colleagues are waiting for the next day to pickup new tasks, I pickup a new task as soon as I finish.  If the tasks are finished in the sprint I pickup tasks from the next sprint. In the current sprint I did more than three times the work compared to  other members of the team. I do things quickly and believe it or not I am the reason that we have always been ahead of plan in the last 10 months.

Two weeks ago there was a planning week at my company. No one was doing work on the planning days. I squeezed in 16-20 hours of work in between those meetings.  That was the reason that at the start of the sprint I had already finished most of the work.

In the evenings I workout and read a non-fiction book to improve myself. In the last two weeks I was so tired that I had no energy to workout or do anything. My body was crushed with tiredness and in pain at the end of the day. I tried reading books but my brain was blank and I couldnt retain anything. Yesterday I didnt even want to entertain myself. I hated the idea of watching my favorite tv show.

Now here is the sad part. No one knows or remembers what I am doing. Last week I even went to the team lead to tell him what I was doing. Today during the standup People said ""Hey Our planning isnt going so great. We are over-estimating tasks. Look we have to pull tasks from the next sprint into this sprint"". 

No one mentioned or remembered the hours and hours of extra effort I put. Infact the planning was wrong and we are overestimating the tasks. I was pissed. Later I asked the team lead for a short meeting and told him I didnt like the discussion this morning. Asked him why he thinks the tasks were being finished so quickly? He told me because they were underestimating the team. I told him that the tasks were finished because I was working outside of the sprint. One the first day of the sprint I had finished a major part of the work. I even told him and he didnt remember. He told me that he appreciates that I am motivated and he does not want me to slow down. 

Sad that no one else cares or remembers. 

To top it all off yesterday I found out on the /r/Netherlands subreddit that [I maybe underpaid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/e2zd26/is_4k_a_good_bargain_to_work_in_the_netherlands/f8zv579/) for my age and experience. I am a contractor so I sent an email to my contracting company about this and they ignored my email. This is the tenth time in the last three months they ignored my email. This is driving me nuts.

This is a matrix organization which means I have another manager. I will share my opinion of how things went and for my contracting company I will soon setup a meeting with them to give them a piece of my mind.

I dont know the symptoms but I may be getting a burnout. The sides of my head feel heavy and there is burning sensation there. It also feels like there is pressure on my head and my body feels tired all the time. 

I am not going to overwork myself going forward. I am done with this.

18cwdiz,How do I hire and pay EU developers?,"Hey everyone, 

I am a US client of a large software development firm with the team spread across Europe. I love my dev team, but I’m not happy with the dev house. Recently they announced that they’re going to shift all devs to Asia. This would be a huge setback for me because I will lose all of the experience and knowledge share we’ve built. Also, many of our team are from Ukraine and Belarus, so when they get fired they will lose their visa status within 6 months.

So, I want to fire the dev house and hire the team, but I can’t do this directly because of some contractual clauses that prevent it. My plan is to create a new company to hire the team, but I don’t really know the norms of software devs in Europe. I’ve also never navigated EU taxes, employee benefits/entitlements before, etc.

Would you prefer to be contracted out by a dev house or work directly with a client?

Would you prefer to work directly for the company or as a contractor?

Do you typically get paid hourly or a salary?

What are some things I should expect hiring remote devs in the EU?

At the end of the day I want to do what’s right for my team. Thanks for your insight!",2023-12-07 14:09:02
15azuof,"I was asked if this career is 'the right fit' for me, and now I'm no longer sure.","I was recently called in by my boss to do a standard work review. Everything was fine - I did my work as told and delivered it on time. However, nearing the end of it, I was asked if I actually 'like' programming and see it as something I would do for the rest of my life. He asked due to his concern over me not doing any programming or anything else CS-related as a hobby or at home, and not exactly showing any interest when it comes to new technologies or discussing them. I couldn't really give a straight answer.  
  
Since I started studying CS I was constantly indifferent about it in general. I didn't really find myself in any other sort of career or profession, all I know is that I wanted to do something 'computer related' and that's how I ended up here.  
  
I do general programming work - studied it, learned it, done it. But I've never had any true excitement about it, like ""Oh, I get to learn a new language, I want to find out what are its quirks, how I could use it, what I can make with it"" and so on. I don't mind getting challenged or needing to learn something new, but it's something I would never personally seek out myself for enjoyment alone. I always saw my career as a means to an end and nothing more (that being getting paid).  
  
Is there something wrong with my attitude? Should I properly start caring so that I could actually advance in my career? Or should I just let everything go and choose another? I was told that there are definitely jobs one can find where they ""Just do as told"", where you code by specification, and that's that.

hzbzm8,Turning down an offer on a startup for a big company. Some questions and feedback on my decision.,"Hi,

I recently got two offers for Werkstudent (Working Student) in Munich, one for a big company and another from a startup. The salary in the big company is okay, but not great. The startup offered to pay more for me to turn down the other offer. I decided to stay with the offer from the big company.  
My reasons being:

\- I think the bigger company will have more effect on my curriculum.

\- It is a company I dreamed of working for.

\- They will do home office for some more months and in general, employee safety was more apparent than in the startup.

\- When I visited the startup I noticed people seemed to be pushed to their limits (which although I enjoy to be challenged, I fear for an unhealthy environment). They also seemed heavy smokers (which could be a stressful environment).

\- The office of the big company was really comforting.   


Do any of you have experience with big company and/or startups in the Munich area?

Are my points valid or did I mislead myself?

I live in a small city outside of Munich, is it possible for me to ask for the company to pay for transportation?

hqxd8i,Thoughts on the Netherlands for a long-term career in software engineering?,"I moved to the Netherlands from overseas about two years ago. I’m on my second company and I have to say I’m bit disappointed of the state of their technology and organization in both companies. The first one having over 200 engineers and the second about 30. 

Also given the financial situation of my current company I don’t see myself  continuing the following year. 

My previous companies before coming here had very high technical level and contributions to open source projects. To give an example, now I have to argue for hours to implement best practices that previously I gave for granted. 

Do I have just bad luck or my experience is an average one?

Will I find mid-small companies with better engineering practices and technical leadership in the UK or Germany?

Do the Netherlands have potential as a high quality tech hub? Should I get better at interviewing future companies here?

1apmkfh,Received a Job offer finally after 7 months,"A big thanks to the Reddit community, after 7-8 months of Job hunting and constantly improving my cv , I finally got a Job after lot of rejections. Sometimes I even get rejections by post.XD

My profile
Bachelors and 2 years experience in my Home country.
Currently masters in Germany, planning to do part time after joining the job.



I have few questions:

1. I'm on One month medical leave in my home country from 1 march to 10 April, any suggestions if I should cut short my Leave for Blue card processing?

2. They asked me if I wish to join by April 15th if I finish my masters or can also join before that if I choose to. The fact is my masters will be finished by October this year. What should I do should I join or not?

3. They are small company and offering me 45k, is it too low? I also have 4 interviews scheduled this week.But I also must confirm the offer by Feb 19.Any suggestions?

19chwqw,"NL 30% ruling changes - wealth tax applies immediately, other countries to see a rise in US/international tech jobs?","Long story short, the 30% ruling in the Netherlands just switched from 5 years of 30% exempted + wealth tax exemption to a 20/20/20 month 30%/20%/10% with no wealth tax exemption. Many US software engineers would be coming to the Netherlands with a few million dollars of savings, so the removal of the wealth tax exemption represents taxes upwards of $20k/million of savings/year. This means that Switzerland, which already had higher wages, will be much more appealing, and will put German tech wages pretty on-par with Dutch tech wages.

Belgium, on the other hand, has an 8-year 30% ruling that also exempts certain benefits (iirc housing/tuition/etc benefits go untaxed). Does anyone think this will cause changes in where US and other international tech companies will set up shop, or know of any companies with Dutch presence that have already hinted towards new offices in other markets?

Similarly, is anyone here changing plans or planning to move out of the Netherlands, based on the changes to the Dutch 30% ruling?

Edit: seeing as I have been a bit argumentative in the comments, I will emphasize that Dutch politics are for the Dutch. I may criticize the decision to change the 30% ruling (I think it's a net tax and economic loss for the Netherlands, being used as a band-aid for housing and cost of living complaints fueled by anti-immigrant, far-right sentiment) but at the end of the day the Dutch have a right to do what they want, and regardless I personally am still interested in moving to the Netherlands regardless of the hefty tax bill associated with it. I just question the idea that it makes sense to change something that gave folks 5 years of runtime to settle in where they wouldn't just be taxed equal to their earning potential, which would be a common case for some tech worker demographics, instead turning it into ""hey! If you come here you can work to earn enough to pay your taxes and net nothing"" which makes other countries more appealing for tech industry growth.

13jy02b,Does it make sense for a software developer in Spain to want to move to richer countries in Northern/Central Europe?,"Hi. I am a 21 y.o. Android developer from Madrid, Spain. I have around 1.5 years of professional experience but I had already been programming for many years before that.

Most of my life, my expectation was that at some point of my career I would have to emigrate to one of Europe's richer countries like Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, etc. and continue my career as a developer there if I wanted to get decently paid. I liked the idea because of the culture exchange but as a Spaniard, things like climate, temperature and few daylight hours were backing me off a little bit. I could confirm this when I went to Berlin in summer and the sun was setting at 19pm and it was relatively cold.

Now, I've been talking to a couple people that also work in tech but came to work remotely for their companies while living here. And most of them told me that quality of life here is just amazing, that yes I would earn way more but life is also way more expensive. That they wouldn't go back to living in their countries, that if they were me, what they would do is just look for one of these companies based in one of these rich countries and work remotely for them from here. That way I, even if I don't earn as much as I would do there, I would still be earning an amount that would allow me to live extremely well in a country that has everything someone could ask for.

Now, I don't want to base my entire opinion on such a reduced sample, but this really surprised me because until then, I hadn't even considered how fortunate I may be to already live here and that that was actually a possibility, so maybe it doesn't make sense for someone already living here and that can work remotely to want to leave?

I know this is a somewhat subjective question but is there any objective reason to want to emigrate given such circumstances? Is life Spain that awesome in comparison to those countries? I've only ever lived here so I have no idea.",2023-05-17 10:37:47

Edit: I think I should clarify a little bit more what I'm looking for. I'm curious about how office culture works in Europe and I understand that it can differ. For example in a generalized way you could say that many US companies are driven by engineering. Engineering drives the strategy, has a large say into what product gets developed, etc. Is that the same or is engineering more a service station for maybe the business or design department? How much responsibility is on the individual to find projects that make a difference? Are you expected to be at your desk at specific times or does it not matter as long as the work gets done? Do you get rewarded for writing beautiful code or does it matter whether the project actually drives the business forward? More general, what does one get rewarded/promoted for? Are there close collaborations with departments like design or product or is it more handing off over the wall?

18oc1x7,Is there anyone else who got into CS just to get a job and earn a good living?,"From what I've read on the internet in the past few years, this is a field that most people get into because they've already enjoyed coding in their freetime and it's mainly a hobby to them, working in tech is only a secondary thing for them.

I'm kinda the opposite, the reason I started studying CS is because it lets me move anywhere in the world and earn enough to live well in that area, have a somewhat flexible and hybrid work schedule and because it seems like something that'll probably be in demand as long as you keep on learning. It's also something that'll help me leave my country (Hungary) in the next few years with relatively high stability. Of course, before I started university, I did learn some coding on my own just to see if I'd really hate it or something, but it turns out I find it fun and it's something I could do as a job. However, if this field wasn't very well paid, I probably wouldn't even be doing any of this in my freetime, I'd just choose another high-demand career, or something else that can earn me a good living. 

Obviously I don't hate it, otherwise I wouldn't be studying CS. Obviously I know that I'll never be able to stop learning and I'm okay with that too because I find it fun most of the time, it's just that I mainly look at this as a career. I don't work on my own projects in my freetime, I don't do leetcode (though if I needed any of the two to progress my career or switch to a different field, I'd be open to do so because it seems fun, I just don't see a need to do it rn).

11tb28l,Is it normal for US based companies to lowball remote EU hires so much?,"Just had this weird experience:

Applied to a US based company as a remote senior android dev. 

Told them my rate was 50eur/hour. 

Their internal recruiter who is based in Poland told me that their budget is max 41 eur/hour max for a senior role. 

I was like ok maybe its worth a shot.

Passed the initial interview, did the technical interview, seemed like I did really great.

Today I receive an offer from that recruiter of 30 eur/hour. Feedback was that Im senior in some areas but in most of them Im a ""really strong mid level"" so they cant offer senior rate for me. Right now Im thinking of how to respond to that.

What is this? Seniors are expected to know everything 100 percent? Every senior I worked with usually specializes in 2-3 areas and looks up others as he goes. I guess shes trying to lowball me or something.

To be honest this is hilarious for me. If I wanted I could land a contracting gig with same 30eur/hour in my city 10km away from my home (Im based in Latvia, capital city Riga). But this is US based company so what the heck? Am I being gaslighted? Or is this rate the new normal?

10qgro9,Am I expecting too much (salary)? Job offers Munich(BMW) and Zurich,"Hi there,

I currently work as a software engineer in a medium sized company in Germany (>5 YOE with Java and Kotlin, Masters degree in CS), and started evaluating whether I should switch jobs. 

I’m not unhappy where I am: WLB, employer and colleagues are all fine. Total compensation is in the low 80s (standard 40h/week), cost of living is not super low, but not excessive either, so from that perspective I'm in a comfortable situation. However, things are getting somewhat stale and the outlook for the next years is not particularly exciting. Career-wise I don't think there is all that much to gain anymore at my current position.

I have received two offers so far. In both cases the position/work seems fine, but not to an extend that I feel that I absolutely have to take the offer for my professional fulfillment or whatever. Both would require moving:

* Offer 1 - BMW (Munich): Yearly salary *including* extra payments for vacation, Christmas etc., but *excluding* (not guaranteed) profit sharing would be in mid 90s (40h/week). Considering cost of rent in Munich, I'd expect my personal profit compared to my current situation to be around zero. It could turn positive with that profit share, which according to news articles etc. can be somewhat significant - does anyone know how this is determined? Either way, to me it feels a bit weird to bet on that and I kind of expected a higher base salary (more than 100K?) for a big company in a high cost of living city. Long term career chances could be better than where I'm currently at though, I guess.
* Offer 2 - Smallish company in Zurich: Yearly salary of 115K CHF with 42 hours/week and 5 weeks paid vacation. Considering cost of living in Zurich and negative impact on WLB plus risk of moving to another country, it again feels a bit on the edge.

Am I off base with my expectations? Would you consider these offers or keep looking? Let me know what you think.",2023-02-01 01:29:58

wl92mo,How are the tech scene and housing crisis in NL and Amsterdam/Rotterdam/Eindhoven and how will them be in the future?,"To get the discussion started, I'd like to offer what I've garnered. Kindly feel free to correct.

From what I've read, the tech scene in NL is pretty good in Europe, in terms of job per capita and n. of companies per capita would be one of the best inside EU.

When it comes to the cities, Amsterdam itself is a tier 1.5 tech hub (tier 1 would be London, other tier 1.5 tech hubs would be Berlin and Munich for example, a tier 0 would be the Bay Area in the USA). And many big local or international companies hire in Amsterdam, which means that the salary ceiling is also good (70-80k for seniors at tier 1 local firms, 100k-150k if you're a senior in a tier 2-3 company, and 150k-200k is also possible)

But Amsterdam is crazy expensive: I've looked at some data points, and it looks like an average grad would strugge to save anything in their first 2-3 yrs as juniors: the pay is around 2500-3000, but the rent would take 1000-1500 already, and then insurance, living expenses, and so on. In the end yes the salaries are ""high"" but the CoL is also high: a person needs at least 2000-2500 euro to live well in Amsterdam

The situation will get better as the person hits 70k and hopefully 80k later, but then the housing prices in Amsterdam are though the roof: from my rough estimation, even if they stopped at the high level which they already are, an ok-ish 50sqm appartment 20-40 mins to the center of Amsterdam would cost at least 350-400k, which requires a person to earn 80k per year and have some savings beforehand to cover other expenses related to buying a house. And the month mortage for such a house alone would be 1500-2000. That's insane, because it would mean that a senior SWE/DE/DS earning 80k, which is a top ~~2~~ 10 percent income in NL according to [this source](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/visualisations/income-distribution), would be able to barely afford an ok-ish house in Amsterdam and have to commute every day 1h+ for the work. It's close to the housing situation that London CS seniors are facing.

I've also looked at some other cities with decent IT jobs in NL, and for Rotterdam and Eindhoven, the housing situation for now in these two cities are much better, and the job opportunies are decent compared with other EU cities like Milan, but the companies are mainly local, which means that the salary ceiling is much lower: 70k-80k for pretty much all the seniors, few if any opportunies to go higher than 100k

So in your opinion, how is and will be:

1. the tech scene in NL in general
2. the tech scence in the NL cities (feel free to mention other NL cities other than the three mentioned)
3. the housing crisis in Amsterdam
4. the housing prices in other NL cities, mainly the smaller cities with decent pay and opportunities

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading and your time! At the risk of being repetitive, feel free to correct me!

:)

EDIT: After some my own calculations, I'd say venture to say that a junior earning 2500 euro per month in Amsterdam has roughly the same standards of living and savings potential as a junior earning 1500 euro in Milan, as they both face the same situations roughly speaking: having to share apartment/having to commute a lot if choose to live further away from the center and being able to save little (400 vs 300 prolly)

For middle-level employees, in Amsterdam it would be a bit better already, though not by a big margin: 3000-3500 in Amsterdam vs 2000 in Milan, the former would be able to save 500-1000 more monthly in absolute terms.

For seniors, especially the seniors at tier 2-3 companies (earning 85k-200k and with a monthly salary of 4.25-7.5k), the financial situation in Amsterdam would be a lot better, as the same senior could ask a salary of around 2.3-3k in Milan most likely. So even though in such a case both would live pretty well, the savings potential of the former is 1-8x the second (2k-8k vs 1k-2k)",2022-08-10 21:16:59

I'm mid 20s finishing my Masters Degree in Germany (Computer Science) soon, and I've worked as a working student in random companies, nothing particularly well known. My grades are pretty average to shitty.

I applied at a number of companies, and went through some interview processes.

One american tech company that is seemingly on FAANG level in terms of culture & compensation had 7 interviews with me, two of which I definitely bombed. To my surprise, on monday I got an offer with preliminary information: 

Base Salary of 100k€, 15-25% bonus a year, I can choose anything between 0% and 100% remote, tons of perks (free gym pass, free food in office etc.), 30 days vacation, and the job location is literally where I live right now.

Now I do consider the offer really good for a graduate role, but they want me to start **in 1-2 months already**, and I was planning on finishing my masters degree sometime in the fall (though it is already taking me longer than expected because I really hate studying). 

I do believe that I can easily finish my masters while working full-time, though I'll probably add a semester. Is it weird to do both at the same time? Any reason why I should not take this opportunity?

Also: While the offer is good, should I negotiate? They told me that I entered 110k in the ""expected salary"" field (which I don't even remember anymore), but they can ""only offer me 100"".

* I quite liked Amsterdam when I once visited the place in 2020 right before the pandemic. 
* **Pro** for the Booking offer is also the ""30% ruling"" which makes the net pay considerably higher compared to the standard tax rates (\~63k EUR net).
* The **Cons** I've heard are it can sometimes be management heavy and some tech can be really old and gnarly to deal with (their perl monolith seems infamous).

About Amazon, I am thinking whether to keep Leetcoding DP (since other topics were well covered for [Booking.com](https://Booking.com)) or simply move on with the Booking offer.

* The **Pro** for Amazon could be the FAANG tag and maybe future scope of mobility within Amazon across locations
* Cons I've heard Amazon paying low salaries for the UK roles.
* I've heard mixed reviews on **Amazon** WLB.
* General perception of EU/Shengen mobility/travel vs stuck in UK mainland.

For context I'm currently a Software Engineer in a Data Science team at a large startup in India, with 1.5 YoE, and earning pretty decent in my current position compared to the market here.

I definitely want to make the Europe move for the quality of life, but would want to hear perspectives from the community here on these places to make a more informed choice.

16bf4k2,"Got an offer 120k, current salary is 95k. How do I approach the situation?","Hi all,
like the title says, I have a decision to make.
Currently I work as an ERP software engineer / Inhouse Consultant for an US company supporting two sites with their ERP system (one located in Germany, one in US).
The Job is 90% remote and the salary is 95k fix + 7k variable. I have 10 years of experience with the ERP-system, having worked as Developer, Inhouse Consultant and Technical Project Manager for different companies. I also did some part-time freelancing during the last four years, getting payed 120€/hours.

The current Job is great and I enjoy it, they also allow me the part-time freelancing which allows me to earn an additional 22k per year with the German ""Kleinunternehmerregelung"".

I started the job just 6 months ago and I was very happy with the offer.

Now last week during PTO I was freelancing on site for a company, that I know for more than 7 years.
They made an offer paying 120k anual salary with 100% remote. It's a German company with 700 employes.
It's a great offer and I know the company and the people very well. I'm prone to take the offer.


But my inner circle says it's too early for another change of employer. This ist the fourth company I worked for during the last 10 years and I've just been with my current employer for 6 months.
They also tell me to not only look for money cause I allready earn so much.
Usually I wouldn't mind asking for more money at my current employer but asking for such a raise after just 6 months feels a little off.

Now I'm ambivalent.
How would you approach this?",2023-09-06 08:59:46

With news of Coinbase and others doing hiring freeze, some people talking about layoffs, budget cuts or halt in expansion of companies I think it is fair to say the market is not as good as it has been. A recruiter contacted me saying a new fintech hub will open here but I am a bit reluctant in pursuing new proposals, much less in fintech because I am not sure this is a good time to change company and go through a new probation period (specially after reading some companies rescinded with candidates before they started, that sucks). I am also a bit skeptical when I read that fintech giants are freezing expansion and this company is moving forward with expansion plans? Isn't this weird?

py0trn,Google SWE interview - how long for prep?,"Hello everyone

Looking for some advice. I have been contacted by two separate recruiters at Google London (it seems they’re on some hiring drive) - one for an SRE SWE position and another for an SWE position. I am currently working as a backend dev and have just over 3 years’ experience.

I’ve decided to give the interview process a go. I had a screening interview with one of the Google recruiters last week and he sent me some material that would be useful yo revise/look over before the interview and get back to him about when I’d like to start the interviewing process. It seems like interview prep will be quite intensive and from what I’ve seen on this sub, people take a good amount of time to prep. 

Do you think asking for two months is reasonable? I’d need to brush up on data structures & algorithms. I have a few hours after work on weekdays and all my weekends to dedicate to this. For those who have gone through or are going through this process, how much time did you ask for to prep for the interview. TIA!",2021-09-29 17:54:15

I usually read on reddit from europeans(one time even from a dutch redditor that I cant find at the moment) that the work environment in their country is so relaxed that people do the bare minimum. Most people just work 20 hours a week(in a 40 hour workweek) because they cant be fired. They spend the rest of the time on reddit.

All of the clients I have worked with in the past were high-medium pressure. We always worked with scrum and we pull more work in the sprint if we finish our sprints work. Our screens are visible to everyone walking around and if someone wants to check something personal they do it in a very small window size(which ironically brings more attention to them). The scrum master appears to me like a spy for management. 

I am always full with work. I work a 40 hour week and sometimes I am so full that I dont have time for a coffee break during the day(otherwise I wont make the sprint). I can never use reddit at work and recently I was talking to someone on reddit who was at work in germany.",2020-07-04 09:30:43

14r6j53,Why do you look for a better-paying job?,"In general, software engineers in Europe tend to get paid more than other office jobs. Also, workers in Europe often enjoy better work-life balance than the rest of the world. (I'm saying this as a foreign worker from East Asia. My home country is known for its poor work-life balance)

When I see a thread where people discuss how to get a job at FAANG or a 6 figure-income job, I wonder what drives them to pursue a better-paying job. Most of the folks here (i.e. SWE in Europe) already have an above-average salary job with a good work-life balance. There won't be a perfect workplace where you'll get paid like Cristiano Ronaldo, all of your colleagues are amazing, and you're excited to go to the office every day. What's the goal of pursuing a higher-paying job?

(Don't get me wrong - I'm NOT saying that being obsessed with a higher salary is bad. I'm just curious about what motives people to look for a better-paying job)

EDIT:
Let me repeat this - **I'm NOT saying that being obsessed with a higher salary is bad**.

y9p8qr,Going from Mid-Level to Senior?,"Hello everyone,

I need some help and opinions.

Currently I'm a mid-level SDE for a good company, however I've gotten a very good senior job offer from another company with a salary way higher.

The question is that, while I'd definitely, no doubt about it, love to get the opportunity, I'm afraid it's above my level. I fear disappointing the hypothetical future team. 

I can code decently, have a good grasp on different technologies, and have gotten frequent praises for, apparently, being an excellent, patient teacher (something I do love to do and wish I could do more of, absolutely).

One of the problems is that most seniors I've worked with, so far, more than being good coders, have a solid capacity to think about problems and solutions, frequently even ahead of time. Being a senior is a great responsability and I don't want to do a poor job.

More than being some further study needed to do, or something I can do on my own, I'd say I just lack even more actual work experience and independence.

With this in mind, what should I do? What's your recommendation?

Thank you very much.",2022-10-21 09:40:24

Also they gave me an exploding offer which unfortunately killed my enthusiasm. I don't think this is how you start long-lasting relationships, by pressuring the candidate to accept an offer. Yet they raised their 48hrs explode window to 96hrs. Thanks corporation!

London offer: £50k base + £6k relocation + £TBD equity, no sign-on and health insurance. Series B start-up, funded $45M. Headcount is approx. 250 and in the growth phase. 100% Remote friendly (UK based), London office expected soon. They are switching from monolith and Ruby to Kotlin and micro-service architecture. I think I would be able to learn a lot since I'll be involved in developing micro-services at scale from scratch. Only downside I can think of is HR department has been very unresponsive to my e-mails. They are nice in the virtual interviews but I never managed to get a return to my e-mails from them.

Meanwhile, I interview with different companies in Dortmund and Berlin. I can't rely on them right now since nothing serious yet.

Would love to hear what you think about those offers and what would you do. Thanks.",2021-10-14 06:08:54
q1d2ap,London FAANG offer assessment,"Hi friends,

I reside in Eastern Europe, hello! I wrote earlier about how I am being considered by a FAANG in London for the position of PM. I have around 4YoE and I just got an offer at 120k GBP, total comp that is. I am happy and excited about the offer, but do I still ask for a bit more of a base increase or maybe even more RSU?

n8egz6,Amazon offer,"Hello, I have graduated a year ago. I had 2 internships and I have been working full time after finishing my studies for quite a big bank in Europe. 

Everything here is ok. Not much work to do. Team is relatively new and I got  to ramp-up super quick and I became quite good in the team. I even got my own area of expertise on the big monolith that we are working on. Everyone is friendly and they expect me to stay here and grow for a while. I have quite a big salary here and even my manager told me that in 1:1 meetings, that I am not paid like a junior. 

Bad thing about this company is that we are using some old technologies and we do not really have a perspective over improving the current codebase by adding some newer technologies and making use of their benefits.

All in all, out of the blue I got contacted by an Amazon recruiter. Aced the interviews and accepted the offer. I passed the background screening process too. First question is: how should I quit my current job? I never did this, and I kinda feel bad  about quitting, they really invested in me.

Second question: any tips on how to start properly at Amazon?

Sorry if I made any mistakes, thanks.

Edit: I just quit today. Manager was pressuring me into giving a counter offer,  but I simply refused to receive it. Technical lead was really happy for me and he probably convinced my manager to not give me a counter offer.

mzj3ms,Impostor syndrome after leaving my first job - what to expect from the junior job market in Berlin?,"My partner and I will be moving from Stockholm to Berlin this summer to allow her to pursue a more attractive career option. I've decided not to continue with my current employer due to poor base compensation and an uninteresting workload. 

I have spent the past 2.5 years as an SAP Basis consultant, writing basically no code whatsoever despite applying to the company as a Java developer. This, sadly, has lead to my programming skills deteriorating to that of a very junior dev.

I now feel incredibly inexperienced and like I don't fit the bill for any of the job listings in Berlin, as most seem to want someone experienced with several languages. I would like to get into developing professionally, or at least work in an IT-adjacent role, but I'm not sure if I fit into any organization.

**TL;DR:** What can I expect from Berlin, coming from an IT consulting background with no development? Are there any roles that favor me?",2021-04-27 07:38:52
mkq7mz,[UK] Should I ask for a pay rise after 2 years of working as a software engineer?,"To give context:

* Job Title: Software engineer
* Qualification: BSc Computer Science
* Professional Experience: ~5 years
* Employer: A very large essential service business (Deliberately vague for privacy)
* Location: North of England (Currently working from home)
* Salary: ~£40,000

As the title says, I have been working at my current company for almost exactly 2 years now and I am considering asking for a payrise. My motivation simply being twofold:

* Firstly, like most people, I would like to have money
* Secondly, cost of living in my city has risen sharply over the past year - most notably house prices. I am looking to buy a house and because my salary hasn't risen I am actually in a worse position to buy a house now than I was when I started the job.

I am hoping people here could give me advise on whether I should go ahead with approaching my manager to suggest a pay rise/review and aso how I can go about phrasing it.

Each year, my company does a pay review of all professional employees and assesses any payrises and bonuses. Last year, on my one-year anniversary, there was a modest bonus and cost-of-living salary increase; my payrise specifically was <1%. I questioned whether I got a below-inflation pay rise because of under performance and was assured that my performance was fine and it was unrelated. This year it has been announced that no employee will be given a payrise (however there has been suggestion that it can be petitioned for individual employees to be reviewed).

If I worked for a company that had been laying off or furloughing staff, I would not attempt this as it would be obvious that the company was struggling financially. But I know that even though the yearly targets of the company were not hit because of COVID, they still make very attractive profits and have continued to aggressively hire staff because of huge increases in demand.

Of course, I would not simply frame my request as ""I've worked here for 2 years, gimme money"". I think there are multiple arguments that show that I am worth extra money, such as:

*  Agreeing to be an on-call engineer for call-outs 24/7. I work 1 week on, 1 week off currently.
  * I have also voluntarily stayed up out of hours on system rollout days to monitor progress and to be able to react if something goes wrong.
  * I get paid modest standby payments for this, but in my opinion this simply covers my additional time spent monitoring and the general inconvenience. It is in no way a premium in compensation for me taking on greater responsibility in my role.
* I lead development and support tasks for a couple of lesser-known systems that I developed on a now disbanded team. And frequently onboard colleagues with those systems if they ever ask about or need to develop them in any way.
* When I was hired, they considered paying £40,000 for a person with `x` skills good value. 2 years on I have `x+y` skills through time invested at work and out of work so logically I am now worth more.
* I have submitted and achieved the recorded goals set between me and my line manager consistently since starting. Surely the point of goals is to develop an employee professionally. If these goals are being hit, then logically they are a more valuable employee and merit greater pay. If not, I see no value in these goals beyond being a box-checking exercise.

Given what I have said, does anybody have any advice on whether I should pursue this? I fear that unless I regularly push to make employers see my value, my compensation will stagnate. But, I do not want to make a fruitless effort and tarnish the relationship with my employer/manager in the process.

If you do think I should pursue it, what would be a reasonable figure?",2021-04-05 17:36:48
i6oisg,"My boss says it's not ok to have frequent doctor appointments, and that I'm lucky he lets me. Is that true?","I've been going to, like, around 2-3 doctor appointments a month lately due to a health problem, and when that happens I give notice as early as I can, and then either go to work late, leave early, or leave during the day then come back / resume work from home if they're ok with that. The doc visits usually take around a couple hours between the commute and the appointment itself.

It's not been like this all along, I worked here for 2 years without this health problem, and thus didn't have to go to the doc as much.

So, my boss said that I'm lucky he has a good attitude about it, because I should get fired for this, or be forced to compensate for the time I go to the doctor.

My question isn't about my boss per se, I already know and respect his opinion, but, let's say I move on to another job and still have this problem.

hfsq0w,"I'm lost I don't know what to do anymore, got rejected 3 times for starter Game Developer positions in the Netherlands (I'm dutch), should I just change my path and become a web developer instead?","**Info about me:**

I'm 24 year old and I live near Rotterdam, 
I only have a degree in Mechanical Engineering since 3 years ago, I continued with my Master in Mech E but then I decided to quit last year because I liked programming more. My graduate internship (3 years ago) was focused on programming in Unity, here I had to develop a VR game from scratch that will be used by a multinational big engineering company and I had to write a big assignment/research about it, that's how I got interested in programming during my Mech career. 
So I started getting into Game Development on my own, I self studied everything on my own, made my own small projects, finished 3 small mobile games in Unity (C#) (and failed some other projects ofcourse), constantly pushed myself to learn more about computer science in general so I dove deep into data structures/algorithms, OOP principles, time complexity, leetcode, cracking the coding interview, many different books about CS, nand2tetris project and the list goes on and on, basically everything an average CS student knows. Because I didn't want to specifically constrain myself in gamedev, I wanted to learn pretty much everything the average CS student knows, and I'm very happy with how far I am with my knowledge.

I didn't only focus on gamedev, I learned Javascript (easy to switch from C#) and developed some big custom discord bots on the side, a chrome extension for a browser game (my most successful small project, used by 50% of the playerbase), some small python scripts to automate some Blender workflows, started learning HTML/CSS/JS from Wes Bos's web dev courses. Currently working on a group project with some people I met on the internet (Open source web dev project using React, Strapi, Postgres).


**I started applying a month ago:** 

I feel I'm ready and that I now have to start learning by working in real world group projects so I start applying to game dev jobs because that is my main knowledge right now.

- Rejection 1: I applied to a junior position at a small company that develops small ''serious games'' for different industries, I looked over their portfolio and requirements and I meet all the requirements. I applied and their answer was that they'd prefer someone with a game development degree instead.

- Rejection 2: I saw a junior unity developer position that needed someone who has experience in VR development, I saw myself as a perfect fit to all their requirements mainly because I spent 20 weeks on a big VR project during my graduate internship and succeeded. I still got rejected because they found a better candidate (I really thought they'd accept me on this one because I was super confident about myself...)

- Rejection 3: I applied to a junior unity developer position for a small-mid company that develops various mobile games/apps for some big names in the Netherlands. I looked over their portfolio and in my mind I knew I would easily be able to make those games of that scale. I finally got a response and was sent a programming test. This was a fun test that tests your programming and design skills in Unity, I had to write every step of mine in a logbook and write a documentation on how the program works. I was super happy with the results and I mail them my project back. 
They tell me I have passed the test and that I'm invited to an interview, yay! I scored a 7,1 / 10 which to them was high compared to the average of 5,5 of all the applicants. The interview took 2-3 hours, they really liked me and told me they will invite me for a 2nd interview for contract negotiation and that they will mail me the date. 1,5 weeks pass and I ask them if they already have an update or now, they tell me they are very busy and will come back to me asap, another 1,5 weeks later (today) they tell me that they have chosen another person for the job.


Now here I am writing this. Game dev jobs in the Netherlands are scarce, the ones that are available are asking for 3+ years of C++ experience (which I am planning on learning after I get my first junior job). But I see there are more front-end, back-end, fullstack dev jobs. I'm thinking I should just forget about game dev and continue with web dev. But I don't have a portfolio of projects because I have never made a website with a domain from 0-100%. I do have knowledge and experience in HTML/CSS/JS, Jquery, node.js etc, currently working on a web dev project with React and a postgres database and Strapi for the backend. I've spent a good amount of time on learning all those technologies and the principles of web dev, I've just never got to making an actual hobby website to fill my portfolio.

What should I do? Should I just go all-in on learning web dev, doing freecodecamp, the odin project, finishing Wes Bos's courses and filling my portfolio? I feel bad ditching a couple years worth of game dev experience and starting over in a different field, jobless.
If I go the web dev route, how will I know if I'm ready to apply to web dev jobs?

I feel so lost I just don't know what to do anymore. If you want to see what my resumé looks like PM me and I will send it to you.

Thank you guys


**Edit:** I can't respond to all you guys so I just make an edit post here: Thank you all for the kind words, I didn't know this field was this hard to get into. So seeing that there are no game dev jobs anymore to apply via Indeed (seriously, it's all empty now) I will just focus on web dev from now on and start filling my portfolio. If anyone wants to follow my journey, I'd love to make some CS friends, pm me your discord tag or twitter name :)

160rdkp,Follow-up on Berlin Salary Trends tech bias: You can explore the data yourself!,"Hey there,

About a month ago I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/14z9xtm/berlin_report_on_berlin_salary_trends_survey/) the survey results and failed to properly present a way to use the dashboard to reduce the biases or to explore data yourself, so here is [a short follow-up writeup](https://handpickedberlin.com/berlin-salary-trends-dashboard-explained/?utm_source=redditcs&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=dashboard):

One of the primary motivations for doing the survey was to have independent data points besides those from Kununu, Glassdoor & Co. We now have that, and I will continue this project in the future. You can look up/filter most of the data points with the dashboard (explained in the article).

For example:

If we **exclude Technology and Software** as an industry, we get (569):

* Average (40h): **€69,216**
* Median: **€65,000**

If we **exclude Non-EU**, we get (507) :

* Average (40h): **€71,094**
* Median: **€63,000**

or we can look at ""keywords"":

If we try **“project”**? We get:

* Average (40h): €64,793
* Median: €57,000

It pays more to be in **“product”**:

* Average (40h): €79,624
* Median: €76,500

What about **“account”**?

* Average (40h): €46,111
* Median: €45,000

Obviosuly you can also try some more software related keywords.

[Check it out](https://handpickedberlin.com/berlin-salary-trends-dashboard-explained/?utm_source=redditcs&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=dashboard) and provide feedback on improving the next one. I hope it helps and that it also shows how much you could/should be getting paid for your work--Berlin is not ""Arm, aber sexy"" anymore!

wnmdmt,First job as software dev and I feel hopeless,"This is throwaway for obvious reasons.   


I just started a new job straight out of university. It's a great salary and a medium sized company (not a top 5 company but well known around the world). I got okay grades throughout university and I wasn't bottom of my class, I'd say I was distinctly average throughout my degree.  


I have been there for 2 weeks now and they are just putting me through training courses at the moment, some stuff I've seen before, other stuff I have not seen before. On Monday my team lead showed me some of the code that they are working on at the moment. This is the first time I have ever seen a project that is hundreds of files long, thousands of lines and theres stuff in there I've never seen before. Full production code is completely different to my small university projects. I know 0 about how pipelines work or even what they are really. I feel so far out of my depth and I reckon I don't have much time left in this job once they realise I'm not worth training.

I've spoken to a few friends as well and I'd say about 80% of them are not having this issue at their new jobs which is also making me think I might be too dumb for this job.

Has anyone else had this experience going into their first job out of university?  


Extra info:  
 €55k a year base, informal talks of bonuses but nothing in writing. (this is really good for my area)

I kind of passed the technical tests, I got one of them right and then the other I got like 70% wrong and most of the questions they asked me I got wrong.

I'm the only fresh grad in my team and the rest of my team (7 people)  have all been at the company for over 5 years minimum.

I've read back the post and it reads like I'm just going to give up. I absolutely am not giving up, My day is spent up training and learning and that is what I will do until they ask me to leave. I was just trying to gauge if other people are experiencing this shock to the system like I am. To be honest the point of this post may have just been to get this sinking feeling out that has been held over me for the past 2 weeks!",2022-08-13 19:20:08

nq0ov3,London Salaries in Banking (non front-office),"These numbers should be fairly reliable.  I think what is key when thinking about what company to join is not the starting salary, but the future salary progression.  I want to try and lay it out for you here so you have an idea of where you might 15-20 years down the line.

|Level|Base|Bonus|Stock|TC|YoE|Probability|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Associate|50-80|10-15%|0|55-90|2|100%|
|Vice President|85-120|10-20%|0|95-140|5-10|95%|
|Director|120-180|15-25%|10%|160-240|15-25|30%|
|Managing Director|?|?|?|300-500|20-30|5%|

Points to note:

* There can be a fair amount of variance here, esp. with FO roles but I would say this captures the most common range of values.
* You cannot simply be a good developer and get to director.  If you stick around long enough and work hard there is a high chance you'll get there, but there might be a lot of BS in the way.
* MD is hard.  They are limited in number and this is where you start making the big bucks, managing bonus pools etc.  Potentially a lot of politics and really not in your hands.  Numbers vary wildly but you're probably not getting to this point in all likelihood, so better to imagine director is your limit.
* The quality of engineers is pretty average, and in many cases you have people making half as much money outside banking with twice as much skill.
* WLB is great, you can pretty much just cruise at VP level at just do your literal 9-5.  If you want to make money go to a hedge fund or prop trading firm.  If you want a good WLB and decent money go to a FAANG, but the technical bar is much lower at IB.

Edit: The numbers might be a bit higher for GS (e.g. VP up to 200k total comp, etc.) but I wanted to give an indicative range of what can be reasonably expected at most tier 1 banks.  Most of these banks will have HR salary ranges broadly in line with what I posted above.",2021-06-01 18:19:32

ju73mv,48k Euro Offer in Amsterdam as UI Designer + %30 Ruling," Hi all!

After rounds of interviews with the company in Amsterdam, I'm happy to say I got the offer! Offer is 48k gross yearly + %8 holiday pay + monthly travel and lunch + %5-10 performance bonus. Along with that, I will move to Amsterdam from a non-eu country so they will cover the first-month rent and the deposit + plane tickets. As I've calculated from [thetax.nl](https://thetax.nl/) and other tools it looks like my net amount will be 3,250 euros monthly with %30 ruling. I know that in the first 2-3 months I'm not going to be able to benefit from it. So I think it's a good deal based on my experience and field (2.5 years - IT as UI Designer)

In the email they've sent to me they said they will handle all the visa process and %30 ruling.

So I think it seems like a good deal? It was the number that I wanted and looks like I got it. I'm in the beginning of my 20s and I will alone.

I did my calculations like: with 3250 net monthly salary

\-1250 rent for the furnished house (because of covid it seems like there good deals out there for housing, so maybe I can find it even within the ring area, I've checked pararius and funda many times, it seems possible)

\-250 for bills  
\-300 for groceries  
\-300 for outside going, dinner etc  
\-100 for health insurance

After we deduct all these expenses it looks like it leaves me **€900-1100 monthly.**

And I know there is a waste collection tax that costs €330 yearly. Are there any other expenses/taxes I need to know, could be taxes or utilities? Thanks in advance!

And before anyone starts talking about rents, yes 1200-1300 range for furnished apartments in Amsterdam is possible right now. Maybe due to covid rent price are lower currently. Few furnished apartment links below with 1100-1300 monthly rents in Amsterdam:

I know that SWEs in Europe don't get paid as much as in the US, but that's ok. I'm mostly just interested in whether we could maintain a similar quality of life. From what I've seen looking up house in Europe, it's WAY more expensive and you get less for your money, but I'm also not too familiar with the market, so I'm sure there's areas that are better than others...

Right now, I make ~$100k (€87.5K / £79.5K), but Arizona is cheap. We live in a ~4000 sq ft (371.6 sq m) home with a pool on a ~10,000 sq ft (929 sq m) lot. A lot of what I've seen in areas around London or Berlin are half the size, on tiny lots and cost 4 times as much. Even if I moved to a EU tech hub and got an L5 position at FAANG, I don't know that I'd be able to maintain anywhere close to a similar standard of living, but maybe I'm missing something (universal healthcare or other benefits which would make my take-home paycheck more?? But aren't taxes higher?)?

16yq3xk,Working at American company in Europe but think I got low-balled on offer to move to US office,"Hello. I work for an American company here in Sweden and I have been with them for around 4 years now. I have around 8 years work experience total and I am 30 years old.

Our Swedish office is closing and all employees (15 of us) are either being offered to work remotely as hourly consultants starting in February 2024 or to relocate to the main US office where the bulk of our team is located. The US office is in San Francisco.

Currently my salary is 53.000 SEK/month before taxes. This is about 57k USD/year before taxes. It's just that in Sweden we write salaries in months instead of years. If I were to work as a consultant I would be billing 1100 SEK/hour which is a standard consulting rate for my position and years of experience.

The offer they gave me to relocate to San Francisco is 122k USD/year, plus a 10k USD cash relocation payment and they would cover the shipment of my household items and car. They would also provide housing for 3 months until I can find a place to live.

I am not so well versed on US salaries but isn't that a very lowball offer from them if I choose to move to San Francisco? I looked online at US salaries for my position on levels.fyi and it seems like it should be at least double, if not 2-3x the compensation. I saw that the cost of living is extremely high in San Francisco and a similar apartment to the one I have now (2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom) would be 4-5x the price in San Francisco, plus I would need to account with the much higher cost of food and other living costs.

My role is senior systems engineer for enterprise products. I basically work as 20% developer, 20% customer support, and 60% working directly with customers to install and maintain our products on customer sites. Most of my work experience has been as a distributed systems developer in my previous roles.

I asked the only close colleague (and friend) I have in the San Francisco office and he said his base salary is 180k USD, plus he gets about 160k USD in stocks and last year he got a 25k USD bonus. We do not get any stocks or bonus here in the Swedish office, but we do get 30 days of paid vacation which is nice. The US office only gets 10 days of vacation.",2023-10-03 12:04:52

wmt9pl,SWE at CERN,"I got an offer for a 2 year contract (fellowship) at CERN. It's kind of a green field project and the tech stack/technologies used seem quite modern.

I know CERN sounds amazing and very prestigious but I'm not sure if that's the case for software too. Some people say there's lots of in house stuff, very niche products, bad code written by other non-primarily-software engineers.

i've been working as a solution analyst at experian for about a year now. it is in a data analysis team and i basically build solutions for banks when they want to tag their customers w things etc. no actual data analysis involved in my opinion. we just write scripts into the the tool that only this company uses, no real coding either. a classmate/colleague who started at the same time w me and someone who adores this job says that i am very good at it and it probably is the best job for me.

but i don't find this type of job very fulfilling tbh, i would like to change my profession if possible. software eng has always seemed interesting but my friends keep telling me that because i haven't figured it out at school i'd have a hard time finding a job w it from this point forward and i'd have an even harder time surviving in that job. i could figure it out if i wanted to but i also want to use the erasmus opportunity as a stepping stone for my immigration to eu goal, which is the main goal in life right now for personal reasons but i guess that is irrelevant rn. i also worry that i won't actually like software eng if i do switch over there.

my entire school life i dipped my toe into many things, mobile/web dev, general data stuff, ml and ai, etc. but i never went too far on anything, and now i am running out of time. i don't know how to know what to focus on. it's all so confusing. all seem interesting but i worry they may not be fulfilling once i start the job or i might fail bc i am not built for it. or i will pick one but the pay will be low even when i do become a senior, and then i will hate myself because i chose wrong. how can i even decide? how many areas are, i don't even know how many professions are there to move onto from a degree like mine. please. some guidance.",2022-06-03 19:26:25
v3qtli,Scared of future career prospects,"Hello guys ! I am currently pursuing my masters' in computer science from a university in Europe (Switzerland) and about to graduate. I am in a huge trouble regarding future career prospects.

I have good problem solving skills via competitive programming (cp) and doing recreational mathematics. However, I wasn't able to build up on my base and improve my software engineering skills. I have a few years of experience, but its all garbage. I was a mainframe developer in my first job. In my first job, I thought I can safely ignore my daily tasks and focus on arbitrary internet points solving strange problems on platforms like Codeforces. I was obssessed with codeforces ratings and thought, its now or never. I started ignoring my work and used most of my office time to solve such problems, while being paid. However, I soon started to see an impact on my career. I was being shuffled across teams, and finally put into support role. I used to rush from my office to home, to compete in codeforces contests without distractions, and felt tired and exhausted. I decided to quit my first job and focus solely on competitive programming till I get exhausted. I did it for 6 months, but soon landed a new job with a hefty pay raise. I was already feeling tired of competitive programming, and decided to finally focus on job. The pay was too great hehe.

However, I was doing bad in my second job as well. This time, I had stopped cp. My work involved frontend development using Angular. I was doing bad again, and there were lots of performance issues. Soon, I was involved in e2e testing using Cucumber and protractor. It was absolutely terrible, and I was annoyed. I started to skip scrum meetings and even skipped a one-on-one with my manager. Needless to say, I was fired.

However, within 2 days of getting fired, I got an offer to study masters' in computer science in Europe, with scholarship. It was fun and looked a good opportunity to explore Europe (I am from India). So I joined.

I did well in one of the courses involving object oriented programming and problem solving. I found studying machine learning fun, and I had an unpaid internship involving comparing performances of object oriented models, which was ok-ish. However, I still sucked big time in actual software development. In my capstone project, I required a lot of intensive support from other students to do my tasks. We used django for backend and react for frontend. Right now, my masters' thesis involves engineering work on an esoteric programming language. It's again going so bad that my advisor has started doing the work for me, just so I can graduate. At this point, I have a PhD offer in array databases. I am now quite concerned about my future. The work will pretty much involve software engineering, and given my history sucking big time across companies, environments and technologies, I am scared. At this stage, I might even fail the masters' because of thesis work. I just hope I somehow complete my thesis and barely pass.

Its kinda strange, on one hand I get new offers, on the other hand, I do really bad at every place. I am bad in actual work. I don't have a good command over git. It looks like I am more suited for theoretical work with some dose of math. I am not sure if I join the PhD. However, I am unwilling to let it go, because its a good opportunity to earn a German visa (yes, its in Germany). Also, I suspect of having ADHD, so I can get a diagnosis and treatment from the German healthcare (can't afford Swiss ones, they have minimum amount which isn't covered and stuff). I had really bad grades in my bachelors' and failed in 6 subjects (yet somehow managed to pass). I have a fucked up routine, and my workout schedule is erratic.

I talked to one friend, he said I don't have experience and just need to intern somewhere. However, with so many opportunities, I doubt if that helps.

Anyway, I require your advice on what to do in this situation.",2022-06-03 03:59:51

unohjw,How will the potential for a recession affect your career decisions,"The Pragmatic Engineer released a newsletter recently entitled 'The Tech Downturn' which ends with the excerpt below. Anecdotally  I've read reports of people having their job offers rescinded, and I think everyone knows about the hiring freeze at Meta. I am wondering what your thoughts are about this, whether it concerns you, how this will progress, the likelihood of this spreading to other industries, and how it may be affecting your decision making in regards to applying for or deciding to stay with your current employer. My experience working for a consultancy is that there has been a reduction in the number of projects. coming across new projects is becoming harder; something that seems to have increased since the beginning of 2022. 

If there are mass layoffs there will be a greater number of people competing for a smaller pool of jobs, and this will probably result in downward pressure on salaries. It could potentially create a more precarious situation for those of us who are not citizens of the country in which we work should our employers decide to let us go.

I don't mean to spread FUD, I'd like to believe that this will only be short-term, and will not spread to the wider industry.

From Newcomer’s analysis, what looks increasingly certain is we will see a pullback in VC funding. The only question is whether this will just be like a “brief blip” as in 2008, or a longer one, like in 2000.

In either case, this is not good news for many people working in tech - and it’s *especially* bad news for people working at companies that will need more VC funding. If VC funding pulls back, this further cools the tech job market, as growing VC funding was one of the causes for the [Perfect storm causing an insane tech hiring market](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/perfect-storm-causing-a-hot-tech-hiring-market?s=w) in September 2021. 

For now: exercise caution when considering job offers from VC-funded companies. Do your due diligence, and ask about numbers: what’s the revenue? How many customers are there? How are these numbers growing? What is the runway?

More VC-funded companies are putting hiring freezes in place, and I have reports of some smaller companies pulling offers - even signed ones. It can be risky to join a company that is in dire need of VC funding, but cannot raise it. In the worst case, they could end up going bankrupt [like Fast rapidly did](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-fast?s=w). In the best case, they ride up this time by reducing their costs.

shtj30,We need to talk about unpaid interview projects,"Ok I'm tilted. I've just had an interview project in which I spent about 4/5 days in it. I was supposed to deliver it and then get a correction/discussion with the company's CTO. I got a bit carried on and ended up doing something really nice, which hopefully will now also serve to showcase my skills in my portfolio. But the task itself, it was flawless. I got compliments from other dev mates all over the place, they couldn't believe I had done all of it just for an interview. 

Of course when you're interviewing you need to be ready for a no, and I was (the company itself didn't even attract me that much), but after delivering my hard-worked project, this is the answer I get shortly after:

"" 
Thanks for your email.

After discussion, we are going to continue the process with another candidate that have more years of experience and I unfortunately don't think we will be able to correctly onboard two profiles on this job request.

I remain at your disposal if you need help with anything.
""

No mention of the project at all, no thank you for your time, thank you for the effort, I appreciate the work you've done, so sorry you had to spend your time in it. Nothing. Just a basic ""we are going to continue with another candidate"" without even mentioning the project, as if it hasn't existed at all.

We spend A LOT of time doing these projects. We are unpaid for it (and we should be talking about it. We probably shouldn't be expected to spend so much time on interview projects without being compensated for it). Since we are not even being compensated, the MINIMUM I expect is some consideration. Is knowing someone will actually go over it, read the code, discuss what you've done, provide with some valuable feedback, be grateful for the time and effort applicants put on it. But not even.

I'm done with this, this is the last unpaid interview project I will ever do.",2022-02-01 12:11:28
sg7o3o,"Where should I move to, Sweden or Spain?","I'm 30M, Indian, a front end developer with 7+ years of experience and currently, I have 2 job offers - one of 45000 EUR annually for Malaga and another of 55000 SEK monthly (62000 EUR annually) for Stockholm.

I've wanted to move out for a few years now, and really wanted to move to a European country so this feels like a great opportunity. However, I'd like to make an informed decision and, therefore, seek advice from the community.

I've never lived in another country for a long time, just traveled to 3 countries (max stay - 2 weeks in Thailand). I have extremely basic knowledge of Spanish, and zero knowledge of Swedish.

Following are some of the factors that I'm considering-

1. Climate - I read that Sweden gets too cold and Spain too hot. I prefer winters to summers as long as they aren't extreme.
2. Career progression - Would like to have a lot of choices to switch jobs in the future so a location with a large number of tech companies is preferred.
3. I'd like to gain citizenship in a European country in the near future. (From what I read, it takes 5 years in Sweden and 8 in Spain by naturalization).
4. Food - I've been a lacto-ovo-vegetarian most of my life, and only recently started eating meat (mostly fried) so prefer a location with a good amount of vegetarian options.
5. People - I'm an introvert and it's a bit hard for me to talk to new people so I'd like to stay somewhere it's comparatively easier to make friends. (I'm into video games and traveling.)
6. Ease of doing stuff - like getting a driver's license (still haven't learned driving a car properly lol), etc. So bureaucracy, but also about private services like food delivery.
7. Safety - Lower crime rates, racism, etc.
8. Ability to bring parents later.
9. Anything else that I haven't considered but might be useful to know.

Do you have experience living in these places? What do you think? Feel free to ask more questions.

1. Citizenship
2. Food

mpj0fm,Applying for programming jobs after a long break,"Hello. I'm writing this post because I feel stuck and in need of some outside input.

I've studied Computer Science between 2013 and 2018 and I've effectively finished university in December 2018. When I graduated I didn't immediately start looking for a job in my field for a number of reasons: family and personal issues, lack of direction and just wanting some time away from studying, to name a few.

What was meant to be a bit of a break turned into more than 2 years of being stuck in my every day cycle and not taking my degree and doing something useful with it. I've held onto my job in retail which is enough to keep me going, but at the back of my mind I have this feeling of unease, like I have to do something more than just work away at my current job. The only way of doing this that I can see is to take the degree I got and use it to try and get a job as a software dev of some kind.

This is where my question comes in. I've turned 26 earlier this year and after such a long break, is it even possible for me to consider applying for a job in this industry? I got the degree, but I haven't got any professional experience working for a company and I haven't done a placement during my time in university either. Only things I'd have going for me are my education and any personal projects I'd be working on. Lack of professional experience aside, I have this feeling that if I apply for a job recruiters will look at the time gap between now and when I finished university and think “why would we give this guy a chance when there are hundreds of fresh grads ready to do the same job?”. I can’t shake this sensation that I blew my chance and it’s been keeping me from actually giving this a fair shot. For reference, I live in Scotland. Thanks.",2021-04-12 17:39:50
kt8hcy,How to get better at working at speed?,"I have a problem. I'm too slow to be considered productive. It's not that I don't understand what needs to be done. It's just that I'm tiptoeing around the decisions I need to make to finish my work on time. I've been let go by (end of contract, no renewal) a couple of times now, and it's been impacting my confidence a lot every time this happens. I'm looking for my 5th job in almost as many years now.

Any tips on how to work faster without cutting corners too much?

I find it really hard to balance my anxiety on possibly lowering the quality of my work with speeding up my work.

\[edit\] some more details:

One type of comments I've been getting is that I should ask more questions and/or ask them sooner. However, when I do try to follow this advice, I get the comment that I should work them out more on my own before asking, or that I'm asking questions nobody has an answer to. This is very confusing to me.

Somehow my experience not exceeding the level of a junior in previous roles seems to be disregarded when hiring. Often I hear that they expected more output for someone my age (late 30's - entered the CS job market in my mid 30's due to problems I had in my 20's, delaying graduation by many years) I think that I'm always clear about me still operating at basically junior level and needing more experience. I do feel that at the companies I've been at, there hasn't been a lot of attention for training juniors. It seems that this is rare at SME's, but I've been unsuccessful at getting hired at larger companies or companies with a lot of possibilities for getting some guidance.

I'm a sociology PhD student at the University of Texas and I am working on some research about aging and working in the tech industry. I'm curious to hear from any people who work/have worked in software in Germany -- what do the career trajectories look like when you get into your 40s, 50s etc.? Do companies or workers councils/unions  help you to re-skill/up-skill?  Do companies provide much job security? Or do older developers get laid off or ""pushed out""?

In the US, developers are extremely young (whether that is because of people not keeping their skills up or because of ageism) and I am wondering whether Germany's different employment model (stronger job protections, more occupational training, works councils etc.) makes it any different.

I understand from several posts on here that many people believe that anything under 35k is selling yourself short in London, which I can appreciate to some extent.

Given covid and the impact it has had on the graduate market, I'm thinking that taking the job and gaining the valuable experience, and then continuing to apply to positions in maybe 6 months or so would be the best bet, but I'd love to hear second opinions.

- I'm a fresh grad off a Computer Science conversion MSc in the UK
- No commerical experience
- Have a BSc in Biology
- 2 decently sized projects

Appreciate any and all replies.

EDIT: 

Thank you all for your insights! Some more information that might be relevant is the fact that the job will be remote, at least to begin with, and I am in the position where I could live at home rent-free for a time. 
Seems like the best move would be to take the job, save up a buffer of money before maybe making the move to London in 6 or so months depending on how the performance review goes.

I'm also fortunate that I actually want to flatshare rather than having my own place as I want to meet people, so should the move become necessary then it shouldn't be too harsh on my finances.",2020-07-05 10:18:10

Above I tried to summerize my roadmap for the following three months. I tried to list the concepts that I have to study. The priority column describes the subject I have to study first. The relavance column reflects it's importance. The expertise is the level that I think I must achieve. The final column is what I think it's going to cost me in terms of time and energy regarding my goals and current abilities.

**Questions/Remarks:**

1. What do you think about the table above: are the priority, relevance and target expertise columns right ?
2. Do you think that kubernetese knowledge is important for a Data Engineer? (I added it mainly because I worked a bit with Kubeflow and going threw the documentation was like reading gibberish) 
3. Do you think that this roadmap is ambitious ?
4. My main goal, beyond reading data structure/Python books which is only a mean, is to be comfortable in whiteboard coding.  I'm I right to think so ? or in order to succed in the overall process knowing how to invert a Tree is not that important ?
5. Beeing an expert coder is not the only skill needed to land such a job, what are the other skills that you see important ? and how should I improve them ?
6. How to I get noticed by the recruiters out there ?
7. Should I try to connect with some people in Big N companies and ask them to pass my CV ?
8. If you went threw some of the books, which chapters did you skip ? and which ones you found really important for the preparation ?
9. How do I find hiring Big N companies that are hiring in Paris
10. When is the best period of the year to begin searching/applying for a new job in Paris ?
11. Anything that I have missed ?

During my studies I did my thesis at a big consulting company here in Italy for 5 months, but after I graduated I decided to take a 2 months break, since the company told me they were going to hire me in January. Now they said they have to finish big projects and are not hiring anyone until March/April.

I've sent around 60 applications around Europe in the last month for ML engineer/Data scientist roles, most of them required experience, but I'm being rejected from all of them.

Having just a couple of years of professional working experience, I can't help but get annoyed when random people keep repeating to me that 'because of AI, no one is looking for developers anymore, there won't be any jobs soon for developers'. I almost had a fight with a friend when she told me, after visiting an AI conference, that ""No one is looking for developers, just for AI people"". I pushed her to tell me what she thinks ""AI people"" means and gave her my opinion on that, and she just kept repeating the same thing all over again. And that's just one example.

I’m working at a small company where the SW department is just two people (me and the leader). I‘ve been working for almost 4 years and I believe I need to leave this company to improve my skills and learn more. 

I’m getting close to signing a contract with another company and I’m starting to have doubts. I basically feel guilty because I will leave them with a lot of code that is already running and completely programmed by me. And I have the feeling that the mantainance pf these programs will be very difficult since it’s always awful to read code made by someone else (I‘m currently working with documentation and I tried to write it as clear as possible, but everyone programs differently).

zyrraq,"How to write an ""outcomes"" focused resume/CV when you've been a cog in a machine","This is a question I'm forced to think about every time update my CV, yet I'm still not happy with the way I do it. 

Let's say, as many of us have, you've been working in an Agile team, maybe a few of them at different companies, where you were basically writing bug fixes and adding a few small features to a codebase. Chances are you need to be in the same company for years before you get more responsibility than that. And let's say the company is large enough, as it often is, that even your team's direct impact on a company's bottom line is  not calculable, much less your OWN impact on the wider company. 

Since ""outcome"" focused CVs are all the rage, do you have any strategies for handling this? Many example CVs will suggest things like - ""increased customer revenue by 50% by implementing bla bla"", or ""reduced operating costs by 70% by optimizing the bla bla system..."". 

Let's face it, mid-level developers often don't have that sort of impact in a big company or a big team – they will rarely have access to hard numbers about *their* direct and unique impact on the company. 

What are some strategies you've employed to translate your bug-fixing and feature-creation into measurable impacts on the business with fancy hard numbers and percentages?",2022-12-30 05:11:05
z1nx6c,Working in Western Europe vs Central/Eastern Europe,"I'm a software engineer working/living in Prague (Czech Republic), originally from a non-EU country.

I came to CR, because...

- I got a better-paying job than my previous job
- by working for this company, I can gain experience with Java & AWS, both of which are pretty in demand (IMO) and can help me to land higher-paying jobs
- Prague is a beautiful city
- the income tax rate in the Czech Republic is lower than that in countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK, where the average wage is much higher

It's been about half a year since I came here. Now I'm wondering if I should've moved to a Western country to pursue my career.

The reasons are...

- The Czech Republic has been impacted by inflation this year sooooo badly. According to [Yahoo news](https://news.yahoo.com/uk-inflation-compare-european-countries-162510952.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8), the Czech Rep is the 4th most affected country in Europe as of August 2022. The living cost in Prague was supposed to be cheaper than in major cities in Western Europe (Berlin, Amsterdam, etc). I don't feel that Prague is an affordable place to live in even by Western standards.
- The number of jobs here is smaller than in cities like Berlin, Munich, and Amsterdam.
- Most well-paying IT jobs in Prague are back-office in a large US company. By working for a big US company, you can earn a lot by local standards, but you won't get an important position in the company.
- There is a shortage of doctors/dentists. I have to wait for 1 to 2 months just to see a dentist. I know that tax rates in Western countries are higher, but I feel that the public healthcare systems can be better

Next year I'll search for a new job. Before then, I'll have to decide which countries to look for jobs.

In Central/Eastern Europe (Czech Rep, Poland, etc), I won't have to pay a lot of taxes, but the career options are fewer by comparison and the overall living standard may be lower.

In Western Europe (Germany, the Netherlands etc), there are more career options and the overall living standard may be better, but the government will take more tax from my income.

Is there any other factor than jobs, tax, and public healthcare that I should take into consideration? I'm keen to hear your thoughts

**UPDATE**

My current net salary (i.e. after-tax salary) is approximately 3,200 Euro (if I convert it to Euro), which IMO isn't bad by Western standards (but I'm eager to increase it)",2022-11-22 07:59:03

Unfortunately, there are some extremely contradictory opinions out there: I've seen so many posts along the lines of ""No offers after 6 months of applications - what am I doing wrong"" but an equal number of posts suggesting that the job market is super strong and that companies can't get staff fast enough!

n1rwaq,Bad Reference letter (Arbeitszeugnis) from a FAANG - Asking German colleagues,"Hi All,  


I would like **ask the advise of my German colleagues** on the forum regarding the reference letter from the employer (Arbeitszeugnis), I got fired from a FAANG during in the 6th month of my probation and this what they are giving me as the reference letter:  


\----

*We hereby certify that Mr. XX,  born on XX, started working in our company on XX as XX Manager. He was in charge of the following main tasks:*  
*(some 4-5 weak bullet points on what my tasks were.* ***No mention of my achievements****).*   
   
***Mr. XX left our company on XX****. We would like to thank him for his work and wish*  
*him all the best and continuing success, both for his professional and personal future.*   
\----

1) Does it make sense to get the letter in German?   
2) Does it make sense to have the typical elements of such a letter:  
***Motivation****,* ***Befähigung****,* ***Fachwissen****, Arbeitsweise, Arbeitsergebnis, evtl. herausragende Erfolge, evtl. Führungsstil, zusammenfassende Leistungsbeurteilung,* ***Sozialverhalten****, Ausstellungsgrund, Schlussformel*  


I am sure, I was motivated enough, and led to some well recognized results and conducted myself professionally towards my colleagues. Do you think they are making a much worse statement by omitting it? Should I fight for these elements to be included?

How can I soften the ""*Ausstellungsgrund""* so that it doesn't look that I was fired at least in the English version?

I know that I can always skip my time at this company all together but for now I just want to get the best letter of reference under these circumstances without the company screwing me any further.

&#x200B;

Thanks.  


PS: for all the international folks, in Germany there is a secret language for such reference letters in which the employer can really screw you over all the while saying only nice things.",2021-04-30 11:31:49
mlyip3,Glasgow vs London,"Hi All,

I'm a Full Stack Developer with 2 years experience.  In a bit of a  predicament right now whether or not to accept a job offer and was looking to get some opinions.

Current Situation:

* Location: Glasgow
* Total Comp: £47k
* Hours: 9-5 (35 hours a week)
* Corporate company, tech not the core of the business, lots of red tape and bureaucracy involved which I don't enjoy.

Job Offer:

* Location: London
* Total Comp: £70k
* Hours: 9-6 (40 hours a week). Also need to verify this as it was mentioned people worked 8/8.30-6
* Small company, tech is core of the business, no burreaucracy, working with latest technology and fast development.

Obviously significant difference in total comp but the costs of living in London is huge compared to Glasgow.

Main concern is the working hours. 9-5 right now seems perfect for me, I'd do 9-6 but any more than that I think is too much.

I much prefer the startup vibe where it is fast paced development and from the interviews I feel like I'd fit really well within the company.

Moving to London as well would make it easier to get another job there in the future.

Just wondering what everyone else would do in this situation? The job offered sounds a lot more enjoyable than what I'm doing now and also offers quick progession within the company but I'm just not sure about the longer hours and the impact that will have on work-life balance.",2021-04-07 09:44:23
m8l6xd,Is dropping out of college a terrible idea in this case?,"A little background: I'm a 25 years old student of Software Engineering currently in one of my country's top universities and i'm also taking software development freelance gigs at the same time for the last 2 years (i was already a proficient programmer before i enrolled in college).

This was supposed to be the year i finish my undergraduate degree but, due to covid19 (i hate remote classes) and my freelancing workload, i have plenty of courses yet to be finished. This makes it impossible to finish the degree this year and possibly even next year. But, apart from that, i'm learning A LOT from my freelance work and making really good money with it (for example, last month i pocketed 4k+€), i'm developing a really good set of regular clients and i'm also able to live totally independently and even save up a good amount of money.

Now, it's not an exaggeration to say that university is killing me. Not only it has a negative impact on my business (i'm not taking has many gigs as i'd like because, with college, i have no time for everything) but also, i feel like it has a negative impact on my learning path. What i mean by this last point is that i feel like i'd learn way more and faster if was on my own. I have tons of academic textbooks related to my topics of interest and i'm currently not studying them because they are not related to any course i'm currently enrolled in and so i have no time for them. So i feel like if i was not in college, i could spend my time working on my freelance projects and studying my textbooks and practicing my skills.

So, the thing is, i'm really close to quit college but i have my doubts. Like i said, i have a pretty successful freelancing business that is rolling on its tracks for that last 2 years and growing better and better over time. I'm also a very dedicated and methodical learner and , by the looks of it, i have what it takes to be a good businessman. So, what are your opinions on this?

P.S: I think it is relevant to add that i really do enjoy my business and working for somebody else just terrifies the shit out of me. Another thing i'd like to add is that, even though i'm enrolled in a software engineering undergraduate program, my main area of interest is cybersecurity but there's no undergraduate program for that, only a masters.",2021-03-19 16:35:15
juqg5s,How to handle an unemployment gap?,"Hello guys. I seek general career advice, because I'm hopelessly lost.

A little bit of backstory: finished my studies, wanted to work in data science, but since there were no jobs got a job as a software developer. It was an IT company that had no software developers whatsoever (the whole dev team of 5 quit before I came) so their onboarding was abysmal. I was eager to learn, but they were throwing me around from project to project, not sure how to handle or educate a junior developer, so after 7ish months I got an opportunity to switch to a different company in a product manager role. I accepted and quit. Turns out 2nd company was even worse. For a time I thought I was the problem but half of my team started quitting in a short time, and my contract was running out, so I decided to bail. To add salt to injury, I had an upcoming medical procedure, so I didn't want to be a jerk on medical leave just to quit after. I had my procedure, and after months of recovering, I told myself this time I'll find something good to stay. I was sick of changing companies. I was looking at job ads and started to learn about different data science topics, and I was honestly overwhelmed. Did a couple of interviews, even though I knew I wasn't qualified. Every day looking at job boards and reading IT books and doing courses sent me into chronic depression. I never thought it was possible to feel this way.

Fast forward 3.5 years, I would say I'm mentally a lot better, even excellent, but I'm still unemployed, so that's making me anxious. Beginning 2020 I did apply to a few places, even got interviews, but they got cancelled because of covid. The last few nights I couldn't sleep so I decided to write this post, hoping someone would give me direction. I'm mostly looking at data analyst/engineer junior roles, but it seems those are quite sparse. Using throwaway because I'm ashamed what my life has turned into.

18tne8e,What are your go-to sources when searching for remote work?,"Hello,

I am currently in search of a new job and having a hard time sorting out listings with remote options. 

For context: non-german EU citizen living in Berlin. Current tech stack: Django backend dev and whatever revolves around that. WFH preference: 4 days (if in Berlin) to fully remote.

It's been some time since i last went on a job hunt, so i only remember checking indeed and LinkedIn, but these look very limited in terms of finding jobs that allow remote work.

So my question is, what are your websites/places on the Internet when looking for remote jobs? I wouldn't mind considering options past the Euro zone as well, just curious what other people are using to find nice remote companies?

Thank you in advance!",2023-12-29 13:42:19
1821wb9,I've just been offered a job after a 15-minute one-stage interview,"Basically title,

I've just been offered a pretty well-paid job after having a 15-minute interview that was non technical. It only lasted that long because I kept asking questions, if it wasn't for that it would've probably lasted a solid five whole minutes. The job is contracted and salaried.

&#x200B;

What??? Whilst it doesn't seem like a scam at all, my gut is also saying it's not a scam. The approach that this company took would imply that it's a scam. I'm so confused.

15djxci,Why I don't generally ask for feedback after being rejected.,"I work in a niche area of finance and I am at middle/senior management level. Over the last few years, I wanted to move to a different country and I had a good number interviews.

Letting aside ghosting, ""dummy"" interviews and any other weird situation, I used to ask for feedback after getting to the final stage. However, the responses I got where along the lines of:

\-  you are overqualified

\- you interviewed well but we are looking for someone slightly more senior

\- we liked your interview but we opted for someone coming from a different industry

\- etc.

I always ask for feedback If I do not make it to the hiring manager or if I get tested technically.

**However I stopped asking for feedback when the interviews are general and I am asked only about examples.**

My point is that there is so much bias and so many factors I don't control, so what could work for a hiring manager does not work for another. As such, I prefer to go my own way and don't waste time overthinking about generic feedback which could even prove counterproductive in a different setting.

What is your view on this?

t7utga,"FAANG ""Remote""","I am focusing on pure remote positions for experienced devs / team lead. I have a very comfortable full remote position at the moment and it suits my lifestyle very much. I'm posting this to share my experiences on ""remote"" for FAANG within the EU and to also ask if anyone else has different experiences.

&#x200B;

I am aware of legal requirements meaning that companies need a payroll company within my country to handle payroll. That's not an issue for some of the FAANGs since I know they do hire people in my country (Belgium). I'm also not complaining about them prorating salaries based on COL of locations, I have accepted that this is the norm in business.

&#x200B;

* Facebook/Meta is quite straightforward, you have to be in one of the 6 countries to be remote in the EU. I had 30min chat with an in-house recruiter up to the point where I told him that I was not willing to relocate to any of the 6 countries nor London. That's where the conversation ended and he told me to contact him again if I do decide to relocate.
* Amazon was a bit different, I spoke to an acquaintance who works at VP level at Amazon and he said that it depends on the team and whether the director approves it. It's on case-by-case basis. What I hear about this is that you won't know until you apply, decide on a team and even then it's hit and miss.
* Google is similar to Amazon from what I understand. It's purely on a case-by-case basis and you have to ask for it. Most of you have read the news that Google is making their staff go back to the offices, not completely on site, but at the very least a ""hybrid"" version. I am hence not having much confidence that a full-remote position will be possible.

I haven't quite the experience with the other FAANGs. I don't quite like the Microsoft stack hence why I'm somewhat excluding them in my search.

At the moment the best hope I have in finding a full remote position are on the next 'tier' of tech companies. The shopify, spotify, datadog etc. It's a hard search since there are many there who are also on-site, such as Mollie, Booking etc.

I am a 27 y/o guy from South Korea with no secondary degree (high school diploma only) and I will graduate a bootcamp in Korea in July 2022.

emruf0,"Poor physics student, Poland – career, future pivoting","### About me:
Hello!  &nbsp;  
I'm a **21yo applied/technical physics student** in Poland and will get a title of BEng (that's roughly how it translates to American standards) degree next year at top #1 technical university in Poland.

I know you might think: wow, top #1 equals a decent job. However, here schools aren't elite like MIT or whatever. They're just a little better than others. I am from a small village, and a small village in Poland is a dark place. Having lived between nature, animals, poor people, and some of the dumbest people I've seen bullying the weak, I've managed to escape the latter one and get accepted to this place – big capital city, which is a decent tech hub. Feeling weird.

### My skills so far:

* Usual Python for DS&ML (spending a lot of free time on it to learn it well right now) 
* Basic but solid object oriented: C++, Java, Python
* Maths, Physics, Statistics
* I can be extremely hardworking when life forces me (which for example is now - better find a job or internship...)

### My portfolio
As for now, my GitHub isn't great but it'll be filled according to what I focus on. What I have currently, aside from hidden personal courses and so on, is:

* (in progress) A small report about a small competitive game community which analyzes six top players. Using pandas, visualization, cleaning very messy data. I'm sure the community will like it so I could even say on the resume that it had impacted the game. 
* (older) small, really minor contributions to a very popular game rewritten in C++
* (older) A C++ simulation of movement of two planets, small circling the bigger one, with okay graphics.
* (hidden) A jumping game in Java GDX, a simulator of particles in a container – these are too simple so I don't want to embarrass myself.

### My dream jobs in 30 years

(I know industry will change, but it's what intrigues me now) 

* A ML Engineer / Data Scientist
* Scala (I guess Big Data) Developer
* Any stable SE which is not front-end

### My Questions / Problems
(I'm considering Masters but definitely not PhD, also not planning to move to USA - no chance for me) 

I am aware that due to my choice of physics I'm at a disadvantage compared to CS guys. I know that the area in which I'm not at such a great disadvantage is DS/ML (fortunately I like it) which is why I am polishing my skills in it right now.

My problem is that I also am interested in Scala, I'd love to get a job in the (far) future using it. I have no experience in it, but I know in my heart I'll take it up in the future even as a hobby. However I am aware that data engineering, Spark and so on is way more Software Engineering than DS/ML, which puts me at disadvantage. In summary, I am torn between these two paths. It's a blessing maybe that they are a little connected.

1. Do you think it's a good path to catch whatever job is available in DS/ML and if I don't feel good in it, study hard and try getting into Scala/Big Data?
2. Is there any other decent path you would recommend?
3. Do you think, assuming I'd have a few years experience in some DS/ML jobs, that I would have to prove my Java skills to employers VERY hardly in order to jump into Scala? Will it change in the future? Because many offers are Java/Scala Developer. And I accept Java but don't love it with all my heart. And I'm not skilled in it.
4. Any other general tips, or what am I lacking to get that first job or internship?",2020-01-10 14:43:13
e8pwkn,Is it going too far ?,"So we all know how the interview process in our field most of the time doesn't represent show skills etc. But I want to share an experience I had recently, and would like to hear what you think.

I applied recently in a company which is not small at all, for a **research internship** in their R&D department. As a first step in the process, I was given an assignment that I had to complete in **~~4 days~~** **3 days** after I received the mail. The assignment consisted to write a web app that used their API, with some constraints such as using Flask, Docker, OAuth and bonus points if you used Vuejs, wrote some unit test, run with Kubernetes.

Now because I'm in my exam period, so I had really little time to develop a web app. Luckily, this summer I learned a bit of Flask but like wtf ?

I was wondering why most of the technical roles (i.e. software engineering) are paid less than some of the quite general roles such as business analyst or project manager? Even if I take the Netherlands, where there is a significant demand for tech profiles, the salaries are still relatively low. Why are the salaries not increasing due to demand relatively to other roles? I know that BigN is different, but still, the average salary seems to be quite low.

I am working already over 1 year in my company and I am having a talk about my salary this friday. To be a little bit more prepared and use realistic numbers for the upcoming talk, I wanted to ask what other peoples earned when they worked as a junior developer.

Current state:

I get currently 3500 € gross a month (42.000 € a year) and we are developing a car sharing (and a web UI) in ruby on rails. I am working in Nordrhein Westfalen in Germany. Small notice: I started with 3.333,33 € gross a month (40.000 € a year) at this company. After half a year (trial period) I got an increase to 3.500 € gross a month (42.000 € a year).

My resume:

I did a dual study (focus was programming and math) but finished only with the training/education and did not finish my bachelor (I am missing a few exams but I decided to just get to work since I do not want to continue this hellish time xD). After the 3 years of the dual study I worked for 4 months in a company but decided to leave there since the people there where not nice. After that I had a some trouble finding a new place to work and started at the place where I am now, which was a bit over a year ago.

Question:

What do you think can I expect for my discussion regarding my salary this friday? I was thinking about asking for a raise to 4.000 € gross a month (48.000 € a year). Is it to much or to less? Was I already to low at the beginning or am I even lucky with what I get now?

How much did you get in your first year and how much did you get after your first year? What was your resume (did you do a bachelor or just an eduction/training?) ?

I hope I am in the right channel and you want to share your experience with me. Thanks guys and have a happy new year :D

u0dmz0,Salaries in Europe & relocation advice,"Not sure if this is the right sub to ask such questions but I saw posts about salary ranges, relocation and more, so let it be. Sorry for a long post but I am at the crossroads and need advice.

I am a senior software engineer with 6.5 YoE from Ukraine, displaced due to the war, looking at my options. Technically, I kept my job in Ukraine (currently working remotely from an EU country) and I am not in a rush, but I see quite a few problems on the horizon (details below). I have a great salary by Ukrainian standards and, from a quick glance, it is probably considered decent in some European countries as well. However, what makes it so great are low taxes in Ukraine (6.5% + \~50USD a month) and low cost of living. I have a NET pay \~4.5k USD and my typical spending back home used to be \~1000-1200USD per month (that includes rent and larger infrequent purchases), allowing for a very comfortable life and nice savings.

I can apply for temporary protection in the EU and keep working for my current company but:

* negotiating a raise is most probably out of the question in the near future
* cost of living is higher in the EU and I also have dependent relatives that have increased my spending considerably already (they used to live in their own apartment back home, now we are forced to rent a larger place)
* at some point I will be forced to become a tax resident and we all know European tax rates

All in all, the situation is not great. I am not used to such uncertainty. Tax rate, higher cost of living and increased spending in the EU are no joke even for a decent income that I enjoy right now. I have enough savings but this is a delay, not a solution.

I am considering applying for a job in Europe now but struggling to properly estimate my salary expectations and what countries to prioritize. Maybe you could help me out with that.

Regarding my experience, I feel fairly confident with 6.5 years working mostly for US clients. I started as a Java dev, then delved into the Big Data stack. I have worked with Scala/Java, Python, Airflow, Spark, Snowflake, multiple SQL and NoSQL DBs, columnar storage. I did high-throughput APIs, Data Platform development, ETL/ELT pipelines processing terabytes of data per day. Got a lot of experience working with AWS and Azure clouds (many different services including serverless), IaC: Terraform/CloudFormation.

So, what are the good countries/cities in Europe for a software guy of my skills? What salary range should I go for? Looking for the best combination of NET income and cost of living, preferably far enough from Russia for obvious reasons. I would also consider non-European countries, but this is probably not the right sub for that.

**TLDR;** came to the EU from Ukraine with a decent salary, keep working remotely but spooked by EU tax rates when tax residency kicks the door as well as a higher cost of living. Not sure what countries/cities to prioritize when looking for a job and what is the market value for my skills in these places.",2022-04-10 08:49:04

Also, how does a relocation package usually work? Do they provide a temporary apartment and flights? Or do they just give you like 3000€ and you can use it to move countries yourself?

ke6ygp,How important a master is for career grownth?,"Greetings all.

I had the assumption that once you get inside the industry, your productivity, relationships (networking) and years of experience on the field were enough to make you progress salary wise and position wise.

Speaking with fellow colleagues though, I was told that a master is pretty much necessary to not stagnate your earnings and get leadership positions.

jk6sws,Anyone else got immediately rejected from Amazon despite acing the online assessment?,"I applied to new grad in many locations. One of them sent me the challenge, I got 7/7 in the debugging session. In the programming challenge, I got ALL testcases right and I'm pretty sure my solutions were efficient and my code was full of comments explaining everything clearly. I think I did well enough on the leadership questions and the ""work simulation"" part, but of course that's more difficult to say.

Despite all this, Amazon rejected my application the same day I submitted OA3. They did not send a rejection email. Why could it be? It's probably not my CV, they usually filter \*before\* sending the online assessment, as far as I know.

Strangely enough, there are some other locations where it says I'm ""under consideration"" for over a week now but they still have not sent the online assessment. I checked my spam folder.

Did anyone have similar experiences?

EDIT: I also sent both new grad and intern applications to the same locations after not receiving an answer for the new grad ones after a long time. Is that a bad idea?  


EDIT 2: I realize that I got rejected from two additional locations the same day I got rejected from the same day I got rejected from the place I aced. Coincidence?",2020-10-29 09:18:36

dq2r8r,Why does everyone place so much emphasis on github and personal projects?,"CS student about to graduate here. I'm applying for jobs and almost every company, even after positive interviews and/or coding tests, asks me to share some of my work on github so they can have a look.

I can't think of any other careers where this would be standard or acceptable. Imagine if you were hiring a mathematician -- ""can you show us some proofs you did in your free time?"" -- or a dentist ""Please upload photos of unpaid freelance dentistry you completed as a hobby. You know, for fun.""

It would be absurd. So why is this different?

I get that lots of people are passionate about coding, but some of us are in better situations than others.

I cannot upload school assignments as it would violate the ""unfair means"" regulations (other people could see my work and cheat).

I have done a couple internships at tech companies, but all the code I worked on obviously belongs to those companies, so I can't post that.

While I wish I had time to do extra coding on the side, I am not rich and thus have had to work part-time jobs in all my spare time at uni. Fun project time is definitely a luxury I can't afford.

14xh2fb,Getting a job in your country is so much easier than in foreign countries.,"I have checked the comments and I'm still confident in what I said. I guess the most important thing on your resume is your name. If it sounds native you will get an interview.

I'm an EU citizen and I have lived in the UK for a long time, I have the right to remain etc and 3 YOE in their country. I'm their ideal foreigner. Yet sending resumes is so unrewarding there. You go through recruiters every single time, they ask you millions of often not important questions, assure they will get to you soon and rarely you get any interviews.

In my country every contact landed me an interview and most likely soon an offer. I get it that competition in the UK is more fierce, but there are also so many more jobs and because of change in regulations those who are allowed to stay there should be able to find a job easier. That's not the case. I can't even imagine how difficult it must be to search for a job in a country where you don't know the language.

rnr5b4,"First ""Software Engineering"" job has virtually no programming","I joined \~ 2 months ago a company in an area of business I'm very interested on. They were a startup (founded \~10 years ago), but now have \~500 employees.

They treated me very well during the recruitment process, and still do. Their offer (by my country's standards...) is good for a junior that is straight out of college.

I was very excited, but I was put in a team where there's only one software engineer (aside from a DevOps engineer and a QA engineer), who told me ""our work mostly deals with configurations"". In two months, I've written exactly one line of Java code (and there was a \*huge\* emphasis on Java coding during the recruitment process), and a few lines of Python. My work so far has involved mostly .yml configurations and JSON patches, and though I guess it's software *engineering* I don't feel fulfilled, and I feel like I can't do this in the medium-long term.

rbzg4t,I had my midpoint internship performance review and I can't understand if standards are very high or I am really terrible,"I   am halfway through my 6 month internship at a FANGMULAS company (or   whatever you call that after Facebook was rebranded) and I've received   my midpoint performance review, which IMO is quite bad. Don't know if it   was a bit harsh or I'm trash, but I wasn't expecting to be told some  of  the things that I was told. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting  to  get praised either, but some things were unexpected (especially if  you  consider this is an internship).

No   score/scale was used to evaluate the technical competencies since the   manager said it doesn't make much sense for the interns/new grads to  use  this method. Instead, I think they did it because I was under    performing in all/most of the competencies so they did not show a list   of full red marks. Call me paranoid or overthinker but I think it makes a   lot of sense.

The manager  started  by saying that the team appreciates that I am proactive when   approaching other engineers teams to solve the problems in my day to day   tasks  and I take ownership of my project, and that's pretty much it.   They also mentioned at some point towards the end that I have improved   since the start and I am on a positive trajectory (although this  doesn't  mean much given the feedback you will see below), but that's it  on the  positive side! Then the shit storm started...

I   was told I ask too many questions and I take away too much time from  my  mentor (of course everything was wrapped in a more kind and   corporate-specific language) and I should try to find a better balance.   I've read many times already on this sub how you should not bother your   mentor for questions that could be easily found on Google, so I kept   that in mind. I consider I've always thought twice before asking them   something, but apparently it was still too much.

Another   negative thing is that I'm arguing too much with more experienced   engineers (i.e. my mentor). I think I know when to step back and I've   done this plenty of times but the thing is I have received a lot of   contradictory feedback that was going either against the suggestion of   another engineer (I had more than a mentor since the start), against the   documentation/code style recommendations or against the suggestions   that the very same engineer gave previously. Each time I felt the need   to kindly pointed out this aspect and in the long run it wasn't   appreciated. Additionally, sometimes I'm genuinely curious and I would   like to learn more on why I am asked to do some certain things and in a   certain way, but this doesn't mean I am pushing back on the requests or   not accepting feedback.

Finally,   my manager told me that they were expecting me to delivery faster and   more. I consider I have already worked hard enough and probably the  only  way I could have pleased them was by working extra hours. Is this  some  technique management uses to manipulate ICs? Was their estimate  too  optimistic? Or should I simply accept that I am simply bad?",2021-12-08 19:53:13

q2g5g8,Is it normal to be the only frontend dev at a startup as a junior?,"I've begun my first dev role February this year. Since the beginning I've felt my training path was a bit chaotic. I started off working with Azure, then a little work on a Jamstack project, and generally a lot of time learning something only to have long periods of time where I don't use it, meaning I'm not really getting sufficient practice with anything in particular. The startup has a ""must wear a lot of different hats"" approach as the Dev team is only 3 people but I think that's ended up in me having a basic knowledge in a lot of different things but with a lack of real confidence that comes with continual use and practice.

This changed slightly in July - September when we hired another frontend dev on contract for a Vue 3 + Typescript project. During this time I felt like I progressed the most working with him. The other dev's contract finished however and I'm left to manage this project on my own. While I relish a challenge this is still a huge undertaking for me as this is my first job in tech and I don't come from a comp sci background (self-taught). This project is also my first experience with both Vue and Typescript. The rest of the tech team is entirely backend or DevOps so while they can try their best, they can only help so much.

My boss has also mentioned that this project might be halted in the coming days and I'd need to work on some SQL tasks. The last time I used SQL was back in March and I'd need to refamiliarise myself with syntax and our database. So not only am I a bit nervous about managing the Typescript project on my own but I'm annoyed at having projects cut off and having to do this constant relearning of technologies I'm not getting any consistent practice in. 

I just want a gauge of what people think about this. I have tried communicating with my boss about how I would progress and offer more value if I was given a set of things to get good at for a reasonable amount of time but it seems to have fallen on deaf ears. My primary concern is that I'm wasting my time at this company not progressing as well as I could.",2021-10-06 08:24:53

So my question is how I would go about transitioning to something like this. Should I maybe try and get a second masters in something like biomedical engineering or is this something I can accomplish using my current skills and learn the rest with experience?",2021-07-05 17:32:04

I am a CS engineer with 7 yoe and I have just started looking for a new position after a few gap years. My profile is software / data, but I am interested in infrastructure as well.

I am considering going with a platform like [talent.io](https://talent.io). The other platforms I've heard about are: hiresweet, mobiskills, urbanlinker. Do you guys have any first-hand feedback about them? Any idea if I should go with just one or several?

mc1cnd,Should I accept a new job offering 4k less than my current one?," 

TL;DR: new job offer -4kwrt to the current one. At an early career stage startup, what should I choose? \[Germany, currently earning 58k vs 54k\]

I am not able to take a clear-cut decision.  Would really appreciate the help.

I am in my current job ( software development in AI) for around 1.5 years. I took this job right out of university, was a bit desperate for a job at that time. The company is established for 15 years, but it's still a very small company with less than 10 employees. Even though it is small, the pay is quite decent and I earn a good living. I am the youngest here with the next person close to 10 years elder to me, so there aren't any work friendships to form or even anyone to casually meet outside work. This isn't a major drawback, but it has kind of affected me mentally, due to moving to a new city, covid blah blah, leading to lack of social circle. The work culture is also quite unique. I work on the development of a product, but I am the only one working on it. The others do not have much of an idea with regards to Deep Learning, but they are highly skilled software developers.  This I have taken into my stride and improved myself, becoming better each day. I work long hours because the others have been there for close to 10 years and I am the newbie in the company,\[they do the same\] I would like to have a life but that's not the case. I do not see any growth in the company, as they are happy with their business model and would like to continue doing the same.

The new company is a startup established around 2 years ago. Everyone there are my peers and it has much more of an international vibe. Here, the product is still in its nascent phase, so if I join I'll be developing the product from scratch. The scenario is, they have funding for maybe next one year and then they would like the product to make money. It's a challenging situation, but the product is really interesting. The responsibility would lie on me to make it viable. Now, I am just assuming that things would be perfect but in reality, that may or may not be the case. They pay is obviously 4,000 € lesser per annum. They are offering stock options, but that is something depending on how successful the company will be.

If I had this offer last year, it would have been an instantaneous decision. The only cons I can think of with the new job are the money and the lack of job security with how the current market is.

I am in quite a conundrum, regarding my decision.

Any help would be great.",2021-03-24 09:14:31
m13bfa,Question about leaving my current company to create and sell a competing product,"Throwaway for very obvious reasons.

I've been working for my current employer as a software engineer since I graduated about 5 years ago. Without getting into specifics, we design a bunch of software used by some private, but mostly public (government-operated) entities used for a very specific type of operation in a specific industry. If I mentioned the purpose of the software and the industry a quick google search has it as the very first suggestion so I would prefer to not do so. The problem is, the software is super old school and written in mostly C (and some C++ and C#) with millions of lines of legacy code (not exaggerating here). We have a team of around 30 people currently maintaining and developing this software.

I know for a fact that I can recreate this software in Python in under 5000 lines of code. How? I have already done it and showed it to the stakeholders as a proof-of-concept. It was denied as they mentioned there would be too much paperwork and logistical issues since a lot of our contracts are with public bureaus of other EU nations. Not only is the performance much better (though the application is not very performance critical so it isn't super important), it is so much more maintainable. I can literally maintain it alone instead of having 30 underpaid developers needing to maintain it. Also, they wouldn't need some very expensive and specific hardware from the late 90s and early 00s in order to get it to work, as they currently do.

So my question is, should I look into starting a competing company with myself as the sole employee? Even though the python version would need to be abandoned since it is technically property of my current employer, I am extremely confident that I can create a competing product in any similar language in less than 3 months. However, I have no business experience and no clue how to market the product to the customers.

Is it worth looking into something like this? These entities are paying completely ridiculous fees for this software. Even if I charged a tenth of what my company does I could be making millions of Euros per year. I just have no clue how the business and financial side of things works.

If it matters, I live in an EU country and I am an EU citizen.",2021-03-09 09:55:09

I started a graduate dev role a few months ago at a medium sized, well respected company. Because of the C word it has started remotely with no view to go into the office any time soon. Knowing how difficult it can be to get your foot in the door, especially in this climate, I really felt like I won the lottery.

Basically I feel like I'm drowning... I don't know anyone and barely even know who I should reach out to when I have an issue. I don't understand any of the procedures or anything that's going on and I'm being given work to do that I don't even know how to start. This feels like a trial by fire and I'm failing miserably.  
I have this feeling like if I had started out in the office it would have still been hard, but I at least would be around people where it would be easier to ask questions or get some experience just watching what other people are doing.

itblnh,How to find out if a company invests time into their entry-level/grad employees?,"A lot of the Software Engineer grad scheme's I see advertised are two years long, which seems like it could be a crucial period as I assume that by the end of it you would (potentially) be expected to have the skills of an upper junior/mid-level engineer. Furthermore, some of these schemes have £2k+ sign-on bonuses which I've read can make it difficult to leave the company as you'd be expected to pay it back. (Correct me if I'm wrong)

I did a 4-month internship at a small/mid company which was growing too fast to dedicate much time to their entry-level developers, during my internship I witnessed a grad developer who had been working there for 8 months learn barely anything at all, the company had no real expectations of him and he wasn't self-motivated, he sat on reddit for 90% of the week and was occasionally tasked with doing the occasional super small code change. He was subsequently and abruptly fired at the 11 month mark.

To the Software Engineers of cscareerquestionsEU, a lot of these polished and shiny grad schemes look amazing on the surface, but **if there are any, what signs/questions can a new grad look out for/ask to indicate that a company actually invests time in their entry-level staff?** (e.g. find out whether they personal development time, mentor/buddy schemes etc)

Not a big name in CS tech jobs, but an FTSE250 company. I took a year out of uni to do a placement here and they gave me an unconditional graduate job offer. Been here two years now since I graduated.

So I've never really done proper job hunting. Just applied to a placement advert, got the job, and had a career handed to me.

Things are getting difficult now. Almost all my friends have moved away over the past half a year. I live alone and I'm very lonely and my job is just getting more and more stressful with lots of deadlines coming in. I want to just quit and live at my parents for a couple of months taking time off, just for my mental health.

But I feel like I want a new job instead of returning. Need something new. I can get a 1 1/2 hour train to central London from their house so a temporary commute before I have another place rented is possible. I would much prefer being near London than where I currently live.

Is this something that seems reasonable in the current climate? Would I have difficulty getting a job? Are many people actually hiring? Or would I be better to just ride out the storm and job search next year?

hef9ae,Thinking about moving out from Italy when I finish my MSc,"Hi, 
I’m finishing my MSc at the top ranked Italian University, I study Computer Engineering with a track highly focused on AI and Machine Learning. 
As I’m approaching more and more the job market, I’m really pissed off by the salaries here in Italy. To give you a bit of background, in Milan I’d get between 1.4k to 1.8k per month, but to rent a small apartment with a bedroom and a small kitchen/living room you’d pay 1.2k. There’s a small difference between the money you earn and the money you spend. Plus Italy is not really the best country for opportunities of advancing in your career. 
I was thinking that maybe I should be moving, I have an interview scheduled in December in Berlin, and I wanted to look around a bit, I think in countries like Germany, Switzerland or Sweden there are far better opportunities than here. 
Can you guys tell me your experience of moving to one of these countries, and how your career’s been proceeding in terms of salary and position?

Almost every time I have come into contact with them they are usually working for an Indian boiler houses like Wipro, InfoSys etc who are then sub-contracting to banks or big four companies.

The problem with these Indian recruiters is they low-ball the offers so much, often the job spec is written with expectations of doing 3 different people's jobs at a sub-standard salary or freelance contract.

I get the suspicion they eat up up to 40% of what the customer actually offered and the low-ball salaries/contracts are then provided to prospects.

The problem is these roles are not advertised on the actual customer websites so you cannot apply direct, it comes through the service providers.

I moved to Poland, worked there 5 years, I liked the working culture and people, but eventually needed a change of scenery. Went to Finland, integration and services were easier here but have only been able to work in low paid consulting jobs (€65k) and have had really low billable hours for more than a year, I doubt I can keep this job for much longer. People work like crazy here, and they tend to completely ignore the demands of their families. Have been interviewing for non consulting roles but it's been impossible to get past first stage interview in Finland!

Casual browsing of this subReddit leaves me with the impression that Europe is “safe” from the ongoing and impending turmoil. In one recent thread I’ve read that EU tech companies didn’t overhire like their US counterparts.

To be fair and put things in perspective, globally $7.4tln of value has been wiped out from the books in the tech sector according to a different CNBC [article](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/11/25/techs-reality-check-how-the-industry-lost-7point4-trillion-in-one-year.html). 

And all of this value is kind of virtual. It’s just what the market thinks will happen. The market thinks a lot of things and not all of them right. But, what the market thinks kind of matters because when companies lose value like Meta and/or can’t attract investors like Klarna then typically there is fallout in terms of jobs being cut.

ve92jw,"Takeover/sale of my app, which I developed during my studies","Hi guys

I finished my bachelor's degree in Germany this spring. During my studies I developed a social app for a niche group. The app went to market with features around early 2021. Currently I have around 70,000 registered users, of which between 8,000 and 15,000 are active per month.

Now I had two phone calls with the biggest app from the niche and they are considering taking over the app. At the same time, they would like to hire me to take the product further.

However, in the long run, they would like to dissolve my app and redevelop the feature set. The problem is that my app is developed with Flutter and Firebase, while their app is native and works with other clouds. So the code can't be adopted.

My desired selling price would be 150k€, but I have already been assured that the amount is unrealistic. I should apply anyway and they will check the value of my company/app in the meantime.

Would you give the app away for less? The app is relatively complex with over 40,000 lines of code. And currently the app makes around €2,000-2,500 gross.

I have a feeling the deal won't happen as I don't want to work for under €70,000 and don't want to give my app away for peanuts. Unfortunately, I have a feeling that they only want to pay the potential users who would switch to their main app. And that always depends entirely on how much advertising I'm doing at the moment. The app still has huge potential to increase. As soon as I put some effort into it and do a bit of advertising, my sales always increase extremely. Unfortunately, it also drops again when I do nothing for the app for weeks.

I don't have a concrete takeover offer yet, but I'm still a bit disappointed that the app isn't worth €150,000 despite its complexity and active community.

It's important to mention that I don't have an urgent job need. I don't have to pay rent, I work as a freelancer on the side, I have a large stock portfolio and I earn a little from the app.

No idea how to proceed with this.",2022-06-17 09:22:34

1. I do not like how they treat their own citizens, worker rights are constantly being exploited
2. I don't like the politial aspects/culture  &  systematic racism  in the states (ranging from how both parties  that does not advocate for the working class; ACAB;  facist groups existing and rising in popularity). I feel unsafe as someone who is not caucasian.

Reasons why I want to to EU (social democratic EU countries to be particular):

1. Worker rights are known to be better, especially in scandaniavna countries. From a quick glance I  feel much safer due to existing saety nets, retiring there, etc.

Reasons why I do not want to move to EU:

1. I can see myself having a hard time integrating into their society since I do not speak their languange; making friends will be challenging.

tl;dr: So my question is do you let your personal standards interfere with how you evaluate an interviewer? How do you put a bare minimum kinda thing for interviewees? Do you care how many YoE the interviewee has?",2021-11-14 13:59:46

pu5iyn,How 'intense' are your jobs? Is this normal?,"So basically, I got my B.Sc. in IT late last year and landed a job as a C# .net dev in Germany (just where I live) straight away.

At first I thought it was amazing, colleagues were (and are still) nice and got me settled into the technical aspects nicely.

The work is pretty standard Windows Desktop app development which sounds antiquated but is straightforward and pretty fun at times.

However, over the last months I've really noticed some things not going 100% well. Examples: Devs develop some feature, it takes ages until someone 'higher up' finally tests it, and the tests only happen just before the date the feature is supposed to be rolled out, resulting in lots of stress because you're supposed to fix every bug in literal minutes so the deadline can be kept. This goes as far as having to (nobody says this outright but deadlines are non negotiable) sometimes work 11h a day instead of the usual 8.

Also, there is this thing going on that every minute except for the 15min daily standup is supposed to be actual coding work. Things like documentation and learning from colleagues or especially pair programming are pretty much disregarded, which of course leads to problems further down the road...

My question to you: Does this happen at your job as well? If so, to what degree? Is this common enough to have to endure it or should I perhaps look into other options?",2021-09-23 21:46:43
p2mfrd,How to keep high performance at your job while pushing hard in the gym?,"Hey all,

I recently started working out again after a long time getting more and more unfit from working at home. I'm finding that it's causing my performance at work to drop quite substantially. This week for instance I've got almost nothing done and today spent over an hour debating a topic that maybe I was never going to win.

The debate was about a service that allows users to preview a small number of events from a Kafka topic and how long we should cache the data for. My position on it was that we should only be caching data for a couple of seconds so that users can make subsequent requests to see the most up to date data. I had 2 colleagues say that instead we should be caching the data for a couple of minutes to keep it efficient, and if users want a way to get up to date data, they should create their own application and connect themselves using their own Consumer.

Just to reiterate, we spent well over an hour debating this and ended up reaching a middle ground of caching for 1 minute, which for the use case I'm thinking of (being able to do a couple of refreshes to quickly see what data is coming through) doesn't really help. It's worth noting at this point that I was trying to win over 2 people who have way more experience than me and know the platform and users better than I do. Perhaps this was a battle I was never going to win, and if I was less tired I feel like I would have had the foresight to have seen that (or at least not spend 1 hour of everyones time debating it). 

My question is - how do you maintain high performance whilst still working out? Are there tips for staying productive when tired, or do you just accept that performance will not be as high? I'm really just looking for advice on how to balance fitness and work and be ace at both.

o0p225,Any one else feeling underpaid?,"Looking for some opinions.

I am working at a company since I got my degree 1.5 years ago as a junior dev (mainly Spring Boot and typescript are used) and getting 45k €.
I am working 40hrs the week plus unpaid 'on call' days once a week - no matter if national holiday or not.

I think the payment is not enough for someone with a masters degree and this experience.

My boss says that one day we get paid by getting shares of the company and that this can pay out. Note: I think this can happen because it is a quite successful company in the finance sector - but there is no contract for that.

But I am missing 30 vacation days (currently is 24), a better payment (like 50-55k/year) and maybe a payment at the end of the year (didn't get anything).
Sometimes I am ashamed of these conditions when I see what others get.

Is this normal? Would you stay or go in this situation? I have two ways: Stay and wait for success of company with having a lot of stress. Or go and get a better paid job without knowing how it will be.

ntlqun,When would you move back to home country (EU) from London (or in general)?,"Hi,

I've been working as software dev in London for about 3 years now.

As I am in the process of thinking whether I'll get a new rental contract for a flat or actually buy a flat to stay longer (4,5 years at least), I was wondering what are the conditions when you might want to move out of London back to your home country (or even if would just stay in London forever).

I think we all know London is one of the best cities in Europe in terms of available roles and opportunities, on the other hand COL is quite high, work life balance not the best ever...

If I want to have a family, nice property... I doubt this can be achieved better in London compared to my home country in EU (eastern EU). I also have a partner, whose career probably wouldn't suffer much if we moved back ""home"".

So overall, some of the circumstances I can think of when I'd want to move back:  
1. Get UK citizenship AND  
2. Negotiate a remote job or find a good paying role in home country (I am surprised how much salaries rose in last 4-5 years...) AND  
3. Have enough money to buy a nice, large apartment in cash

l182ot,Is the job market for web developers in Italy really all that bad?,"Long story short, I'm a junior web dev and I will be moving to italy this year to finally live with my fiance. Italy is my only option in the EU for now. But I'm 100% geographically flexible - we will initially live in the south but we wouldn't mind moving to one of the major cities in the north or centre (hell, I'd love to stay in the south but I doubt there is any work there).

I'm making decent money in my current non-EU country as a junior dev (considering the CoL) but staying here is not really an option for me.

I know salaries suck there and  I have very low expectations, I'm just trying to understand which city might be the best choice for me as far as salaries and CoL go. Judging from my research, Milan is by far the best place but when I'm comparing the average salaries to the CoL, I simply wont be able to survive there (70% of my salary would go to rent alone). I just need to make enough to rent a place and pay for necessities, nothing more, especially in the beginning.

Also, how do you think the job market situation in Rome is?

p0yjvw,Not all salaries in Italy suck as much as this sub thinks they do.,"With this post I would just like to address a point that I keep on reading on this sub: Italy's salaries are terrible. No one earns more than 45K for a senior developer.

Here some of (my) answers to some misconceptions:

* Do italian salaries suck for software engineers? Yes, for a lot of software engineers this is true.
* Southern Italy salaries are worse than Northern Italy ones? Yes! But southern Italy CoL is way lower.
* Are salaries for new graduates bad? Almost always yes (20K-38K is the min\_max range I've seen).
* Do ALL salaries for software engineers in Italy suck? ABSOLUTELY NOT.

The last one is a big misconception and is well backed up by the fact that most italian salaries are quite low, however there are plenty of companies that actually pay well in Italy as well, and yes, especially in northern Italy (Milan, Turin..).

There are some fintechs, tech companies, consultancy companies and FAANGS (still consultancy for the most part big G and MSFT) that pay well above the average ""I earn 35K and I have 10 years experience in Italy"" that I keep on reading in this sub. 50-70K with around 3 years experience is quite doable, and with 10s of years of exp you can get a lot more (85-90 for software architects) and more once you get in management/team lead roles.

Of course, it will still be inferior compared to some other countries, but it's not as bad as everyone paints it to be.

And if you are earning 35K with 10 years of experience in Italy... it's time for a change! Be it in Italy or outside Italy, there's something incredibly wrong going on there! You're being taken advantage of and you're not using your experience in the right way.

What I am saying is that YES, we do have a problem with software engineers salaries, however the picture is not all black as this sub paints it. It has shades of gray too, and sometimes a bit of color. You need to search for better companies and more importantly.. job hop!",2021-08-09 10:10:01

I have two kids (started school recently) and I'm a bit worried about their future here, It's quite easy to get a job in finance or IT, but that's it.

m0dphc,Stay in UK or try Europe?,"33M, 11 YOE, trying to decide what to do with the next few years of my life (as ever!) now that there's starting to be some light at the end of the pandemic tunnel.

Short story so far is I studied CS at uni and did very well but then for most my 20s I didn't take my career very seriously and did digital agency work that was well below my capabilities. A couple of years ago I took a job in a large retail bank here in Edinburgh which was a big step up - crappy company to decent company - but in the near future I'd like to go from decent to good and realise more of my potential.

Currently earning 52k + decent benefits, hoping to get a promotion soon to \~60k; it would be nice to get it but I still feel I could do better elsewhere. It's quite comfortable and WLB is decent but the work isn't very interesting and the engineering standard isn't high so I often feel I can't trust my teammates (including better-paid ones and contractors!) to do their work properly. I've gained a ton of experience there but, without wanting to sound too full of myself, I feel I'm now getting too good for it... More money would always be nice (I'm aiming for financial independence, and I admit that seeing all the super-high earners on here makes me feel a little inadequate :D) although my current salary is decent for the cost of living here, and as well as progressing my career I'm quite curious to try life in another city and even country while I'm still young and free.

Options I'm considering:

* The conventional one: stay in Edinburgh for the next few years at least, buy a property, relax and feel settled, consider other jobs here or remote work e.g. for a London-based company.
* Berlin: I love the city (although would maybe get sick of it after a few years) and have been offered a job there in the past so have done my research. I'm not sure I'd earn much more (I could maybe get 80-95k, which after tax wouldn't be too different from what I get now) but I'd have fun and probably have more interesting options with the bigger tech and startup community. Bit more complicated now with Brexit but getting a visa should be easy with my experience.
* London: big international city life without the hassle (and excitement) of leaving the UK, plenty job options, and with WFH being more common the commute and cost of living could be smaller factors than before.
* Go all the way and aim for FAANG-level companies. Unlike most here it's not my dream job (would rather be in a cool startup/scale-up), but can't argue with the salary, experience, and brand. If I keep up my spare-time study and Leetcode for a few months I might have a decent chance. I'm not very keen on Facebook or Amazon, but Google in Zurich/Munich/London could be pretty cool.
* Something/somewhere else?

My current thinking is to stay where I am for now and keep doing interview prep and exploring options in my spare time, then start seriously applying later in the year when I'll be more prepared and things will (hopefully!) be more back to normal. But there's a bit of an internal battle between the part of me that's getting older and wanting to feel settled and realise that I'm already doing pretty well, and my ambitious and aventurous side that wants to see how far I can go and compensate for fucking around in my 20s...",2021-03-08 11:24:25

ku1h0n,How realistic is it to move and find a job in Germany (or elsewhere) with only a Bachelor's in Math?,"Okay, so a little background about me: I live in Spain, about to finish my bachelor's. My intention is probably to study a master's degree in Data Science or something related, but since I still want to figure out what I like, if that's my correct path, where to study, what specific degree, etc. I would first like to take a ""break"" from studying, get a job, gain some experience, and have some time to think about my future plans with my studies.

But obviously, having only a Bachelor's limits my possibilities, specially with how competitive the market is, and because it's obviously not the same being a Data Scientist, with the master's degree and all, as only having a Bachelor in Maths. However, I do have some ""real life experience"" that might give me some opportunities: I'm working as an intern right now as I finish my bachelor's, in a multinational consultancy, doing some machine learning and neural networks in Python. I also know a decent level of C++, R and Matlab. But still, I don't know if my knowledge is sufficient to get a job. And I obviously have all the math background (statistics, probability, calculus, algebra...) needed for Data Science 

And regarding countries, I'm thinking of going to Germany mainly because of good salaries to COL ratio, and I see more opportunities than in Spain (or most other countries tbh), low unemployment, and I also have a somewhat decent level of German. Like, not enough to actually get a job where I *must* know German (I feel way more comfortable in English), but I see moving to Germany as a good opportunity to improve my German. But tbf I wouldn't mind anywhere else (NL, UK, Ireland...) if I get a good offer. 

So... Is it realistic, or should I just go directly for the master's and get a job afterwards?",2021-01-09 22:52:19

18trcrj,I fucked up bad and don't know what to do.,"I graduated in January and am still without a job.

The gist of it, is: I put all my eggs in one rotten basket. During my Masters I was doing research with a post-doc and I thought I had good chances to get into doctorate programs. Turns out that was not the case. Because I put my everything into this research effort I did not do any internships or work placements so I have no connections in industry.

After graduation I was no longer eligible for internships and as it turns out there are no junior positions available in any of the niches I had expertise in. What's worse is, I never had the time to prepare for interviews by doing leetcode or publishing some projects on github.

So now I feel terrified that I fucked up my whole life. I don't know how I can get my foot in the door. It feels like all doors are closed now. ",2023-12-29 16:43:26

1820rze,Dumb mistake got me rejected,"I recently had a final round coding interview for a junior/entry level SWE role where I solved the question as well as the follow-up twist with optimal solution. However, I got rejected. The feedback I received was that I coded well, I was coachable, and I know my DSA well. The only criticism I got was that I needed a little nudge from my interviewer to consider some corner case checks, which I promptly implemented.

I feel pretty disheartened that despite my optimal solution and voicing out my thought process throughout the interview, I let a basic mistake overshadow my performance. I also feel it is a little harsh that I was rejected based on this, given that I also did another final round system design interview for this role and received solely positive feedback.

14ew19b,Berlin based company cancelled offer due to potential visa delays,"**Tldr**: Berlin based company cancelled my SDE job offer because they fear that my relocation to Germany will take an unpredictable amount of time (often 5 months+).

**Details**

I cleared interviews for an SDE role in a Berlin based company. I live outside the EU but they said they were happy to relocate me and that they do it all the time. They were very happy with my interview performance. They then sent an offer.

But now, they have cancelled the offer because they are experiencing too much delays with relocating people to Germany. They said they recently hired 4 people to relocate them to Germany, but for all of them, it has taken at least 5 months (and counting) to get their blue card visas approved. So, for now, they are not considering relocation candidates.

I will add that my compensation was going to be €80k per year. I have a university degree. So I would have definitely qualified for the blue card visa.

112b1yk,What would you choose? 82k in an established company or 104k in a startup?,"Hi! I'm in a paralyzing state of decision fatigue and in dire need of a reality check. I thought I'd share my story:

I guess I don't have to elaborate on the current market - companies ghosting, closing job positions out of nowhere, being extra picky and paranoid with minute details.

However, I managed to get two offers out of company A and company B:

**Company A**

* 82k + budget for learning + stock options.
* Pretty well-respected scale-up based in Germany, exciting product, has offices in multiple countries.
* Friendly atmosphere, had a good experience with all interviewers.
* The company culture seems decent and seems to have its shit (processes) together.
* Fully remote.

**Company B**

* Compensation is 104k + stock options.
* Western European seed-stage SAAS startup with a good outlook - the founders have successfully sold their previous company.
* The team is very small, and I would be wearing more hats than in the other one.
* The interviews were kinda informal and uncoordinated, talking a lot about the product but not much about the day-to-day responsibilities.
* They are based in my favorite city, there would be occasional trips to the office.
* Fully remote with occasional off-site gatherings.

TLDR: torn between A's stability and defined career path and overall culture, and B's better compensation (+25%), being part of a founding team, and faster career progression (if the company succeeds).

I'm leaning towards A, but I'm having doubts mainly because of the TC. Though it makes little sense because I'm based in a fairly cheap country.

Thanks for reading and for any insights!

Edit: decided to accept offer A, viva la WLB!",2023-02-14 17:31:50

16ktt35,Is the job market in Finland always this… bad? Or it's not the right season?,"I'm an Asian who wants to work in the IT industry in Europe by getting a bachelor's degree in ICT at Aalto University. I had a bachelor's and a master's degree in a totally irrelevant field from my country (I majored in English, yeah, I know, it's useless…). 

One of the reasons I want to go to Aalto University is that living and studying there would be much cheaper than Ireland, UK and Netherlands. Aalto University also ranks pretty high in the technology field in Europe. Plus the requirement for getting PR in Finland is rather easy. I don't speak any European languages other than English. I heard almost all of the Finish people can speak good English. So it seems that Finland is a nice choice for me.

However, I've been looking up full-time job posts on LinkedIn and Indeed in Finland and it seems that the market looks… not positive at all. I've tried keywords like ""frontend"", ""backend"", ""fullstack"", ""java"", and ""data"". The results were only like less than 100 or so and many of them were just ""open application"" or not even relevant. As for internship… well, I've only seen like three or four real intern jobs in the first seven or eight pages.

I've also switched the location to Ireland and Germany and tried the same keywords. And the results were just as bad… There's also extremely limited relevant positions and most of them require three or more years of experience in really specific field and with super specific expertise.

I have several questions:
1. Am I doing something wrong? 
Did I not use the correct keywords? 
2. Is it not the right season to do job hunting in Europe? 
3. Are most of the jobs in Europe are found through internal connections and networks? 
4. Will I be fucked as a new grad looking for a job in Europe?",2023-09-17 06:55:29

13xbl49,"Nobody thrives on rejection – here are reasons I didn’t take job offers - ""Christian Heilmann""","Apologies for long text, this is copied from Christian Heilmann's blog where he explains his latest job looking experience after working for Microsoft quite some time. It is really good read so I wanted to share it with you all.   


  
End of this month is my last day at Microsoft. I didn’t plan this. My original plan was to keep being a representative of that company and work on the amazing products it builds. Market forces, however, caused yet another reorg and as there was no other department with openings for remote work in Germany, we agreed to split. Who knows? Maybe things will change, but given the current trend of all big tech companies to “healthshrink”, I looked around for smaller, local companies.  
  
Having been focused on my employer for 8 years without any interests in other opportunities I dived into the job market, brushing up my resume and using my network of great folks I interacted with over the years. So after a month of unemployment benefits, I will start a new role on the first of July.  
  
All in all I sent out 19 applications, 11 of which got offered to me by contacts, recruiters, or the companies directly. Yes, I am a lucky person with a lot of privilege. But I also have a 20+ years track record I worked very hard on. My main source was LinkedIn but I also paid for two more services, both of which were pointless, but at least the payment is tax deductible.  
I had a stressful time finding and choosing, mostly because of the people I met in the process. Everybody was nice and exciting to get to know. The offers, too, were really good and some made impostor syndrome hop about like a mechanical cymbal wielding monkey in my head. I had a hard time disappointing some dedicated people and hope I didn’t burn all bridges. In short, recruiters are people, too, so treat them like you want to be treated.  
  
I also want to point out that the list I’m about to write feels weird as it may make me come across as a spoiled brat – at least to me. But I think it might be helpful for companies to know which things can cause someone like me to say no, even when all interactions were positive up to the last moment.  
  
So, without more beating around the bush, here goes:  
  
Work from office / bonkers hybrid work demands  
With the hiatus in the pandemic it seems that most companies remembered that they have expensive offices their employers should use. Often they also had bad experiences with people working remotely. And I get it. Working face to face in a small company is a lot more efficient. I’m looking forward to working from an office from time to time again. But I don’t see the point of being a lead of a distributed team and having to do this from a place with a one hour commute when all my interactions would be virtual anyway. One company even asked if I could work from their office 400 kilometres away twice a week.  
  
Remote work in tech is the most obvious thing to do – so don’t force people to waste time on the road who don’t want to.  
Complex and rigid application processes and systems  
Bureaucracy and red tape in companies is generally mentioned as one of the main sources of employee dissatisfaction. Therefore it is baffling to see how many companies made me jump through rows and rows of hoops – some of them burning – just to get to the first interview. I get it, at Microsoft we were also swamped with applications and there are many SaaS offers out there that promise a company to deal with that in a convenient fashion for the recruiters.  
  
But having to replicate all the information in a secondary system after people found me on LinkedIn and got my CV through the “Easy Apply” process was always the first indicator that we won’t get to where we both apparently want to.  
I keep my LinkedIn profile tidy and up-to-date, same with my CV. So having to fill in multi-step forms, some of them with two factor authentication and CAPTCHAs with the same information is not only a colossal waste of time, but also worries me as it means there is a copy of my information that will not get an update when I change my CV.  
  
Other companies made me sign an NDA to get information about the job. Well, as an open source advocate this doesn’t bode well to what I will create in this role.  
  
I wrote in more detail about one company asking me to answer a lot of questions in a written interview. They then sent me an online test to assess my skills that I had to do within a week and took three hours, demanding a full block of that time as you couldn’t pause and continue.  
  
As stated in that earlier post, I get the idea of treating every hire equally, but treating me like applicant number 2324234 instead of catering the test to my skills and the role was another big flag for me.  
  
I have to mention one special case though: one company asked me to do a case study showing my skills and explaining how I solved issues and paid for my time. This was a very interesting approach which gives the company something to work with and the applicant a feeling of not wasting time.  
  
Super aggressive timelines  
Starting a new job is a big decision and nobody likes to get badgered. I understand that it’s also a lot of work for companies to hire new folks and get them up and running.  
  
I explained in each communication when and why I can start and that I needed some time to stomach the change and get ready for the new job. And yet seven companies asked if I could start weeks earlier as things are broken and it would need my amazing fixing skills right now. This is flattering, but also a big red flag.  
  
Another thing several companies did was send me a contract that I needed to digitally sign that had a fixed offer expiration date two days later. Sometimes these came on a Friday and I was asked to sign by Monday. Huge, 9-10 page contracts full of boilerplate not enforceable or even applicable.  
  
This isn’t “I read the terms and conditions” before downloading a demo app. This is our professional work agreement. Companies and applicants should expect that there is a necessary review and alteration period.  
Automated responses and processes with no context of your application  
Especially with US companies but also with agencies and government affiliated companies I had a few run-ins when it comes to automated gatekeeping. Although the job offers mentioned “degree or comparable experience” many had forms where adding a degree was mandatory and I got automatically filtered out.  
  
It also felt like a massive waste of time being contacted by recruiters because of your profile just to be asked by every single interviewer to repeat the information in the profile in interview forms. You can give an applicant a much better feeling of being in an onboarding process if information already provided gets sent on through the stages.  
  
Boilerplate social benefits without insight into local or personal requirements  
There is a big difference between a company providing a social benefits net to feel safe in and a company that tries to impress you with perk offers that seem great, but ultimately don’t apply to you.  
  
Some companies I talked to obviously partnered with a third party provider that offered a US package that would make folks there happy but didn’t even cover the basic legal requirements in Germany. Workplaces need to contribute to the public healthcare fund or cover part of your personal insurance.  
  
It is great that companies offer social perks, but the most grating thing I found in some of the offers is that they are a non-starter. Many social perks, like a personal pension fund partly covered by your employer, need years of accumulation to make sense. I had quite a few companies that offered them but when I asked about the average retention of employees in the company people admitted that most folks stay for a year and move on. This felt like a strange disconnect.  
  
Aggressive haggling and the myth of competitive salary  
There was no doubt that it would be tough for European companies to match the salary and compensation package of an 8 year career in a US tech giant. So I slashed 20% of what I had earned for the convenience of working for a company that isn’t confused about European tax, social packages benefits and support instead of perpetual growth demands.  
  
However, some of the offers were just incredibly low considering the high taxation here. Even worse were offers that had no range or figure but offered “competitive salary” instead. When I offer “competitive skills” people probably would have questions, too.  
  
I was very candid in my demands, which went down really well with all the people I talked to. When candid answers then told me that I would earn more than most of my peers or even managers I knew I couldn’t do it. It’s good to be clear.  
  
Huge discrepancy between skills offered and skills needed without a plan to cover the gap  
I was flattered by some of the offers as it would mean I had to push myself to learn new skills or transfer to have the ones I got into other environments. It’s also a concern when there was no mention of an adjustment period or introduction to internal systems and processes programs.  
  
Sure, some skills are easy to transfer, but I remember vividly how much I hated dealing with managers coming in not knowing half of what I did and keeping things generic not to be found out. Maybe I was too chicken there, but it would be good not to be thrown into situations where you need to prove your skills to yourself and to the people you are supposed to lead.  
  
No job offer will be a perfect match and it is a back and forth to meet in the middle. But it would be great to have clarity on what the process of getting to learn about the company environment is and how much time you have to get enough confidence to start running the team without feeling like a fraud.  
  
Things applicants and companies can do to make this smoother  
All in all, I had a positive experience on a human level but I found that there is a lot to be improved in the processes of finding a job in tech even on the senior level I am at. I can only imagine what it would be like to apply as a junior where the human excitement of your application isn’t as high. So here are some things I found any applicant should do and I could have done better.  
  
As an applicant you should:  
  
Get ready to have a lot of demands, things to fill out and do. I was kind of rushing things in the beginning, freaking out that I will need to find a new job soon. This lead to me applying for a lot of things at the same time and feeling overwhelmed with the work this meant. Don’t panic. You will find a job eventually. It makes a lot more sense to focus on a few offers and prepare yourself thoroughly than casting a wide net.  
Have a clear goal what you want to do – there are a lot of exciting job offers, but if you apply for the reason of having a “cool” job, you ultimately don’t have the skills for and don’t feel you will get the time to learn them upfront, you are wasting people’s – and your – time.  
Have a list of “must have” benefits and perks you don’t back out from – that includes a minimal salary and work situation definition (remote, hybrid, on-site – in the latter case including the information how long of a commute you are ready to take on)  
Do your homework learning about the job offer, the company behind it and what you specifically can bring to the table. This includes a CV catered to the job application and role.  
Communicate clearly your earliest possible start date and availability for interviews and tests – I used Calendly for that.  
Communicate if you have other offers and by when these decisions are due – this is great to speed up the process  
Appreciate the efforts and time of people involved – recruiters and interviewers have to deal with a lot of applications. Be on time for your interviews, don’t leave people hanging with answers and have your materials ready for the different steps of the process.  
Companies should:  
  
Value the work applicants put into the process. We spend a lot of time writing and optimising our CVs and LinkedIn profile, so use this information but don’t ask us to repeat it all the time or fill out your internal systems.  
Be aware of the fact that automated systems with arbitrary gatekeeping mechanisms are great to stem the flood of mass applications and fake applications but will make you miss out on great talent and start the process with a bad experience if there are false positives  
Value the time people need to ponder your job offer and give enough time read through contracts  
Be aware that a job application and how it is handled is a first impression that goes both ways. We always have the impression that applicants have to put their best foot forward and spruce up to get the job, but in a highly paid environment with a severe lack of talent this very much goes both ways.  
Give a sense of clarity of what the company wants to do in the next few years and how it would affect the applicant. Freelancing is always an option and people choose to join a company for the reason of having security, not help a company even find its place in the market.  
I hope this is helpful to some. It helped me, writing it down. I am happy to have met so many interesting companies and people during this last month and hope to keep in contact and work together in other capacities.",2023-06-01 08:02:28
131sviy,Salaries: UK vs Switzerland,"Hello colleagues! I'll soon be searching for a new grad job and have reduced my choice to only two countries - UK and Switzerland. My preference is London since I like the city a lot (have done an internship there), but I couldn't help but notice how average salaries in the UK are much lower than in Switzerland. E.g. new grads and juniors earn on average 90k/year in Zurich (6k/month after tax), while in London it's around 40k/year. I have two Big N (one is FAANG) internships on my resume so I'll be able to get a better-than-average offer. Anyways, I'm still looking to maximise my TC package and look at few years into the future.

Both cities are extremely expensive with Zurich being more expensive and London having more opportunities. What's your take on this - why are salaries in the UK so low on average? What would be a ""better"" offer - 60k in London vs 100k in Zurich?",2023-04-28 14:10:42

She kept warning me that once the company start to lay off, the market will be full of people in the same roles as me looking for jobs and I would have to compete with all of them, I didn't listen.

Now I just don't know how much more time it would take to find new jobs. It usually took me no more than 2 months to get offers before all this started.

169qhvp,How to look for €100k+ remote jobs?,"Hi there,

For context, I am a software developer with 10 years of experience. My core skill is doing backend with Java, and I also am knowledgable with DevOpsing with ADO/GitLab CI/Kubernetes/Helm, automated testing and a relational and non-relational databases (I have a MongoDB certificate) and React frontends, but it's a little rusty for me as it's been a significant amount of time since I've done a proper frontend.

My contract runs out fairly soon meaning that I will be out of a job in a couple of weeks and now I have to find something. My previous job was very well paid, I was on £120k per year before taxes, which translated to very favourable £90k net, thanks to the Polish tax code for B2B contractors.

The thing is that is that I didn't do anything special to land my previous job. A recruiter contacted me, I did well enough during the interviews and I was hired with very little effort on my part. This is where the question comes in - how in the current landscape of IT do I replicate this? I don't want to move, I am open to working within European timezone. Anyone can share any tips?

Thanks in advance!",2023-09-04 12:18:01
161t65l,No salary adjustment for internal move,"Hey! I work as data something at a tech company in Stockholm, Sweden. I have a computer science bachelor and a business masters degree and 8 years relevant experience. Currently I have a leadership position for 5 employees. Funnily enough, I earn less than half of them although I am on the same or higher job level than them, plus the leadership function (mentoring, salary talk, interviewing) at just below 50.000 SEK per month (ca. 3100€ net). I have been frustrated over that for a while and got a mere 3% raise last time (as the whole rest of ordinary employees), and I don’t want to wait another year for another tiny increase. Hence, I am looking for a new job, but to no success yet as not many big companies seem to hire right now. 

Long story short, I thought looking for a new job internally would do the trick to push my salary. Found a position that fits well, becoming department analytics lead for 10 employees and interview went well. Now I learned though that for internal moves, the company generally does not do any salary adjustment - Wow. So they would expect me to take on the new job which requires higher skill set and more responsibility at the same already underpaid level that I’m at now? Looks like I am moving externally :)

i just got an offer for an ML software developer position in Munich, Germany, in a rather laid back company (I’m not expecting much overtime or stress from what I’ve seen so far, plus up to 100% remote work). I thought 60.000€ is quite an okay offer for a graduate (MSc CS with focus ML) with some working student experience, but someone from the industry I just talked to said that’s a ridiculously low offer. When I do my Google research, the salary is between 44 and 53k, depending on the source, but is that the reality?

What salary can I expect as a recent graduate? Do you agree with the industry guy?

17hojm2,Is Poland the best EU country for FIRE as a non-EU SWE?,"Poland has a relatively low income tax rate and COL in the EU. Still, as long as you can land a job as a senior/staff/lead engineer at a major US company there, you can earn a decent salary nowadays. Check out levels.fyi and see the salary for SWE in [Warsaw](https://www.levels.fyi/t/software-engineer/locations/warsaw-pol).

Countries like the UK and Switzerland have jobs with significantly higher salaries yet the income tax rates aren't very high. Still, most cities in the UK seem to lack housing (I've lived a few countries and apartment hunting abroad was always a nightmare. So, I'd rather avoid cities with very few houses). Switzerland doesn't have many jobs.

Countries like Germany, Austria, and Nordic countries have high salaries. Also, these countries probably have better overall living standards (Buildings are more modern, public health service is better, WLB is generally good etc). Still, the income tax rates in those countries seem too high (...at least for me). 

Countries like Bulgaria and Romain have lower tax rates & COL too, so you could earn and save a lot by working remotely for a US company as a contractor. However, I'm a non-EU citizen, so I can't do the same until I get a permanent visa. Also, the living standards there don't seem very good (No offense to Bulgarians and Romanians).

Poland may not offer the best overall living standards (e.g. Public health service, public transportation, infrastructure) in the EU. Nonetheless, considering the job chances, tax, housing and COL, I feel that Poland is the best country to maximize your saving potential as a non-EU citizen. What do you think? Is there a better EU country/city to achieve FIRE (early retirement) as a non-EU SWE?",2023-10-27 14:16:28
15ge79q,I'm thinking about quitting software engineer,"Hi y'all!

Very quick background: I'm almost 26 years old. I have a BS degree. I started working in 2017 as a DevOps Engineer and continued to do so. My skills are mainly back-end java, go, spring boot, etc... Always worked in a microservice/hybrid architecture. My daily tools are Java EE, Go, AWS, digitalocean, kubernetes, docker, etc... I also work sometimes on front-end, which I know very well, expect for frameworks like React, Vue, etc... I also published some mobile apps, which one of them is a mobile game made in C++ and OpenGL, which has been downloaded more than 10k times. I have also a personal blog where I write mostly about back-end/cloud development, so I can give recruiters some insights about my job. I have been also on-call employee and for some years I have been a contractor.

Now, I live in Italy where salaries are very low. I also tried to be a contractor, as I said before, but only for one major project which lasted almost one year, but clients are not willing to pay for software. I currently earn 27k gross per year, which is 1600 euros net per month where I live. In Italy we pay a lot for BASIC car insurance, highways, car tax, public free healthcare is only useful for critical surgeries (for example, you have to pay for dentist or any other specialist). I tried to get a new job, but no IT company is willing to pay more than 30-35k (which is 1800 net euros, by the way. It's near 200 net more per month... not a lot). I went to too much interview steps and hops, just enough to see skills-inflation and low wages. I really don't thing getting a MS or ABC certification is going to help me, since IT companies are always going to pay as less as they can.

I can't really afford all of this. The situation does NOT change if I moved to another country. Yes, some expenses would be lower, but I would pay a lot of rent to be in a shitty city, where your landlord negates you to own a pet or play a instrument. Also taxes are generally high everywhere in Western Europe.

IT companies are requiring A LOT OF SKILLS (skills-inflation) are salaries are going backwards. I don't see all these people earning six figures.

I'm thinking about quitting software engineering and starting studying for an entire different field, such as surgeon or something like that.

What do you advise me to do? Thanks in advance!",2023-08-02 16:55:29
149hz58,Pursue a career in the EU or the US?,"Hey folks, I'm about to make a big decision and was hoping to get some advice from more experienced colleagues.

About me:24, Bachelor’s degree in CS, 3 years of experience

My situation:I'm from a third-world country and got two offers offering a relocation to either US or Germany. The offer from Germany seems to be much better - permanent contract, \~107k (base+bonus), 30 days of vacation, full WFH from any place in the country, and a ton of benefits. Offer from the US - H1B with promised PERM sponsorship, 100k, relocation to Chicago required. Base benefits like 7 vacation days and medical insurance.

I understand that I'm immensely lucky to get these offers given my experience, but I'm really struggling with which one to take.

The offer from Germany is great and it seems like life would be much easier here compared to the US. But it also seems like I will be stuck with my company and technical stack for a really long time, as the market here is relatively small, and I'm highly unlikely to get an offer similar to this one in years to come, especially if I would like to change my stack.

The US is the opposite, while the offer itself is good, it's incomparable to the German one(especially given how pricey Chicago is compared to pretty much any city in Germany), but the market is much bigger and there should be a lot of career opportunities once the market is back on its feet.

Have anyone here faced a similar choice? What would you recommend? Maybe I'm missing some crucial piece of the picture here?

I'm a data scientist with 6 YOE living in Spain. I've read several times here that if you really want to make good money, you should look for remote jobs in the USA or (maybe easier) in EU countries where companies actually pay well.

I thought that the inconvenient part of this was that you needed to register as self-employed (autónomos in Spain) and send invoices to your company to get paid (losing many rights that company workers have). However, today I've learnt of umbrella companies that make you a full-time contract with all the rights associated to it and manages all the invoicing stuff with your real company, which seems so convenient.

My questions are, has anyone had some experience working this way? Is it as convenient as it seems or does it have any drawbacks? And most importantly, how do you find those kinds of jobs?

1398sl6,A CV like a big block of swiss cheese: Struggling with Data Science/Machine Learning Job Applications,"Edit: I'm in west Germany.

This story is about not paying attention to the important things for 5 years.

I've been struggling with my job applications for data science/machine learning roles for the past five months. And I'm perceived by the recruiters in a Schrodinger's state of either having five years of experience or none at all, which leads me to think there's something very wrong in my presentation. 

Despite sending over 50 applications, most were serious ones with personalized cover letters and LinkedIn messages, I've only interviewed with three of them, and none of these interviews led to a job offer.

I always asked for feedback about the applications, and I now have a clearer picture of my situation: they are confused about my CV.


Before applying for data science/machine learning roles, I worked in Python development for academia for six years, where I worked on many projects that involved different data types and tools. However, my job title was simply ""researcher"" for all these years. I was the ""tech implementor"" for a research group with a wide variety of mobility research projects. There were other tech people in the department but I was the only one in my team. I had to leave for bureaucratic reasons at the beginning of the year and decided to find a job in the industry. 

Unfortunately, then I realized that I lacked many basics required for a junior data science/machine learning job. For example, I hardly ever worked on a shared repo or done ""production"" code. Although I always had a successful working experiment for the research with accurate and validated results.  And now I feel unsure where to learn these missing basics.

I have a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and a master's degree in medical data science (a glorified degree in Jupyter Notebooks). What was attractive about me for supervisors was that I can jump into a new project and understand what's happening quickly and start providing valuable contributions. On the other side, I only recently learned what type hints in python are, and I don't know how my code survived for years without this knowledge.
Another example: I was the lead on a project successfully managing a team of web developers for a mobility project for a year, but I never learned how to write a simple CI/CD pipeline.

Most of my knowledge was self-taught through trial and error, and my supervisors throughout the years needed the job done quick with results while they lacked a software development background to have a critical eye.

As a result of all of this, I now feel unable to present myself consistently, and I think this confusion is definitely showing in my applications, and setting the bar too high or too low for myself while applying.

For some things I lake basic knowledge that a second year CS student knows, while at the same time I have projects on my CV that are always impressive in interviews (e.g. online machine learning system for predicting driver reaction on top of a VR and eye tracking system while driving a virtual car) .

I feel it's too late to go back to college, but I have nothing else that I know how to do. Is it hopeless? Any advice on what to do? Are the holes fillable?

13qzsxo,Job hunt experience as a New Grad,"I want to tell you guys how my job hunt in Germany has been to share some experience to the people in similar situations.

Here a [Sankey](https://imgur.com/a/p43Kkx0) showing the stats.

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in computer science and I am in my final semester. Although I will not graduate until around October, I have already started my job search and I believe I have achieved good results so far. Despite the late start date, I haven't encountered any problems. I don't have full-time work experience yet, but during my 6 years of study, I have worked for 5 years as a student assistant/working student as a software developer, which has definitely helped me in the application process.

I found most of the job offers through LinkedIn, with only a handful coming from other job search portals. For the most part, I applied with just a resume and any relevant work or academic certificates. I did not write a cover letter for any of my applications. Except for one interview in the third round, all the interviews were conducted online.

The typical application process went as follows:

1st round: Introduction of my resume, exchange of questions regarding myself and the company.
2nd round: Technical interview.
3rd round: Offer, or a conversation with a manager and then an offer.

I mainly applied for full remote positions or positions in my local area. I live in a major city in Eastern Germany, but it is still kind of LCOL. The entry-level salaries offered to me were all in the range of 50k - 58k, including all bonuses and special payments. In the end, I chose the offer with the highest compensation, which is also fully remote and in the automotive industry with main office in Munich.

I'm now curious: What are your experiences with job searching when entering the workforce? Overall, I found my application process relatively relaxed, but I can also imagine that I was in a relatively privileged position due to the circumstances. As an example reading about experiences of people from the US, I am glad to be in the position I am.",2023-05-24 22:23:25

13a0fuw,Do you network and if so how?,"I'm in my 2nd year of my career and been afraid of this uncertainty in the industry. I keep reading and hearing (from my uni days actually) that to increase your chances of getting a job you need to network. But how do you actually do it? I work remote (go to the office only like once a month) and my team members also do the same, and so we are not really close with each other. I don't really have many friends outside of work, just my uni mates (who works outside of CS) and some church friends. I got this current job by LinkedIn, and honestly it's the only way I know to get new opportunities.

Do you guys network and if so how? And how do you maintain the relationship so that it's not just ""I scratch your back and you scratch mine"" kind of relationship, but a genuine connection helping each other honestly?

In my home country dozen if not hundred of agencies started up with this business model. Find US/EU client, hire IT staff and lease them to the client. This became possible due to lower living standards and especially cheap labor. But in EU the labor is not that cheap. So what's the catch?

18e46gq,Dropping PhD in AI or not?,"I'm currently 1/3 through my PhD in AI, but I'm contemplating leaving due to the toll it's taking on my mental health. I like the topic of my research, but I have zero interest in teaching or publishing papers, people around me are always stressed, and the bureaucracy is crazy. The idea that our papers should maybe find an application in the real world is also a foreign concept to everybody, which makes me depressed. We are doing everything for the conferences. Obviously, I have huge respect for all the researchers who are going to them but... I simply don't care.  
I'm sure I'd be happier by working in the industry in a better environment and with a (far) better pay.  
I already know that I'm not going to work in academia in the future, but I haven't dropped the PhD yet because I feel the title might help me score a high-profile job with FAANG down the line...

Im aware a requeriment for Swiss companies is to process their data in the country, so if we take a look of the region openings there :

GCP (2019), Azure (2019), AWS (2022)

1437d7g,Senior devs/tech leads: how much do you have to be available outside hours?,"Long story short, my company is shoving on-call rotations down our throats, even though I was clear about wanting to keep a healthy work life balance when I interviewed 

This is a tiered system where I’d be the first point of contact for L3 support calls periodically, and I’d need to be on standby at most other times. It’s paid, but only for the on-call week and IMO not enough to justify the downgrade in quality of life

The problem is, I’m 90% sure my manager will say it’s a responsibility that comes with the job, and that’s an argument I’ve heard before. But reading other subs it doesn’t seem to be as widespread as they make it out to be, so I’d like some unbiased opinion 

I’m okay with doing the _occasional_ overtime and helping others when shit hits the fan, but this kind of formal, contractual obligation with tight metrics where I get up at night just to hit a “restart” button and I’m monitored by how fast I wake up is too much for me

So how much of a career-limiting move would it be to decline the request?

About me: my job title is senior software engineer, I have 10 years exp. I have experience even as principal engineer but I’m new in this company. All others in the rotation have equal or better understanding of the system than I do. 

Payment will be a suspiciously still-unspecified amount for the week, + an hourly pay for calls. When on standby, there’s no base compensation and just the hourly pay",2023-06-07 08:25:02
13ttozm,Just switched jobs to a highly technical SWE position I dreamed of and now I'm struggling to learn the stack,"Hi all!

I'm in the EU, around 2 YOE (years of experience). I recently accepted a new full time SWE job offer at a nice company - really cool tech, lovely people, nice salary. I honestly love it here. I'm excited about the technology and how it helps others and I adore my colleagues.

I'm just around the two month mark at my new place. I'm getting a lot of help from people around me to learn the tech - as soon as I ask someone has jumped in a meeting with me to explain/discuss my questions. I feel I'm getting the best conditions to learn. And yet I'm struggling. 

The stack is completely new to me, the code base is large and very detailed and concerns complex programming areas that are challenging. I love that it's hard because it's personally simulating. But I'm also starting to feel worried. I'm no where near being able to contribute to the stack by myself without ample aid from senior developers. Everyone of my colleagues had experience in this specific area from before (I didn't) and works autonomously easily. I'm so excited to go to work in the mornings and hang out with colleagues/learn but I'm worried that me having fun and being excited isn't enough. We recently had mass layoffs, and at 2 months I haven't yet passed probation so my position isn't *super* secure. 

I may just be overthinking it, but thoughts have popped into my head that I should maybe put a lid on my excitement to at least give a more professional appearance or something  ... It sounds so stupid and sad now that I write that out, is it ever desirable to do that?

I'm also very open when I don't understand things/aspects (even when these may be basic) and will say often immediately that ""I don't know/I don't understand this/this feels hard for me to understand"". I do that because often someone will fill me in then, explain a bit of what I'm missing, and I will learn quickly (rather than googling on my own). But I rarely hear my colleagues say this - maybe because they're so experienced - but I say it so often. I was thinking that maybe I should stop being so vocal about my gaps of knowledge to at least appear more competent? I've always thought it was healthy to be open about knowledge gaps, but corporate software jobs are quite new to me and I feel like I don't know the social rules well yet. It feels sad/counterproductive to even consider hiding excitement and not being open about where my knowledge is at, I think I may be thinking about this too much. I wouldn't want others to hide their questions or excitement with me. I don't know. I'm sorry if this is rambly. 

Has anyone here been in a similar position? Or in the position of the experienced seeing other people struggle like I do? What did you think then, what are your tips? Should those of us in my position be worried when we're struggling like this or should we just keep going and eventually it often sorts itself out/our knowledge grows with practise? Mind you, none of my colleagues have said anything to make me think I should worry yet.

How do you placate your
own worries when you feel like you're not as cool/you're not contributing at all as much as others? 

Thanks for all input in advance! I just want to stay with my lovely team and continue to learn here.",2023-05-28 06:55:54
13so7ox,No promotions after going above and beyond current role - how to decline more responsibilities in a polite way?,"I'm a L2 Engineer in an startup, and this week I had a performance review where I got an excellent rating after working there for 1 year. My manager, who is leaving the company in 3 months, said pretty much like:  
you're doing a great job, and we wanted to promote you, but because some other colleagues are underpaid, we had to use the budget to give them raises. With me leaving you'll be able to take (even) more responsibilities, and you'll for sure be an obvious promotion on the next review (for your new manager)  
This affected me greatly, because I wanted to invest myself more into the company, but now feel completely uninterested in my tasks, and even had to take the rest of the week off to figure out what to do. I hate this corporate talk, and I'm already looking for a new job. But in meanwhile, I would like to step down from all the extra responsibilities I had previous taken, and also reject the new ones being given to me.

12rqll0,(UK) I just had a technical test that I'm sure I failed and probably not getting the job. I'm so tired of them.,"First interview was on Zoom and it went great.

I secured a new job just before lockdown happened in Feb 2020 working for a small (around 80 employees) entertainment company. I was an engineer and worked there for 2 years. This company used System A so I put that on my CV.

I got a new job last February 2022 (large company with over 5k employees) as an engineer and it's been a ride. They use System A, but it's a completely different version. I mean, it's easy enough to learn, but I learned real fast that not all companies do coding the same.

So today I get to the interview and I feel like I nailed the oral speaking questions. I had to take a 90 minute technical test after. Some of the questions were multiple choice, some were short essay, and some were actual hands on coding. My biggest problem is the company uses System A, but it's again completely different version to my last 2 companies. They asked me how I would do X and I told the guy and he seemed shocked as if they do it a completely different way to my current company. I'm like well at my current role this is how we code X or sometimes we'll just have a script run and do code for things. This test had me figuring out how to do things in a way I don't know. I felt humbled real fast. This was way too hard. I feel confident in my abilities, but it's clear that I would need to learn how they do things and they clearly don't want to train someone.

For the past four years or so I've been doing a mix of junior work and what my current work calls us is above junior.

I felt really stupid when taking that technical test. I felt frustrated. Like all my experience meant nothing. I regretted even going to the interview and thought maybe I should just apply for basic admin jobs to get rid of my stress. Maybe I want to leave tech behind me.

What do you guys think? How do I avoid this embarrassment in the future? I called out of work for this",2023-04-19 11:50:41

currently I'm still pursuing my Bachelor's degree in CS in Germany, and this upcoming next semester will be my 11th semester.

With the language barrier and the subject itself I did have some trouble during the early semesters, but I managed to survive until now.

I've also been working part time (Werkstudent) in a small start up company as a software developer for almost 2 years now.

\- I live with family so I save 80% of my salary (I'm trying to save a bit before moving to the US and finding a job there). Currently, I have 20k USD in savings.  
\- Have to move to the US in 2 years due to marriage so I am concerned about my growth until then as I hear a lot about how competitive the US market is

16oyiyn,Grappling with the sunk-cost fallacy by hopping across the pond.,"The EU vs. US debate is nothing new on this sub. I too had this question ever since I moved to Germany from South Asia some 5 years ago. Studied at the best German uni and worked as an SDE in Munich afterwards. But finally decided to bite the bullet and go for another masters in the US just to be able to access the US SWE job market afterwards. Professors, friends, colleagues, family, not a single person agreed with my decision but I stuck to it. The only people who actually encouraged me were my friends who were already working in the US. I believe most people fall victim to the sunk-cost fallacy whereby they think that moving is no longer worth it since they have already invested so much in their respective job market (especially for a South Asian like me for whom the EU passport would have been a big deal).

But I also find that these same people usually have little to no clue about the opportunity cost of just staying put -- the difference in compensation is simply TOO BIG! The difference in WLB is negligible unless you work for a select few employers like Amazon. Health insurance isn't relevant since all Big Tech cover that for you anyway. Taxes are almost half while compensation is double to triple for the median developer. Safety concerns are overrated (you are more likely to die crossing the road than by a mass shooter). Overall, I believe the QoL (which includes compensation) is much higher for Engineers in the US than in the EU. ~~This INCLUDES countries like Swiss, because even if the compensation is comparable the wealth tax in Swiss would eat into your savings in the long run (more so even than the ludicrous income tax in places like Germany).~~ After discussion with a commenter, I concede that Swiss might be a singular exception in the EU with comparable QoL to the US.

For those SWEs who would like to move to the US in hopes of a better QoL, I suggest you move by hook or by crook. Two approaches are relatively straightforward:

1. Go back to school in the US. Costs should not be a huge problem for a CS major because the opportunities for a GRA/GTA are plentiful. And even if you don't get a GRA/GTA, you can easily make back the costs within two years of graduating. It's a no-brainer investment.
2. Move to Canada, get their passport within 4 years then move to the US.

Not doing so would mean leaving money (or even QoL) on the table.

Hope this helps those who are just as confused as I was about 5 years ago.

Cheers!

Edit1: Moving to Canada might not be the best move. Corrected my suggestions.

Edit2: A lot of people seem to think that a L1 visa (transferring internally to the US) is the way to go. I disagree for a number of reasons:

1. People seem to underestimate internal transfers via L1 let alone getting into FAANG in the EU. I know several of my friends working for US employers in Germany (and Europe in general) who have been trying to transfer internally but to no avail. The only person who I have come across that was able to do it was a guy from Meta. But I know several at Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Spotify, Intel who haven't been able to do it even after 3+ years at the company. Also (just a personal opinion) getting into FAANG is much more difficult in the EU than in the US since the number of openings simply aren't as many and every person and their grandma is applying.
2. ~~Suppose you do get the L1, even then you have to go through the H1B route to get to the Greencard. In which case you will actually have significantly lower odds to make the lottery compared to a Masters+ graduate from the US.~~ A commenter corrected me that going through the H1B for a Greencard is not necessary for a L1 holder.
3. Waiting around in the EU to get lucky by first landing FAANG and then landing the L1 is not as good a strategy as straight up going for Masters. In the later scenario you bound your time to the US job market by 2 years, in the other you might very well be waiting forever.

Edit3: Ignore Edit1. There was some confusion based on a comment on here. Apologies.

157cuup,Google Poland,"Recently I was invited to a tech interview with Google Poland for a frontend position (although there seems to be something weird with it because the recruiter said frontend engineer and then another recruiter said Google Cloud SWE). 

Thinking about grinding a leet code for an interview makes me miserable, but I am curious if it's worth it. Currently, I know myself well enough to know that I don't want to work overtime, especially not weekends, I don't want to be micromanaged or compete with other devs over the tickets.

12hhytk,How to find a job and survive with chronic illness,"Hello everyone! I’m a 25 y.o. student in my last semester of a CS bachelor’s degree. I suffer from myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), and I’m worried about my future. There’s no way for me to get on disability, I live in a second world country, I have a toxic family I can’t live with, no savings and little energy. I’m able to work for about 6 hours a day maximum with small breaks and, if I overdo I suffer the next day. 

My energy envelope is pretty limited, I’d say I have about 65% of the energy of a healthy person. If I push myself and, often it’s hard to stop, I get flu-like symptoms and headache for the entire next day or two. 
I try my best to practice my skills when I have time and energy. 

My university isn’t that good, so going to classes was mostly a waste of time, then coming home and taking care of the chores and homework would leave me exhausted. I had very little opportunities to practice programming and get job-ready. I know HTML, CSS, basic Python and some Java, Linux and Bash, recently started learning JavaScript. I’m mostly interested in Data engineering since I like Linux-based systems and Python. I’m also a creative person and was thinking of getting into UI/UX but it seems there are fewer jobs in this. 

What would be the most energy-efficient way for me to get job ready? I’m currently focusing on my bachelor’s thesis and then final exams. Is there any career path within CS that’d be more accommodating for me? It’d also be nice to chat with someone to support each other through the obstacles. I’d appreciate your experiences and advice",2023-04-10 12:54:26

117j935,Moving out of FAANG - how important are individual language/tooling skills?,"I've been in a FAANG company for 3.5 years doing hybrid DevOps/SWE work. I drift from team to team helping them out with reliability problems and the tech stacks can vary wildly, and the work I do for them varies wildly too.

This was my first job out of university so I know nothing else about the industry at large, and im concerned about how portable my skills would be to another company. While I have experience with quite a few languages, frameworks, tools... I wouldn't say im very proficient in any of them. I would in fact say im more a config engineer than software developer.

As an example i've worked with a C++ codebase for the last 2 years but maybe written <1000 lines and it was mostly bug and perf fixes. The majority of my work for them has been server reliability and alerting improvements. 

To add to this we use almost no industry standard tools/frameworks. I've never touched Terraform/AWS/Chef/Docker/etc. and in fact I haven't heard of [90% of these tools](https://katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-tools) before in my life. Its ALL proprietary. So my questions are:

1. Has as anyone moved away from FAANG to a role as a traditional SWE/DevOps at a small or large EU company? How big a deal was your lack of experience with industry standard tooling vs internal tooling?

2. So many of these job postings are for people with very specialized experience, is there a space for someone like me who is more of a jack of all trades archetype?",2023-02-20 20:15:14
193j2v5,Three monthes into the job and my motivation is out,"Hello, I am only three monthes into my new job as a junior and my motivation is completely out. Like completely.

In those 3 monthes, I only did some HTML & CSS, because the task that I was assigned was to redesign et make responsive some projects.

I managed to finish 2 projects but the third one is like the two that I did, and it's starting to be very exausting mentally.

No version controlling.  
I am working on the production server via SFTP.  
The variables doesn't mean anything.  
The indentation is kind of disastrous without the shortcut of VS Code to re-indent automatically it would be like that and I am not evene talking about HTML :

    if(condition)
        {
            //stuff
        }
    else 
        {
            //stuff
        }

 The databases doesn't have any foreign key.  
The queries to the databases are not parametered, what they are doing is simply remove all the < ' > of each input.  
The logic is deeply nested into the view.  
And some stuff that I probably missed.  


This code base hasn't been refactored or touched since 10 years and everything is awfull. It would need a complete rewrite. But I don't have a lot of years of experience behind me to back me up and I am sure that my manager wouldn't listen to me. I tried to ask him why he wouldn't use parameters while querying the database and his answer was non-sense : ""Like that I can prevent XSS"". Yeah sure, because everybody use htmlspecialchars to insert into the db and it's not like you could use it as well with some propers parameters.

What can I tell ? Or do I just suffer through and wait to gain more experience (experience only by time, because I wouldn't learn anything there in terms of dev).

And I am tired, I didn't do a single thing since 3 days, I only look at the code and I am asking myself : Where the fuck do I start ?

By the way here's what the code looks like : https://i.imgur.com/9wd9QXl.png",2024-01-10 21:02:18
17tpy28,"I made a mistake in specializing in Embedded AI, what to do now?","Hi everyone,

this is my first post on this subreddit (and on Reddit in general). I like reading about other people's ambitions and goals, but don't really like sharing much myself. However, I feel I am struggling to find my own path in this field, and I need some objective perspectives from the outside...

Here goes my story (If you are not interested in reading another burnt-out guy in CS, just skip to TL;DR).

To give you some context, I graduated in biomedical engineering (specialized in computer science and electronics), from a well-known university in Milan, Italy. Since the beginning of my MSc, I knew I wanted to be a programmer rather than a scientist, and chose as many CS courses as I could find. However, since I really liked many topics, I ended up specializing in Embedded Systems and AI (ML, DL, RL, you name it), believing this would give me an edge in roles where both disciplines would be needed.

After managing to find the only thesis supervisor who allowed me to research deep learning methods for denoising EEG signals in real-time Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems running on novel Low-powered architecture MCU (what a mouthful!), I was hired by the startup I was collaborating with for this thesis. I was stoked! Not only I was able to get my first gig as a programmer (given that I started my journey as a biomedical engineer) but I was also able to make use of my knowledge of Embedded Systems and AI! Too good to be true? Unfortunately, yes. Aside from major problems with the CTO coming up with insane ideas (not in a good way), my real problem with this company was that most of the time I was there it seemed that I was going nowhere since, aside from a junior colleague hired with me, I was the only embedded guy. Other people were just collecting data, writing pointless Python Jupyter notebooks, and going nowhere near having an actual product. So I decided to leave.

After casually looking at Embedded AI positions, I found a big semiconductor company looking exactly for my profile, and my excitement for the field reignited! After many interviews, I was hired. It was great, I was no longer in a small reality, rather now my clients are big names in the consumer market (smartphones, laptops). At first, understandably, I was doing some filler jobs for some other people in the team for unrelated stuff (testing GUIs, writing get-started examples for HW products, script automation, etc...) while I was waiting for the first real big project to put me on. This, however, lasted almost a year, but I was still grateful for the job opportunity, so I didn't express my dissatisfaction yet. The first big project came up, finally! However, it was a total marketing BS on an AI product that only existed for supporting a product from my division, but what was required of me were just my Python skills (by now since it is the only thing I am doing, I am pretty good at). I am pretty much in charge of this part of the tool, nobody cares for it, if it works, if it performs well, nor if anyone will ever use it, as I said, just marketing.

By now, I couldn't care less for the company, and I decided to speak up to my manager telling him that what I wanted to do was embedded stuff and that I felt miserable doing Python scripting for some useless product. He reassured me that when something new embedded-related comes up he will assign it to me, but I don't believe him anymore, since the filler jobs also should have lasted a couple of months maximum when he first told me. As you can hear from this story, I feel pretty burned out at this point and ready to move on to the next chapter of my career with (hopefully) less corporate BS and return to having fun again.

During all this time, however, I managed to reserve time to study, get additional certifications, and do some low-level SW projects, which I really enjoyed! But, I am now convinced that I need to specialize in one field only and leave the niche in order to have better job opportunities. Also, remote jobs would just be a dream come true! Since for now, I am forced to go working 3 days a week in office.

TL;DR

So, I am at a crossroads now, I feel I am confident in both low-level C stuff, and deep learning in Python (mainly for image / time series classification tasks). Should I stick with AI and maybe move to a more performance-oriented field like computer vision (maybe requiring C++, I would rather not do any more Python for production... ), or should I specialize in writing firmware for MCUs for a company developing actual products (i.e., not a semiconductor vendor) ?

By now, in terms of what I enjoy most, I think I just want to write software while caring about performance and memory management, so either options are ok for me, I would like to know your opinions on what career path offers more opportunities and what can be accessible to me given my background.

Thank you all in advance.",2023-11-12 18:11:48
17j7ohb,[Germany] I am getting promoted from Junior. How much salary increase can I expect or ask?,"I just had feedback round with my manager last week and he said that due that I am becoming the main responsible person for development pipeline and landscape, I will get a promotion. I have been working in this company for almost 2 years now. This is my second company so my total YoE is around 3.5 years. My role in this company is more into DevOps with some technology like Jenkins, Github Actions, Kubernetes, Cloud, etc with 3-4 programming languages thrown in between.  

The first time I joined this company I had TC of 60k Euro and right after my probation I asked for a raise and they gave me an additional 5k Euro yearly. So with my current TC of 65k Euro, how much of a raise should I expect? Is asking 78k too high for just removing ""Junior"" from my title?

17a4ejn,Ageism and stereotyping?,"I was browsing a glassdoor page for a company I was interesting to work in as a junior engineer, and every other page has at least a review that puts emphasis on how awesome and informal is the culture is. So far it sounds great because that's more or less the culture we have in my current company.

But then they go ""informal due to young people, but naturally inclusive"", ""lots of young enthusiastic people"", ""pros: low age average"".

I'm literally what the actual hell? I won't even deny that it's great that they're inclusive but why the hell is the low age average a pro? Do fellow developers also hate me for being old? And how can you claim that you're inclusive but at the same time be biased to hire young people? 

Am I crazy?",2023-10-17 17:59:37
1718yp3,Evaluating Swiss offer from DE,"Hey folks, curious about your opinion on an offer I have gotten in Switzerland. I am personall close to accepting it, but wanted to hear some thoughts from people working in CH or having moved DE -> CH.

Me: around 4 YOE, SWE, live and work in Munich, 75k gross salary for a mid-level position + 10k/y paper equity (not a public company), EU citizen (not from DE though), I can speak German.

Company in CH is pretty close to the German border, I'd get 120k CHF salary for a Full Stack position and that's it. That would amount to almost doubling my net salary, a bit less after factoring in health insurance. Job seems quite good and company is legit, also it's a Senior position. It is not a big city, so living costs don't seem super high at a first glance and shopping in DE would be very easy. According to Reddit and some other online sources, 120k CHF seems a pretty decent salary also for Zürich city, so it does seem like a good offer to me.

I like both German and Swiss culture, but I've been getting very tired of German taxes and social contributions, it seems pointless to me to fight for e.g. a 10k increase when after taxes what arrives in my pocket is less than half of that amount. Hence I'm decided I'm quite done with Germany, as those contributions are only going up every year without me really getting anything out of those, and as a foreigner I don't even have family here which could make me think, at least I pay tax so that my parents can get a pension or smth.

From what I can see online in CH these taxes and contibutions are much lower and overall seems to me that the saving rate is much higher, after also taking into account how much more expensive Germany has gotten in the recent years. So I'm probably going to take the offer.

What's your thoughts? Anything that I might be missing/might be wrong at? (just asking from a money POV here honestly, the social side of moving somewhere else I've already got figured out)",2023-10-06 10:40:24
16p8ksq,Quitting a job after 3 months,"I joined this startup approximately three months ago, following a job at a FAANG company. Unfortunately, my experience here has been quite stressful due to the toxic behavior exhibited by our CTO. To provide some context, I am a backend developer with nearly six years of professional experience. Throughout my career, I've worked with various companies, but I've never stayed at one for more than two years. This pattern emerged because I initially began with a modest salary and resorted to changing jobs as the primary means to secure salary increases.

However, when I decided to join this particular company, I had a genuine interest in remaining with them for a more extended period. I was keen on delving into the startup world and acquiring as much knowledge as possible. Regrettably, the reality has been quite different. Initially, the company promised three days of remote work per week, but later reneged, offering only one day of remote work. Additionally, our CTO incessantly monitors my activity when I'm working remotely, going as far as checking my Slack status for inactivity, even if it's just for a brief period. He also maintains a frequent checking schedule, typically every two hours, despite the fact that the tasks I'm handling are quite challenging, involving tasks such as code refactoring and improving our AWS infrastructure.

Furthermore, there was an incident where the CTO addressed me in a condescending manner over a missed comment on a pull request. This constant scrutiny and demeaning behavior have taken a significant toll on my mental well-being, causing considerable stress. I'm currently contemplating resigning from my position; however, I'm concerned about the impact it might have on my resume, especially considering that I've only been here for three months, and the job market is currently experiencing a slowdown. 

I would greatly appreciate any advice you could offer on this matter. Thank you in advance.",2023-09-22 12:07:35
16dbznp,Am I being underpaid in Berlin?,"I have a total of six years of part-time + internship software development experience (I have been working throughout my university and school in a professional capacity and was also providing independent consulting services to different clients).

Data scientist/ML engineer with 4 YoE. Academic background in mathematics and machine learning. Learned programming along the way, not the best but I get by.  
  
Stayed at the same company since I graduated and got promoted after 3 years from Junior to Associate.  
I'm trying to save as much money as possible, and that starts by earning more.  
  
I, based in Paris, currently make 75k€ gross/annually + 5% to 15% annual bonus. Without the bonus, my take at home monthly salary after taxes is about 4100€, whereas my monthly spending is around 1600€ while living frugally.  
  
I tried looking for a new job, as people seem to say it's the best way to increase salaries, but I have had no luck so far. Applied to about 50 openings in Paris, most were offering a total package of 60-65k gross, which is lower than at least 10k what I'm currently making.  
  
Should my next step be outside of France ? What country would you recommend ? How hard is it to find work as a non nationals ? I can only speak French and English.

14imuhz,Changing jobs too often,"From a CV perspective, how often is too often to change jobs?

Bit of background, did a year or so at my first job, around 18 months at my second, and am nearly at a year into my current role.

Current company has ruled out pay increases across the business and the overall benefits package is pretty weak. Apart from that, the work is interesting, I'm still learning, and have opportunities to take on big pieces of work, which I know is all good stuff. 

I like to keep my finger on the pulse with LinkedIn and while the market isn't super hot at the moment there are quite a few roles up that would take me from my current TC of 75K up to 90K and even into six figures plus bonuses and better benefits.

If I start pursuing a new role at around the 18 month mark, which is still 8+ months away, do you think that would raise any alarms from a hiring managers perspective?

I'm of the opinion that I am as well jump ship often early in my career to maximise my earning potential. But not sure if this is wise in the current UK market.",2023-06-25 13:53:17
13qhsg4,Would you move?,"I live in Berlin for almost two years now, unfortunately for the job I would like to do I need a fluent German (B2 at least) and without it I won't be able to progress. I have a job offer in London for the role I would like to do which is 125k Pound total compensation (105k base + 20k performance bonus) and some 50k Rsus divided for 4 years and I'm considering to move.

I have been to London several times and always like it as a city, but I'm not sure whether it's easy to make new friends there. I don't like Berlin as a city or most of a night life here as it revolves around techno and drugs, but I found here two groups of friends (mostly expats) with whom even these parties could be fun and going out is worthwile. Additionaly, I understand that apartments in London are worse and much more expensive than in Berlin.

So from one side for the career I think it would be better to move, but I'm not sure that it would be easy to get to know new people in London I also heard many bad things about work life balance in London. How true is that?

Another option is to stay in Berlin, get less money like around 90k - 95k euro, improve my German until B2 level like really fluent...I think it's possible in the framework of 2 years. And then try to find a role I want in Berlin.

12qgg8b,[HELP] Our DEI Goals Challenging the Hiring of Skilled Developers,"First, let me clarify that I strongly support diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. However, I want to share an experience highlighting potential challenges in achieving such goals.

In 2020, our company set a DEI target to achieve a 50% female and 50% male workforce. This changed in 2021 to a 45-45-10 distribution (female-male-trans+others). Additionally, there are hiring goals related to ethnicities. Without delving into specifics, our objective is to reduce the percentage of white employees from 74% (as of January 2023) to 70% by the end of 2023.

As a developer, I recently collaborated with my manager to conduct interviews for a lead developer position. We identified three strong candidates and chose one. However, when we submitted their resume to HR, we were informed that the candidate could not be hired due to our DEI targets. They also told us that we're huge outliers contributing to the DEI target as our team of nine currently includes eight white males and one white female. This individual was a white male in his late 30s. We inquired about our second choice, who was also a white male, but he was rejected for the same reason.

This situation is frustrating because the candidates we selected had the qualifications and personality traits we sought, but HR is effectively blocking our hiring requests.  The biggest facepalm was that we congratulated our first pick, as he was brilliant and clearly understood the requirements.

The dilemma we face is whether we should hire a less-qualified candidate to meet our DEI targets or wait for an underrepresented candidate with the necessary skills to become available. To be honest, we don't know how long we can afford to wait, as we need to fill this position as soon as possible.",2023-04-18 08:48:29
12ezz8e,Job offer with visa sponsorship: UK or NL?,"I have been offered a job by a company that provides visa sponsorship for either the UK or NL. The gross salary for both options is similar, with the UK offering 75k GBP (4,379 GBP net) and NL offering 86k Euros (5,678 Euros net with the 30% ruling benefit). As I will be moving to this new country alone, I prefer to live in a big city where I can interact with other expats in English, ideally near London or Amsterdam.

After considering both options, I am more inclined to move to Amsterdam as it appeals to me more. Besides, the visa expenses for the company are also lower NL, and they are offering a relocation package in this case. Additionally, I only need to work with them for 12 months to avoid any visa repayment fines, compared to 3 years in the case of the UK (without any relocation package option). While I don't intend to switch jobs after the first year, I am hesitant about the idea of having to pay a fine if I end up staying working for the company from the UK for less than 3 years. Furthermore, I am not interested in working for a FAANG company in the future.

116k5pz,Really low self-confidence about returning to developer career after 18 month career break as SAHM. Any advice?,"I'm a software engineer who has been a SAHM since August 2021. I had to take a career break because childcare was eating up my entire income. I literally couldn't afford to work whilst my kids were so young.

Now my eldest is at school and my youngest gets 3 mornings of funded nursery. Also COL has skyrocketed in the UK, so I am desperate to get back to work!

 Prior to quitting I worked as a software engineer for 5 years at a company. However the tech stack was highly proprietary and so nobody has heard of it. It doesn't look good on paper at all.

Whilst I've been on my break I've tried to pick up Web Dev, but as a full time SAHM it's slow going. I'm just about to get stuck into React, and am pretty decent in JavaScript now. 

However I'm really struggling with feeling unemployable because I don't fit the expectations of a typical developer. I have very limited free time to build a portfolio and apply for work. Nobody has heard of my previous tech stack and I can't really show examples of it. I have a significant gap in employment which is never a good look. That's not to mention the tech hiring bias (unconscious but obvious) because I am a middle aged woman with kids.

Most of the advice I have read online makes me feel like an outsider. The advice about career breaks is almost never aimed at tech careers. And the tech advice is clearly aimed at a younger, non-parent crowd. 

Can anyone offer me some advice to help me get back into my career?

Especially, what can I do to avoid feeling like all I should apply for are low paid entry level roles? 

I would love to hear from any other women who have been or are also in a similar position.",2023-02-19 18:30:07

16flhpq,Full stack developer salary in Germany,"Greetings.

I have been working as a Full stack developer in Germany in Neuss and my annual salary is 48k €. I am working in a small company. I have completed my masters in computer science here and have an experience of 2.5 years including internship (1 year internship and 1.5 years fulltime experience).

My manager is reluctant to increase the salary and I feel it's a super lowball and hence trying to make a move to another one. My skill set range from Python web development, JS/TS frameworks, Docker, AWS level 1 (we have private cloud so I studied this by myself to keep upto date), Kubernetes, MQTT, etc. As it is a small company, I had to do everything from talking to customers in a direct customer facing environment to managing their servers.

I aim to make a move, however I also think to go for Consultant roles but can't make it because I don't speak german (My CV is getting rejected from Big companies). So I am trying to aim for a better salary in SWE. How much should I expect with my skillset and experience as I am willing to move anywhere inside Germany? And if possible by any chance could anyone guide me how to make an entry into consultant roles?

Thanks you.

Edit: I made a switch and got an offer of 65k € in Dusseldorf. More importantly the work environment and challenges are great. Pretty happy with the switch. Thanks for the feedbacks, highly appreciated.

1ainmsy,Czech Repulic seems like a great place to work from as a remote Freelancer for Junior/Mid Level Devs,"Recently I was researching some places in the EU with low tax rates and came across the Czech Republic. It seems almost too good to be true tbh.

The TLDR of their tax system, to my current understanding, is this:

If you make under 2 million CZK (= 80k EUR) you can apply for a ""flat tax"". This flat tax includes income tax, social insurance and health insurance. The rates are:

\- Under 1.5mil CZK yearly income (=60k EUR): 3600 EUR **so only 6% tax rate** if you make the max 1.5mil CZK- 1.5-2mil CZK yearly income (= up to 80k EUR): 7680 EUR **so 9.6% tax rate** for 2mil CZK income

If you make more than 2mil CZK you will have to use their 60/40 model. Even then, it seems like the resulting tax rate will be fairly low. Here is the best article I found for more info [link](https://kancelarzp.cz/en/usefull-links-info/health-insurance-system-in-cz/).

Regarding VAT, it appears that while you don't have to pay any, you do have to make monthly VAT statements.

I really like how uncomplicated this tax system appears to be. On top of that, the cost of living in CZ is substantially lower than many other places. [Here](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Germany&country2=Czech+Republic&city1=Berlin&city2=Prague) is a comparison between Berlin, where I currently live, and Prague.

&#x200B;

My question: Do you think I'm missing something here, or is it really this straight forward? Also, are there any people here working as a freelancer from CZ who could comment on this?

I am actually seriously contemplating bringing this option up to my current employer. I am working a 90% remote job from Berlin with 2YOE and have been considering moving for a while now anyway. Prague would be a great place to live in.",2024-02-04 13:14:46

Salary range is wide 70-140k, let's take average 110k (consider many candidates earn less than that, because the higher salary the less candidates make it). It nets 87k depending on the location about 7.3 a month. Is it actually that much?

Considering you don't commute from a different country and don't want to live like a student (so comparing to what we can get in other countries).

Rent - up to 3k (most of those cheap rents you can find are not furnished and don't include utilities).

Other costs 2.4k while keeping the same lifestyle we can have in other countries (things like insurance is costly there).

So savings about 3k if you find very cheap rent and less than that if normal. You can make that in other locations too. And if you only want to go there to save you can also adjust your lifestyle in cheapier countries to save more and it's gonna be similar.

To be honest nature would be one of the main reasons for me to go there, but I know some consider it quite boring.

1447cch,Am I underpaid at 41000 annually in Munich as a self taught developer?,"Hi,

I finally managed to get a job a while back. It has been good so far. Everyone is really friendly. 40 hr/week.

But I notice the salaries that everyone discusses here about Germany and I feel I am earning a tad less that I'm supposed to...?

My plan is to hop after the 1 year mark, but maybe I could also ask for a raise at the end of the probation period?

Background: No degree, I have 3 months of experience (internship at a startup) as a programmer before i got hired. Many projects, have an android app on playstore too.

So am I underpaid for a self taught dev in Munich?

Thanks guys.",2023-06-08 12:01:27
140m7xf,Feeling lost as a software engineer,"I am software web developer with around 5 years of experience now. I worked on both frontend and backend using React.js and Node.js. Around 1.5 years back, I left my hometown for the first time and shifted to Germany from a 3rd world country in a company as a ""full-stack"" developer that uses Kotlin/Spring boot on the backend and React on frontend. I always planned to shift to a backend oriented developer as that is where my interest lies.

Due to personal crises circling around trying to make a new life, I had to put any personal learning on hold. And in the company I mostly work as a frontend engineer with backend work few and far between. I have tried communicating this with my manager but it always comes back to me not trying hard enough and that the company is doing all it can to accommodate me.

I have been trying to find another backend specific job with backend but I feel like I have done literally nothing in the last 1.5 years that can look good on a resume. And the few interviews I've had were a bust where I did not even get to a technical round and was told ""I'm not a good fit with regards to the technology we use"".

Honestly, at this point I have lost most of my self confidence and at work I feel no motivation to contribute or grow. I guess I'm just ranting and maybe looking for any advice/perspective from others who may have fallen into the same boat at some point.

TLDR; I want to transition into a backend oriented engineer but have been mostly working in frontend for the past 1.5 years and at this point feel unemployable.",2023-06-04 18:45:03

18u3f9g,What to do next as a meh junior software engineer ?,"Hello,

**Only read highlighted text if you do not have time to waste, please**

**I am 27** and I am trying to get back my life back on track as I wasted my whole early life.

Will work with a psychiatrist to get things going by solving my addictions and getting me to be able to focus on things. But I have questions concerning what I can do in tech with my background.

&#x200B;

I am pretty ambitious as I want to have as much influence as I can with my capacities and time left on Earth. I wish to see my vision of society being implemented as much as possible as I have a really big hard-on about justice but I am not going to delve much further about philosophy here as the text is already long enough.

But I have not much to show for even though I was blessed to live near a big city in Western Europe. What I am working with is :

* a meh **master degree's related to IT**
* **2 years of experience as a software engineer** on a pretty meh internal application in **Java/react using a custom private cloud developed by the company on an open source stack**. A bit annoyed as I feel like working on a big ball of mud and not learning much. I didn't quit as It was the best paid job I could find 2 years ago and the pressure is not very high. People at my job are nice so I am grateful.  But they are not interested into speaking about much else than holidays and entertainment as they all have families and social circles outside work. Pretty much set in their lives. I feel like an outsider and wasting my time. My wage increased by a measely 5% since I began working with the high inflation...
* I basically have **no social/professional network** to help me.
* Have a bit of money as I did not find way to spend it being alone and living at my parents since I felt it would have been wasted to use it on a rent to spend it being alone in an appartment as big as my room.
* **Probably average IQ, no special skills, no impressive projects yet so no pretentions about being anything special**, I will probably fail everything but hey I want to at least try something

&#x200B;

What I did in the last few months :

* Doing the **fundamental training courses** **for the first certifications of Azure/AWS** to get an idea about how public cloud providers work. Did the free cloudquest of AWS. Don't know yet if I should bother pass the certifications since it is ""only"" 100 euros.
* Writing a few ideas of app/business. **But I am a bit confused about how to start implementing anything between all the nocode/lowcode/tech stack choices**
* Finally created a linkedin profile ahahah, but not much on it
* Began working on a small project to understand ***event sourcing*** using this as a template [https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing](https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing) . But I don't yet know how to use it coupled with cloud providers as I only launched it in local so I need to get trained about ci/cd and all since it is all already done at my job.
* ***Reading on DDD and good software engineering practices that I forgot***
* Followed a few online courses of Andrew Lo to know about finance  to have some basics about how the world works. I tried to solve a Jane Street puzzle but I don't even know how to begin solving it. So I don't think I am even remotely close to have any potential in the finance sector lmao
* **Applied for a lot of positions as software engineer 2 months ago but I had an answer only for one job** and the salary didn't look like it was going to be much higher than now (and even maybe lower) and the job didn't look much more exciting than what I am doing now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Possible future paths :

* **Quitting my job and trying to work on my personal projects to get hands-on experience with cloud providers while I continue applying** : I would gain a few hours per day but I would probably lose most of my social interactions so I don't know if it would be good for my mental health to stay alone even more.
* **Continue my job until I define a business plan then quit and entirely focus on trying to create a start up** : i don't know if it is a wise idea as I am inexperienced and I will move out soon (Finally)
* **Keep working at my job and focus on reading to prepare for interviews and pay for training courses like aws skill builder/cloudquest and certifications**
* **Just change job and stop trying to be a software engineer. I don't like nor hate to code especially. I am more interested into doing participating creating something useful so I would be ok having another position. That's where I want to know if you guys have any advice as I have no idea what kind of position pay well in IT**

&#x200B;

My dream would one or several of the followings :

* Having my own company or being freelance in whatever job that pays as much as possible as wealth can translate to influence
* Reaching an executive position
* Having a political position

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** : **Meh software engineer in western europe looks for a career path in IT since I have an IT background. I am a bit lost now concerning what to do when you are random and you want to do something meaningful with your life. A bit lost with all the choices of tool available today too.**

&#x200B;

**Do you have any advice or insights on what I could do ? What kind of jobs are accessible to climb the ladder in IT ? I think I am doing many things wrong as I don't feel like i did much progress in the last few months except reading (and forgetting a lot of what I read) and I feel stuck**",2023-12-30 01:32:51

15tvjgd,Typical starting salary for a software engineer in your country? And other questions about the SWE job market in the EU.,"**Hi, I'm just curious what the typical starting salary is for a new grad software engineer is in your country?**

Also have a few more secondary questions that are probably a bit harder to answer. If you can great if not its fine just ignore them:

1. Do employers generally spend a substantial amount on employee benefits (pension, health insurance, vacation, parental leave, etc.) and payroll taxes (taxes they pay towards the government)?
2. Do they hire independent contractors/freelancers to do the same work as employees? This is common here, many Canadians are hired as independent contractors by US companies for tax reasons?
3. Are internships extremely important for new grad jobs? They are in the US/Canada. Do most CS/Informatics(I think that's what you call it) graduates have internships?

I understand that not every country is going to be the same obviously, but because of the single market I assume there's going to be a degree of policy standardization and salary normalization between various countries. You can just answer for your country and whatever other countries you are familiar with.",2023-08-17 18:28:59
15g488v,Got lost.,"Hi guys,

I'm a self-taught developer (Java) with around 6 years of experience, working for a regular ""body shop"" company in Poland. I started to feel extremely overwhelming by amount of things I should know, especially as a specialist with my experience. I'm trying to be on top of the things and learn (or at least be familiar) today's actual technologies just to be more competitive on the market, unfortunately, I'm not a quick learner and spent a lot of time to do that. For instance, I spent 4 month to prepare for GCP exam (didn't have previous experience with cloud), now I'm reading Web Scalability for Startup Engineers by Artur Ejsmont (eye-opening book for me) and doing some courses in my company to be able to transition to ""Senior"" level. But the problem is I don't use the most of these technologies in my current project and obviously I started forgetting everything I learnt, so it looks so pointless.

Besides that I feel like the absence of CS degree shows itself, I have huge gaps in knowledge of basics: computer networks, OS, hardware etc. I don't feel confident and comfortable because of it, especially when it comes to work with guys who has that degree.

&#x200B;

What would you recommend in my place? Should I concentrate on basics only and find a project with as latest tech stack as possible and gain knowledge at work itself?

It would also be great to hear stories from other self-taught developers, how they cope with these problems.",2023-08-02 09:32:07

14m5v0i,Is my resume really THAT bad ? (3 interviews for 150+ applications),"[https://imgur.com/KL7LYKh](https://imgur.com/KL7LYKh)

Hello,  
  
I'm finishing up my internship and graduating in early October, so I started sending out my resume about 2 months ago to various places in France, the UK (no visa), and the Netherlands for Data Engineer and Software Engineer roles. However, I haven't had any success, and I can't figure out why.  
  
I've been trying to write tailored cover letters, applying to positions that require 0-2 years of experience, and not limiting myself to just big tech companies.  
  
What I find strange is that a few months ago, when I was searching for an internship, I successfully passed the resume screening at many big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Datadog even though I had one less international internship listed on my resume.  
  
I suspect it might be due to my education.

34 days paid vacations.  
10 minutes in bicycle.  
My friends and my family next to me.  
South of france, good weather.

What I am scared of is the quality of life if I move and the other thing I am scared of is that there are a lot of processes in the bank.  
I am not free to do whatever I want like right now.  
They told me I should not be afraid of administratives tasks because there are a lot.  
If I want to install X, I should make a demand and wait for the approvals of many services.  
No agile, a lot of things seems to be ""old school"".  
For example, when they want to do a release, they copy/paste.

If I move, I plan to live in france at the border.

Anyone working in a bank can give me their opinion ?

11e04qo,Will this be looked down upon if I asked my manager to change teams only after a year joining due to a toxic colleague?,"So basically the toxicity of this colleague (a team lead) is already a public knowledge and my manager already got this complaint from many people. Basically he would explode if things don’t go like what he wants. But all my manager did to “solve” this was only by creating some bullshit team workshop, which didn’t change this colleague behavior at all.

My original plan was to look for another jobs, but due to the current market it is very difficult for a someone with only a 3 YoE and I guess it’s risky now to switch jobs. Therefore I am thinking to change teams for now because it really impacts my mental health. But I am afraid that my manager would be upset because he specifically said during my interview that to change teams would only be possible after at least 3 years.

1135v1n,Applying through recruiters vs applying yourself,"I am right now applying again and noticed a strange thing.

When I am reacting to a recruiter message and send my CV through them, it more often then not leads to a talk with the company. When I am reacting to a job posting though, I more often get a standard rejection email from HR.

My sample is by no means representative, but I am interested if it is true for others here.

I have 3 YoE as a Backend Developer and, since I set my linkedin status to ""open"", have been having multiple recruiters reaching to me. It is also not like that that I am cold applying to FAANG and get recruiters messaging me for positions in local sweatshops, the distribution on both sides is even.

I have a few hypotheses about why it can be like this.

1. Companies consider you more desperate if you are applying on your own.
2. My CV is not good enough to pass first internal screening by HR or by some software, and it needs some advocating from recruiters.
3. Companies in general prefer to work through recruiters, so they can skip the initial screening process and rely on them.
4. It is all pure coincidence and my sample is too small.",2023-02-15 19:09:21

I joined a bootcamp about halfway through 2022 and was given (in my opinion) a lot of great feedback on my ability to learn, my unwillingness to sacrifice quality and the effort that I put in.

My name was put forward for an apprenticeship as a software engineer with a very large company, and some how I managed to pass the take home test, and initial interview - Again, with great feedback and a few private calls to discuss how things would work further down the process.

I was asked to remain available as the position will be starting basically instantly. I had checked in on the one month mark just to ask how things were going and if responses had gone out already and was told they were coming soon.

Another month passed and today I was finally declined. 

I understand it's not personal but it came across quite negatively to be given thumbs up across the entire process and specifically being requested to not get in to anything else too deeply, only to be told it was for nothing - I am sure many of you have gone through this experience before, but for me this is the first time it's happened and I'm really questioning what my next step is.

I've avoided applying to many suitable positions that were a lot more convenient because of how influencial this position would be for kick starting my career, and now all of these other positions are obviously not being advertised anymore.

Just to clarify, I do not consider myself a better developer than my teammates and I never said a thing about them. I just fix what they did wrong because if I dont fix it we would not deliver on time.

The thing is the Tech Lead just points out my mistakes but he never says a thing about the fact that my  teammates are not working ar the required pace and they also make way more mistakes than myself (mistakes that I have to end up fixing)

16uk89j,Name and Shame: Abcvyz,"Last month, I applied for a remote backend position to this distributed company. For context, I am a CS graduate and a fullstack developer with over a year of experience. The first interview was a video call, where I met the only person I would be in contact with from that point on. In this interview, they asked me some general questions, and we engaged in some small talk.  
  
For the second interview, they asked me to draw a UML diagram of a solution. I was given 40 minutes, so I took my time to really think and reason about the solution. However, after about 15 minutes, they interrupted me, saying they had seen enough to judge my abilities. At this point, even though I felt I had performed okay, I wasn't expecting to hear back from them. Surprisingly, the following week, they invited me to a third interview which was supposed to be a hands-on technical test where I would code a simple backend API.  
  
Yet again, I met with the same person. I must not have satisfied him with my solution, since he mentioned I was ""showing off"" my programming skills without demonstrating the necessary engineering skills. At the end of the interview, he said that even though I wasn't ready for this role, they would give me a chance with a trial period to ""prove myself"". This trial was supposedly paid, but I soon realized payment would only come after completing a full month.  
  
At the time, I had another equally appealing offer, but because this position was fully remote (as opposed to the other offer which was hybrid), I decided to take a risk and went forward with Abcvyz. I also stopped interviewing with three other companies.  
  
I signed the necessary documents and sent them over. When they asked for a start date, I informed them I could begin the following week, and everything seemed fine.  
  
A week passed, and on my start date, they introduced what they termed an ""incubation period"". For three days, this same individual (now my mentor) constantly told me that I couldn't grasp certain concepts or comprehend contexts. Finally, he concluded that I wasn't smart enough for the role and proceeded to block me.  
  
Now, I feel like a fool, unemployed and without any job options in hand.",2023-09-28 16:14:42
16qua3u,Munich 80K for a potential PhD dropout?,"I am a frequent lurker at this sub but I am sort of paralyzed now when it's time to make my next career decision. Other similar posts and queries made here don't seem to completely satisfy my anxiety. I am a (potential) PhD dropout in computer science. Since my contract would not be renewed at my university, I started looking for jobs in my field (autonomous systems) and received an offer of EUR 80K base pay at a company in Munich. I am also being offered some virtual shares, but I think they are not of any value until the company goes public or gets sold. It's a hybrid role, so accepting this offer would need me to relocate to Munich where the rents are possibly the highest in Germany. 

I spent about 5 years on my PhD and  for various reasons was unable complete it within this time. There is a possibility to finish it as an external candidate, but it may go either way which is why I say that I am potentially a dropout. Apart from that I do have a further industry experience of 5 years but it was in a field completely unrelated to autonomous systems.

16bk48s,Relocating from Germany to Sweden: is it worth it?,"Hello everyone! I have been working for two years in Germany for a Swedish technology company. During these two years I have been working within a department mainly based in Gothenburg, so I have been there several times. My working experience there has outperformed the one in Germany, making me impossible to believe that I was working for the same company: incredible offices, much more relaxed working rhythm, nice and young colleagues... And the city of Gothenburg itself I also love it, to be honest, especially when it comes to lifestyle, architecture, nature and food. 

So I have the chance now of moving there permanently (more towards 2024Q1), and in most of the aspects I see it as a life upgrade. But in the economic aspect (and that is an important one, definitely), I have a lot of doubts. I know that salaries for STEM tend to be lower in Sweden than in Germany, and that having a higher cost of living, I will lose some acquisition power. Well, I can accept that, since with my current salary in Germany I am living really well and I do not have a family to take care of, nor debts to pay. 

But what worries me the most is how bad the SEK has been performing lately, without signs of improving. This is especially worrying for me, coming from a country with euro (Spain). On the other hand, there are some voices out there saying that Germany's economy is or will soon start to suffer a lot.

Any advice on the economic side? Do you think that this is a reason big enough to make me seriously consider if I really want to move there? ",2023-09-06 13:19:15

That leaves me in a dilemma. I would like to bring it up with my manager and discuss options, but once I tell them, then I've played my cards.

I believe my options are:

1. Apply to Norwegian companies, hopefully get an appropriately paid position and pray I like it as much as my current position

2. Bring it up early and open the discussion, ask if I can get a sponsor and if they'd be willing to move salary. If yes, great, if not then I **could** live on my current salary for a year or two and work out something from Norway.

18t63hr,I feel like I can't continue coding anymore,"I've been working as a web developer for the past 3 years after finishing a master's degree in CS. I've always struggled with the jobs that I've held (partly because of the workload but mostly because of bullying and toxic workplaces), but at my current job, my colleagues are kinda nice yet the project I'm working on is overwhelming. The whole company culture is about working a lot, having many uncertainties, and doing unpaid overtime (which they don't directly tell us to do but everyone does it). It's a tech startup and seems to be struggling financially and they have many features they want to implement. There are no raises and there are a lot of upcoming responsibilities and my salary isn't really good considering the inflation. We're also a very small team and they don't want to hire people.

My problem is that I started hating coding. It's the only thing I know how to do, but I can't do it anymore. I literally stare at the screen most of the time trying to come up with an idea or to force myself to work but my brain keeps going blank. Literally blank. Like I have no brain in there. I've always been a hard working student and employee. When I was at uni, I always got high grades at subjects I hated, so I've always forced myself to do things even when I didn't want to. But now I feel like I can't work anymore. I keep blaming myself that I'm being lazy, but I'm too exhausted. When I'm given a new task to do, it feels like climbing a mountain. I take longer doing things and I take forever to understand a new codebase (the codebases in their projects are very big). I can't come up with any creative ideas anymore. And to add up to all that, the company is launching new products next year so I'll have to work harder because more work will be given to me. Everything moves at such high speed and I'm supposed to be familiar and research lots of new tools/libraries/etc and come up with decisions. I'm just very overwhelmed.
I don't have a social life anymore due to my very low energy, I can barely do the basic things in life and everything feels like a struggle, even showering and making food. I saw a therapist a few weeks ago and she said I have all the symptoms of depression, I really don't know what to do with my life anymore. I'm even having thoughts about ending my life and keep imagining what a relief it would be to do it.

I thought it could be burnout, but I took 1 month off (all my vacation days) and still didn't feel good. I was actually dreading the day I go back to work because I knew what was waiting for me. Also I started getting a lot of physical health issues like stomachaches, acid reflux, hemorrhoids, constant headahces, dizziness, eye pain, neck and shoulder pain that radiates down my arm and hand, weight gain, etc. This only adds to my misery given the long work hours I have to put every day.

For the record, I recently moved to Germany to work there and I really wanted to make it, but I guess I'm failing terribly. I'm thinking that being a developer isn't for me anymore or maybe I can't work in corporate anymore. I'm contemplating going back to my home country (which isn't nice btw) knowing that I failed, just to preserve my health and try to find something else to do. Because I can't take a break then switch careers while I'm here due to the crazy expensive rent and life expenses, since I'm very likely to get a lower salary in whatever career I decide to switch to. What's stopping me is the fear of regretting this decision and being blamed by my family for not making it in Germany while everyone else who comes here makes a life for themselves and thrives. I also can't look for a new job because, as I mentioned before, I'm too exhausted, so I can't go through the grueling interview process and studying DSA, also I'm slowly hating coding and technology more and more everyday. I can't even imagine becoming a senior developer and working in this field for 10+ years.

Anybody been in my shoes before? I'd benefit from some insights or any words of advice. Thanks.",2023-12-28 22:10:39

145wv79,B2B in Central/Eastern Europe vs Western Europe? Got an offer for 100k in Berlin.,"Hi, I have 5 YoE working in IT, 2 YoE as a software engineer (before that I was a tester) and I have MSc degree in IT. 

&#x200B;

I got offered a mid-level role in Berlin for 90-100k € annual. When I put 100k in tax calculator the gross monthly pay is 8.333€, however net is only 4.673€ - are the taxes really so high, like 44%? I have no kids and I'm not married, so the first tax category. 

&#x200B;

I currently work on B2B contract in a capital city in Central/Eastern Europe, where I earn on average 41k € annual. I pay flat tax rate of 250€ per month for health & social insurance and income tax, so I'm left with 37k€ per year, what's around 3000€ per month. I'm not really living frugally, as I'm living alone and I often travel and eat in restaurants, but I'm able to save around 800€ every month. B2B contract has a lot of downsides like no paid sick leave, no paid vacation, it's semi-legal, a lot of administrative hurdles, but I've done it for years so I'm used to it. 

&#x200B;

Now, how is this offer for Berlin - for me it'd be only 1500€ per month more, but Berlin is waaaay more expensive than Central/Eastern Europe, especially looking at one-bedroom flats. Is this a good offer? I hear often that QoL is higher in Western Europe, but what exactly could improve for me? Free kindergarten in Berlin is nice, but I have no kids. I'm done with studies, so not interested in public education and I'm also healthy. 

&#x200B;

Is there anyone on B2B who had the same dilemma - B2B in Central/Eastern Europe vs Western Europe?",2023-06-10 10:35:01

Meanwhile these jobs require to live in Areas such as Barcelona, London, Prague, Milan, Zagreb and so on, where the rent alone will consume half of your net salary and you can only afford a one room apartment and live like a normie/wagie.

I dont understand why anyone would like to work in a highly intellectual and competent industry but be paid like an average office worker who just uses word and excel and sends emails all day.

* offering a lower pay
* less interesting tasks

1126ihd,How did you get better at interviews?,"Hi folk,

I'm looking for general suggestions for job search/interviews for my spouse. She's been looking for a job for about 6 months with no luck. She is a junior-mid level (2-3 years exp) frontend engineer. She also has an EU passport, so she's not visa dependent. I'm a full stack engineer myself at senior level, but unfortunately I feel like I can't contribute much, even though I was personally able to land multiple jobs. I simply didn't have the problems she had with the interviews, so I'm having a hard time helping her.  


I think we are encountering two main problems with her search: 

1) Language barrier: We never tested her English level, she speaks and understands it, but when it comes to interview companies are much more picky. I'm assuming she's around B1-B2. We are actively trying to improve this with mock interviews, studying English etc. but open to suggestions. As for German, I think it would take a crazy amount of time.

2) Anxiety: I can see her physically getting very anxious during the interviews. She interviewed quite a lot lately, but not a lot of improvement tbh. We also do mock interviews sometimes.  


Now when both of these combine unfortunately she looks very flaky in the interviews and gets usually rejected on the first step. I think she only made it once to the technical step. The only criteria we have is a remote/hybrid job, everything else we really don't care much, like pay could be new grad level it's fine.   


I'm wondering how other people got around these issues and looking for suggestions. Are there certain language courses etc. maybe we can look into? Maybe register her to Agentur für Arbeit and maybe they can be helpful? Open to ideas!",2023-02-14 14:21:00

For context: I'm 28yo and I started coding almost 10 years ago. In 2016 I got into comp.science because I wanted to get into AI. During that, I constantly built portfolios, worked on coursera degrees and other things to not only learn more but also, show employees what I'm really made of (it was really hard on me, by the way). 
Even though it took me 6 years to complete because of an illness, I recovered and also got an internship and a full-time job before finishing.

Now, I'm finishing my MSc in AI and, while I thought I would get many more opportunities, it's quite the contrary!!

Basically every recruiter goes for the final interview and they ghost me there. Only 1 recruiter told me that it was because I don't have the mindset nor skillset of a normal junior and that they are afraid of me going there and in a couple of months go for a higger-paid job because of all the things I mentioned before.

168f5qg,Career Stagnation After 9 Years in Dev: A Lead Software Engineer's Dilemma on Next Steps,"Hello everyone,

I've been in the workforce for 16 years, starting with low-paying, non-IT jobs that paid just €7.5/hr before taxes. To improve my situation, I enrolled in evening courses at a Software Engineering College while still working full-time. Before even completing my 4 years in the College, I landed a role at a now-iconic digital agency in my homecountry. There, I wore many hats: full-stack developer, customer support, and even hiring manager for all tech Jobs. To this day, employees hear stories about me and im known as a ""living legend"" within the company.

Later, I transitioned to a prestigious consulting firm and climbed the ranks to become a Lead Software Engineer. In this role, I've handled various responsibilities, mostly focusing on Enterprise Cloud but also including on-prem enterprise solutions for large international Corps. 

However, it hasn't been smooth sailing. I've dealt with upper management lacking technical know-how, leading to poor decisions. Moreover, I've had to manage underperforming developers, even after warning about inadequate onboarding processes years before my leadership role. The lack of imo quality projects in the pipeline also concerns me. Im somehow bored too.

On the upside, I work almost entirely remotely, have 5 weeks of paid vacation, and earn a higher salary than most people I know. It is the best job ive ever had, and i know there are a lot of bad firms. Overall its pretty chill. Despite these benefits, I feel my career stagnating. 

I've started a side business and have the option to freelance, potentially tripling my hourly rate vs my Job. These freelance opportunities are pre-arranged through a trusted consulting firm and a agency and a former lead engineer, eliminating the need for client acquisition. (Smaller clients, but no low Quality Work, and still ""big"" [1000-2000 hours] and cool Software projects.)
But still im afraid, because i like to chill and freelancing could be more stress and work than i really want. 

So here are the options i tought about:

1. Remain in my current role, tolerating stagnation and try to chill.
2. Begin freelancing part-time while keeping my full-time job.
3. Move to part-time at my current job and focus more on freelancing. (I can always say no to freelance projects and chill, but when i take it, ive to deliver)
4. Like point 3 but with a slower transition out of my Job to only freelance.
5. Explore FAANG opportunities, though I'm not particularly interested in this route. (Some ex staff did.)
6. Accept a promotion to Solution Architect purely for CV enhancement, even though it would bore me and lead to an increase in pointless meetings, leaving my development team basically leaderless.

Your insights would be greatly appreciated.

18a24zg,Junior SWE: Fired at the end of probation,"This is a throwaway account to be less identifiable.  
Hello everyone. I got fired at the end of my probation period from an early-stage startup and would like to ask for advice.

It was my first job after graduation. I chose it over a more stable and in general better job offer from another company because I was curious about what the development looks like at these stages and just felt like that I could get a lot of interesting experience there.

There were no signs of being unhappy with me, I received positive feedback only, and it also doesn't help that my manager (one of the co-founders) was super friendly (on a buddy level) to me. Then, suddenly, during an unrelated call I was informed that they were letting me go. The reason stated is that they decided against remote work, even though each time there were talks about it before, I was assured that home office for engineers was totally fine.

It would still suck to find out about it but I'd be more understanding if it was the only reason stated. I was also told other things which I can't share but that made me read between the lines and think that there might have never been any intention to continue working with me after my probation period.

This sudden 180-degree turn from the founders, me not properly establishing personal boundaries, and the fact that I lost my job at the worst time (holiday season and saturated market) have been having a negative impact on my mental state.

If you've ever been in a similar situation, what helped you to overcome it? What made the last weeks of work more bearable and motivated you to show up at meetings and work on your tasks?

Will it also look like a red flag in my CV that the only full-time job I had ended during probation? Other than that, I only worked part-time as a developer during my studies.",2023-12-03 20:14:06

I'm from a country that didn't have a near-0 inflation rates so it was kind of expected to get a raise every year and by talking to my manager and sometimes bringing offers from other companies I was able to get a decent salary.

Now that I live in Germany I got a \~2% raise in 2023 and expected to get about the same in 2024 which is definitely lower than the inflation rate. 

How is it better to approach it? Any tips specific to the country? Does speaking about the current inflation help?

Unfortunately I don't have such leverage anymore as I'm in a new country and received a relocation bonus which I'd have to return, so threatening with offers probably wouldn't work.

15rqiq1,Imposter syndrome making me reconsider Senior job offer.,"My background (5 YOE mixed): 

2 YOE in Python scripting for a data related role

3 YOE in SWE role

I've been considering a career change out of SWE to DevOps as I loved that type of work in my current role and have really enjoyed tinkering with my personal homelab.

I came across a DevOps Engineer job that ticked all the boxes I wanted to do and where I had some (but certainly not all) of the skills they were after. I knew I wasn't experienced enough but decided to apply anyway.

The job desc had a few technologies I'd heard of but haven't got experience in (Terraform/Ansible/Puppet) and I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn.

I was surprised to even get an interview and was even more surprised to be offered the job with the salary I asked for. It works out to be a 35% salary increase and comes with the title of ""Senior DevOps Engineer"".

I had to confirm with the recruiter that it wasn't a mistake as I certainly don't feel like a Senior Software Engineer, let alone a Senior DEVOPS Engineer! They said the hiring team had a think about it and decided on hiring me as a Senior to give me a chance to grow into the role.

I am seriously concerned whether I'll survive probation / perform as a Senior member in their team. This job market is tough and I feel like I shouldn't leave my stable job for a job I might not succeed at... Is it going to be a massive transition from SWE to DevOps?

Unfortunately I lost my job due to cost-cutting in my company, and finding a new one proved to be very difficult. About hundred applications and 3 technical interviews, one of which I almost got the offer, but fumbled when it came to salary negotiations.

However one company offered me a summer internship position with a nice pay. The thing is that they are upfront about it only being for the summer as they do not have any real openings at the moment. The goal of the internship is to build a project with 2 other interns and 1 member of the company and help students get some experience in the summer. The deal seems pretty bad to me as I would rather just take a full-time job elsewhere and spend 2-3 years there to gain some good experience, but I am pretty desperate after 2 months of searching...

131xn8m,More responsibilities but no increase in pay,"Happy friday everyone!

I am a senior PM at a big tech firm. I had a compensation discussion with my manager recently - overall, my company's stock performed really poorly this year, so my total compensation will be less than what I got in 2022. There are no bonuses/refreshers planned in the coming years, so very likely I will be making less than what I made in the last couple of years and will continue to make even lesser in 2025. I've met expectations in this year's performance cycle, so currently there are no performance-related layoffs expected. I'm in the EU so I cannot be let go without a major reason.

My manager has recently asked me to take over additional responsibility for a product that was envisioned by one of the stakeholders in our partner teams. This project currently lacks an end-to-end program owner (for launch and implementation), and the work is expected to be both managing the product roadmap and go-to-market. He has been asking me to own it for the last few months, claiming that it is ""good for my career"" and it will ""help me learn how to stretch"". In our last 1:1 he asked me to tell him in the next 2-3 weeks if I will own this product or not. I am not sure where this timeline comes from, because the product currently doesn't have strict targets associated with it.

Given the comp decrease, and no plans for me to get a promotion, the extra work is not going to increase my quality of life in any way. I will most likely apply to other teams in a few months. I am going to say no once and for all to this product but I am curious to hear from the other PMs - what would you do if you were given extra work with no extra pay?

I’ve started learning italian, and my knowledge of the language/college currently makes moving this year unrealistic, so it’ll probably take a few years or so before I move there.

19aq1ap,Is high turnover always a sign of a poor team/business?,"I've only worked as a dev in 2 companies so far (<2 YOE), both times in very small teams. In both places (mid-senior) developers kept leaving all the time, usually I am the only constant there.

The first job even I could tell was absolutely a total mess, 3-4 developers left in a year, the only one who stayed simply enjoyed getting paid not to do almost anything. I myself was frustrated I wasn't learning anything and wasting my time, so I found another job.

Compared to the first one, I am infinitely happier, learning a lot, stuff is actually being done, there are standards in place. There are some things about work politics that don't concern my at this level. However, here again people are leaving, for the 6 months I've been here, 2 developers resigned (leaving me and my boss as the only people on the team..).

Is such turnover in the dev world normal? I realise I should be grateful I have a job with the job market being so tough now, so I am not thinking of leaving my current place, I just can't imagine a place where good developers actually stay for years.

18zzx10,Is it worth it ti change stack for Europe? (Germany),"Hello Everyone! 

I'm a Backend developer living currently in Peru, I got married to a German and we are planing to move to Germany this year. Here in South America since last year there is a Boom for .Net/ C# developers and a lot of demand for Java + Spring Boot, almost nothing with other languages like Python, Javascript (except for Front end positions) or Go(Golang). But looking in Germany's Linkedin job board the marked is way more mixed in the tech stack (many positions in Typescript/Javascript and way less for C# and the same for Java) I count with some years of experience with Typescript , Node.js , Nest.js and some Next.js however Lately I was thinking in maybe change stack because the amount of applications a Typescript/Javascript position gets is inmense (from 300 to 500 or more per position on Germany) is it worth it go an apply eventho there are a lot of people already applying to this positions? Or would be convenient to change stack before going? Anyone with a similar experience?

18hesj7,Job Offer in Munich 90K,"Hi all,

I got a job offer from a company in Munich for a position for Security Expert. The offer is 90K base + 10% annual bonus (base on performance) with all the required documents covered (Blue Card). The company will cover all the move costs and first rent. I am 35y, Ihave 10 YoE and my wife won't work at first glance due to language barrier. No kids yet. 

Currently, I live in Ireland with 75K base + 3% annual bonus. All the other benefits are pretty much the same (standard).

Also I am almost sure that my current company would cover or at least increase my salary if I hand over the notice to them. 

I am not sure whether or not worth changing jobs. I was inclined to due to Germany is a better place than Ireland. Munich is also cheaper. We plan to have kids in the near future 2 years and Germany is more appealing in that line too (safest etc.). The fact that Ireland is an Island affects our quality of life as well. There is no easy way to travel or visit different countries.

What should I do next?,"So for some context, my 1 year contract with my current (and first) employer is about to end in a month and a half. I got no information about whether they intend to stick with me or not so I of course took a look at job market and applied for some jobs.

Quite a few of the interviews went smoothly and I received an offer 50% higher than is my current salary. In a year it adds up to about 8 000€ more than I am making at this moment.

So of course I had a meeting with my current manager about it and he says that they cannot give me such a high raise, and that the most they could do is give me a raise of about 5 500€ more yearly. The job is fine and I learned a lot, but being in a junior position I think I am being underpaid by a mile. With no clear path towards a medior position. Hell, if I hadn't bought up another offer I don't think my pay would get an increase at all.

143gcx8,Switching companies for 25% raise? DevOps Engineer with 2.5 YoE,"Hi,

Throwaway account, just in case. Anyway, I have been doing DevOps for the last 2.5 years, mostly for small companies and startups, plus some contracting on the side. Originally, I came from cybersecurity domain, but the transition was essentially career-changing, so I count it separately. 7 months ago, I received an offer from a British scale-up that offered me around 15% more over my former salary. This was all fine and good, but after signing the offer acceptance, the hiring manager quickly told me that my final salary will be 200 euros lower (he blamed it on the budget and told me that there's nothing he can do). My negotiated salary was lower in the end. Although it quite surprised me, I decided to proceed anyway due to an amazing team that I clicked with, work-life balance, and a vision that I can always climb higher within the company. Another major letdown was recent, a few weeks ago. I wanted the company to pay for a conference, and they flat-out told me that they don't offer this benefit in my country, although it was stated in the job offer + contract that the company would reimburse up to $1500 worth of conference tickets and certificates/further education. Again, I just shrugged and moved on, because of the people.

**Import info** \- I'm from a central European country that's a tad more to the east, so wages are usually somewhat lower than in our western counterparts. This also means that I was offered full remote with my team being distributed across Europe (80% of engineering incl. my team is in Greece). This was fine by me, and 7 months later, I'm still happy with my team, managers, engineering culture, and how I'm progressing with my career. It could be slightly better, but could be also a lot worse. The only two incidents are described above.

Thing is, I received an offer from a local unicorn with 25% raise in base salary (not TC). I'd also receive noticeable amount of stock options + a yearly bonus. I know stock options/RSUs are essentially a throwaway paper unless the company actually debuts, but the equity I'd receive is around 50% higher than my current company. They also offer full remote (my team would be local, but the engineering is spread across Europe as well + some people in the US and Canada), but I'd have the option to go to the office if I want to hang out or grab a beer with someone. As the office is only 40 mins away, I could meet with my team here and there. They also offer home office equipment (chair, laptop, screen etc.). Other than that, I'd also get reimbursed therapy sessions, prepaid card for gyms and spas etc. PTOs and sick days are more or less the same.

The job band in my current company is ""Developing Individual Contributor"" (basically Medior), the new one would be ""Engineer IV"" (first stage of Senior ladder).

I have no idea what to do. On one hand, I have an absolutely positive team, the greatest manager I could wish for (really chill, I have a soft spot for him), and overall good engineering culture. On the other hand, though, I know the company is underpaying me and I was told that the next reviews (whether I'm eligible for a raise) would be in a year, and I have the opportunity to up not only my income, but also my title. The new team I had a talk with also seems rather chill, laid-back, and welcoming.

The difference would be 44k € vs 60k (+- 25%).

11iw5ry,"[Czech Republic, Slovakia] Did my client crossed a line or am I overreacting? Experiencing angry client for the first tine.","Hello,

I  am potentially facing a violation of the CoC by my client, and I would  appreciate your assistance in determining if my reaction and feelings  are justified. This is a long rant as I am currently experiencing a  great deal of stress and emotional distress. I apologize for my poor  Eastern European English.

Over the  past decade, I have been responsible for developing systems and  providing technical support for these systems, and have maintained  excellent and professional relationships with everyone. As part of a new  project, employees are required to report monthly in accordance with  local legislation. This information is then processed by accountants who  have access to the system, which automatically calculates all the  necessary figures based on the monthly rates provided by the HQ, and  generates all required outputs required by the law. Apologies for being  too vague.

Although the idea was  met with significant opposition from the employees, the project manager,  who oversees the project and works at the company, was determined to  proceed. They created a clear set of specifications, discussed the  proposed changes with the employees, and work on the project began.

After  several months, the project was completed and the project manager was  very pleased with the outcome. We conducted workshops to introduce the  software to the employees, although they expressed dissatisfaction. The  project manager responded by emphasizing that the process was legally  required and acknowledged that feedback could be used to make  improvements, but ultimately the process itself needed to remain in  place.

After rolling out the  system, we encountered several issues. Firstly, there were some bugs in  the software that I failed to catch initially, and I take full  responsibility for this. However, we fixed the issues quickly and I  apologized for the inconvenience. Secondly, some options were missing in  the GUI, which employees perceived as my fault. However, it was  actually a specification issue. The biggest problem was related to the  process itself. Despite the software working flawlessly most of the  time, employees were frustrated about having to fill in all the required  information, which they sometimes didn't understand the reasoning for.  Additionally, false accusations were made about the quality of the  software. Even though we verified that all the numbers were correct,  some employees used outdated calculations and refused to accept that the  calculation had changed. Some people demanded features that were  outside the scope of the project, and although some were reasonable,  they were not part of the original agreement. Finally, some employees  demanded changes to the process, which I am unable to implement on my  own.

In my opinion, around 10% of  the issues could be attributed to me, such as technical issues and UI  elements that could have been clearer in their explanations.

Despite  my efforts to address the issues, many employees were furious with me  and expressed their anger through shouting, insults, and other forms of  hostility. I passed every issue on to the project manager, who remained  mostly in the background. As the project manager is someone in higher  management, I believe people were too afraid to express their  frustration with them and instead took out their anger on me. It was  particularly painful to receive this kind of treatment from people I had  known for a decade and with whom I had previously had good  relationships. Nevertheless, I remained professional throughout the  ordeal, assisting people with technical issues and explaining the  processes again and again, even answering calls late at night and on  weekends.

What crossed the line  for me was when an employee threatened to physically assault me if I  stepped into their office (more specifically they said I ""would get  punched in the face""). Although I have a good Code of Conduct in my  agreement with the client (for instance, it prohibits raised voices), I  consider the threat of physical violence to be completely unacceptable,  regardless of cultural norms. For the time being, I have chosen not to  take action against the violation of the CoC, which could have serious  consequences for my contract, but instead, I plan to allow the situation  to calm down and work with the project manager to address the issues  and find ways to improve the process for everyone involved.

Do  you agree with me that being threatened with physical violence, even if  not a real threat, is crossing a line? Or am I being too sensitive? I  am losing sleep over this incident and am hesitant to check my blood  pressure. This is a completely new experience for me and I have never  encountered anything like this in my ten years in the industry

19fde9z,Getting kicked out at your first shot at an SE career sucks - True story,"I got hired for a Jnr SWE position at a startup right after University in 2022 (lyear with an option to extend based on performance). It started all well and good however, it wasn't until they approached me for help with their public facing website to be transformed into a Wordpress Site.
Being the only one in the team with extensive WP background I took it on alongside my duties as Jr SWE (was psyched at this opportunity so was willing to give my all). Basically had to build their whole site from scratch and went through hurdles for months to complete. Having a pretty impressive academic background and delusions of a high performance person working on this project, l found myself struggling to keep up with the most basic stuff in my actual role (SE), making mistakes all over the place and by the time I realized I was 9months into the job struggling for some of high complexity my code to make production.
Hence, them pushing back my review (other low key requests from them to document everything about the website and its creation), tasking me with specific SWE related tickets to test my suitability for the job (which even made things worse as I was always rushing to complete tickets hence making loads of mistakes).
Overall, I'd say I spent the most part of the role on WP dev instead of actual SE. Clearly I realized I made lots of mistakes (after finding out some colleagues even had WP experience and none volunteered) with this and it's affected my mental health in lots of ways. E.g, found myself taking antidepressants and consistently stressed for being let go at the end, which I was (Although sometimes I think I was hired for the interim to be used for WP dev but).

18bbj7z,6YoE Data scientist stuck and losing motivation,"Hello there! First interaction in this community, wanted to share my situation and hope to get some advice that could be useful for others too.

**TL;DR**: After 6 years in an engineering firm paving my way as a data scientist with effort, I have reached stagnation and my motivation is drained. Recruiters don't seem to value my profile and I feel it is due to my progression having halted some time ago. I need advice.

I am a data scientist with 6 years of experience, most of them on my current company, a large engineering firm based on Spain.

I started off as a young and highly motivated talent with fresh knowledge about Deep Learning and all fancy AI techniques, but had to face a lot of skepticism at the beginning because the company had not reached that point yet. However, after times of hard work and constant evangelization of the benefits of state-of-the-art techniques (and the help of some enthusiastic peers) I reached a respected senior status here. Nevertheless, the constant pressure of having to continuously prove my value demoted my motivation. I feel that my progression was slowed down in comparison to what I could have achieved in a company that had backed me from the beginning.

The thing is that, apart from a couple of projects that I really enjoyed during that time, I feel that I have reached stagnation. I am involved in very long term projects with no real impact, and advancing at a slow pace. All I do is trying to keep up with the emerging technologies, do some R&D experimentation and lead a few junior peers (which is the only rewarding part, but I hardly find the motivation myself to even motivate them!).

I have no fixed goals or tractor projects to motivate me to keep learning and improving. I have tried to make up for that with personal projects during my free time but I end my work day tired and also want to live other aspects of my life.

As I look back, I see that I am not a fresh, valuable and motivated junior talent anymore but a mid-senior getting rusty and pessimistic.

I have tried to switch jobs but either I am rejected in favour of best suited candidates at some part of the process or get offered less money than I am currently making. This situation increases my feeling that I am not progressing in my career and as time passes I have less to offer for my age and expected seniority level.

Have you felt something similar? From what I have read here, burnout is not uncommon, but I honestly do not know how to exit this loop.

Or put it another way. I know I am capable and have great problem solving and engineering skills and experience. Do you know any companies for which I could apply and demonstrate my talent instead of being judged by how many buzzwords and random technologies I have in my CV?",2023-12-05 13:04:28

17o829f,Remote work contract concerns in Germany,"Hey everyone,
I got an offer for a senior position (in a German scale-up) which was advertised as remote. I’m not based in the same city of their headquarters and so in the very first interview I stressed out again the importance of the remote work for me and that I don’t have any intention to move any other city.
They guaranteed it and everything went smoothly.

I received the contract and here is where it gets tricky: almost half of the contract is made up of clauses about ""mobile"" employment, including the company's ability to cancel rights to work remotely “if necessary”, among other similar restrictions.

For me it is a big red flag. If company wants to do layoffs, it has the right to force you to return to the office and if you refuse, it has right to fire you without any benefits etc and there is nothing can do about it legally as you have signed the contract.

I was curious whether anyone else in Germany had encountered anything similar. Is this typical?

177t8gt,Make a risky move to pursue FAANG now?,"So, I am a PhD in CS graduate that recently started on my first job in industry. I have a doubt that is consuming me.

I moved to the NL to start my job. It is an okay work, kind of related to my field of expertise. Team is nice, hybrid with 2x in the office, and they have good amenities. Company seems overall very stable and profitable despite current economic scenario (it is a Dutch non-tech company). The salary is just average.

However, I interned at FAANG rainforest during my PhD where I got a return offer. Sadly the offer was put on hold after the layoffs this year. I now have the opportunity of maybe joining them again. It is a bit crazy, and timing is very bad. I would have to relocate again, apply for a visa again (non-EU here) and all the annoyances that comes with it.

The salary offered by FAANG is literally twice my current one. They also offer sign on bonus, and RSUs. I know that learning opportunities for career growth are likely better at FAANG too.


Summing up

*Pro FAANG*
- Double the salary
- Bonus and RSU
- Better career opportunities

*Con FAANG*
- Economy is still unstable, they could lay me off during probation
- Visa process and relocation again
- Rainforest has all the RTO policies coming in very strong, so likely less WFH opportunities
- Shitty with the company that hired me recently (I mean, despite the low salary and not that great opportunity, everyone has been nice so it is impossible not to feel shitty)


It seems that risking FAANG could be the best career-wise, but should I take this huge risk in this economy? Anyone with some sensible opinion? (I am obviously also talking to people I know, but strangers on the internet can also be helpful)",2023-10-14 16:25:03

18vx9xr,Is it difficult to make the switch from Salesforce Developer to a Full-stack/ Backend developer with a mainstream stack?,"Hello everyone and happy new year! I have graduated university in july this year, I have limited work experience (1 year as a java developer), and after months and months of applying to hundreds of job postings, I received an offer for a Salesforce job.

My knowledge about salesforce was almost zero before applying, but I applied anyway because I can't really be picky in this market.

Anyway, I started learning about salesforce before the interview and I came to like the idea of it (and the potential financial earnings of this niche).

I am a little worried though, because unlike many of you who came from a mainstream stack to salesforce later in your career, I am at the beginning of my career. I fear the fact that I may get stuck, and if companies would stop using salesforce, my skills would become unmarketable. 

So my questions are: 

Does salesforce developmemt come with transferable skills?

Are there people who started with salesforce and later in their career made the switch to a mainstream stack like java + react etc.? If so, how difficult was it?

Thank you!

I've been working as a full-stack dev for 7 years, focusing on frontend. I wonder if it's a good long-term career strategy for me to switch to backend/DevOps.

I am a SWE with 4 years of experience I work in a fintech startup in Canada , my total comp is 165K.

I am going back to school to the university of Oxford for a masters degree in maths and computational finance, I had the option to go Columbia or Stern in the US but I opted for Oxford because of the brand name , prestige.

After Oxford I am not sure what to do, many people work in the UK , Germany , Honk Kong or the Middle East.

Canada is amazing but the weather and food aren’t unfortunately, especially the weather to be honest, also the job market is saturated and most of my colleagues wait to get the Canadian citizenship to be able to move and work in the USA.

I am thinking about Germany or Hong Kong , I speak a little German , a friend advised me against Hong Kong because of the politics going on right now but I’m still not sure.

Anyway my question to you dear colleagues , is it worth it to move to Europe in your opinion ? I have lived quite some time there and did my bachelor degree in maths in France ( 3 years).
That was back in 2015.

Has anyone here moved from North America to Europe ? How did it go ?

14yidev,Passed all stages of the job interview and never received any call back,"I just want to check if someone else have been through the same process so you can share any feedback.  
Namely, the recruitment team of one corporation reached out to me regarding open position that they have open. I was extremely flexible regarding the meeting schedules, so within three weeks i passed all three stages.  
In the first interview, it was discussion about my general experience and what would be my expected salary range. So i provided the numbers and i literally received the following feedback: ""Perfect, that is in alignment with our range.""   
The second interview was technical, and they were pretty satisfied with my experience and responses. Also, they have send connection request right after the interview, so i thought that it is a good sign. Of course, the last interview was scheduled after 2 days since they wanted to onboard me asap.  
The third interview was with HR which was pretty formal, where i see myself etc, all the standard questions. Also, i have asked some questions and that was it. The HR manager shared that in one week they will reach out to me regarding the offer details, and that we can negotiate some smaller details if needed.  
So one week passed, there was no response at all. I waited for almost a month to see if there will be any response. At the end, I needed to reach out to employee in the company on Linkedin in private chat, so he can ask about my status. He found the HR manager and the response was that my salary range was just too high. And that is all.  
I mean, why you are spending my time and energy (and also theirs), to go through all of this so at the end to be reject because of high salary expectation? That is why we have initial interview, in case the numbers don't add up, not to continue with the candidate.  
Even if the numbers are high, I though maybe there will be at least some negotiations. But there was no response at all. Not even simple email saying ""Ok, we will not continue with you, bye"".

14at2nf,Is getting a job in the ML/Data Science field as a recent Masters graduate (international student) in Germany really that hard? Or am I stupid? Or both?,"Context: I am an international student who just finished his masters degree from a ML related degree. I am also lucky to do my masters thesis at Miele in a Data Science project. Apart from that, I worked at Fraunhofer Reserarch Institute as a AR/VR part-time research assistant. I also worked as a C++ developer in my home country which does not count unfortunately in EU.

Everyone says 'oh! you study computer science? You will get loads of jobs' and here I am looking for the last 4-5 months part-time (the other half of the time I am doing part-time jobs). I still can't find one, it is really getting embarrassing. Specially now when the AI/ML is booming. Now I am starting to think, it is a me problem.

Question: Is it really that hard to get a job in the ML/Data Science area as a fresh graduate in Germany? What has been your experience? Any feedback is appreciated 🙏

Edit:

I think this is big part of my problem. I have **3 different experiences** (Software Dev, Game/AR Dev and ML/Data Science). 'Jack of all trades, master of none'. In some places it is desired, in some places not. I am also asking myself, where is it desired?

So far, what I have figured out is, I like **applied science** work. I am also open to doing a PhD if it is applied science in nature preferably in a company. Since my interests are scattered, and I find lots of things interesting (which can be a good problem), I am having trouble picking one. But since I have to pick, my **first pick** will be ML/Data science field. Then Games/AR field. And then C++ Dev. I am already **bad at making decision**, and starting one job means normally getting struck in that area. Which makes it even more difficult for me.

What can I do? Maybe the solution is right in front of me. When I apply for ML/Data science positions, I don't get replies. I get more replies from C++ and Games/AR positions just because I have professional experience.

144zzdh,I'm having trouble finding Front End job with 1 year of experience.,"Hi all!

&#x200B;

I've been trying to apply to different positions all across Europe (I'm an EU citizen) these last days as I'm ending a Frontend internship in about a week and I was told that sadly there are no open positions at the moment where I'm doing the internship.

I have to add that I'm still studying my CS degree (though I have some other official studies from Spain that allow me to work as a developer, I think it's called vocational training in English) but I am planning to study slowly the subjects that I have left as I currently need to earn money.

So far I only find other internships or offers where they ask for at least 3 years of experience, I'm sending my CV anyways but I'm being rejected without doing any interviews (I'm guessing because I've only got 1 year of experience).

You can check my anonymized CV here: [Anonymized CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LPEaK-9i46O4TO3IPolpGqGJ8AObEaRa/view?usp=sharing)

I was told by my manager that I exceeded their expectations at the internship and he even offered himself to write a recommendation letter. I think that I do have a higher level with React than you would expect from someone with just 1 year of experience (I'm writing custom hooks, pointing out structural problems in the codebase and refactoring them and, I usually don't need help and can work on my own, it is rare for me to need to ask for help).

Still, I guess that I'm being rejected without being given the opportunity to prove myself the moment people see that I only have 1 year of experience (and maybe that I haven't finished my degree yet).

Any ideas on what could I do to have more chances of getting interviewed, I feel that once I got to the interview it'd be much easier to prove my skills and actually get hired.

**Context**:
I've got 6 years of experience now mostly in small companies with ""flat"" organisational structure. Often I was informally taking the lead on day to day technical development as a main developer, but formally had no decision making or managerial powers. My current position is even worse - when I interviewed it was described to me as 'flat' organisationally, with devs reporting directly to the CTO, but shortly after I joined though, the most senior dev has left, and in the company-wide ""restructuring"" the remaining other dev got promoted to team lead, ""leading"" a tiny team consisting of themselves, me and a tester.

1agmyuu,I resigned from my job at a robotics startup after 4 months. Was this the right thing to do?,"I joined a startup as a robotics software engineer and had to quit my job after 4 months. I am a recent graduate with a Master's in Mechanical engineering. I am a self-taught C++/Python programmer with some experience in computer vision. This job was my first job out of university ...

This small Canadian company had only 12 members, all of which report to the CEO who is also the CTO. The software team of the company consisted of me working on the backend and vision stuff, another guy who worked on the GUI, and the CTO himself who ""sometimes"" worked on the control software. Naturally, my only teammate was the CTO to seek technical support from, who did not respond well to me asking questions. His responses were often based on mocking me or even threatening to fire me whenever he didn't find my questions worthy of asking. His attitude also included making me come to work during the weekends or stay after hours with no payment to ""get the job done"" even though I was scared and confused, trying my best to just come up with some weak-ass code that barely worked to produce some result to make him happy. My only teammate was the internet and ChatGPT. There was no such concept as ""code review"" or ""standup"" in the company. I could just push any code I wanted to the repo with ZERO supervision as long as the code produced some result.

After a while, I became more and more stuck in my tasks to the point that I could not make any progress in my work. This led me to lose motivation, self-esteem, and believe in myself that I was worthy enough of this job. However, the emotional torture from my manager never stopped. I was extremely burnt out which led me to resign. For context, I was the second person to resign in the last 8 months from this role. But the company still goes on because the other employees were ""tough guys"".

I am currently seeking other opportunities, but I just wanted to know what the internet thinks about my decision. Sometimes, I blame myself for not being ""smart"" enough, or not being ""hard-working"" enough to be able to handle this situation. But whatever I do or think, I can't think of a situation in which I could stay in the company and not unalive myself. Do you guys think I made a terrible mistake leaving my first-ever job in a shitty job market or did I do the right thing, putting my mental health first?

I also had an internship last summer developing a mobile app and (not that I thought it matters much, but I have had positive comments about it in interviews) A*A*A at A level.

I have been looking to get a job as a graduate software engineer, and have been applying since May, but am really struggling to get an offer. I've interviewed at 11 different places, but all rejections. I don't know exactly how many applications I've made, but must be at least 60. I live in London and am not aiming for a super high pay + benefits job, most of the jobs are appropriate for me.

I really dislike interviewing. They are usually very stressful and difficult to prepare for, but I feel like I put in some good performances in some of them. For non-technical interviews I typically get asked about my experience and skills and/or what I know about the company etc. I rarely have these go badly, although the interviewer thinks I am often not a good fit, or I am a good fit and they just choose someone else who is a better fit. Although I haven't done too many, most of my performances in technical interviews are mediocre, if not bad.

I'm very demoralised, especially with what's happened in a recent interview. I was invited to a place with only one stage of the interview process and with only 6 or 7 other candidates. I would be interviewed for about an hour, mixture of technical and non-technical questions, but mostly technical. I answered many of the questions just fine, I remember one of the answers I gave, the interviewer told me that was the best one they've had of the candidates they've interviewed so far, and I even taught a small bit of CS theory he did not know in a different question. I was feeling confident with it but I heard from my recruiter that they've made an offer to someone else, and they were looking to hire multiple people. It's been nearly two weeks since this though, so I doubt anything will come of it.

I have an offer from a German and UK company. Both of them offer great working conditions including non-limited WFH(I can work from anywhere in the respective country). Overall, I like both companies and projects about the same, but I'm not sure which I should select.

Here are the offers:

Germany - (EUR) 85k base + \~1.5-month salary as a  yearly bonus, 5k for relocation, 2k for home office setup, they also help with visa and finding the apartment. Flexible hours, 6 weeks of vacation, permanent contract

UK - (GBP) 60k, flexible hours, 5 weeks of vacation, help with visa and finding an apartment

The offer for Germany seems to be much better, but I'm not sure if Germany is a good choice career-wise. I'm still at the beginning of my career (2.7 yoe) and my target is to eventually get into the USA. My current plan is to switch language (PHP -> C#/Java maybe) and get into a bigger company that might eventually offer L-1B visa, and it seems that the UK would be a better choice as there are more companies and opportunities, I also will have a chance to practice my English. Germany on the other hand seems to have a smaller IT market and learning German will lessen my capacity to do useful stuff like obtaining certifications or grinding Leetcode.

&#x200B;

I would really appreciate some advice from more experienced colleagues on how to proceed here and whether taking a less attractive offer in the UK will actually provide a noticeable benefit in achieving my goals.

I do want opinions of the challenge because I think its a little excessive, but maybe they were aiming for someone w/ more seniority who could do this in a couple of hours. I really suck at time estimates so I initially thought it wouldn't take long. I've done it 70% and send it like that.

169mabr,Looking for advice: Berlin vs Dublin,"Hello! I currently have an offer from Berlin and one from Dublin. I'm looking for some advice on which offer looks better. Some background about me:

I have close to 4 YOE and most of my work has been on Java and its tech stack. My current TC is 60k EUR + 4k yearly bonus. I'm a non EU citizen currently living in Dublin. I use public transport heavily as I don't (can't) drive. My job was fully remote until now but the company is forcing us to RTO and it will take me close to 4 hours to travel to office and back home which is why I'm looking for a job change. I tried searching for a house share/apartment close to the office but I found a job sooner so you can guess the situation of the housing scenario in Dublin. I'm reading about a similar crisis in Berlin as well but not sure how bad it is. What do you guys think about the below offers? Happy to add any more information that you might need in giving me some suggestions.

**Berlin offer:**

**Company:** German equivalent of Tier 2 company based on this ([https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/))  
**TC:** 75K EUR base + 3k relocation reimbursement  
**Role:** Software Engineer  
**Pros:**   
\- Company is well known in Germany  
\- Work seems to be quite exciting and challenging  
\- Lower cost of living in Berlin? (Source: [https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare\_cities.jsp?country1=Ireland&country2=Germany&city1=Dublin&city2=Berlin](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Ireland&country2=Germany&city1=Dublin&city2=Berlin))  
\- Scope for learning new technologies  
**Cons:**  
\- Browsing through the subreddit I have seen mixed reviews of the company wrt WLB and culture. But the conversations that I had during the interview were quite amazing and the team seemed quite chill.

**Dublin offer:**

**Company:** Irish startup which has been around for a while.  
**TC:** 72K EUR base + 10% yearly bonus + 100 RSU(private company so worthless for now)  
**Role:** Software Engineer  
**Pros:**  
\- Company reviews are quite nice  
\- I am already in Dublin so no hassle of relocation  
\- Scope for learning new technologies  
**Cons:**  
\- Dublin (Although I love the city it doesn't feel sustainable for me in the long term)

But I feel continous pressure from my management and from the ""IT field"" in general to always thrive for more, learn new things etc.  
  
Listening to my management, the company expects from me that I should already be familiar with a bunch of the modern technologies and concepts, like Docker, K8s, multithreading, messaging queues, cloud, deep UI frameworks knowledge (I am primarily a .net dev, I do some UI stuff but not really into it ). Well I do have an overall understanding of those things but mostly only like ""I understand the concept"".  
  
What I was doing for this time on the project is mostly debugging, extending an existing functionality without major/huge changes, fixing bugs and small troubles.  
  
I did feel that those things are getting easy and switched the project now where I hope to learn more, however I don\`t know how to deal with their ""shame on me"" that I should already be this and that, give a solution ideas, and other people of my YOE are giving speaches at a conference and here I am not knowing how to deal with race conditions or whatever more advanced topic you can put here.

They also teach us that the salaries are slower to adapt, given the salary negotiations happen on a yearly basis for most people, and a raise oftentimes means switching jobs, which many people aren't keen of.

The last months before the ""freeze"" and rounds of layoff on the tech job market, the salaries were beginning to catch up. Am I the only one finding it strange ? It seems like the companies have teamed-up to increase their profits by raising prices and freezing the job market.

I understand VC-funded companies having to get rid of part of their workforce due to interest rates, but I find no explanation for big profitable companies to stall in what is probably the best time to hire talented people.  


Do you also thing that they might be fixing prices ? Would it be illegal in some ways given the job market is a market ?

I have observed that in Software, the tech scene in the US is quite a lot better than in Europe.   
In fact, salaries in tech hubs here are less than half of what one gets in tech hubs in the US (e.g. Seattle).  
The top tech companies in Europe are themselves American (e.g. Google).   
Outside of ML/Data Science, the diversity of jobs available in Europe is also quite low (e.g. it is harder to find a job in cloud computing in Europe than in US).

11cd4v9,Java vs C# jobs in Europe - where to focus my efforts?," 

I started as a junior a year ago initially hired to work in Java. Due to company circumstances, I didn't do much actual Java work (just debugging a legacy code) and 9 months later got moved to C# project. First it was slow, but now I have been working quite intensely building APIs. I have an interest mainly in backend work, and so far in my job I've mainly done REST API and used cloud/serverless technologies.

Couple of months ago I had decided to prepare for Java interviews regardless since I thought it's more widely used (more widespread) and I seemed to enjoy the language more. I started SpringBoot courses, leetcode challenges, etc with the idea to build my own project in my spare time. However, the more I work in the .NET project at work, the more exposed I am to .NET concepts and courses and the more difficult it is to switch to Java after work and during weekends. It feels the Java progress is very slow this way and it would take me many many months to feel prepared for any interviews..

Question to experienced devs, what is your view of C# vs Java market, what kind of companies/products use each language, do I Just have to pull my sh\*t together and work harder to prepare for Java or would you say since I'm already doing C# all day long it wouldn't be such a huge compromise to switch to C# jobs instead in the interest of moving forward with my career ?",2023-02-26 11:01:49

**Background:** After 3yoe as a full stack dev and investing a bit in my linkedIn profile (still no profile picture though - getting a non-festival photo of me is on my todo though!) I get more and more contact requests from recruiters.

I already am mindful of my time (i.e. they have to be upfront, I don't initiate anything), but I wondered: Is there any harm to blindly accepting any contact request? The only reason I can think of is literately getting spammed with requests once a certain desirability threshold it met (but right now, that is not a problem for me).

17i8ul7,Migrating to the US or Canada after getting a EU citizenship,"Having recently acquired my German citizenship, I've been giving some thought to possibly moving to the US. I first visited the country in 2011, right after high school, and was quite taken by it. However, enjoying a country as a tourist or student doesn't necessarily equate to enjoying it as a worker. I earned my master's in Computer Science a year ago and have accumulated over three years of professional experience, encompassing both my present position and some freelance work. My current job is quite relaxed, devoid of intense stress. While the pay is decent but not outstanding at €60K annually, there are other perks that compensate, such as the flexibility to work from home, a healthy work environment, and involvement in research-driven open-source projects.  
  
Here's why I'm drawn to the idea of relocating to the US:  
1.) The people seem friendlier and more approachable.  
2.) The promise of better weather.  
3.) A desire for a change from the prevailing attitudes in Germany and Northern Europe.  
4.) Fond memories from previous visits.  
5.) Potential for increased savings.  
  
However, I do have some reservations:  
1.) Concerns about the reported levels of violence in the US.  
2.) Stories of software engineers burning out.  
3.) The American healthcare system.  
4.) The potential for excessive work hours.  
5.) The possibility that I've become so acclimated to German work culture (without being aware of it) that I might struggle to adapt to the US work environment.  
  
Holding German citizenship allows me to enter the green card lottery, which I've already done. Another path to US residency would be the H-1B visa, though that might require employer sponsorship, which could be a more challenging route. If I'm fortunate enough to win the green card lottery, is making the move the right decision? I've also considered Canada. Would it be a simpler migration process for someone with German citizenship? Does Canada offer advantages over the US? is it worth moving from Germany to there? Or should I consider Spain, Poland, Estonia etc.?",2023-10-28 07:52:19

I'm 23, 4+ YOE, and graduated from BCs a few months ago (yes I did it working and studying full time). I moved to Switzerland 1 year ago for a fully remote job (90k). Great for WLB to continue both activities in parallel, I'm not sure if I want to continue with my university education.

Goal: Enter a big FAANG before I turn 25, pursue a software architect / team-leading path (I like distributed systems)

Why do a Master:

* FOMO and Self-pride
* I can handle double full-time stress now that I'm young
* Learning multiple stuff and maybe finding something I'm more passionate about

Why don't do a Master:

* Lot of stress and poor WLB
* Opportunity cost to learn actually useful stuff and contribute to open source projects that may have more relevance to the FAANG path
* Being stuck at my place for 2+ years.

I asked the seniors last week but it was a busy week. I still thought they could book a session for this week. This week was also a bit busy the first two days due to planning but the planning went well and for example today and friday there's not a lot of meetings. 

I created a group chat with the seniors as well. They attributed me a task with a good realistic timeline and said they'd do a walk through but still no meeting. 

Should I insist again? It would be like the third or fourth time I ask for a meeting. They told me I have 2 months to complete the task (which probably a ""normal"" person would do like in 2 or 3 weeks) but still one of them is not allocated full time and the other will also decrease allocation in the future. I will be the only backend dev with 100%. 
Shouldn't they like be giving me a strong onboarding so I get into it as fast as possible? The director said the only reason he placed me in this project is because he had two seniors that could take some time to guide me. am I supposed to chase it? 

Everyone is cool but I get the feeling they don't like me because I am the tester. I am also a career changer, so I feel like they think bootcamper tester trying to be developer and making them lose their time. 

I don't want to be annoying but some sessions to help me through the codebase, with focus in the part where I will work, would be useful specially because its a big complex project. I am not saying explain the code, I can search technical things. I just want an explanation of architecture, flows and how it integrates with other parts of the system which I can't google obviously.

However, in some EU countries such as Germany and France, it hasn't really affected them (or at least they will be the last workers to be laid off) because of the strong employee protections. In fact, I heard that big tech is offering EU workers 2 years of their salary if some the Senior people leave. So I wonder, which country where it would be the most difficult to be fired? This would be a great place to settle if you have enough experience and get a comfy salary and just live life. Also, I wonder if it is common for senior workers or management to transfer to the European office in FAANG or other american companies just for these employee benefits (but I got a funny feeling that it would be the other way round since US pays more and has more ""exciting"" projects)

Do you personally learn on the job or would you:
- Work on personal projects?
- Read books?
- Follow tutorials/workshops?
- Get certificats like aws, scrum...
- Keep changing jobs
-...

This is a little bit long as I feel a little lost and I want to share my own experience but I would appreciate if anyone answer the question above if he don't have time to read all this.


I have been working for a company for 4 years now (startup) and it wasn't that bad as it was my first real world experience, it was more than just creating a CRUD application/service as it was working with terabytes of data, I am working on a large application so I found myself lucky helping to scale it up to support more users and I was flexible picking my own tasks and challenges...

I leaned a lot during the job and my contributions were quiet seen, like I significly reduced the cloud costs, improved performance significantly,  made the app more modular, started using a queue system and separated the services, I refractored some of them, had other teams refactor other modules instead of one big monolithic application, so I am basically the person to go to if someone needs technical advise with our solution or if something goes wrong..., it was a lot of stress but it was part of the experience.

Now I work more on my management skills, leading skills and project management skills which it wasn't one of my strongest skill but so far it has been a good experience and I feel my team is the most team that's achieving stuff, respecting deadlines and more organized and not feeling lost like most of the other teams...

We are like 9 developers in the company not really that big but I had the chance to work with seniors and tbh it never felt that they deserve to be called seniors, maybe they are older and have more years of experiences but when working with them I never felt I could make progress, it didn't feel right for them following a Junior/mid-level person and they are not risk takers, they don't want any responsibility and they are more want to play it safe and have all the requirements defined which is not something you can do in a startup context! they do have knowledge, I admit that, but they just don't seem to want to be the responsible for any product or define a good processes..., so aside from 1 or 2 seniors that I enjoy talking to and I always seek their advice when needed, I don't feel I am learning that much from my colleagues.

I think I was lucky because the startup business has grew and as a result my role grew and I didn't feel the need to change company but I kept feeling lately that the learning curve is slowed, I am doing more of a routine tasks and I always felt bad when thinking that my CV contains one experience after graduating that are not internships.

The reason I am writing this is that today we had a call with a lead from Amazon (it's normal with our business to be in touch with Amazon, we always have calls with product managers, tech architects.. which was also part of the experience that I liked, and never felt intimidated by them, I saw that even big companies could be lost as we are..) but today this call was different, the entire call I was afraid of saying something stupid, maybe part of it is is that the person in the call was a little arrogant but it felt that she knows what she is saying and she seemed a little difficult (I wouldn't want to miss a dead line if I was in her team 😂), that's probably the reason for the success of her team anyway but for me I was presenting my small company, I was the somehow the tech/architect ""expert"", I admit that I can't compare ourselves to Amazon because we have less resources, less experts but still the entire time I felt bad because I wasn't the senior I want to be and even that the call was ok, it still felt I am nowhere close to be a senior, I know I could do better but I am just not sure how...

I don't feel like spending my free time coding and learning new stuff as I want to enjoy my free time but at the same time I feel I am not making any progress with my carrier..., I am thinking of changing my job but I am also afraid to lose the privileges that I have now like the flexibility to pick my own challenges or probably my role in the new company won't be that much significant unless it's a startup which could be stressful but at least still better than someone asking me to do a CRUD application or fix a bug...


Also it seems this period it's quit risky to change job and join a startup, any project could be shutdown at any time if it doesn't get funds.

TL;DR: I've been working for a company for 4 years, I have learned a lot and changed my role from software developer to software architect and I am still trying to improve my skills but now I feel I am not learning as much as I used to and I feel intimidated by other people out there that have more experience and knowledge and I am not sure how to keep myself expert in my field of work.",2023-05-26 17:31:43

126p5pv,"Dead end job, how to proceed?"," 

So I've 8 years of experience as .NET and Angular full stack dev. Since 4 years I'm working at same company. I've moved for this job from my home country to Switzerland. Company is a really big name in the world but the software development part is tiny and product Im working on very old and simple. Recent years were bit crazy with the pandemics and I was afraid to change jobs. I'm kind of comfortable in current position. Don't have to do much, bar is really low but there is absolutely no career outlook here.

Would should do now?

1. Try to find new job asap - market is bit difficult now. I was dreaming about work in big tech but there is no open positions now. I don't want to change from one dead end job to another.
2. Try to develop some new skills in free time and wait for better market? I could brush up the .net or angular stuff. Maybe learn new framework like node.
3. Try to get involved in some side project. I could devote there 20hours a week, but I don't really know where to look for such.
4. I could do some part time university degree. Currently I've only bachelor degree. There are some cool courses on the ETH university called Certificates of Advanced Studies on topics like ML, Data Science?

11xbu9t,Feeling so overwhelmed and tired from work after only 6 months. Is this normal?,"I joined my current company half a year ago. Before that I studied and during studies I worked as tester for 2.5 years then I worked as developer for the last year half-time, so I had in total 0.5 full-time YoE prior to joining. I left my previous job as I felt after a year that I stopped learning, I didn't like the environment and they also started firing people out of the blue.

The current company is an international unicorn with a lot of smart and experienced folks working there, some of them leave and go to FAANG afterwards. They don't have any juniors at all. They offered me literally 2x more money and at interviews everything looked great.

When I joined the company, right from the 3rd day I started getting very demanding tasks with no guidance and in order to complete them, I had to study and work in the evenings and on weekends as all the frameworks and tools were new to me and I felt like I was lost. The codebase is huge and environments are quite complicated, so I wasn't struggling with basing coding stuff, more like with how to do it inside of our huge codebase. I'm working alone on BE, the only other person doing BE is my manager who also does management stuff and doesn't have much time for me nor for coding. I passed the probation period and got feedback that they're very satisfied with me.

Almost six months passed by, but I'm still getting even more demanding tasks, being preoccupied with work all the time and there's no one who could help. In the last month it's taken a toll on my mental health - sometimes I can't even sleep at night and I feel so stressed out all the time. Not because the tasks are demanding itself, but because I feel like there's no one who could help and there's so much of pressure. My manager got to lead another project and he basically just does status checks with me. If I ask him for help, he does help, but I need to wait and I see on him that he's annoyed by it. It also doesn't help that plenty of people got fired, because of restructuring. Even though I'm going to the office, my manager works remotely so we don't really see each other.

I addressed this to my manager on our one to one and he told me he's trying to push me out of my comfort zone, because that's a way how to learn, work should be challenge, expectations should be high, go extra mile bla bla. He also mentioned that when someone helps me with something, they're not working on their tasks, so this will not get better and I need to deal with it on my own.

When reflecting upon the last six months, I feel like this was amazing learning opportunity, as they're very strict with code reviews, they gave me lots of responsibilities, I'm working on loosely defined tasks which I need to define on my own and break them into smaller chunks etc. The pay is also great. But I feel so mentally exhausted and every day I'm going to work I feel so anxious. I do though really like programming and I sometimes program something for fun, but I also want to have social life, so to close my computer at 17 and go to the gym, meet with friends or do whatever I need to do without stressing out I have just another feature that needs to be done and I have no idea how to do it nor will anyone help me with it.

Is this normal or am I too sensitive? What should I do? Talking to my manager is obviously not an option as I already did that, so I feel like either I quit or stay and hope it gets better.

198wop9,How to sell my abilities as a software engineer?,"As the title says I would like to get some pointers on my job applications for companies in EU.
Context: I’m a software engineer from Greece with 10 YOE working on web apps (backend mostly) with 3 different companies/projects on my cv. So last weeks have been kind of an awakening for me, I’ve applied to 20 different senior software engineer positions in The Netherlands (mostly in corporates and series c start ups) and have got so far 0 interviews, I was just plain rejected by email. The reason this comes as a surprise is 2 reasons:

- This is the first time in my career (other than my first job) I’m actually applying and sending cvs. All previous jobs I’ve got were because a recruiter reached out to me, I did the interviews and I was in. Maybe I’m a little out of touch but I had no clue most applications would be rejected. In the last year I did notice a decrease in the number of recruiters reaching out I assumed it was because of the market situation, now I’m thinking my profile is somehow less attractive (?)

- in every company I’ve worked on I always become (not on purpose) one of the “essential” employees. This is mostly because I have a very good memory and I can remember details of the systems that most people forget or need to look out, so I’m basically a walking Wikipedia of the architecture and the code which comes in handy in many situations. Also I’m very good at delivering projects that have been deemed “undeliverable” because I’m also very good at thinking out of the box. In all previous jobs I was the one deciding to change jobs and every time my manager would do everything possible to keep me from going (throw in promotions, matching salary, more benefits) so this is how I came to understand I was in some way good at my job.

The problem is: I don’t see how I can “sell” myself when I’m applying and make the hiring teams see that I have these good qualities. I definitely don’t want to play the card of “all my companies have begged me to stay”.

Also for reference I updated my cv to match the Harvard style as show in this page https://cdn-careerservices.fas.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/161/2023/08/College-CS-Resume-Example.pdf

TLDR; I have good reasons to believe I’m a good software engineer but I don’t know how to show my non-technical abilities (which is my main advantage compared to other candidates) to recruiters to get an interview",2024-01-17 13:35:39
194vm92,How Do Companies Determine Who Gets Laid Off?,"Hello everyone,

With the increasing number of layoffs, I've been curious about the behind-the-scenes decision-making process that companies use to determine who gets laid off. I understand this is a complex issue, involving a variety of factors, and I'm interested in gaining a broader understanding of this process.

Is there any framework in the companies to execute these decisions? Maybe, there is an executive on the tech side like a CTO, who could give input here.

How does one decide who and what team is not performing well enough? I am aware of the PIP framework, for example, but not every company uses that. I believe people who got laid off are maybe even outside of these frameworks.

I'm looking to understand both the theoretical framework and real-world applications of these decisions. Any insights, experiences, or resources you can share would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!",2024-01-12 13:55:10

17c6aar,"Career advice, bored Staff engineer, switch back to a startup?","Hi everyone!

I have 13 yoe, from Europe, I've been Lead Software Engineer for 4 years in a startup (10 engineers) and I did pretty well there, lot of impact, very interesting work like complex product features, microservices architecture, gateway, devx tools, standardized logging, error handling, security, etc. anyway don't want to list everything but it was very challenging and I enjoyed it, but I had to work a lot, sometimes late, sometimes on Saturdays..! I was not 'forced' but there was a lot of work to do.

After that (this year), I joined a big scaleup (700 employees, 40 engineers) as a Staff Engineer,I'm doing also pretty well there, in a few months I had a lot of impact, worked on complex projects, architecture, even leading one big refactoring in collaboration with other Staff+ engineers. I had my 6 months 1:1 with my manager and I have excellent 360 feedbacks, nothing average, mostly positive things, and things I have to improve are pretty basic, but, **I'm bored**.

The work there is not challenging at all, most of the things I have to do are 'easy' for me, I'm not learning anything technically, I'm even very disappointed with the code base quality, most of my time I have to talk and/or influence people on some direction, based on certain practices I don't even agree with. People are very friendly, they trust my capacities and I suppose I will be able to grow easily there as a Principal engineer, but again, **I'm bored**.

Salary is good, 90K euros and I can save a lot every month.

So recently I've been contacted by this startup from the US, salary range is up to 150K euros, the position is Principal Engineer, will have a local EU contract (and benefits), already passed the first interview steps (recruiter + technical). The project looks interesting, this is also a greenfield project so I suppose there will be a lot of things to build from scratch, and I think I can enjoy the technical challenges there, but, **I'm scared to go back in a startup** because of the WLB, as I have a kid now. The team is small like 5 or 6 engineers, there is already another Principal engineer, so we will be 2 principal engineers for a small team.

So basically I have 2 choices :

* Stay in my current position as I'm doing very well, continue to earn a very good salary with a really good WLB, but I will continue to be bored
* Go with the startup, and get a big salary jump and be sure there will be things to learn and technical challenges and impact, but I can never be sure of this, even If I ask questions during the interviews (already did) starting somewhere else can come with good surprises but also disappointments.

Any advice? I know it's very personal choice, but I don't really have people around me I can talk to about my situation, thanks in advance!",2023-10-20 08:29:13

15jnvcd,Failing startup… when to switch jobs?,"TLDR: When to quit a failing startup? Would it look better on my resume if I had a 8 month stint vs a 3 month stint? 

I have less than 2 years of experience, and I joined a startup 3 months ago. Everything was really great when I first started, the environment, the people, etc, but now, the environment has become toxic because management made a series of poor financial decisions (renting a new, larger office, hiring a bunch of supposed experienced project managers, and sales experts) and it seems like the money is running out. I was originally planning to stay here for at least a year or two before switching, but I don’t even think the company will last that long. 

The work itself is extremely boring. We’re always adding features to their existing codebase which is written by fresh grads or phd students with no industry experience. So the entire codebase is an entangled mess with simple services needing 20+ different dependencies that have nothing to do with it. And then there are so many parts to the flow that if one repo is updated, it risks breaking the entire flow. It’s a nightmare to code and adapt new features to fit their existing code, and before it was bearable because at least the environment is nice, but now, even the management has become toxic, asking why we aren’t delivering results and asking for updates every 2-3 hours, which is very stressful. They also started to openly criticize people’s work and have no respect for anyone. A coworker who started at about the same time just got a “disciplinary” notice because he was not delivering enough, and I know for a fact that he worked very hard, sometimes even working late to finish projects. 

So my question is: when should I start looking for a new job? If I start interviewing now with 3 months at this job, would it look extremely bad? And what should I say at the interviews about this?",2023-08-06 11:59:41

No exam-like questions. 

Financially, the offer is somewhat below average. Variable compensation makes it attractive, but I'm afraid that in reality it will never be paid out. At the end of the day, they can always claim not to have been satisfied (enough) with my performance to pay me the bonus.

I've already done a lot of research about many different countries (mostly about what life is like there, what are the salaries like for a junior, how much does it cost to live there, etc...) but I don't know how it works in practice.

I'll just write out how I imagine it works in reality and please tell me if it's realistic or how it works differently.

1. I'd most likely just go on LinkedIn and start applying for jobs that I think I'd be suitable for (with different CVs tailored more towards the job description but without really lieing), I'd also DM some hiring managers and drop my CV in case they were looking for someone like me. **What's not exactly clear to me is how I should let them know that I have to relocate before being able to start**.
2. Hope to get some interviews that are on Teams (all of them seem to be on Teams where I live) or if it seems like a really great opportunity then maybe fly over there just for a day or two to go to the interview.
3. Once I manage to succeed and I have a job offer, then it's time to relocate, fly over, maybe stay at an Airbnb for a month (or two?) until I can find a place to live, get my tax number / social security number / whatever else I need to be able to work in the country.
4. Start working.

I'd imagine this whole process could take about 6 months (maybe 7-8 if I'm a junior?).

Any advice / opinions on whether this is realistic is appreciated, I'd also love to hear anyone else's experience in relocating.

18kk67s,Embedded Software Market in Germany,"Hey all,  


Getting to the point. I am working as an embedded software engineer in India in the automotive industry for the past 2 years and I have been having a thought lately of giving a shot to move to Germany.  
I've been doing some research on it lately too and came across the new citizenship law that the German parliament has passed lately and the blue card stuff too.  


I've looked at job postings too and most of them relating to the embedded software industry in Germany is posted by staffing/recruiting agenciesa and that led to a skepticism if they are legit and / or trustable so people who have / had worked under staffing agencies in Germany or anywhere in Europe, please pitch in your inputs.  


And to the embedded folks in Germany, let me know how the embedded scene in Germany currently is. Are they more LC oriented like in the US and does / do you know companies who accept applications from international candidates.  


I've started taking German classes too recently so I am pretty serious and want to make an actual and dedicated effort to make the move soon. So yeah, please free to add any advice that you wanna convey that would make the experience easier for me.

18bdhgo,Should I switch jobs in the current market,"I'm working as a Python dev in my current job for a year now. However, my team's responsibilities have shifted quite a lot to devops (e.g. Kubernetes management, Jenkins pipelines) tasks, and there are less and less Python work for us. I took most of the devops work since no one wanted to and they directly block the customers, but now I become the go to person for devops and I get less development work. I also am assigned to maintain an Angular app and thus now I'm responsible for so many different things and not specialize.

I always wanted to simply have the stereotypical boring stable career in the future (not want to work in startups or cutting edge companies) and I heard to achieve that it's best to work in enterprise software, and so I'm thinking of leaving and improve my .NET skills; I did some .NET related things before my current job and really loved it. But I'm not sure of leaving yet, considering the market in pretty bad shape and I may have to get a pay cut. I'm also still learning new things in my job, although not directly software design but more about deployment.

17s6to0,Confirmation bias of foreigners.,"I would like to talk about something I noticed. I'm from one of the EU countries. Recently there's more foreigners coming espiecially for IT jobs. Usually I ask them: ""How is the interviewing? Don't the companies have issues with interviewing you in English?"". They always cheerfully answer: ""No, everyone interviews in English, it's very easy.""

Of course lol, they ain't gonna interview you in the local language. Here's the funny part. Almost every company wants to interview me, a local, in a local language. I've lived in foreign countries for many years and I definietely would like to be interviewed in English because the technical knowledge is easily available in that language. Only a few companies agree to that. 

Conclusion: You might think every company conducts business in English, but it's because only those companies contact you back. If you're a foreigner, you will never know about companies who ignore you because you're not a local.",2023-11-10 15:48:09

17r83fr,Applying to Docker EU,"Hello,

I've made two half ass applications to some docker non-senior backend-engineering positions but never got a reply. I say half ass because I've just applied via linkedin throwing my cv at them.

Concerning my background: I'm a backend-engineer, I've got around 4 YOE in software-engineering in the jvm-field (java, kotlin, scala) and also some data-engineering experience (airflow, google cloud). Docker was always around for me and I also have experience with creating and managing docker images at my current company. Linux was the backbone of my work since I started working, from my local machine to servers running software. So I'm also fairly experienced with this as well.

So now I'm wondering, am I actually interesting for them? When looking at the job descriptions they usually state to have experience with backend (not jvm though) and linux low level stuff. Also working with product, etc. Nothing really special.

Anyone who made it to a Docker EU position who is willing to share some insights?

15knwpk,Job Hopping - when should I stop?,"Hello,

I have had the following stints in the last/this year after graduating with a masters in CS in dec 2021:

1. Jan 2022 - Aug 2022 (8 months)   - Software Engineer (Backend/Cloud)
2. Oct 2022 - April 2023 (8 months) - ML-Engineer
3. May 2023 - Now                              - ML-Engineer

The reason for me resigning was simple, the first time I was bored out of my mind after a couple of months, since the tasks were getting too trivial for me. CRUD Apps on AWS and some DevOps work like CI/CD and infra management. I also had a background in ML from studies and internships and as a working student, so I felt like I would be better suited for that

For my first switch I landed a job at a HW company that was always my dream company to work at. I also wanted to make the switch to MLE from CRUD engineer.

To my surprise, their software practices where horrible. 12000 LoC files with ghost code as far as the eye could see and not a single unit test. The people that wrote the code don't even know what it's doing anymore. Since nobody was able to work on the codebase nobody was productive and it was just a shitshow all around.

In may 2023 I escaped ghost code hell and moved to a company that is not really ""tech"" and once again started as MLE. At the moment I work on an exciting project with cool co-workers doing large scale live ml serving over 4000 requests/ sec. It feels like the stack is cutting edge and the software engineering quality is great from my PoV. The senior engineers also tell me I am doing great for my experience level and I get to have a say on a lot of the design decisions. I feel like it's the perfect job. There is a lot to learn and it feels like the skills that I am learning will be really valuable going into the future.

But here comes the ""problem"":  I have gotten contacted by a Headhunter and after 2 interviews I got an offer for a DevOps position that pays almost double my current salary 72K -> 130K. I would have to move from West EU to Switzerland. I know the CoL in Switzerland is also much higher, but due to lower taxes I would have pretty much tripple my net income and after some calcs (2K CHF+  for Rent, 3 times my expenses for food) I would still be much better off financially.

I think DevOps is fine, but most likely not as interesting as MLE. Either way the pay will make a massive difference and I am sure that I won't hate it. I am thinking that I could do that for 1-2 years and then switch again to a more SWE or MLE related position. It's also on-prem kubernetes instead of public cloud based, which I have done previously and the techstack seems a little bit on the ""old"" side.

On the other hand I think that I will get promoted quickly at my current job. By the words of my team and my boss I am by far exceeding expectations and I am doing an ""amazing job"" (Quote boss).

I don't wanna make my CV look even worse, but this opportunity almost sounds too good for me to pass up on. At this point I don't even know why the hell they wanna hire me so badly, with me just hopping jobs all the time. Should I take the risk and switch again? Would you? I think Switzerland is a pretty good place for developers, but my work life balance might suffer too. Also I am pretty sure my current job is more fun than doing DevOps. I am really torn apart what to do.",2023-08-07 15:28:04
15ay042,UK Job offer: am I selling myself short ?,"Hello, I (22M) just graduated  and have finally received a job offer for graduate embedded software and controls engineer from a consultancy company based in UK (not London).

- Salary: £27k /year
- location: Med. cost of living 
- may require me to get a car 
- company: low number of employees (<10)

My Background:

- Master in mechatronic engineering (Russel Group  , 1st class)
- lot of personal projects and university projects, healthy github portfolio and a technical blog w\ more robotics and ML projects (I enjoy what I do for sure).
- No Actual Work experience in tech. (This is my first job)
- only one 3 Month internship in R&D of robotics/AI company to improve hardware automated testing of product

This post is not meant to brag, I will have to start renting on my own, and have been working part time jobs in the mean time to make sure I will have enough financial stability to start moving out in September.

The salary is reviewed annually but they told me that it is not likely to increase much…
On the other hand, they seem very skilled and professional and it would be good for me to learn from them 

Should I accept this offer ? Although 27k is not a lot compared to other jobs in the market (Glassdoor), I live on my own so I can probably manage but is it worth it ?

To be really honest , I do not know my worth in this work industry..

Update Edit:

It’s been a week and I got two other offers. One big tech consultancy company in Belgium (TMC) and a smaller one in EV and fast cars. I chose the second one because … of a gut feeling, nothing more. I’m super grateful I actually had the chance to pick. 

I accepted my first job offer at 29k/Y and I am really happy about it. Also, as someone has pointed out, I am sorry to be part of those who contribute to this shit job market in UK but I couldn’t afford to let that slip away.

18khg6v,How to best learn new skills in MLOps / MLEngineering in free time?,"### Background

- Studied MINT, but not CS
- 1st job as ML scientist: trained deep learning computer vision models
- 2nd job in ML platform team: maintained internal python libraries, setup CI/CD pipelines, setup ML pipelines in e.g. airflow or kubeflow, investigated new tools for ML scientists (ray, EC2 machines, deeplake, etc.), debugged difficult bugs
- Future: My impression is that it's difficult for me to continue as ML scientist, because (1) most job ads prefer a PhD and publications in that field, (2) I haven't trained models for a while and (3) there seems to be a flood of young data scientist. Instead, the path in ML-Ops / ML-Engineering seems like a better future career pathway.

### Problem

I'd like to improve and widen my existing skills in the MLOps domain. However:

- my current responsibilities at work are not in that area (longer story...).
- I've done several online courses including Udacity nanodegrees. While I perceived them as a great introduction to a new topic, they're definitely only beginner level, not intermediate.

Are there any other courses / personal projects / open source projects you can recommend to upskill myself in my free time?",2023-12-17 13:33:59
18ht5ks,Feedback for take-home URL Shortener Task after rejection,"Hi guys,

I was recently rejected for a job application after a take-home task. There was no follow-up interview to discuss my solution. It was just a straight rejection from the recruiter with a short feedback from the Engineering Manager, which reviewed my solution.

I'm kinda curious, if my solution was really that bad or they were really picky/unreasonable. Usually, with these take-home tasks I always get to the follow-up interview and was almost never rejected so far. But the market is weird at the moment and I get (like a lot of other developers) quite a lot of rejections after applying for a job.

Here are some facts about the job and my profile:

I'm a Back-End Engineer with 6 years of experience. I do Java and Spring Boot and Node.js and TypeScript development. The task required that I provide a solution in Kotlin, even though the company does some Java development as well. I have very limited Kotlin experience from tutorials and this was really the first toy project that I did in Kotlin. I'm aware that there are better practices and libraries in Kotlin to do some stuff. Writing the solution in Kotlin is the reason that it took me around 5 hours instead of the required 2 hours. I had to look up a lot of things.

The job: Senior Back-End Engineer position at a FinTech comapny. Based in Berlin with remote option from Germany. Offering 75k to 90k Euro. A potential offer was going to be probably around 80k Euro.

Here is the solution. The task is located in the TASK.md file: [https://github.com/thisWasFreeFinally/url-shortener/tree/main](https://github.com/thisWasFreeFinally/url-shortener/tree/main)

It is a new, throwaway GitHub account. It is not my main one.

Here is the feedback from the reviewer:

* naming of the rest API endpoints with using verbs in the resource names
* no mention in his solution (documentation) of the collision possibility
* even more, in the code he does check for already existing hashes but completely ignores the path of conflict. instead he returns to the client a potentially wrong short url (pointing to a wrong original url). unfortunately this is a no go. even a mention of this possibility, or a simple basic approach to handle it (even if not perfect) would have been acceptable, but in this case the possibility was completely overlooked.
* to add to the problem, the null check is anyway not thread safe (multiple instances, or just parallel calls to the endpoint will end in that null check to not be reliable)
* the GET does potentially change (writes) to the database by deleting expired entries. By definition a GET should not do such things. If a deletion of expired items is needed, a different mechanism could have been imagined.

Now, I'm fully aware of how hashing works and of the collisions. But I though that by requiring to do a solution in 2 hours, they would focus a lot more on the structure and naming of the project and if it is covered by tests and not on the actual way that the URL is shortened. I was prepared for follow-up questions for better approaches in the follow-up interview.

The last point for the GET endpoint was addressed in such a way, because of time constraints. I really shouldn't have added this expiration at all.

Also, I'm I the only one, who thinks that mentioning concurrency and thread safety in a 2 hour task, when it wasn't even in the requirement, is straight B.S.?

So TL-DR: Is the feedback and the rejection without a follow-up interview reasonable?",2023-12-13 22:30:44
188eqas,"Just got laid off, finding a new job without a degree.","Hello, I just got laid off from my first job after one year. I managed to get this job while still being a student, I feel a bit lost and I would like to know about some things. 

How is the market for people without a degree but with experience? I would love to search everywhere in Europe, some tips on where? Is applying to full remote jobs a good idea so early in my career?

* I think the company I used to work has a good culture it was an amazing environment. We have our own products and they are widely used in Italy, one of the products even worldwide. 
* I worked in the backend using Typescript, we used AWS, Slack, Jira... so really modern stack.

I'm a bit worried since all my experience comes from working on node rather than working on specific frameworks, I learned a lot about project / clean architecture, API design, unit testing, databases, a bit of containerisation and all the sweet backend stuff. 

So the problem is: this kind of position usually requires a lot of architectural knowledge (which in a year I wasn't really able to properly acquire of course, I know how the architecture works, I wouldn't feel competent enough to design it), how this put me versus new college grads with no experience? I didn't sent applications yet but I feel like companies would rather find a person with a degree for this kind of position. Should I apply to any kind of positions anyway?

I'm afraid to focus on new or more on demand skills since they would be skills with no job related experience, and I would have no chance against applicants with a degree, (like react for example, or working in the backend with Python) instead of deepening my knowledge on what I used to work.

Actually is there any room in this market for people with some meaningful experience (I'd consider it really meaningful, college would've never taught me what I learned having a great mentor and staying around other engineers for a year) but no degree? Am I giving myself not enough value? I think I would do a great job, it's more of a ""I don't have the piece of paper"" kind of issue.

Last question: about the interviewing process, I read a lot about US companies and all the leetCode grind. What kind of questions are asked in European companies? Is it leetCode centred like the US? I have some leetCode skills but I'm not as good as solving DP problems level of good.

Another question I have is if the job spec is just, ""Software Engineer"" without showing the level, what do you typically say? I like having someone say to me that you're at ""X level"" but I've never been told, so my level is just a self-reflection on my ability.  
I would like to read about negotiating salary, generic interview preps, etc. Is there any guidance you recommend that's changed your process with interviews?",2023-11-10 12:19:38

17ocij5,Non-technical boss driving me insane,"My bosses' boss, let's call her Mary, is driving me insane. I work at a small start-up (<50 employees) and do data analysis for the company, although this isn't my exclusive role (I also manage other aspects). Mary has no background in stats/epi/data analysis and will send out a ton of ad hoc, very specific data requests relating to random ideas she has about our data. For example, we are working on a study looking at risk factors for stroke, and she will request a table of baseline characteristics of subjects who drink diet coke vs those who don't. When I ask her what the main research question is that she's interested in, she says she is interested in understanding the major lifestyle predictors of stroke. I suggest we look into additional lifestyle variables we have in our dataset (in addition to diet coke use) and perform an adjusted regression analysis, etc. but she was not open to it.  
I've learned recently (through my boss) that she is frustrated by these requests for clarification and additional suggestions, and expects more or less blind execution of the specific analysis she requests. I sent another of Mary's requests to a junior analyst, who came back to her to flat out say the request didn't make sense, and asked for additional clarifications. I'm hoping Mary will start to learn from feedback, but I'm not hopeful.  
My boss spoke to her about having meetings in which data requests could be discussed as a group, with the analytical approach and any clarifications needed discussed, but apparently Mary is offended by the suggestion. How should I approach this situation?",2023-11-05 13:58:57

Employers are more willing to hire somebody like me in case I want full remote (I can stay wherever I want, they don't have to deal with the official issues) even while not staying in the UK, which is not against the rules of other countries if you don't stay there for too long or have insurance etc. But that's not the topic. Most likely they intend to hire me indefinitely and just use my company / contracting as a convenient tool for that, so it's not the usual short time contracting. But technically it's still contracting without the rights of standard employee. So what should be the increase to compensate for the costs I would have to cover?

13lbqzu,"Canada -> deciding to move back to Portugal, and work in a remote position","I am a Canadian residing and working in Toronto, but I hold dual citizenship as I grew up in Portugal. The work-life balance in Toronto has left me feeling exhausted and dissatisfied, prompting my desire to return to Portugal. Despite having a Computer Science degree, my current position at a reputable charity foundation is entry-level and not directly related to coding. However, I am utilizing this role to develop my skills as a Data Analyst. Unfortunately, my current salary is only 55k per year, and although I am on a contract, they plan to convert me to full-time soon. I have been attempting to persuade them to allow me to work full-time in Portugal, as my team does not require physical presence, and even my manager resides in a different province. However, it is highly unlikely that they will approve this request, possibly due to tax implications. Currently, I am still living with my parents and saving as much as possible, and I also own a house in Portugal. Considering that salaries in Portugal are relatively low, I have been exploring remote job opportunities in the Netherlands, Spain, or Germany that would allow me to work from Portugal. I would greatly appreciate any tips or suggestions on how to initiate my job search in these countries. I have already set up some job alerts on LinkedIn for European Union.

I'm moving to Berlin some time this year, hopefully around the middle of the year. I've got a EU citizenship so papers are not an issue but I wanna get a job before moving to avoid myself that stress 😅  


I don't really know what the current market is like in Berlin, been finding a lot of posts from years before, but, as I understand, the market changed a lot these past 2 years.  


I'm also feeling a bit rusty and wanted to do a couple courses on Udemy before moving, one for React and one for Go (used it for a year in my previous job and I think it's the BE language I enjoyed the most).   


I take it nowadays people are looking for fullstack devs more than anything? Is learning React and Go a good option? Ik Go is not the biggest tool at the moment, tho it's been gaining popularity, but I take it React is still a safe bet? Also ik that given my experience I should be able to swtich between languages and I do with every job, I've got no problem with that, but recruiters sometimes get picky and I wanna give myself the best possible setup before I jump on interviews.

Was already more convinced after having a performance review with my manager. And he wasn’t satisfied with my performance as I lack the “growth mindset” and my technical skills is somewhat lacking. Which is fair enough, as I believe that to be the case as well.

19afsb1,Junior Software Developer from Turkey. Is immigration to EU worth it for me?,"Hello, i'm a 25 yo. CS grad. I graduated from one of the of top 3 technical universities in Turkey last year.

I've been working since august 2023 in a startup as software developer. I code mainly in Java. My salary is 750 € after taxes.

Currently thanks to my supportive parents i have my own house and car and live in a good district of Istanbul where QoL is on par with European countries but cost of living is 50% lower.

I spare 400 € each month after spendings.

After years, i can earn here up to 2000-2500 € as senior developer. But that seems like a upper limit.

Why do i think of moving out of Turkey is: because i'm pessimistic about my countries' future. Currency isn't stable and my salary fluctates too much. I want more stability.

My salary isn't sufficient enough to buy imported goods, tech devices such as new PC, console, phone etc. And I struggle to travel because of weak currency.

Reasons for me to immigrate to EU is, to get an EU citizenship (hence a stronger passport without visa requirements), earn more in Euros and travel more. Also i don't think Turkey will improve in the future and go for worse, so i want a more stable lifestyle.

But i'm not sure if jumping from a rent-free, easy life to a new life with unknowns, paying rent for every month.

I don't want to work in Southern and Eastern Europe countries because i know it's not worth it. My quality of life is already slightly better than these places.

I think of working in one of Germany, Austria, UK or Nordic countries.

How will my QoL change? Will this shift in my life worth it? What would you suggest to me?

* Working as a developer on AI related tasks (using LLM providers)

* Compensation between €75K - €80K, but unlikely to increase much in the next few years

* 100% remote with nice culture

* Flexible and good work life balance


Offer B: 

* Known US based company

* Compensation between €100K - €120K

* Working as a partner engineer (half project management / working with partners and half engineering)

* 100% remote but might be 50% in office (I am fine with this)

* Somewhat flexible and ok work life balance (team has good work life balance at least)


I'm more interested in the role of offer A, but only slightly, while the compensation for offer B is hard to ignore.

My options are:
The UK or Sweden: apply for a one-year master's degree.
Germany: apply for a two-year master's degree.

I've heard many good things about Sweden, but honestly, most of those things don't really benefit me (as I'm not planning to start a family soon) which makes me think I'm trading a lower salary for things I can't even benefit from(except for the more casual work-life balance which is cool).
I don't know very much about the UK but the salaries for tech jobs seem to be way higher than (more than double) Sweden.
Then we have Germany which is a popular destination for many people in the same position as me, with good paying jobs and overall nice quality of life. I am aware that germany is behind sweden in many ways( mostly related to usage of modern technologies in everyday life) but those things are negligible if the salaries are way higher in my opinion.

As for language, I have no problem learning the language of the destination country.

Also, my best friend just moved to Sweden, so I'm more inclined to go there too, but seeing in many sources that salaries in Sweden are much lower than the other two is making me worried as I don't want to regret my decision later on.

- Got fed up of not living up to my potential. 4 months of self learning and grinding. Oct 2017. 20k comp at no name driving 100 miles a day.

- After 1 year swapped to London job 30k. Baited and switched. So changed companies after 4 months. 2019 now

- Learned a lot at this new company about microservies, messaging, caching etc (Fintech). 35k. Quit after 18 months. At the time, wife pregnant. Needed more money for a mortgage, they were only willing to budge by promoting me to mid level. 2021

Latest company, mid level 45k. Fully remote, old tech, feel like I've been stagnating for 2 years now. 2023

Total exp just over 5 years. But feels like around 3 at best. 

Current offer: 65k with bank, working on trade processing. High transactions. 2-3 days in office.

This look like a good offer? Sorry for the boring wall of text.",2023-04-13 16:52:31

Paradoxically, some quick fixes I made as a solo dev on that project are now considered the benchmark. Issue for me is that now my tasks are less about coding and more about documentation and coordination. I occasionally look at the code if things go wrong and find what went wrong to document it.

18nho3d,Bad idea to accept a Rails dev job?,"Currently working as a back end C#/.NET dev with about 3YOE. I've got an interview for a new job that uses Rails. I'm relatively comfortable in Ruby/Rails, so I'm fairly confident I'll get an offer. 

My current company is pretty big, good benefits, and the pay is OK (£45K) for my area. Rails company is small, pay is £52K, and they haven't advertised much about what other benefits they have (pension plans, bonuses, etc).

Apart from some concerns about what benefits might be available, my main concern is if it's a bad idea to accept a Rails job at this point in my career. I'm under no illusion that Rails is what it once was, but I'm also not a Rails doomer shouting ""Ruby/Rails is dead"" from the rooftops like some people. 

I'm not the biggest fan of C#, so a change in language is welcomed, but just wondering if I'd be better off not taking this job (assuming benefits are passable) and picking up something else with a bit more momentum (Python or Go spring to mind).",2023-12-21 07:47:58

17dnju4,Help me decide where to move (🇫🇮->🇩🇪/🇳🇱/🇮🇪/🇬🇧),"My dudes, I’m a non EU currently finishing my Bachelor’s in Finland while working as a Full Stack SWE. I have almost 1.5 YOE now and would have 2 YOE at the time graduation. I’m planning to relocate to either Berlin/Amsterdam/Dublin/London. I’m kinda confused which cities should I aim for. I’m doing LC and prepping for DSA stuffs so ya would probably apply to FAANGs as well (in addition to the top paying non FAANG companies)

Now, I have few criteria which I would like to compare all the cities with before I make a move:

1. Sponsorship: I would require a sponsorship/work permit/Blue card thing to work in any of the cities mentioned. So for my YOE and background which cities would be more easier to get into? Heard that German Blue Card is quite easy and NL also hands out work visas quite easily?

2. English speaking city: I would love to relocate to a city where I would not feel outsider for not knowing the native language (if it’s not English). So London and Dublin come preferable in this category.

3. More savings in net: Netherland’s 30% ruling looks a good deal. I would like to save more in net as much I can. 

4. Lower deposit to buy first home: I would want to buy a home rather rent within a year of relocation. London offers low/zero deposit schemes for some criteria. 

5. Weather: I hate winter, it’s been horror to live in Finland for past years during winter. Nice weather in the new city would be really nice!

6. Easier path into settlement/citizenship: I relocated to Finland as I wanted to settle here permanently. But later figured out I dont like it here. Now I want to make a last move to a city where I would feel belonged and I would integrate with the culture and maybe get citizenship. So an easier path would be nice!

So, please help me figure out which city would be the best deal for me. Thanks in advance!

15llcqm,About to start a CS degree (I am 37),"Hello guys, first post here.  
I am about to start a bachelor degree in CS, at 37. This means that when I will graduate I will be at least 40. I currently work and I have 10 years of experience in various multinational companies. The pay is nothing to complain about but I feel like I am meaninglessly jumping from a job to another, without having specific competencies or even being competitive. So I decided that it would be good to be specialised and do something that I enjoy (I always liked tech, computer in particular and I really like programming even if I am not really good yet), and having a cs degree, I reckon, could help.  
 I won't ask whether I am too old or not, I guess there's plenty of posts like that all indicating that a degree is useful no matter the age...and at 40 nobody is really that old.  
Could you guys share your experience if you did the same thing or went to a similar path?

15fevau,Where to move out from NL - to Swiss/Basel or ES/Barcelona?,"hello colleagues

&#x200B;

I moved from east EU country to the Netherlands, I'm here for short time, 30% ruling and a big company. Made good frieds, work environment is great. And for me personaly and comparing to my previous country, that's all of pros. I want out.

For cons: 

\- the housing market is unbelievably wrong. Either I pay 3500e monthly for next 30 years, either I pay 2500 and drive 1h daily and loose that time with my family. Nursery is 2000e, afternoon primary school is costly also - and I'm lucky to get a slot. Everything - products or services - went very expensive.

\- both working with my wife, both on 30%, earning together 180k yearly - we feel almost  poor. And single salary is not sufficient to sustain.

\- job market is limited. Many HQ are in the NL, but comparing to Poland (where NL, DE, BE, FR,UK are outsourcing jobs), not a big choice. Brutt salaries were the same for me, but COL is 2.5x more. 

So I'll just make space for another guy wanting to get to the NL. But I can't decide where

\- Switzerland/Basel - pros: good highly paid jobs match my profile, good opinion on environment for children, high COL but good ratio to salary, many skilled foreigners. cons: work permit for me and my wife, some people say it's ""stiff"" mindset compared to relaxed NL

\- ES/Barcelona - pros: salary/COL ratio similar to PL, big job market (ES is cheap outsourcing country same as PL), multicultural and vivid city for events, more sunny days and sea for children, spanish language

Optimally I wouldn't want to tell until I sign a contract, since I'm not sure if I will even be able to get the job that I'm wanting to pursue.

* Very good pay for a junior (€50k/year gross), even for the standards of the country in question. Solid benefits.

12wnq31,"Sadness and guilt of leaving a company, how to inform the boss about leaving?","I have been working in a small company in Germany for the past year as a student and recently I have gotten a good full time job offer as as a Data Engineer. I have already accepted the new offer, signed the contract and even got my Bluecard 2 days ago but I dont know how to inform that I am leaving to my current supervisor.

&#x200B;

To shed a bit of light on my situation, I have been working in a really great team for the past year, had a great German guy as my supervisor (literally one of the nicest ppl I have ever met in life) and had a great professional experience. I have been working as student in the company because I am a masters degree student in Electrical Engineering but working as a DE for the past 2 years, have decided to continue as a DE and thus started looking for fulltime positions a while ago until I got the offer. A while ago I indirectly asked my supervisor if we have a fulltime vacancy in the company in which he replied no (and I knew it already cause we had a 15% layoff round recently).

&#x200B;

the problem is that I think my supervisor has no idea that I have been looking for fulltime jobs and I want to tell him tomorrow which I guess will catch him off guard. Also I dont know how to tell him? how much details should I share with him about new job? I feel extremely sad that I am leaving this company because of the great people I was working with, is it normal to feel this way? (this was my first experience in the industry)

Also the guilt: I renew my contract with current company every 3 months and I have 0 notice period on it and my current one will expire in 2 weeks. Couple of days ago my supervisor asked me if I wanted to continue my contact which I replied that I will inform him next week. Then he asked if I want to continue here after my contract which I said yes, because at the time I didnt know if I would get bluecard and new job wasnt secured, so I didint risk loosing the current job and I lied  that I will continue which is eating me alive (ofc didint sign anything).

190cl7h,Giving up DevOps Engineer (Software Engineer) career in Germany?,"Dear Redditors,

I am reaching out with some concerns and questions regarding my future career path and would appreciate your insights.  


Introduction:  
I am originally from South Korea and have had diverse professional experiences in the tech industry, primarily focused on AWS, Kubernetes, and Java. Here's a brief overview of my journey:

Graduated and worked as a Software Engineer (A Big-Tech Firm) in the USA for 6.5 months. I had an issue with my OPT and visa so I had to move back to Korea.  
Worked as a Software Engineer in a Blockchain Solution company in Korea for 1 year and 3 months, transitioning to DevOps Engineering.Experienced a layoff during the COVID pandemic.  
Worked in real estate management and freelancing with Kubernetes and Linux for 1 year and 7 months.  
**Moved to Munich, Germany in last November to work as a DevOps Engineer (Consulting Subsidiary from an Automotive Company) with Kubernetes and EKS responsibilities but got laid off during the Probation Period (Total 6.5 months). My previous manager gave me a feedback that my previous technical experiences do not fit with their tech responsibilities.**  
**Then, joined a big IT Consulting Firm (Ca\*\*\*\*\*\*i) with AWS and Python responsibilities but faced a layoff during the probation period again (Total 5 months) because many projects were under budget constraints and I could not find billable tasks during the period.**   
I am currently unemployed with a Blue Card visa.  
Passionate about staying in Germany and improving German language skills (B1).

My Concerns:  
(1) Considering a career change outside of tech due to uncertainty about my aptitude for technical roles. I chose Bachelor's degree in Computer Science for visa reasons, but I find debugging and problem-solving challenging.  
(2) Frequently receiving interview invitations for DevOps/Cloud Engineer positions but concerned about the potential long-term harm of project-based tech careers after moving to Germany. I have one upcoming final interview with a Big Consulting (SI) Firm soon.  
(3) Every time I get rejected upon tech interviews, hiring managers prefer senior DevOps Engineers.  
(4) Considering a shift to Backend (Java/Python) development despite having been away from it for a long time.

My Questions:  
**(1) Not really sure whether I really have talents in debugging and problem-solving, should I explore other careers or attend vocational school for alternative jobs?**  
**(2) I am allowed to be unemployed only 3-6 months in Germany. If I receive an offer from an Outsourcing/Consulting firm within the short job search period, should I accept it despite the potential drawbacks of project-based tasks and harm of tech-careers? If I decline offers from consulting (SI) companies, is changing to a language student visa a fine option while applying to Product-based companies and attending German language school?**  
**(3) Is it better for me to shift my career back to backend development (For a few years)? Or should I continue applying for DevOps Engineering roles?**

I truly appreciate your valuable insights and feedback. I am committed to improving based on your responses.  
Best Regards,  
A DevOps (Software) Engineer Candidate",2024-01-06 22:49:33

18bn72x,[Booking.com] Tech & Cultural Interview Feedback/Advice,"Hi, guys. Recently I've had an interview at [Booking.com](https://Booking.com).  I wanted to ask you about how to pass to it next time, because It seems that I probably, somehow, failed Cultural part.

\---

**YoE**: 7

**Position (at Booking):** Full-Stack Software Engineer

**Location**: Amsterdam, NL (for me relocation & visa support is required)

**TC:** \~90k + 15% bonus + stocks (don't remember)

**Result**: Rejected

\---

The process:

1. **Online Assessment** (Hackerrank Test + small code challenge) -> almost 100% passed
2. **Onsite tech.**

That was something I didn't feel good about after I was told that it's 3 interview in 1,5h (Backend, Frontend and System Design) 30min each.

Okay...I was in a rush there, but seemed to be OK, although I was confused by Booking com having such interview format, because it literally doesn't have any common sense.

I felt they were in a hurry with the process.

3. **Cultural Fit**

I got an email that they are excited to proceed.

The call was with one manager and Tech Lead (I guess).

There were different questions, ""Why Booking?"" was as well.

I wanted to discuss two items in particular:

**Q:** ""How do you prioritise what to work on inside the team""

**A:** I was describing how things work at one of my previous company (large scale, lots of microservices). Described that we have one department-level planning in a year and all the initiatives that needs to be done e2e are taken by every team that is in services chain.

Inside the team, we are free to choose what initiative to work on. (every member takes 2-3 initiatives per year apart from KTLO activities).

**Feedback given:**

*""Lack of experience in deciding in a team,  referred to ""what was given to him""""*

*""lack the customer centricity on what is priority""*

&#x200B;

Didn't get it. I mean, on a such scale one service team has a very small impact on the whole e2e chain. I'm free to choose from the given action items (to take and implement it from raw business requirements to rollout), but what was the feedback about? Sure thing I can suggest something to improve, but reality is usually about business goals.

*""lack of data-based decisions""*

We didn't work the way Booking com. does, I guess, our service was Gateway-like 100% backend service (mentioned it), couldn't come up with any data-based decisions inside the team apart from Operational activities such as scaling based on incoming and projected traffic.

&#x200B;

I really want to understand, what is expected here and what is it about.

&#x200B;

Thanks a lot. Any questions are appreciated, will be answering in the comments section.

160y7b2,"Amsterdam vs Warsaw, I need advice","Hey, I'm Dutch with 4yoe and CS bachelor degree. For the past 2 years I've been working in a Dutch company in Amsterdam (AI/ML Dev) and it was fairly comfortable for me but also a bit too boring. Recently I started looking for a bit more challenging job and apart from a few similialy paid offers from France and Germany, I also received an offer for 78k EUR net in Warsaw + relocation package. I currenly have around 45k EUR net so it would be a HUGE jump for me with lower cost of living and I feel like I could save a lot compared to work in NL. My gf (also Dutch, works in accounting) is not convinced as neither of us has ever been to Poland and we pretty much know nothing about life there. My current view is that I could work for 3-4 years, save a bit of money and maybe move elsewhere or go back to The Netherlands. How's life in Warsaw these days, I'm particularly worried about racism(?), potential job for my gf as she (unfortunately) cannot switch to remote, and about the language (do people in general speak English, I also speak a bit of German)?",2023-08-25 12:42:02
15ubpk7,Career choice in Germany,"Recently I graduated with a PhD in Machine Learning, and landed up as a Deep Learning Specialist in  a Tier 1 automotive supplier. But unfortunately after a month I found out that job description and the daily job does not have any match. I spoke to the hiring manager, and his vision for the role is completely different to what my expectation is. 

Currently I have another offer from a US startup for remote job where I will be heading the AI research. I will be tasked with building the AI research team and the direction is interesting. The salary is also close to 2x more (as they are paying US rate) than what I am making now. But it is a risky preposition as they are still in pre seed funding.

I have the following questions

1. Will working in a no name startup is recognised when I look for a job later if the startup is not working out ?

2. Is it a good idea to risk at this point in my career? I have no industry experience until now 

3. Is it a good idea to stay in the Tier 1 company and look for an internal switch if it comes at any point?

14jjdej,Stay in this job or leave,"Hello,  
I would like to hear other opinions since I do not know very well how to approach this situation.  
I have been working for a little over a year in a company as a data engineer. Before this, I spent 6 years as an analyst and in total, I have more than 10 years of experience in technology.  
  
The first months in this company were good, until they asked me and a couple of colleagues to help support the data science group. I'm going to call them A and B. A came from a not CS field. From the very beginning, A acts as if he were the boss, B begins to question his authority and decisions, and before long, B leaves the company.  
  
I am a direct person who likes to work in a team and I do like to get along with people, but from the beginning I see that my work is in the background, A usually takes the credit, he usually makes comments questioning what I say and attacking my performances or way of working especially in public. He acts like he's my boss when he's not. I know he works alone normally, even after hours and on weekends. This contempt has led me to question whether I myself have a problem. I get along well with the rest of my coworkers, and A gets along well with them, or so it seems.  
  
I can't go to my boss because she has basically delegated the management of people and tasks to him, so even though he's not officially the boss (he himself has commented that he was waiting for a promotion, surprise, it's not happening) he acts almost as such. Several juniors are under his charge.  
  
I can tell I'm starting to feel burnt out and I don't like it. Apart from this, the company has a good conciliation policy, hybrid, my salary is good, many vacation days and summer hours.  
  
What should I do? Update my CV and go? I don't think it has to do with it but I'm a woman. Sorry if my English is not the best, it is not my first language. Thank you.",2023-06-26 14:49:19

1472wnt,Is London a good place for a CS career in the UK? Or choose somewhere else?,"Hi,

Currently working a remote job (junior web dev) in the southeast of the UK, the office is based in a town outside London. Earning 25k at the moment, also had a short stint at a very outdated company using Classic ASP, so I have about 2.5 years experience.

I'm looking to make a move to a new role sometime soon, as pay is low and the work is boring, perhaps aiming for a mid-level role. I'm in my early-mid 20s so was hoping to move to a city for the social opportunities, plus jobs around here are very limited, you only see about 5 postings at a time and I think they're always the same small but established companies, which don't seem to be doing exciting work.

I'm currently renting a flat with my friend, I was hoping to move to London if I got a job there. I'm aware I could live outside London and commute in if I get a hybrid arrangement, but I was hoping to live and work in a city as I'm a bit tired of living in a small-ish town.

I see a lot of talk about London being one of the best places in the EU to work as a dev, or at least the best place in the UK. However I've noticed that the average salary, or at least the one I could probably attain as someone with 2.5 years experience, is about 60k, which doesn't go very far in London, as the minimum rent for a tolerable 1 bed flat seems to be about £1800, and that's outside Zone 2... Unless you want to go far out to the suburbs which are mostly young families and maybe don't have a huge amount going on, or renting a tiny studio where you would have no room for a WFH setup. I know one pretty talented guy who was renting in London, and forced to move to a commuter town recently because of high rents.

I'm aware that most people in London share a flat with strangers or friends, but I was under the impression that working as a dev in London gave a good QOL, but I wouldn't consider flatsharing to be a great QOL, and it doesn't seem to be quite as commonplace outside London/south UK for people in good jobs.

I've considered other places in the south, e.g. Brighton, but that doesn't seem to have a huge amount of dev roles and a lot of them are based in Crawley (and I don't drive). You also have Bristol but the cost of living has gone up immensely there and it has public transport issues.

It seems like if you got, say, a 40k salary in the midlands or up north, which seems very achieveable, you could probably rent your own flat, e.g. in places like Manchester and Nottingham, while saving more money than in London on 60k, and that money goes further if you're looking to buy a property. I know a guy managing to rent his own flat in Manchester, which really doesn't seem possible in London unless you're working in fintech or other high paying roles.

I'm kind of at an impasse at the moment and not really sure where to go, it feels like my 20s are rapidly disappearing and I kind of hate my job, does anyone have any advice on where to go or what would be a good place for a career + good QoL? I know Manchester is meant to have a decent number of roles, not sure about other cities or if I should just go with London? Just want to get my own place really but don't want to live in the middle of nowhere :D",2023-06-11 19:30:41
13w43me,Extreme differences between salaries for the same company the same title but in different countries.,"I am a phd student and just passed an interview at Amazon as an applied scientist intern.  
I did the same 1-year internship at Amazon in my country last year, and the salary was 9k euros, since I was working at half capacity, I was making about 4.5k euros a month.  


As I mentioned, I recently got accepted into the same internship, same title, same company but now it is in Germany.

I was offered 4.5k per month salary.

At first, I thought that they had already factored in the fact that I am going to work at 50% capacity, so I thought that the full-time job is 9k and the 4.5k is for 20-hour workweek. 

But then I sent an email to request some clarifications, and yeah, the total compensation for 40-hour workweek is 4.5k and I will be making 2250 euros since I will be working 20-hours a week.

Is this normal? Am I the crazy one?

 I can understand some differences between countries, or if Germany was an underdeveloped country, but to offer half the salary for the same position looks absurd to me.  
2250 after taxes will be around 1.7 k, minus rent plus relocation bonus (785 euros), leaving me with about 1-1.2k euros per month (depending on the rent) for everything else.

Will it really be enough for two?

I really want to go to Germany with my wife and have this experience but I don't know if it is feasible. 

Any German folks here that can offer some advice?",2023-05-30 22:24:04

Because the effort  needed to get 10's is a lot more than the effort to get 8's, and it's  not like this is ""quality effort"" either. It's mostly min-maxing exams  and doing more wrote work that in my estimation doesn't really deepen  understanding.

1amzk0b,Would you start job hopping for a few hundreds raise?,"Hi everyone!  


Thank you for stopping by, really appreciate it  
  
I'm an Italian mobile developer with 3 years of experience, split between one year in web development and two years in mobile development. Lately, I've been feeling quite stressed about my financial situation due to the high cost of living expenses like rent, bills, and utilities combined to my low salary.

In my current job, I find myself in a bit of a comfort zone with not much to do at work. However, I'm also involved in a side project with some friends where we're developing an app that we hope to sell B2B. While this project allows me to showcase my tech skills and team leadership, it doesn't provide any income, which is a major concern for me.

This has been concerning mainly because I've been receiving job offers that aren't very appealing, either due to the nature of the projects or the minimal increase in salary they offer (around €200 a month).  
However, I'm worried that if I solely focus on my side project and it doesn't succeed, I could end up stuck in my current position with the same low salary for years, instead of potentially benefiting from incremental raises of changing jobs.

It's a dilemma because while I'm hesitant to constantly switch jobs, in Italy, even if you actively seek a raise, it's unlikely to be substantial - typically just around €50 a month.

I tried searching for a job in other countries but unfortunately I didn't have any chance, probably because of my market niche which offers very little now  
I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or advice on how to navigate this situation. Has anyone been in a similar position before? How did you handle it? Any insights or tips would be highly appreciated. Thank you in advance!",2024-02-09 21:44:55

Overall I'm very happy, company is doing good, managers are nice and not overbearing and good mentors overall. Pay is quite nice for finance in Paris (about 75k total comp before taxes) and i am not willing to move. Working conditionsqand hours are good. (35h/week average).

Are diverse experiences really necessary to get further in your career ? Do three 3 years experience makes you much more hirable and better paid than one 10y experience ? Should I try to move forwards commando or IT quant roles ? 

While my eoy reviews are good, they are not oustanding (reached expectations with no negative points or points to improve) and the hirerarchy is pretty horizontal which leads me to believe a promotion is not on the horizon (except senior status which basically changes nothing but maybe pay).

19596v5,I hate my work equipment. What can I do about it?,"Before I started my new job, I made it clear that I wanted to use a Mac. They said their employees usually use Windows, but there's enough time before I start for them to work something out with IT. I should have known better: I got a Windows computer. I hate this computer. Today alone it showed me two blue screens. Every morning the fans turn up and I have to wait 10 minutes for Microsoft Defender and a gazillion of other security tools to calm down before I can work. Sometimes these tools also randomly decide during the day that it's time for a break. As if that wasn't enough, the IT department is super restrictive in what I can do with the computer. For example, I can't even remove the Adobe Acrobat shortcut from my desktop. Any request I make to IT is always happily dismissed with ""security concerns"". In short, I hate this computer. I really, really can't stand it. Now, I'm not trying to make an argument that Macs are generally better - everyone has their preferences - but for me, this computer is the definition of pain.

  
The iPhone I was told was the standard work phone for all employees turned out to be a used Android phone that cost less than $200 new. It's one of those phones where when you type in a number of your PIN, the screen takes 1-2 seconds to realize that something has happened before showing any reaction. I forwarded all calls to my personal phone and never touched the Android again.

  
I know my problems may sound silly to some, but I'm really unhappy with the way they're restricting my work and the fact that they didn't provide me with the equipment I expected when I made it clear several times during the hiring process. But what's the solution? I've already drafted my letter of resignation. But I hope there's a different solution here. My manager seems to be unwilling to help me. Is quitting really my only / best option?

  
To not sound completely insane I should add that the work itself is also different from what I thought we agreed on (in a bad way). There are a couple of more reasons that resulted in me drafting the letter of resignation but to be honest, as silly as it may sound to some, the equipment is one of the main factors that drives me insane.",2024-01-12 23:28:15

I'm an embedded software engineer with 1.5yoe who just got laid off due to bad economic situation of the company. 

In my free time i started developing simple Console Apps with C# and i really like it, way more than what i did at my embedded job

&#x200B;

i applied to around 30-40 jobs which are in my environment (Junior and normal positions, i am from germany)  and just got negative answers , even tho i just want 55k EUR salary due to missing experience in that field , made 70k in embedded

meanwhile i am getting one recruiting message after another for embedded software engineer positions, i know i will earn more money there but i want to do what is most fun for me and thats C# App development

now i am in this position where i get offers from the unwanted sector and no offers from the wanted sector, so i dont know what to do, i will keep applying and i will start a project which i can show on my CV..

to my question: why is it that hard to get a job in .Net and so easy to start in embedded? is this just a thing in germany (NRW) ?  does anyone have a hint for me

18bluyb,Leaving before layoffs,"I’ll keep it short.

6 years experience currently ~£100k remote, been offered ~£90k on-site with better benefits but me/partner would have to sell up and move house.

Bit bored of my current role and company not doing too great, layoffs are definitely on the cards very soon. Wondering if I should cut my losses and try something new or use whatever time I’ve got left to prep for other interviews. The current market has gotten me a bit concerned but don’t want to jump the gun.

New role is quite a hit (less take home, more commuting, higher COL area) but possibly more opportunity for growth. Current role might be safe for a year or so until work dries up unless I’m cut earlier.

The move is not an ideal location for us so I’m leaning towards staying put for now. Will kick myself if I end up losing my job though.

Flip a coin?

Edit: Thanks for the replies everyone, not sure what I was thinking. I’m going to stay put for now.",2023-12-05 20:45:19

I'm currently working in Milan as an embedded engineer for a consultancy company. 1 yoe but I don't really like the work culture here, not learning much and often working overtime. Also, gross sucks bad, it's around 30k.

I started looking for jobs in the Amsterdam or Berlin area, and suddenly I got contacted by different Belgian consultancy firms.

I already did a couple of interviews, I intentionally did not discuss salary since I wasn't really confident on what is the average salary for my job there and I don't have a good insight of the cost of living.

Actually I am quite excited to have the chance to move, I restricted my eventual choice for Bruxelles or Antwerp.
Excitement that got a bit buffed down after looking through this sub, is working in Belgium really that bad? Should I continue looking in the previous areas? Did not manage to score a single interview for those.

175gr70,Anyone else finding .NET/C# market completely dead in the UK?,"So I have 3.5 years experience with a consultancy, mostly C# specialised but some DevOps stuff, a little bit of FE with React/Angular, worked across three pretty major client projects in that time with 6+ months at each, big projects with a lot to talk about in interviews (big rewrites for the first two, last one was a huge greenfield project, over a year there). First in CS from a Russell Group University. Unfortunately interest rates hit old company pretty hard and was let go in July along with about 200 other people.

Took a few months out as I'd saved enough to not have to work for a while and thought it would be pretty straightforward to get a new role in the Autumn. I was on 54k before being laid off, was hoping for 60+ - As I'm finding though its a horrible market out there. Just a few experiences:

Small Legal IP firm (start of September): ticked all their boxes, great interview and smashed the tech test. Final interview was good too and feeling pretty good about it - couple days later I hear from the recruiter they'd gone with the other candidate, he had 12 years experience and was willing to come down to 60k for the role. Should have been a warning sign but didn't think too deeply about it really.

Wealth management firm (middle of September): pretty similar, great first interview and tech test, they loved my approach to the tech test and final interview with partners was really good. Then a day later - they've gone with a guy who had 7 years experience. Both roles said they'd keep me on file and would get back in contact if they recruited again.

And thats it - all the rest are first introduction calls that go nowhere, tech tests I complete and never heard back.

This last week or two has really taken the piss - had a great first call with a company I was really interested in, completed the tech test and got two senior devs from old company to review and both loved it - and then just nothing. Complete radio silence from both recruiters, no replies to emails nothing. Obviously that one is most likely dead but God it's horrible when you just get ghosted like that.

I'm stilly applying to stuff - at least 3/4 applications a day. I'm on Reed, Indeed, Monster, Otta all of that. I hear back from maybe 1 out of 5 applications I put in, if that. Had my CV reviewed by a recruiter who likes it and recommended only minor wording changes. Savings are running pretty low too - UC says I'm entitled to about a grand a month which will pay most of my rent and bills but not much else.

Got two interviews coming up but again hard to be optimistic with the way other interviews have gone. Have dropped my salary expectations to the point where I'd take pretty much anything now. Have even thought about switching out of C# but my Java mates from old company are having the same problems as me.

Throughout this past year, I kept going back and forth as to whether I’d like to get a CS degree despite already securing a good first job. I feel like there could be some basics that would either be good for me professionally to learn, or would just be plain interesting for me. I admit some of it could be impostor syndrome, but I feel like this nagging feeling of “what if it will block me from certain positions in the future” or “what if it’d actually be very interesting” would haunt me forever if I stay put.

Does it make sense for someone in my position to get a degree? I’m thinking that if I do get one, I should probably wait another 1.5-2 years, so I can actually be out of the “first job” woods, and get everything I can from my current job.

I'm currently in the process of job hunting, and I've got about 3.5 years of industry experience under my belt.

However, I've been facing some challenges in the form of either getting ghosted or receiving outright rejections, even for roles I felt I was well-suited for. Interestingly, I've faced rejection from both Meta and Amazon without even getting a screening call despite having solid references. In fact, I've only made it to the screening stage in less than \~7% of the places I've applied to.

This is quite a contrast to my previous job search experience two years ago, where I had a much higher success rate.

14v3wuw,How to mentally prepare yourself for a significant pay cut?,"My situation: I am a non EU non european person living in amsterdam.

&#x200B;

This might turn into a rant so I'll tldr at the bottom.

&#x200B;

I have 1 YOE as a C++/Python dev in the HFT industry. In HFTs they go hard. There is constant expectation of overworking, 24/7 availability for emergencies, and projects are quite fast paced without room to breathe. All this is justified by the high salaries, starting at more than 100k euros and more for people with more experience. There persists a money can buy everything attitude. Instead of having nice benefits or nice company culture, they go ""here have some more money and work instead"". 

&#x200B;

In my time here, I feel I am sacrificing my youth and time for a little extra money. The last few weeks I was working an average of 11-12 hours a day to meet a deadline. I feel like I have no life except the weekends, and I am not able to spend all this money to actually do things that I like (external hobbies etc).

&#x200B;

So all this is supposed to be justified by the money I'm making right? Well in my recent review my managers said that my output was lower than expected (some of which was due to unexpected life circumstances for me), and as a result they will be cutting down on my bonus (where the real money is). This feels like a stab in the back after I sacrificed a year of my life for this company.

&#x200B;

Before this sends me spiralling into depression, I think I'll try getting a traditional software dev job instead. However there are a few things that concern me.

1. Everyone is saying the job market is tough right now.
2. Despite the cut down on the bonus, going to a traditional company might still be a significant pay cut.

How do I deal with the above two points? Amsterdam is also an expensive city.

TLDR: Work for an HFT since a year. Mental health is in the gutter due to working long hours and not having time/energy. Thinking of switching to a traditional company but market is shit now and will have to take a huge pay cut.",2023-07-09 17:11:12

## 🚀 Startups, scale-ups and others

In May '22 (#1), tiny Estonia (pop. of 1.32M) had ten unicorns. **Flink** purchased French **Cajoo** (#4) for under €100M, signalling future consolidations. The main worry for **Tier’s** CEO Lawrence Leuschner at the time (#4) were [electric scooter](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wirtschaft/im-tagesspiegel-podcast-fast-lane-tier-chef-plaediert-fuer-scooter-parkplaetze-an-jeder-ecke/28301726.html) dedicated parking spaces in Berlin (23k scooters in total). 

The first big layoffs started (#5): **Klarna, Nuri, Uncapped, Getir, Gorillas, Zapp** & others. This was also the time of the “alumni” spreadsheets trend, which had completely disappeared. While **Gorillas** struggled and expanded its product portfolio (#6), **Knuspr** (part of the Czech Rohlik Group) said it was almost profitable (#5). Fast forward to today, they [still aren’t](https://www.merkur.de/wirtschaft/knuspr-region-essen-bestellen-preis-regional-bio-rabatt-92286532.html), but they, like everyone else (!), plan to turn profitable by the end of 2023.

🔥 [I linked to this great article](https://kjlabuz.substack.com/p/gorillas) on the cash-burning unit economics of grocery delivery services like **Gorillas** & co. Spoiler: unit economics are absolute shit. (#35)

On the other hand, the [convenience of food delivery is a promising business and is here to stay](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ca38f3216b6405d11e3d4b4/t/63f939351e11de0b0208cb31/1677277493216/foodservicevsgrocery.jpg?utm_source=pocket_saves). This trend of restaurants gaining share from grocery stores is described [in detail here](https://www.nzscapital.com/sitalweek/sitalweek-386). People simply cook much less? (#42)

**Cariad**, **VW**’s software arm, was already struggling to deliver a new operating system (#7), and it took almost a year to make bigger changes in the board. **Trendyol**, a Turkish fast fashion company, was planning a big expansion in Germany (#7), but I could not find much data to see how successful they were/are.

**AWS** had big plans to add 600 positions in Germany (#11), but I am not really sure how that went since **Amazon** laid off 27k people in 2023. **Deutsche Bahn** was struggling with the worst delays in history (#11), while **Deutsche Bank** was developing a white-label BNPL solution (#12), which is still in development, judging by not hearing about it again.

**Handelsblatt** was right about the vertical farming company **Infarm** back in the day (#16), saying they were almost broke. It turns out they were and have recently left Europe. The same newspaper (+Tagesspiegel) told us that the bubble of instant delivery companies is bursting (#18), and it did.

Handelsblatt also analyzed (#29) the current position of unicorns with a strong presence in Germany. Based on the rating, the worst rated were **Gorillas** (spot on!), while they thought **Flix, Mambu, SumUp, Taxfix, Trade Republic, wefox, Celonis, Commercetools, Personio, Staffbase, Sennder, Grover, Sunfire, and Enpal** are the best bet for the future (gut or sehr gut). The rest were so-so. Only time will tell.

Of all the companies that raised money, **Mietz**, which raised €1M pre-seed (#22) to do Tinder for flats, caught my eye. [The app has poor reviews so far](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.mietz.Mietz&pli=1). I was also looking for a flat and prepared a small Google doc that did not work (#15), and somehow got it after nine intensive days (#17), mostly because of a gorgeous final application.

**QMWare** and **IONOS** landed an undisclosed amount from the German government to develop SeQenC, a quantum computing platform (#28). I googled and did not find anything new on that.

**Rewe** started a new “Pick&Go” experiment at [Schönhauser Alle 130](https://goo.gl/maps/WazYuRn6KGeTri9bA) , where you simply walk out of the store without stopping at the cashier (#28). I still did not go.

Summer is almost here, and **Klarna** should be profitable anytime soon as declared last year (#30). Thirteen weeks later, we (#43) could also read that losing $100M monthly was not THAT crazy in the hyper-growth times. 😅

I told you about **Dream Security**, a company former Austrian *Wunderkind* Sebastian Kurz co-founded (€20M seed). (#24) [Now they have a website](https://www.dream-security.com/about). 

I also mentioned layoffs just after hiring: **Trade Republic** (#7)**, Coinbase** and **Wayfair** (#18). But to be fair, sometimes the hiring pipeline takes ages (six months or more), so I can partially understand it. Still, extremely painful for everyone involved. A relevant resource related to layoffs: [what to do if you lose your job or get fired](https://www.arbeitnow.com/blog/fired-in-germany) at **arbeitnow** (#39). In short, double-check and do not sign anything too fast.

💔 If you are counting on a big exit with ESOPs or similar programs, you could be in for a surprise and printed out with a big fat zero. [This happened to Bonify employees](https://www.businessinsider.de/gruenderszene/business/nach-erfolgreichem-exit-bonify-speist-mitarbeiter-ab-grillfest/)(🇩🇪, sold to Schufa), but at least they will get a barbecue. 😅 More on [liquidation preference from Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation-preference.asp). #45

1354jgk,Europe vs US - where would it be easier to justify cost of study?,"\[I am not a US/Canada/EU/Swiss citizen\]

Hi!

I currently have two options to enroll in for a MS CS - Georgia Tech in the US and ETH Zurich in Switzerland. Both unis have very high cost of study (tuition + CoL) from my PoV. The only way to justify that cost would be if I can get a good industry opportunity, with high salaries.

Now I know the jobs I get will mostly depend on what I do and how well I do that; let's keep that aside for a while.

Which of the two universities should I attend, in your opinion - for better industry opportunities?

While the US has, in general, much better tech scene than Europe - Georgia Tech isn't one of the top schools unlike MIT, Stanford or ETH.

Also, ETH isn't a EU school + I am not a EU citizen which makes it difficult to find opportunities in Europe. Also European salaries aren't that high.

I feel like both my options are not good enough. How do I choose?

12zcvyp,[Germany] Is it possible to get a Full Time Job in between studies (and leave the studies OR make the studies a part time thing)?,"I am doing my Masters in Germany. I'm from a non-EU Country.. I'm in my 4th Semester now and due to various reasons am having trouble doing the degree in reasonable time, and my progress has been somewhat slow. I've also kinda lost interest in the degree and am doing it primarily to maintain my status here. My main aim is full time Job and eventual Permanent Residence. I've given it a lot of thought, and this path is definitely more in line with my life goals..

I'm in the Software/IT field by the way so opportunities are plentiful (yay!!). (I already get contacted by recruiters online even without applying). I am sure if I get dedicated to brush up my technical and german langauge skills, I will be able to secure full time job offers in Software Development field.

1. My question is if I get a full time job offer, can I leave my Master's Degree in between and convert my status to Work Visa (Or Blue Card (I think this is more likely as I'm pretty sure the salary will be above the threshold)) and work towards my Permanent Residence (21 months job + B1 German if I am correct)?
2. BUT, I am observing all the layoffs and stuff right now, so I plan to start applying for full-time jobs after like 6 months (when the storm has clamed down a bit). According to my estimates, I will be done 75 percent done with my degree till then and only thesis will be left.. It will be a tough pill to swallow completing so much and having to potentially leave :/ So is it allowed I get Blue Card and make my studies a 'part time thing' on the side?
3. Will Auslanderbehorde make an issue out of all this, or will they be fine with it? (To put things into perspective, this has been my story so far: Started Degree A with Uni -> Shifted to new Degree in the same uni after 2 semesters -> Now in the 2nd semester on the new degree -> Now potentially after a year will go to ABH saying i have a full time job offer and I want to do that now...)

1242gft,CUDA/C++ jobs after finishing PhD in the UK,"TL;DR: I'm a PhD student who knows CUDA, C++ and Python. My research is about developing computational fluid dynamics codes parallelised on **single** GPUs using CUDA (**I don't know MPI**). What kind of CUDA/C++ developer jobs can I aim for in the UK?

Hi all,

Thanks for reading this. I'm an international PhD student in the UK and this year I hope to finish my PhD, at a non-target university. My PhD is in computational fluid dynamics and involves a good amount of HPC (high performance computing). During my PhD, I coded a lot in CUDA, C++ and Python and I enjoyed it very much. **Please note that I coded only on single GPUs, not multiple GPUs, so I don't know MPI.**

After my PhD I'm fairly I certain I want get a job here in industry, not academia. I'm aiming for the following jobs, listed in order of preference:

1. Quantitative researcher in finance
2. CUDA/C++ developer for scientific applications
3. [Research software engineer](https://ukrse.github.io/who.html)
4. C++ developer for non-scientific applications
5. Postdoc
6. Flood modelling (PhD subject)

I want to hear your thoughts about bullet points (2) and (4).

I've asked about (2) before (elsewhere on Reddit, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CUDA/comments/10wb0mt/how_common_are_cuda_jobs/)), but I want to know: **how common it is to get a CUDA/C++ developer job developing scientific software in the UK?** So far I've only heard about two or three companies I could apply to (Nvidia, AMD, maybe Arm), which is very few.

Bullet point (4) is the one I know the least about. I've enjoyed coding in C++ during my PhD, and I think I would continue to do so even if it was not a scientific project. As per my (somewhat limited) research, examples of the sectors C++ is used are: embedded systems, video games, operating systems, etc. These are niche areas. **Where else is C++ used? Furthermore, my undergrad and PhD degrees are both in engineering, not computer science, so (a) would companies in these fields take me, and (b) how common/good are these jobs in the UK?** For the video game industry, I've heard the work-life balance there is terrible.

Im curious to know how layoffs are handled in large companies in the EU. Ive gone through a period of intense layoffs and some coworkers  have been laid off twice in a year across 2 different companies. The severance is also not great unless its big tech (usually it seems its 2 weeks maybe a month).  
My understanding in Germnay/France/Holland is:  
1. A company has to give you a certain amount of notice(2-3 months)  
2. mass layoffs suddenly are uncommon  
3. severance in case of large layoffs is defined by law

I have about 3yoe, most of that working for startups and doing ML / data engineering consultancy for a few companies. Recently, I was given an offer to work at IBM for one of their client-engineering positions for around 53K/year (which I might be able to increase to 55K).

176um9a,Do mandatory trainings even work? Is this the best way?,"A bit of a context, I have several years of working in several different regulated and highly regulated industries.

Each time it's the same story, a lot of mandatory trainings who become more and more annoying each year: requiring tab focus to continue and pause if you switch away (e.g. you can't listen to audio in the background while you do real work) and more and more annoyances and naggings like instead of showing 5 pieces of information you have to sit through each animation, wait for it to be done with the narrative and requiring user input on the remaining 4 to uncover the information to continue.

Now I have nothing against this if it were to straight up give you everything and rely on a quiz to test your skills, but it's always slowing you down thought the content taking upwards of 30 minutes for each training, and then also giving you a quiz.

Second problem is a lot or most of the training is simply slapped on top of every employee regardless of what they do, e.g. it wasn't uncommon that I was given a special training with advice not to deal with people in Iran for acquisition when A. I don't ever, even indirectly, handle acquisition, B. I never work or speak with anyone outside my country and it's been the case for the years I've been with the company.

Thirds is all this training is just being repeated each year, and sometimes it's being assigned less than a month until it's due, and I don't need to tell you how frustrating it is to get back from holiday to see you got a bunch of due mandatory trainings.

Fourth, do these even work? Has anyone crunched the numbers of the hundreds of thousands of man hours these allegedly waste each year? Is this less expensive than a data leak? Are these proven to reduce data leaks? If so how data leaks still happen with all the MT going on everywhere each year?

Usually in this type of topics others suggest that it's better to live in a more costly country because the absolute savings will be bigger even when you have to ""temporary"" (a few years usually) trade off QOL you could get in cheaper countries.

I ran the numbers and the difference in savings is not big enough to justify that. It's not amount that would let you retire or get a house much earlier, unless you work for top companies in the US (which we rarely have an occasion).

If we choose the country within Europe usually the bigger savings allow more costly holiday and that's it. But holiday last at most one month while the QOL of the country you choose last all year. Stuff like hiring a maid can actually make a difference. So that contributes to your satisfaction much more than having a bit more savings. Also better QOL in a cheaper country automatically assumes that you have reasonable savings (otherwise you wouldn't have said QOL).

The pay is pretty good, 25 pto days, plus 10 sick days plus company holidays so around 45 PTO days a year. Company size is around 1000, mainly between London and Boston and we are growing as well in Atlanta, GA. So, if anyone is intersted please HMU",2023-08-25 19:37:45
15mdt53,"3 Year gap in my CV after a CS degree, no professional experience working in Germany, what should I do?","Some background information:

* I am a german citizen and can speak and write fluent german(native).
* Have a CS degree from the UK (fluent in english)
* Have 0 professional work experience
* Age: 25
* Have a 3 year gap after my degree due to a range of circumstances (moving country to care for sick family, masters degree considerations, unsuccessful job applications). 
* Living with family.

Hi, so I have applied to a range of jobs in germany for a programming position, I have generally been honest in my CV and listed that I don't have professional work experience (by leaving a gap). 90% of my applications get outright rejected (I have only applied to positions that were junior or seeming considerate of not having much work experience). The 10% that get some sort of feedback usually have a phone call where I am asked about the gap in my CV. I usually mention that I have done some projects in my private time and had said circumstances, then the question comes ""but do you have any professional experience?"", I honestly answer no and the interview of sorts ends with a rejection a few days or weeks later.   


While I am applying for junior roles, I am generally an able software developer, I have a range of private projects I have done since I was 10 because I simply enjoy programming and have gotten into the habit of writing clear and maintainable code. I don't really have a record for all these projects on say github but I could easily make a few larger (for a single person) projects in a few days if I needed to and upload some of those that I do have.   


I'm really not sure what to do here overall, I could potentially outright lie on my CV and claim I have had some sort of work experience in the UK by listing my projects under some company I have never worked for, which would look a bit better. I could add in some white lies and make it seem like my projects were professional or that those I have done during university were professional. I could create a bunch of github projects and claim that I uploaded them recently but had worked on them over several years. I could simply get on with a masters in germany and then try again or go for a PhD ( I was accepted to a CS masters program in Berlin a year ago which I decided not to go to due to the financial costs of living closer to the university and in the capital).  The obvious problem with the latter option is that I would be burdening my family financially and it's not really feasible unless I have a some savings. Job applications also seem to take a while, sometimes several months for a reply or interview, it makes it really difficult in germany. I find the UK would be a bit easier so I am also considering moving back to the UK as a last option (as I am also allowed to work and reside in the UK).   


If it is informative, I have generally applied over Stepstone.   


What would be a good way to handle my lack of professional experience or in general get a job in Germany? ",2023-08-09 12:23:40

Just wanted to share my concern and have a talk about this with you

I LOVE developing on mobile and having my apps actually on my phone is so cool to me, but I'm also thinking about the future, and sadly this has to do with money too

14m7w8y,"Is this the norm in most companies? Feel like the balance between engineering and ""make it work"" is not healthy","HeySo I'm part of a team on a small-ish company of around 100 people. I am nearing my 2YOE mark, so please excuse my possibly naive perception of how the real world works. Let me start by the most recent situation, which I think may help understand where I'm coming from.As it turns outs, Management decided they need to fix something important in the get the money side of things. They asked the main Product teams how long it would take, to which they've replied at least 3/4 months. This is something they'd like ASAP, so my team was if there's something we can hack together to make the process semi-automatic in less than one month. Decision makers said yes.This is obviously not ideal, but we can probably do it. My issues are:

* This is somewhat of a recurrent thing, there is general disregard for Engineering practices, as long as it works. Team leader gives us all the freedom we want for Architectural design, but once we discuss, both him and our skip push for whatever is fastest. My job is to communicate the trade-offs between each alternative, but at the end of the day, I will be the owner of said feature.
* This is my first job and it's decently paid for an European gig, but I feel I'm going to stagnate pretty rapidly as there's close to no technical guidance on more broader architecture level concepts.
* Even though both my TL and skip are emotionally mature, open to new ideas and generally good people, I have a really hard time communicating to them how this pattern of approaching issues is hurting us long-term. Temporary solutions become permanent as there will be no benefit on building something to replace a relatively working, but feeble process.
* I would hope to extract more knowledge and guidance on harder to master topics (especially architecture related decisions) from more knowledgeable seniors and leaders.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking about leaving, but it would put them on a pretty tight spot for the coming months as some other gears are moving, so I'd feel as if I'm somehow betraying them.Added New Grad flair, but as I said, I'm nearing 2YOE.",2023-06-29 15:26:17

14hjzbf,Why are certain companies so interested in who do you like having *** with?,"I used to think it's XXI century and we're just humans but some companies really want to stress all the small differences between us.  
  
What is your orientation, what's your skin color, do you have a gf, what's in between your legs, what would you like to have in between your legs, what's your favorite cult, are you coming from the rich and other stupid, nonrelevant questions are asked and it's always by companies with a rainbow logo.  
  
How is that legal?  
  
Why do all big job sites allow it?  
  
Society is controlled by nutjobs.  
  
If somebody ever asks me face to face: ""What is your orientation?"" My answer is: ""Why are you so interested in who do others have \*\*\* with? Are you a pervert?"". And if they try to shift the responsibility on the gov then I follow: ""Oh, so it's the gov who's the pervert and you encourage it even though you don't have to?"" I wonder what they have in their defense.  
  
It's not like job search is not difficult enough and they still have to waste your time with this nonsense.  
  
You could think: Just skip companies with a rainbow logo, but in the UK it's almost half the companies, there is not much you can do. Do not use an argument that's it's optional. It should not considered a good taste to even ask it.

1496xat,"What's a normal amount of ""other"" work","So I've been in my first SE job for about a year (6 months part-time while studying, 6 months full-time), it's a smaller company owned by a much larger company but we are mostly left to operate ourselves. Our company is split into Development and Support Desk, the support desk is archaic and understaffed meaning we are asked to ""help out"" with tickets. This has led to my day being around 60/40 split of support Desk / development with no infrastructure changes seemingly planned. This is the case for a lot of the developers. On Monday and Tuesday I didn't even open my IDE. 

This is very frustrating, I have read that developers don't actually develop all day but I thought this was for meetings around client specs or things related to the product.

I'm getting very sick of the support desk, when I do get an actual development task I go all in on it, but they are not frequent enough and I can't help but feel like I'm not learning fast enough or doing the job I signed up for. Also it is stressful to try and develop when getting chased on tickets. It has only been 6 months full-time but I feel I want to leave and try to find a development job that actually allows me to develop.

13i1i91,Seeking Guidance & CV Review: Transitioning from PhD Research to a Machine Learning Role,"Hello esteemed members of r/cscareerquestionsEU,

I am currently in a transitional phase in my career and I am seeking your expertise and guidance.

**Background**: Over the past few years, I have been heavily immersed in machine learning research for my PhD position. Prior to this, I accumulated more than 10 years of experience as a software developer and scientific programmer. However, my PhD contract has come to an end, and I find myself in the market for a new job.

**CV Review**: I've created a CV that I believe highlights my relevant experience for my target roles. I would greatly appreciate any constructive feedback you might be able to provide. Here's the link to [my anonymized CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PSfbU05t-tYTx1KqE4fd4AOHeVjtdcb8/view?usp=sharing).

**Career Guidance**: I am considering several potential roles such as Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, or Scientific Programmer. Although I'd like to continue capitalizing on my data science skills, I am open to other suggestions if my expectations seem unrealistic. It's worth mentioning that I don't hold a Masters degree and I am currently targeting part-time positions (32 hours per week) as I plan to continue my PhD research on the side, even if it might not lead to a formal degree.

**Location**: I am based in Rotterdam, in the Randstad area of the Netherlands. I am open to opportunities in the surrounding regions, including Amsterdam, which is roughly an hour commute for me. I am also open to fully remote positions.

I look forward to your insights and advice. Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

**Edit1** - In response to the feedback gathered from this thread, I've made significant enhancements to my CV and streamlined it to a single page with an optional publications page. Please find the updated version (v2) of my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xo2yKYRvS6NRQdspc6tl86AWGCvjGk20/view?usp=sharing).

**Edit2** - I am thrilled to announce that, thanks to your invaluable contributions, I have secured a position as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at a prestigious banking institution. Your support has been instrumental in this achievement, and for that, I am profoundly grateful.

Despite facing stiff competition from over 100 candidates, I emerged as the top contender for this role. Considering the current global and economic landscape, I believe this position offers a stable and promising path forward, at least for the foreseeable future.",2023-05-15 07:54:53
13emjji,Does it make sense early in the career to be switching languages so much?,"I did some Python for data processing during my biophysics studies (no actual dev work, more like data analysis I guess, function optimisation with scipy, matrix work with numpy..). Then, I got what was supposed to be a Java job (junior software developer). Then this became a C# job, because I got moved to a different project. I really took the C# path to heart and have been reading and practising a lot out of working hours. I only have 1y professional experience. I have been actively looking for C# jobs since I decided to focus on one language to get up to speed with the language-specific frameworks, language features, etc.  I'm practising dynamic programming questions also in C#. 

I came across a Software developer job now which seems very suitable for me from point of view of domain knowledge. However, reading the job description, it appears it's a Python developer job. I'm torn if it makes sense to spend time applying at all, since I feel I haven't managed to get very good even at one language and I keep switching them all the time, because of circumstances. If it was a Java developer job I wouldn't worry at all, I'll immediately apply. But particularly as Java/C# and Python are form entirely different families of languages it feels I can't solidify any knowledge/skill set..

On the other hand, I've had a very difficult time getting a better job because of the current market and that my experience is so limited.. my science background doesn't really help it seems, so this might be a good opportunity at least to get to an interview stage.. 

Any advice from more experienced people?",2023-05-11 12:52:30

13a0j0u,Does a timeline of coding challenge actually mean something?,"Experienced this recently, applied for an open position and after the initial screening was proceeded to the next step which was a take home coding challenge. There was no time tracking involved but it was mentioned not to spend more than 4 hours on the challenge itself.

The problem statement had two parts and had clear explanation what was required. 

I was able to complete the given task, perform what was required from it and if I am being honest, spent a little more than the allocated time (4 hrs) because I struggled a bit in the beginning with some setup related steps on my local environment.  

My focus during this time was to

* make it work
* clean it up
* document my work

After submission, I was very much looking forward to the next steps of the interview process, unfortunately I got the response that I didn't make it. I have to give credit it was a very personalized and detailed response in which they explained in detail the positives of the solution I had added and how its working. In terms of negatives the remarks I got was, its missing test coverage. 

Adding test coverage is routine for me, for years in my day to day work there is no concept of shipping something without having sufficient test coverage. In this case I guess, one mistake on my part was to, I forgot to add it in the list of improvements I had added in the task description during the submission. But since, I was only supposed to spend 4 hrs on it, I thought a clean working solution would be enough to make it to the next round and the evaluators might take it into consideration. There was no mention of test coverage in the actual problem statement, I have seen take home challenges where these requirements are explicitly mentioned. Not saying it should always be mentioned, but in my personal experience, the expectation of a fully working solution with test coverage in a 4 hour timeline is unrealistic. I wouldn't estimate it like that in my normal day job.

Husband has an offer of 85K EUR + relocation to Berlin.

Profile: We are a family with a 2.5 year kid, living in South Central Mumbai. Husband works in software as a product manager with 10+ years of experience and earns INR 30 LPA + 12% bonus and other perks. I have 7+ years of experience in QA, but I have been on maternity break since 2020. I am looking for jobs now as kid will start school this month. Currently, we pay no rent since the flat we live in, is owned by my parents. Our parents (my mom+dad and his dad) live in the suburbs with good extended family support and no financial assistance needed from us.

Would Eur 85K salary be enough for Berlin considering the increase in housing rents? We would want to live in a decent, safe area for families around Berlin and travel once-twice a year. We do not splurge a lot, eat out once a week or once in 2 weeks. We would love to save towards buying a house and living long-term. I also plan to look for a job over there.

We plan to move abroad for cleaner air, good infrastructure, work culture/opportunities and better quality of life.. I know there will be no hired help like India. Also, there is a chance the social life would not be as great, even after learning German (We are at A1 level now). I am fine with it. So, is it worth relocating to Berlin or should we just stay put?

In my eyes, moving inside the EU is similar to someone moving in the US: Going from Cali to New York just means a very long road trip moving that nice desk you dont want to get rid of. But with language and cultural barriers in the EU, which have honestly never been much of a problem for me, HM might think a lot about hiring a non native.

Which brings me to my question: How can I improve my chances to convince them?

I was thinking I could write a letter explaining why I want to move there, but it would be very short. I have no particular skills that would make me a great hire (just python and javascript), I speak spanish, french, english and some german, but no nordic languages. But this wouldnt be a cover letter, it would be more of an introductory letter saying that I would be ok living there.

I'm a 24M from the Netherlands and grew up here. A little background information about me: I graduated in August 2023 in Business Informatics and did a Computer Science minor in the US in 2022. I currently work as a data engineer and don't have to complain about money but I'm not growing as a person.

  
I still live at home with my parents, I can afford to live on my own but I won't want to in the Netherlands since rent prices are nuts. I studied for a few months in the US (Utah) and had the best time of my life. I'm very ambitious and find something to work on in my free time but for the last few months, I just felt sad. At the end of the month, I have money to save/invest but I don't like the life I have and I think it's just time to leave because I started to feel this quote: nothing changes if nothing changes.

  
I can stay but I know that I'm gonna be more miserable later on this year. The energy I used to have is slowly dying, my friends are cool but most of them are not inspiring. There are some options that I had in mind but I'm stressing too much about what I want to do this year. The things I had in mind:

  
\- Going back to the US this year for a CS masters  
\- Move to another country (some other friends wanted to move out and had Spain in mind, I've currently learning Spanish for almost 7 months)  
\- Quit my job and start something to do for myself (I'm trying to do this while maintaining my current job)

The weather is just depressing in the Netherlands and most of all I just want to move anywhere to grow as a person, I just have 0 idea about what to do but the most important thing I know is that if I'm not doing something different, nothing will change. I would appreciate any advice!

Few days ago I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/s/DWjd3ixV5s) and got some really good feedback, honestly i don’t know why I couldn’t see how horrendous the resume actually was, for some reason I thought they’d zoom in or something, and I wanted the most of the ATS to be  matched with my resume  out there, and I couldn’t decide what to keep and what to take it out.

192yk9o,Which countries would be my best bets to get a visa sponsorship right now as a Data Engineer?,"Hello, fellow redditors. Hope all of you are well.

For some context, I am a Data Engineer with 3 years of experience (main stack AWS/Python/Spark/SQL/Airflow/Terraform). I also have 2 more years of experience before that in academic research with Python and mathematical/statistical modeling.

I'm currently looking for a job in the EU, but I would need support with the visa bureaucracy. I do have the right to an EU citizenship by descent, but I am still working on the documents and the process is VERY slow, so I don't want to count on this right now.

So, with that info, which countries would you recommend I invest more of my time in?

I speak English and Portuguese, but Portugal is not an immediate option because the salary to cost of living ratio is not very good right now.

I have been focusing on Spain, Netherlands and Germany, but spanish companies seem to require spanish fluency, netherlands' market seems dominated by Azure and GCP and Germany seems a little bit slow right now. Of course, it could also be that my experience is not optimal or that the market is generally slow. Could you guys give me some insight on this?",2024-01-10 03:36:35

18c0og9,doubt whether to continue as a front end developer,"First of all I would like to thank everyone who will take the time to read this post and give me their opinion. I'm from Italy BTW.

  
A little context. Immediately after graduating from high school I was forced to go to work without being able to attend college to get a degree. My family situation was very bad and for a few years I worked in various non-IT related jobs to get some money and improve my life. At that time I was playing a lot with Photoshop and this allowed me to get my first serious job in a small e-commerce company doing product images, graphics for print and a bit of web design. Shortly after joining this job, out of personal curiosity, I began to experiment with html and css and I proposed to the company to help them with small layout jobs.

  
Fast forward 10 years. I am 34 years old and I now mainly deal with the front-end development of the 3 e-commerce and various websites of my company, as well as supporting the external marketing agency by creating newsletters and landing pages for their advertising campaigns. The job isn't bad, it's not too stressful and I also have some benefits.

  
The problem is that a change of management (and ownership) is about to take place and, having been inside for a long time now, I know that they will most likely assign my work to an external agency and therefore I will most likely find myself without a job in the not too distant future.

  
Wanting to prevent this eventuality, I started looking around, updated my CV and was contacted by some recruiters who offered me several interviews as a front end developer. Unfortunately, none of the six selection processes I have undertaken so far have gone well.

  
For the last 7 - 8 years I have always worked with html, css, basic javascript and jquery. I know how to use devTools and have a basic understanding of Git. From the feedback I received, I have the impression that this knowledge is not sufficient to get a job in this field. Furthermore there is the fact that I don't have a degree, I don't have any formal theoretical training on the topics and I have also never worked in a team or in a IT company.

  
To try to open up new possibilities I tried to study react, nodejs, express and mongodb, but unfortunately my knowledge remains very basic because I have limited way of applying these technologies in my current job and I can't create projects in my free time because I have a house and a family with children to care and raise.

  
At this point I'm wondering if it's really possible for me to stay (or enter) this field or perhaps consider another job position. I really like IT and technology and I would like to continue doing this job.

  
TLDR: After ten years working using only html, css, some js and jquery I need to find another job but struggle to find it in this field. I also have no degree and I've never worked in a IT oriented business. What should I do?",2023-12-06 09:56:33
189u8vu,Do .net devs earn less than java devs?,"Hi, I am a software engineer who has been working with .net + azure for 1.5 years,

 I did a little bit of digging and it seems like most other developers(java etc) are getting paid more than .net developers in general, also there seems to be more java jobs than .net jobs too

I know that languages dont decide these salaries and companies do but still, if this is true, it might help saying something about the companies who choose .net


Dont get me wrong I like .net and working with it is fun, also I know its more important to be a good programmer and have a solid foundation instead of following the next thing but as a junior developer I want to look at future opportunities both in salary+ job opportunities wise.

And (from what I saw) there seems to be more demand for java devs and some people/surveys say that their salaries seems to be a little higher, I usually looked into java since I used it in university and familiar with it.

There are resources who claim the opposite too but I saw the first case more than the second.

So I got a few questions.

1- do you think there is a difference in salaries of .net developers and java developers?

2- do you think .net is rising in demand and usage (+job opportunities)?

3-should I consider switching your java while I dont have a lot of experience on .net or keep going with .net?

Thank you all for reading. Looking forward to hear about your opinions!",2023-12-03 14:09:20
187117k,Will you leave a fully remote job for a 3days/week in office job,"My current job allows me to be fully remote, good salary+ other benefits, the company makes good profit so the job feels very stable. I love my colleagues, my team. It's just the work itself doesn't spark joy for me because there is not enough product work. 

I started looking for jobs in startup as I miss the fast pace, working in greenfield projects excite me, even though it's not as secured as my current job. But all of them require me to go to the office at least 2,3 days/week. I hate commuting. I dread having to get up early, spend 30 minutes in crowded tube, walk in  the rain. It is cold and wet in winter in London.

1817i2w,Update to Stay in this job or leave,"When I wrote this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/14jjdej/stay\_in\_this\_job\_or\_leave/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/14jjdej/stay_in_this_job_or_leave/) , I thought I might provide an update later, as sometimes I've read questions and always wondered what happened in the end.  
  
Unfortunately, this update has come sooner than expected.  
  
To provide a bit of context, when I wrote my post, it had been a short while since a US company had bought part of my company, and then a restructuring process began at all levels.  
  
In the past few months, I've felt that I've been pushed away from what I knew, given tasks that no one else wanted, experiencing moments with hardly any work and waiting for new projects to start, while my other colleagues had no shortage of tasks.  
  
The advice given to me in the previous post was either avoid confronting my toxic colleague by focusing on the work or look for another job.  
  
I should have followed my instincts because my boss left, and I was fired two days later. No notice, no report, no reason.  
  
Mentally, I haven't taken it well, as I had made an effort to be more conciliatory at work, and I think passivity may have worked against me. Of course, I believe my colleague played a part.  
  
Right now, I'm dealing with legal matters regarding how everything ended, but I wanted to tell you that my advice if you find yourself in such a situation is:  
  
1. Escalate your real situation to your superiors.  
2. If you don't see tangible changes, look for another job where you are more valued.

  
That's it. Now I've taken a few weeks off, and I've started looking for opportunities for the coming year. Wish me luck.",2023-11-22 11:58:54
180li29,Living/working in Finland vs Sweden as a SWE,"**tl:dr** If you have worked in either Finland or Sweden, can you share your experience?

I was contacted by a recruiter from a company that has branches in Nordic countries. They have vacancies in Stockholm and Helsinki. This company seems cool, but I haven't been to either country, so I'm hesitant to proceed with it.

Overall, I have positive impressions of both countries. The reasons are:

* It seems that WLB and welfare (e.g. Public health care) are pretty good in both
* Both are developed nations, so I expect that buildings and public transport there would be modern
* I heard that bureaucracy (e.g. Registering yourself in a municipal government) is digitalized and efficient
* CoL in Stockholm and Helsinki aren't too high, compared to CoL in Prague, which is where I live ([CoL in Helsinki - Prague](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Finland&city1=Helsinki&country2=Czech+Republic&city2=Prague) , [CoL in Stockholm - Prague](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Czech+Republic&city1=Prague&country2=Sweden&city2=Stockholm))

Negative things that I heard for both countries are:

* winter is long and harsh (I prefer a cold climate to a warm one, though)
* it's hard to socialize (I'm an introvert, so I don't see this as a big issue)
* the income tax rates are so high (yeah this seems demoralizing...)
* not so many jobs and not particularly high salaries (compared to some Western European countries, such as UK, DE, NL)
* apartment hunting is tough in Stockholm (I'm not sure if this applies to Helsinki too)

Moving to another country might waste your time and money. Also, I don't see myself as young enough to move around from country to country. So, I'd like to do research as much as possible if I ever move abroad again. If you could share your experience in either country, that would be appreciated.

I'll get straight to the point: I have 2 years of experience but currently do the same job people with 4-6 years do in my company.

The thing is, my company refuses to pay me more because of my years of experience, and other companies do the same. So I am stuck doing a job I should be paid 40-50% more to do without many options aside from stopping my growth and just doing the minimum my paygrade requires.

16fq9xg,Worried about work-life balance in new role,"I've just started my second week in a new full-stack .NET role in London, and have noticed some worrying trends from my colleagues. This post may be slightly wordier that it perhaps needs to be, but I just want to make sure no one's missing any context.

The contract says the job is 35 hours per week – 9-5, which was a nice surprise, as my last job was 9-5:30, as are most of my friends' jobs. I flagged this with the HR rep I was speaking to, as I had noted that she'd previously said it was 9-5:30; she said ""Oh it's technically 9-5, but most people stay until around 5:30."", which I thought didn't sound too out of the ordinary. Before I accepted the role, I was offered a chat with the head of development, and during the call, he stressed that he cared about his devs' work-life balance, and that everyone but him had left the office. This was around 6:15 pm, so I didn't think it was *that* amazing that everyone had left, based on my previous experience.

Fast-forward to my first day, and I was set up on all of their systems, including Teams. My manager mentioned to me that the head of my particular team (not the head of development I spoke to before) likes everyone to give an EOD update in a specific chat on Teams before they head off for the day. He told me that there's a calendar reminder for this every day between 5 and 5:15, and told me to look through past messages for a rough idea of the format expected. I looked through, and noticed that barely anyone left a message at 5 – I had to scroll back several weeks to find one. Most of the messages were at 6:30 - 7, and some of them as late as 10 (and these were not infrequent). I know that it's not people coming in late and finishing late, as our stand-ups are at 9:15 every morning. I know this is standard in some industries, but that's not my experience in this on. This is a pretty big red flag for me, and I'm kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place: I care about my work-life balance, but I also don't want to upset the balance at this new job. I was thinking my options are:

* Try to chat to colleagues about it at lunch and see what they think. Even if I phrase my question well (something like ""I have commitments outside of work, but I want to pull my weight, and don't want to cause other devs to have to pick up any slack. Do you ever feel an expectation to stay late?""), I feel that people would have a hard time saying anything other than ""That's absolutely fine!"" in person.
* Try to arrange a talk with my manager. I'm worried about this one, because I think it could do more harm than good.
* Just leave on time, and accept that some people may have an issue with it.

I also thought that maybe this just is a bad culture fit and I need to look elsewhere, but I obviously don't want to do that without trying to fix it first. The actual work, workflow, team, and pay are infinitely better than my last role, so I would love to stick it out. I think this is a pretty common position to be in, so just wanted to hear people's thoughts on the matter! Thanks in advance.",2023-09-11 08:57:19

Often times I hear that people work ""remotely"" for company in let's say Germany or Netherlands or Switzerland, yet when you look at remote jobs (where location where you reside is irrelevant), there are only handful of these. I've read here that it's due to tax regulations that companies are reluctant to allow location agnostic work. 

Despite of that I see decent amount of stories where people say they work for these countries?

I've read that many of them open ""smaller companies"" and larger companies transfer money to their businesses account so that these devs (their mini companies) have obligation regarding taxes in their native country.

What is unclear is how do these people keep working for companies since essentially, they are contractors and once their work is done they are no longer needed? Also how do these people find companies that are willing to do this, because I've never seen any add that mentions this type of work (I am ignorant so this is why I'm asking)?

1- I am doing my masters in computer science for aerospace in Toulouse but honestly it's alot of bullshit. They teach us alot of stuff but it's not focused on anything. So they teach us embedded systems and neural networks but it's not things that we might work with.
2- I am currently working at Airbus which maybe a good CV boost, but I'm working with something entirely different. I'm working with HR data and apps script ( ik 🤢) . I actually joined Airbus hoping to someday reach the physics part and be close to the cool physics part but I'm not sure I ever will.
3- I'm not sure about embedded systems because as I heard it's not a domain with a lot of opportunities or high salaries ( The reason for salary part is that I hope someday I would be able to provide for my family and allow my wife to have the freedom to choose how much she wants to work)
4- I would love to do research and a PhD later in my life but I'm not sure if it's too late for me. 
5-  I was thinking that maybe the best thing to do is to try some side projects to see if this is what I'm really passionate about

Edit: I'm sorry I might have been unclear on my part. I don't want to be a physicist or do physics research on my own. I would like to be the developer that is working on physics projects. Examples:
- my friend right now is working on recalculating the coordinates for satellite for transmissions
- my other friend is right now working on the data center for an observatory.

14mdkwa,"Considering a career move: Tech Lead offer in Barcelona, Spain – Insights on cost of living, career prospects, and quality of life?","Hello, Redditors! I’m currently facing a career decision and would greatly appreciate your insights. I’ve been working as a front-end developer for nearly 10 years and recently moved to Portugal for a change in lifestyle. However, my current salary of 55k is proving to be insufficient for future planning.

Now, I’ve received an enticing offer to work as a tech lead for a major consultancy company in Barcelona, Spain. The proposed salary is 80k, which would undoubtedly be a significant improvement for my wife and me. We don’t have kids and lead a simple life, without any extravagant expenses.

Before making a decision, I’d like to gather information about various parameters that come into play. Firstly, I’m curious about the cost of living in Barcelona compared to Portugal, taking into account factors like housing, transportation, healthcare, and daily expenses. How far would the increased salary stretch in terms of maintaining a comfortable standard of living?

Additionally, I’m interested in understanding the career prospects and growth opportunities for tech professionals in Barcelona. Is it a thriving tech hub with ample chances for professional development? Are there networking opportunities and a vibrant tech community that fosters innovation?

Lastly, I’d love to hear about the overall quality of life in Barcelona. How does the city fare in terms of safety, healthcare facilities, public infrastructure, recreational activities, and the general work-life balance?

14kly6c,How open should I be with recruiters?,"**Context**: Where I come from, there is no recruiter culture. I came to Germany for my masters and after it is done, now I am looking for a job. 

**Present**: Today the recruiter I am in touch with, asked me, if I get 'accepted' from her suggested company, how much time I need to give an answer. I told her I will have 2nd interview from another company very soon. So it will depend on that, maybe 2 weeks. The way she kept poking on which company, when etc kind of seemed weird. She said, I should not take more than 1 week to decide if a company is waiting for an answer. She went as far as saying, here in Germany the culture is like that. I think she just panicked seeing her investment (me) might not turn out profitable. Don't get me wrong, she is a nice person as far as I can tell, but today was a bit weird.

**Question**: Should I consider that they are on my side? Should I be open to them about other interviews I am doing parallelly? 

So what I am asking is, how does it work here (**Germany** or Europe)?",2023-06-27 18:46:05
14kbyir,Should I quit my job for my mental health?,"I(27F) am still a fairly inexperienced frontend developer, with  2 years of experience and I have been working at this company for a about a year and a half.

When I started we had a CTO and a full-stack developer ""mentor"", and it was pretty good, since I could get the support I needed, but they have since both quit, and now I'm mostly by myself. It feels like I have graduated from a junior developer to a senior in about a month in terms of responsibilites, and it is honestly really hard on my mental health. I'm always feeling stressed, always has a headache, no appetite and I cry so easily because of the pressure.

The company has always had issues with communication and lack of information on projects, but atleast we were multiple people and I could ask questions if I needed to. Now I feel like they have doubled up on the complicated projects, but without the time and resources to handle them, and the management (all non-developers in another office) just don't understand because they keep prioritising sales over development.

Last week I felt so awful because I made a mistake because I didn't have time to test properly, but they just got frustrated at me. It's like they don't understand that the way the company is run can affect my performance.

I'm debating on quitting this week. The issue is that I haven't managed to land another job yet, but I have been trying. I just feel like it's hard to have both this stress-inducing job going on and job hunt at the same time, since I usually have to go through multiple tests and interviews, so it's just a very time-consuming process.

In my head, if I were to quit, I could spend the summer holidays focusing on my mental health, and then afterwards focus on improving my skills and job searching fulltime.

I live in a country where you can get a bit of financial help while unemployed, and I also have some money saved, so it would be tough but doable financially. But I'm worried that it's a super bad idea and that I will have trouble finding another job, it feels like the market has changed quite a bit since the last time I was searching.

If any of you have some advice or experienced to share, it would be very nice. I really feel like I'm struggling here :(  


TLDR: Everyone else has left the development department, management expects me to be able to do the same amount of work as before, I'm overworked and stressed, I want to quit, but don't have a job lined up",2023-06-27 12:08:11
144d8qa,Underpaid for my experience,"Hi,

I am a non EU citizen working in Germany as a mid level Software Engineer on EU Blue Card visa. I was hired directly from my third world country into Germany with a low balled offer. But since I was desperate at that time in search of an EU job, i took the offer for relocating to Germany. 

A little background about the offer that I received. I was offered the position of a mid level Software developer according to the company's job roles as fixed by the hiring manager irrespective of the 7 years of experience that i already had under my belt during the salary negotiations. Since, my hiring manager decided the role I would be offered, the HR low balled me with an initial offer of 59000 € annually, which i was able to increase to 64000 € after a lot of bargaining. 

I was unaware of the company internal job roles and the experiences associated with them until i joined the company and got to know about the various roles and their responsibilities through internal documents. I realized that I'm being paid equivalent to a new graduates with masters degree or maybe 10% more than such candidates. Also, my company has a history of underpaying its employees as well compared to usual market standards. 

Now, it has been 16 months since I'm working at my company and made valuable impact in developing a new product by myself mostly. I feel that I have Integrated well with the team, understood the company culture and protocols and helped bring in more revenue as confirmed through the monthly reviews that I have with my manager. Even my director recognized my effort as well. 

My current manager is not my initial hiring manager but he has mostly been managing me for 90% of my duration in the company and knows very well of my contributions. He even said that there might have been some mistake during hiring because he was not part of it, when I raised the point of me being assigned a mid senior developer role was not correct according to my experience and skills, rather i should have been assigned a senior developer role because of the skills and experience that i bring to the table based on the company's internal role description. 

Our annual raise cycle is near and I want to bring up the point of correcting my salary according to my impact on the company's revenue, company's internal role policies and market standards. 

How should I go about in pitching my concerns to my manager in order to discuss my salary concerns healthily? Any suggestions would be helpful. 

Thanks.",2023-06-08 16:04:35

13zujrf,Relocating to EU as a junior software developer,"Hi everyone! I just wanted to ask your thoughts on this. I'm a junior software developer living and working in London, for an online trading company. I currently work in the mobile backend team, using Spring Boot, Java, Kotlin, and I want to get into iOS development so I'm doing iOS projects on the side. I'm quite burnt out and disappointed by life in the UK. I feel like I have little to no future here, and I don't like the 'culture' of the UK. I don't see myself buying a house and 'settling' here, etc. London, though a great city in many ways, is extremely expensive, and after renting in London for three years with my former partner, I've scarcely been able to save much of my salary due to the high rents. You just work all the time, so don't always have time to enjoy the city during the week, and having a social life is another expense. I also don't have my desired salary currently, as I'm a junior developer, not mid level or senior (yet).

So, my plan is to work a while longer in my current job to build up more experience and work on my skills, also learning a new language, while applying for dev jobs in EU countries, as that's where I ideally want to live. Thanks to my Portuguese citizenship I'm assuming I won't need a work visa, so I'm looking at Austria, Germany (Berlin is good for dev roles from what I've heard), Sweden, Switzerland and France. I love Portugal, Italy and Spain, but developer salaries there aren't too great, and COL can be higher in the cities e.g Barcelona, Madrid, Lisboa. A remote job might be the best option if moving to those areas.

My question is: is this a good time to do this? Is it advisable? I think it can only be a benefit to a career if you have worked as a developer in another country. I don't want to leave London or my current job immediately, but it is a goal of mine, and it would be great to have some advice from anyone who's done this :) Thanks!",2023-06-04 00:06:11

Basically, I am in my early 30s, working in other branch, studying computer science in college(1 year left). I am at the point, where programming is becoming more comfortable. 

My main interests are android and web development, currently. My stack for those two are Kotlin and Django. I am at the point where I can make basic to-do app in both, plus currently creating e-commerce project in Django.

Question is this: I wanted to start looking for junior web development job this year, but received an offer in my current branch, where I'll be employed for another 12 months, but the job itself is not physical, stressful or long hours, so I will have time for studying. The problem is, I will have to stay there for full 12 months, I can't leave sooner, if I choose to do this. What would be better in my case?

1ak3gg0,My position isn't ideal for Junior Developer and I'm lost.,"I will preface this by saying, despite the grievances I have with my current position, I am extremely grateful for the knowledge I've accumulated in my time here and the fact I even have a job in the current job climate, but I need to open up. I don't want to come across as someone who is angerily kvetching to the internet or expects the world to accomodate them, but I don't feel like this role fits me, the way I learn, and my current experience level. I'd like others' opinions on my situation. 

So, I've been working in this Fintech position for about 2.5-ish years now, and it's my first real job post-university. It's primarily a backend role and my team is VERY experienced. Some of my team members have had very decorated careers that have spanned years. Most of my colleagues are extremely helpful when I reach out to them as well. I've, admittedly, have had performance fluctuations up until the last couple of months where I've been a lot more consistent in terms of card completion and such (we strictly follow AGILE). The first major issue for me is, I often don't have a solid grasp of what's going on. Sometimes, ongoing things/issues are discussed that I personally am not aware of until its mentioned, but seemingly everyone else IS fully aware of it. I have tried alleviating this issue by keeping up with my emails, asking questions during stand-ups, asking my team members outside of meetings (which we have A LOT of cuz corporate), but sometimes things are mentioned that I've never heard before and the team discusses it as if everyone is already filled in. Another issue is, my manager is very opaque when it comes to her/the company's expectations. She has praised me for completing tasks that are assigned to me and my dedication to seeing them get closed, but she has mentioned that she'd like to see ""more"" from me, but I'm not entirely sure what that's supposed to mean. We don't have days dedicated for innovation or learning anymore. I want to do ""more"" but the company is so large and there's so much going on that have no idea how to contribute in any meaningful way outside of completing cards. If I have a task in front of me, its very straight forward, but being fully attentive to the large, fast-paced ecosystem around me and all its inner workings is when I start to struggle. I have reached out to my scrum master for assistance, and he said she'd keep me in mind when communicating with other teams but I'm just so lost. Admittingly, I haven't done extensive research into some of the going-ons and company frameworks, but I'm also thinking to myself, ""how am I supposed to do all that when the cards themselves require a lot of my time and attention as a younger developer?"". It's often not relevant to what I'm tasked with either, so I just priortize the latter, which I think is reasonable. I've grown frustrated because this, paired with my poor performance in early 2023, are reasons why I'm technically late for promotion. I want to at least get promoted before I ask for a transfer/seek other opportunities and the thought of again failing to achieve promotion scares the day-lights out of me. Outside of work, I research technologies that are mentioned and work on personal projects that should improve my literacy in the tech stack we have, but this position isn't straight forward at all. Maybe my prior depression was partially to blame, my ADD, a general lack of interest, me not sharing the same level of enthusiasm for the work that my colleagues do, or this environment simply isn't right for me. My intention isn't to make excuses or to deflect blame, that is not my intention, but something clearly isn't clicking for me.

My apologies for the essay above, I am just lost.
Should I just cut my losses and ask for a transfer to a younger team? Any thoughts, personal experiences, and advice would be extremely appreciated.",2024-02-06 06:35:36

One of my goals is to move to London (it's a life goal to live there, not for a career reason, though the opportunities seems great). I calculated that I'd require about a 55000 pound salary (before tax) to live comfortably from the beginning there and to have something to build upon. 

By the time I finish university I should have about a year of experience through the internship role I'm currently working in now. As a minimum I'm most likely gonna have to stay in my country for a year to save up some more money and to gain experience.

I'm currently using Spring because that's what makes sense for me here at the moment at my job and I'd like to keep getting using that and getting better at it as it seems like a great technology to be familiar with.

16osoy5,Future of the SWE market,"Software Engineering is really hyped up everywhere, you see advice for people with dead end jobs to switch to this field as 'it's only a few months of learning'. CS is becoming a extremely popular subject, more and more bootcamps are popping up and it seems so many people are interesting in becoming a SWE. More people are studying Computer Science and are self learning to become one.

I don't really see it ending well for many people, there will be too many software engineers in 5-10 years and who knows how good Chat GPT will be.

I guess I'm just worried about myself and how much competition there is for the job market because it seems like I'm in a race with tens or if not hundreds of thousands of people to enter the market.

16g82i0,I am tired.,"Bare with me as this may be longer than I anticipate and I hope I don't bore you.

I am 28, living in the UK working as a ""Software Engineer"" at a bank, £50k ish, 4 years of experience... although I do more Data Engineering but that's another story.

I graduated with a 2:2 from a Russell Group University (UK) in Computer Science, I had problems with my personal life and circumstances which upon reflection I wish I handled a lot better. Frankly that's not the worse of it, I was doing my A-levels predicted A\*A\*AA, aiming to go into Medicine and life happened just in the midst of my studies, took a gap year to re-attempt until I thought forget it I'll do Computer Science to escape the issues that were surrounding me only for them to creep back up on me.   


Was doing an integrated masters, dropped that finished with a Bachelor's to just escape uni and start working, started working doing well but had no clue what I actually wanted to do since I was just good at computers, hopes that I may one day get back into Medicine.

Except realising that most Uni's refuse to look at anything below 2:1... Great.

Started an MSc, again most Uni's don't care... Great.

Attempt to go for IBs, Hedgefunds... as you know... Great.  


I want to transition into Quant, hedgefunds etc. But it just seems like the sh\*t cards I have been dealt with are haunting me...

Lately, my health has started to get worse, despite repeated attempts for resolution from my Doctor's no one can explain my constant back ache or the most recent burning wrist pain (Not carpal tunnels). 

I am tired guys, my wrists are always burning and cramping, I am struggling to even type anymore and honestly if it becomes worse and worse what can I do? When my entire livelihood is on a computer?

15w83pr,Money over passion,"Hi! I know this is a hot debate between people in this sphere but I don't see an issue choosing to pursue computer science due to financial concerns. I wouldn't call myself passionate when it comes to technology but it's one of the rare things I somewhat like. Tech is the most lucrative industry here (I'm from Latvia) and salaries are WAY above the average national. The demand for software engineers is still crazy high, and getting a job or paid internship isn't much of a hassle. There are around 3000 vacancies a year (and the number is growing each year) while formal education institutes are only able to ""produce"" around 700 CS grads every year, meaning there are no tuition fees in public universities for those who choose to study CS to try and keep up with the demand. I wanted to go the self-taught route but chose to go through uni (about to start my second year).  
I don't care about materialistic things such as an expensive phone, watch, or car but the ability to comfortably invest a lot of money into my health (high quality food, mattress, pillow, etc. I have become a big health freak recently, lol), help my family with finances and to secure a good life for my future children sounds very luring to me.  
I don't expect to shower in cash by barely passing classes and doing fuck all. I'm aware this is a challenging field and I'm willing to put in the work by continuously learning and adapting.  
Anyway, for those who went into tech purely for the big bucks, do you regret it? For those who think software engineering (or any other CS/IT related field) should be a passion, where do you see an issue in all of this?",2023-08-20 10:39:14

It's in a LCOL city and mostly remote. I've asked them if they will consider increasing the compensation and I have a few doubts now. Can they pull the original offer if I ask for more? As things stand, I would accept it because I liked the company and the role in general and I think it'll help me transition to a proper Data Science position which is what I want to do long term.

14bpahb,Feeling Undermined and Overlooked at Work,"I am currently a junior front-end developer, working on a project for over six months now. The work has been diverse and I have been learning a lot, but recent changes in the team structure have caused some challenges for me. The two senior front-end developers left, and their responsibilities were handed over to a former back-end junior, who now leads the front-end side as well.  
  
With this change, my role has been somewhat diminished. The new leader does not assign me challenging and engaging tasks like before, which makes me feel underutilized. I am fairly confident in my capabilities as I have demonstrated my skills on numerous occasions, but it seems that he doubts my abilities.  
  
Another issue that's been bothering me is the code review process. When I push changes and make a pull request, there are often comments on small mistakes in the code. I value constructive feedback and I'm always eager to improve, so I review the feedback and make the necessary corrections.  
  
However, in the last instance, my colleague privately messaged me expressing his frustration about having to point out my mistakes. I was tasked with swapping all PNG icons to SVG icons throughout the app - a process which involved modifying about 30 files and adjusting styling due to different icon sizes. He pointed out some missing elements that were neither in the original code nor in the requirements, and chided me for making ""stupid mistakes"".  
  
His remark seemed unnecessarily harsh and discouraging, especially since the task was monotonous and the missed elements weren't initially specified.  
  
I am looking for advice on how to address this situation. How can I communicate to him that I am more than capable of handling complex tasks, and that I believe his expectations on the icon-switching task were unclear? How should I handle his remark about my ""stupid mistakes""? Is it normal to face this level of scrutiny in code reviews, or is he being excessively critical?  
  
Any advice or insights you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

146pmlh,"Trying to get into a developer focused role within infrastructure (SRE/DevOps) as bare-metal SysAdmin, but not getting interviews. Help with CV?","https://imgur.com/KvllYpJ

As in the title, I've been working as a SysAdmin (although the role involves some backend programming and other things) since I graduated 3 years ago. I'm trying to look for a job as SRE or in DevOps, involving more programming in my tasks than I do now and working in a more modern setting, but I am having a hard time getting interviews because my lack of Cloud/K8s/IaC in a professional environment. 

Any tips on making me stand out more? Things that have crossed my mind, other ideas are welcome too:

- Maybe change the title from SysAdmin in my current job to something else more ""attractive""
- Someone mentioned to me to put my degree at the top to show that I am a programmer working as a SysAdmin, in case people reject me for being ""only"" a SysAdmin. Though about maybe putting a small introductory sentence at the top to show that too
- The ""Certificates"" part inside ""Skills"" could have a section on its own, although right now it's only online courses. I'm thinking of maybe getting formal AWS/K8s/Terraform certs if the search keeps going so badly for me.
- Have no idea if having ""Hobby Project"" written down is a good or bad thing.
- The other 3 experiences were on the side of the first one (as freelance),  that's why the dates are conflicting. Had ""Freelance"" instead of the employer before but got suggested to show a company name instead.

Ideally I'd want to relocate from south of Europe to a place further north (had an eye on Amsterdam), for a position in development of internal tools/scripts or automation of processes, but it's looking tough. Any help increasing my chances is welcome.

13y9etb,Fired. Need advice,"I was hired as a junior backend developer at a small company and there was a senior dev who kept going on really long meetings with me when I asked him a simple question that could be answered in 5 minutes. I went along out of respect since I was new but during a catch-up with my boss he implied that I wasn’t doing my work on my own and that I was bothering the senior dev. I kinda feel like I was backstabbed as all my commits and completed tickets have been my own work and the questions I’ve asked the senior dev were more about company specific things and about the codebase that I couldn’t possibly know if I haven’t been working there. So after that I made it a point to not ask him anything. my boss also complained about my productivity and said  I wasn’t making enough commits even though I usually completed my work behind schedule but the pull request to another senior dev takes ages to be reviewed and the product owner won’t assign any tickets to me when my current tickets are pending . I just didn’t see the point in making unnecessary commits to make it seem like I was more productive and making commits on work I have completed and pending a pull request review. I have mentioned during meetings around November and December that I didn’t have much to do but the product manager said that it was the end of the year and with the holidays coming up, I would be given more to do in the new year. The company was closed for pretty much the last half of December and also the first half of january so I’ve only worked for maybe 4 months. And I was fired when I came back from holiday at less than 6 months  citing not enough commits. I feel like I have been pretty productive as I completed all the tickets given to me but I’m  not given anything to do. I’ve never made a mistake and all the changes I’ve made during reviews were mostly formatting related as one of the senior devs have a very specific way of doing things that was an inside joke with the other devs. When I brought up lack of tickets  my boss blamed me for not being more assertive enough and not hounding her for more tasks but honestly I didn’t want to offend anyone.

I did an apprenticeship and never learned any of this while learning to code. For the potential of a higher caliber of employment I am interested in dedicating the next 3-6 months to doing that while maybe building a small project to keep my coding skills sharp. 

What do you all think? Is the gap too weird? Have you ever done something similar? Any ideas for tools/sites to help with it and make it more streamlined? I can pay for access. 

Thanks for any ideas you might have.

TLDR: been gone from work due to sickness, will be jobless soon and wanting to do interview prep and learn DSA for better job. Thoughts? Suggestions?",2024-02-11 11:21:40
1anny1o,Did you have similar experience in finding your first SWE job in Germany?,"I am considering relocation to Germany and looking for a first job there.

At the moment, I had 5 interviews/online assessments with German companies, and after they finished, my first thought often was: ""What it was?""

Will shortly describe application processes to explain my point:

* Company #1: No HR interview, just sent online test. The timing was very strict: only 3 min for each mathematical assignment.
* Company #2: Also started with online assignment. They gave a reasonable amount of time, but required screen sharing and web camera.
* Company #3: First interview was a CV examination. Interviewer questioned some random strings from my CV and tried to find imperfections in my prior work: ""What was the speed?"", ""Did it work?"", ...
* Company #4: One more online interview. I was requested to install a remote desktop app to solve a programming assignment on a remote PC. The task was basic, but it required a library, which I wasn't expected to know. The interviewer wanted to see how I google the documentation, learn it on the go, and explain the direction of my thoughts out loud. I was talked to in a commander manner like in the army.
* Company #5: First round was an online interview. The only place without pressure, humiliation or rudeness. Just an algorithmic task with follow-up questions about the programming language. Unfortunately, I haven't passed it, but I'd like to work with interviewers in the same team.

Companies #1-4 are no-name startups, company #5 is a famous brand.

Briefly about me:  
Good CV with 10 yoe, working in another EU country, don't know German.

Short summary about my job application process:  
20 job applications -> 5 first rounds -> 4 so-so places and 1 nice -> no offers

In contrast to other EU countries, Germany has plenty of vacancies for my specialization, but this experience makes me frustrated, and I am considering not to proceed with Germany.  
So, I have a couple of question to community:

1. Have you experienced similar things applying for a first job in Germany? Or, maybe I was unlucky or overreacted?
2. Could it be that some of the companies #1-4 make interview this way to negotiate the salary?
3. Will it be easier to find a second job in Germany, or it will be a similar rat race?
4. Do you like your work environment in Germany? Or do you find it pressuring, toxic or demanding?

at the same time, we had many many people working in all EU countries for 30 years or more. Salespersons, commuters over france-swiss border, people like me who worked during a long  stay/vacation in Poland or Germany for a swedish company with no problem. 

but when you read reddit, it seems like this is just not the case and people make made up scenarios about how it's IMPOSSIBLE to for example work 7 weeks in portugal if you are employed in germany. In the end, that's just not true and not many care even if it's a problem

18wrxoz,Am I ready for a step up in my career?,"I'm currently employed as a Software Engineering Manager, although this is really in title only - My team consists of me and one Junior Developer.  We are literally the only Software Engineers in our organisation. (My Boss is one of the non-technicial directors / Managers of the company).  The Junior only has about 6 months experience so the bulk of work is still carried out by yours truly. I have 8 years dev experience, all of which has been gained in very small teams.  
We have several products which we provide as a 'value added service' to our clients (software is not our primary business function, as you may have gathered!) as well as internal business critical systems which are used by our staff (the company has about 30 staff in total).  
On a day to day basis, my job consists of the following:  
\- Software architecture (i.e., where are we hosting an application, how should we structure the DB, what DB should we use, what language / framework should we use, should we break into microservices or just split by Serverside / Client side, how do we want to secure our application etc. etc. yadda yadda  
\- liasing with end users to determine functional requirements, i.e., what problem do they need to solve?  And then figuring out what we actually need to implement to solve that problem  
\- Designing UI (yup, all UI is done by the dev team)  
\- Writing Code (Serverside and client side and everything inbetween)  
\- DevOps - Implementing CI pipelines  
\- Code Management - Repository control / management  
\- Testing Software: self testing pretty much everything (no end users really get involved in any testing), signing off on tasks, ensuring functionality works as expected, ensuring latency / speed is up to par, ensuring DB queries etc. are efficient using benchmarking etc.  
\- End user support: presenting software to end users, conducting training sessions, dealing with support requests, dealing with bug fixes, ongoing changes etc.   
\- Supporting / Training the Junior developer on all of the above  
Anything else you can think of along the full SDLC can be added as a bullet point above.  
A lot of what i've learnt is Self taught, i.e., I haven't taken any direction from more Senior Devs since throughout most of my career, i've been in very small teams and have just kind of had to figure things out along the way.   
To the guys I work with just now, I'm a 10x Dev - they think I'm great but they are non technical and my worry is that if I were to jump into a team of 20 engineers, would I just be another average Mid level Dev? It's very hard to gauge your relative expertise when you don't have anyone to compare yourself too.  The few experienced devs we have had on our team previously were certainly a few rungs on the ladder below in terms of capabilities, but this is a very small subset (literally 3 other guys).  
So my concern is this - I would like to move into a position with greater responsibility and progression opportunities - whether that is an Engineering Manager, Lead Engineer, Architect etc. but I fear if I leave my current company and take on another position, I may not have the required experience and/or skillset to fulfill the role successfully.  Like I say, its very hard to gauge whether you are ready to progress into a role with more responsibility when you have no way to compare yourself with people who are already in said roles.  
Any and all advice is very welcome!  
Thanks

18qg9lw,AI material for software engineer,"I'm a professional Java developer.  AI is currently a new buzzword in town.

My company also has an AI division, which consists of Data Scientists and Data Engineers. They are good at building models, however results are bad if we look from engineering point of view. No tests, no logging, almost all deploys results in errors and/or complete downtime of their part of the system. It's really bad - in other words. Situation is known in the company.

Therefore, to help them develop software I thought it might be good for me to increase my knowledge in AI (from complete zero), so I could help AI team develop their part of the system. The AI part of system is created with Python.

I did some googling on the Internet and found a couple of books on AI:

18qf65x,Software Engineer position but with QA responsibilities,"Merry Christmas everyone!

Recently I've been offered a Java Software Engineer position, I went through multitple interview stages that were testing my programming knowledge, mainly Java.

After getting through all of that I am sent a mail with my responsibilities which to my surprise have more in common with a QA position than programming and now I am puzzled.  
Edit: List of responsibilities:  
\- Collaborate closely with various teams to enhance Quality Assurance efforts.  
\- Conduct manual execution of testing scenarios.  
\- Develop and sustain automated testing procedures.  
\- Document and communicate identified problems.  
\- Drafting scenarios for testing.  


The company sounds nice and for someone who's just starting my career in this field after graduating it looks like a good opportunity. However I am afraid of being a bit lied to and that I will be pigeonholed into a QA role instead.

I asked about potential team rotations and their response was along the lines of ""maybe maybe, can't promise anything"".

What do you think? Should I give it a try with the hope of them rotating me after a while to something more programming related? As I said, I am just starting so I am also looking at it from perspective of ""getting the foot in the door"" but I don't want to screw up so early.",2023-12-25 09:07:38

As I talked to my peers I found out that it was already planned to cut 6 people but not in my location, then in the afternoon it was in fact 8 people with 2 from my location. Our manager told my lead senior colleague that we're gonna know who these people are on Monday but those concerned have already been informed, so in principle it's neither me nor this colleague, but manager wants him to start doing some training related to another project going on so it seems they're expecting this client to make further cuts.

This consultancy seem to be very humane and I think they'll do everything to avoid firing people unless there's no other way but I have recently joined it and am still in the 3rd month of a experimental period of 6 months, they can fire me any time so I'm feeling quite vulnerable.

I made a CV and sent it and also one of my cover letters to a senior developer and SEO of one company and asked for opinion.  
I was told that the cover letter shouldn't be that large. But in addition, a CV needs a visually pleasing template, when I just made the text in a Word document without a template. He said that he had seen such examples in the West, but not so often.  
On the other hand, representatives of the British Job Centre told me that this may be enough.  
Also, there were questions about experience. If in the CV for trainee/junior developer I can indicate some of my projects and a link to Github, then I don’t know what to indicate in the CV for QA. Because I don’t know if it’s possible to get some experience in QA on my own, without practical experience in a company.

178dp2z,Downleveled to support role at FAANG. is it still worth it?,"Hey everyone, throwaway acc here, don't want to dox myself and give too many details (pls don't ask country or company name).

I'll start by telling a bit about my background: I worked as a fullstack dev for 3 years, got tired of working as a dev and applied to other roles within my company. managed to land a role as a cloud engineer even though I'm not ultra experienced in it and I've been working for 4 months in this new role. by far I am enjoying this role more, but I'm not liking how things are done in my company, so I want to change jobs, also pay is really bad and I want to get out of my country (PIGS).

I have always wanted to work at a FAANG and I recently interviewed with one. I completed the whole intervieweing process and I did well in some technical rounds but failed a pretty important technical interview and because of that they decided that I wasn't a right fit for the cloud eng role that I interviewed for.

But they still liked me and offered me a role in support, they said it's pretty common to progress from this support engineer role to the cloud engineer role over time.

So if I end up accepting, my career path will look like this: fullstack dev > cloud engineeer > support engineer > cloud engineer.

I'm aware this is not a traditional career progression, so I'm slightly concerned of this hurting my  options in the future, but at the same time I think it could be an interesting experience, something that I've never considered doing, this experience could drastically improve my soft skills and allow me to keep studying and improving my skills to become a good cloud engineer.

I didn't get the written offer yet, but I'm pretty sure I'll be making way more than what I currently make, also on top of that, they'll offer me a relocation package to move to another country that I'm really interested in.

I need a bit of advice in terms of widening my skill set. I have just graduated and received my PhD in Machine Learning (specifically in Reinforcement Learning). I had no trouble landing a 3-year postdoc, having an above average track record. 

All that being said, my background is a lot more in the theory side of machine learning, where the split is like 70% theory and 30% empirical. That means I spent most of my time working mathematically, coding minimally to get proof-of-concept empirical results. I am 99% committed to continuing in the academia. However, I decided that I will widen my skill set in the next 3 years, on the side, to at least have the option of finding a job in industry, in case the academic job market stalls. Now, I can start working on mobile development, backend etc. but I reckon it is better to capitalize on my ML expertise. 

My question is: which path do you think has the highest probability of good employment in industry for me? I am torn in between ML Engineer, Data Scientist, and MLOps. I will also need to figure out how to get the knowledge/experience in each of these, since I have no idea what tech stack people use for say ML engineering or data science.

15pwqq2,Starting a career in development at 32. Would a conversion masters be better than a bachelors?,"Hello everyone, hope this post is alright for this sub, I would really appreciate some advice about moving into a career in development.

My situation is that I am 32 years old and living abroad. I have made some money in my country of residence doing various jobs, but mainly tutoring at universities, and I have a nice job that gives me more free time than usual. This sounds great but I want to change careers for a couple of reasons. The first is that we are planning a move back to the UK (my home country) some time in the not so distant future, and also I feel like I have come to a dead end in my career (which I am not so enthusiastic about anyway to be honest). 

I have been thinking about moving into Tech for a while, and particularly software development.Up until university I used to enjoy all things computers, making mods for games, learning to code and making websites. At uni I studied Art, another passion of mine, and concentrated on that ever since. For the past year I have been getting back into programming, I did part of the Harvard CS50 course and enjoyed it (didn't quite finish it due to other commitments but I plan to revisit it), and am finishing up The Odin Project right now, which I am loving (I know it's not software development, but I started it when I was trying things out and am enjoying it so want to see it out till the end), I feel like I have found the passion for learning I used to have and enjoy my time coding and learning a lot.

The trouble I have is that I have no formal qualifications in this field, and doing a bootcamp in my current country would be hard, so I have been using and looking at mainly online courses. I want to be able to get an entry level job when I move away and from what I gather having a CS degree would help in that regard, so I have found a few distance courses that I can do, and that don't look like they're just after my money.

The question I have is whether there would be a big difference in doing a conversion Masters course, or starting from a Bachelors course. While the bachelors is longer, I am under the impression that while doing it I might be able to start an internship or apply for entry level jobs while completing it. 

The two courses I am considering are the University of Bath MSc in Computer Science, and one Bachelors of Software Development at International University of Applied Sciences.

Any insight into whether one or the other might be more worth it would be appreciated, as well as any other advice that might help in my situation. Thanks for reading",2023-08-13 11:43:23

Then changed to a big multinational bank where I was making \~40k gross (\~30k net) as a Jr. DevOps and worked my way up there and moved to a start-up in the US, making \~45k. In that company I acquired extensive knowledge of AWS and infrastructure as code and got certifications for it and all that. Then I switched to a company in Slovenia (where I live), where I make about 50k. In this company I was promoted a few times and right now my position is as Sr. DevOps, but I'm doing a TL's job, basically in charge of a project for a fintech in another country (also EU), doing the architecture design of the cloud infrastructure of the company and managing a small team of DevOps engineers. I report directly to the director of the engineering department and my colleagues are the software architects of the different services the company offers.I'm very happy with this company, but for what I'm seeing in the posts and comments here (And I've been lurking here for a long time), I'm grossly underpaid.

So, since last year I started replying to the offers I get in LinkedIn to see how much they are offering, and all the offers I get are about the same, 50 to 60k euro gross. Same when I search for jobs there myself. When I find things around or over 100k, it's for US or Canadian residents.

But this doesn't seem to be in line with what I see in Glassdoor or similar websites. It seems like every website I check, it looks like in the EU I should be making at least twice as much as I'm making, but I can't seem to find where to get such jobs.

So, the question is:What am I missing here? I feel like there's some important information I'm lacking.

How do you guys get these positions I see here, where you start as a trainee making more than what I make in a technical leadership role?

What am I doing wrong?  


Edit:   
Thanks guys for your comments and messages!  I'm glad I decided to post here after so much time lurking. I have a more clear view of my career situation now and you gave me some food for thought.   
I think I'll stick to this company for some time more to get a promotion and consolidate in a leadership role and then attempt to jump to a tech company in another country, working directly for them without intermediate companies, while also negotiating salary and benefits more assertively.",2023-07-20 13:51:35
153uoay,Is this offer too low in this case?,"Hi everyone, I just got an offer for a position in Germany as backend developer for about 55k (mostly remote). From what I know, this is rather on the low side (down from 68k in my last job), but would you consider it too low? They justify the salary with them requiring certain additional skills that I don't have a strong background in yet. Apparently senior developers make about 90k there, so the difference seems pretty steep.

Offers with better conditions seem pretty sparse recently; does it make sense to keep looking or take up this offer in the meanwhile?

I have a Master's degree in CS and about 4.5 years of experience, although 4 of those were as a single full-stack developer in a non-IT company, so I am actually still catching up with some of the workflows that are typical in larger development teams.

Your thoughts?,"So today I just happened to notice that someone had made a wee mistake naming one of the SQL script files with a missing letter so it said `_t1_` instead of `_Pt1_`. I took a quick peek at the file with Notepad++, saw that it was my boss's file, pointed this out in the Teams chat, and asked her if she if wanted me to correct it? She said yes and thanks, but the next thing she starts up saying what was doing in the Approvals folder. I said I just happened to have it open after putting files in there and had not closed the explorer window. So then the senior dev starts up saying to me please don't mess with files in there, I said, I would never do that, all I do is just put files in there to get approved. Finally my boss made an announcement saying that she doesn't want us to leave folders open in case we delete files by mistake.

14jite7,Relocating as a non-EU citizen to west slavic country,"Hey there! I'm a software developer from Colombia. It's been over 7 years since I graduated, and for the past 3 years, I've been working as a backend developer on NodeJS. In the last 1.5 years, I've been working with clients from the US.

Now, straight to the point. Last year, I had the opportunity to travel all around central Europe for several months and in while doing so, I fell in love with the region, particularly Poland, Slovakia, and the Northwestern Balkans (Slovenia and Croatia). I had visited Western Europe before, but there was something about the people in the West Slavic countries that really resonated with me ( down-to-earth, honest, humble, and super friendly).

So, as soon as I got back home, I started looking into ways I could relocate to the region in the near future. But, as you know, the current economic situation isn't exactly helping. I've applied to over 60 job openings, but I haven't received any follow-up responses other than a simple ""thanks for applying, but unfortunately..."" message. And forget about interview, I haven't gotten a single invitation.

That's when I began considering a plan B: going for a full-time MSc program. There are different options available, with some universities having affordable tuition fees (around $3000/year) like Comenius at BA, and others that make you stop and think (around $8000/year) like Ljubljana University.

But here's the thing that worries me apart from choosing the university: what happens after I finish my studies? I want to know which of these countries offer the best job opportunities for someone like me who speaks English, Spanish, and, by then, some of the local languages. I know Poland has the biggest job market in the region, but considering the population differences, I'm not sure if it's that much better than the others. Maybe in smaller countries like Slovenia or Slovakia, it would be easier to find a well-paid job compared to Poland where there's more competition.

Also, I'm curious about how easy it is to move from one country to another within the region, in case I decide to do so in the future.",2023-06-26 14:26:59

I recently accepted a job offer from a consulting company. The pay was good and the position was also interesting. After I sign the contract, I realized that the position that I applied did not exist and it is merely an ad to attract people into their talent pool.

But after more then 5 telephone call with the recruiter telling them I am already in the company talent pool and looking  for a project, they told me the job that they advertise does not exist and it is just to attract young talent. I feel so dissapointed and deceived. Do I still get paid even if I am not working in any project?

Then i had the final interview two weeks ago which was onsite along with other engineers. All interviews
went well and i was told during the final interview that they'll let me know about their decision after exactly 1 week(Wednesday). I sent the HR that i was in contact with a thanking email and she replied me this: ""Thank you for the kind follow up. l wanted to let you know we'll have the meeting with the team on the final feedback this Wednesday, and we should be able to have updates for you then"".  That Wednesday was supposed to be last week's one emailed her again on friday asking the status still no reply it has been two weeks since final interview and one week have passed to the day when they promised to let me know. I am just mad because i wasted so much time on the project and interviews. l also have some other offers but this one being such a big software company (one of the big companies from silicon valley) is really my dream internship :( Atleast they should let me know what they are doing.

I've been seriously stressed out as I can't find a proper job ever since. It's also hitting me bad as I have 1.5 or so YoE and can't seem to quite be regarded as a ""mid level"" engineer, and get mostly rejected due to experience alone. There's virtually no junior offers, none.

I'm mostly a frontend engineer,  in JavaScript / Angular, and don't know what to do. Recently I've seen some job offers but they are almost always fullstack engineer roles since companies want a rockstar that does work of 10 people.

I've been working a job at a medium-sized tech company in Germany for 5 months now. In total, I have over 3 YoE in the field (excluding internships) and I'm in my early 20's. I make a tiny bit above average in my city.

I'm really struggling with my team, but also with the product we are developing.

The senior, Bob, in our team is very toxic. Bob gets aggressive often and thinks only his opinions are valid. When another colleague throws a clarification question on the table, Bob noticably starts to get annoyed. Bob also feels the need express his negative opinions on just about anything during the day.

Obviously, Bob is a very negative person, and this is not a good environment to be in. In my short time here it is very clear that my other colleagues are also struggling with Bob. Every other colleague is very nice and I'm having a good time with all of them.

I've talked with my manager about this. Bob is on his final stroke, it's been a problem ever since he got more experience, but is ""improving his behavior"". I'm not buying that. Bob is a senior, and the team is heavily depending on him.

I'm currently on my probation period, which lasts for 1 more month. I've been thinking of quitting, as the thought of just going to work with this guy ruins all the fun of it. My previous 2 jobs I had both only lasted under 2 years, and I feel quitting so soon would make me a job hopper. I'm an expat and I'm a beginning German speaker, so I have to use English to get around, which would make it a lot harder to find a new job.

What do you think I should do? Should I quit? Should I stay? Switching teams is not possible.",2023-05-22 13:03:52

Both degrees require you to take 8 modules and complete a 15,000 word dissertation. The main difference that I can see between the two degrees is that the software engineering degree has 4/5 compulsory modules where as computer science only has one compulsory module (although to be fair I lean towards the more practical side so I would probably take the SE modules even if I did the computer science degree).

There are also some additional modules that you can only take on the Computer Science degree such as machine learning, signal processing, data ethics, and digital preservation.

My line manager who has been in the industry for decades seems to think that software engineering sounds better but almost every job listing I have ever seen says 'Computer Science or similar related discipline' which makes me think that Computer Science is seen as the gold standard. I'm sure there's not much in it but I'm curious to hear people's thoughts. I also get the impression that a Computer Science degree would enable me to pursue both software engineering jobs and research positions but software engineering might only allow me to pursue engineering jobs.",2023-04-25 21:36:45

11opqz3,"Feeling stuck and stifled in my current job, how to move to greener pastures ?","Hello Reddit,

A bit of background to frame my problem : I graduated in 2019 with a Mathematics/Machine Learning Master's degree. I was offered a PhD position at graduation, and I took it without much conviction because I was the typical aimless graduate who didn't know what to do with his career, and was afraid to be unemployed. I did not care much for the specific thesis subject at the time, and I still do not. It was a mistake to accept the offer without trying to look around a bit first.

A year after that, I left my PhD, on good terms with my advisors, in the middle of the pandemic. After this, I moved back home and took up an industry job, in one of the AI teams of a multinational company. 

After nearly 2 years on the job, I am growing increasingly frustrated with the work I do.

Due to the nature of the company's products, and its available infrastructure, it is mostly basic and cookie cutter work. There is precious little room to implement state of the art methods, or to try innovating ourselves. I see all of the cool advances in my field month after month, read very interesting papers, and think to myself : ""Man, I wish I could work on things at such an advanced level.""

My team is mostly junior employees with less than 3 years of experience in the field. There is no senior research engineer to mentor us or anything.

My manager is very happy with my work and performance (unlike myself), and considers me to have expertise on several topics on which I frankly do not.

I see no way to continue growing my skills in this particular job, and I am afraid of stagnation, and eventually being outpaced / becoming obsolete. A sort of knowledge/expertise FOMO.

I would like to move into a job, team or environment where I could have the opportunity to work with more up to date tools and methods, where I could collaborate with senior or experienced people in my field, and generally continuously grow my skills.

However, I do not really know how to go about it, or if it is even a possibility. 

I am hesitating between trying to start a PhD, this time taking care to actually pick out a subject I care about, with the intent of finishing, or changing companies. I do not regret leaving my first PhD, but I do kind of regret leaving academia and research behind.

The problem I foresee with changing companies is that I assume most interesting positions require a PhD. That, and being able to sort between positions which are advertised as R&D positions, but where you end up doing basic things over and over again with little research and innovation, and actual R&D positions.

And as for going back to a PhD, I have no idea if any lab would even have me, having left academia for over 2 years. How to even get back into academia ? Do I just start applying to PhD positions online, do I send emails to professors who publish papers on topics I am interested in ?

In the meantime, I am working on personal projects in my time off. It has brought me some measure of relief, but I do not have much time to dedicate to it, and things have been slow to progress.

Has anyone here encountered a similar issue before, or gone from industry back to academia ? If so, I would be very eager to hear about your experience.

Similarly, if you work in a R&D position in ML/AI, I'd be interested to know how candidates are recruited for positions like yours, if a PhD is required, and even get in touch with you to discuss further, if you are so inclined.

Thanks for reading all of this, and have a good day.",2023-03-11 17:27:47
11ejbye,Offer comparison London vs. Zürich,"Hi everyone, writing to you from Zürich, Switzerland (EU citizen).

I have a competing offer for a role in London from a similar sized bank as a quant strat with a bump in the corporate title from analyst to associate and a 95k GBP base + 35k GBP bonus (~156k USD) with a better stack (C++ and python instead of R) and closer to front office.3 days WFH, 30d/ holiday, and similar other pension and paternity benefits.

London: - taxes are higher, + COL is lower. These two almost cancel out. My marginal tax rate in Zürich is ~30% while in London it would be 40%.

Zürich: +quality of life, -boring. These two almost cancel out.

As my german and swiss german are very rudimentary, there is a high appeal to live in an English speaking country and close to a bigger job market. So ++ to London. But I would miss skiing in the mountains on the weekends which are just 1h drive away.

The new team also seems to have a lower turnover rate and will be reporting to a more senior manager giving me more space to climb the ladder.

1bkh0oa,My job hunt summary/statistics as a Java dev (8 years exp),"After 35 days from sending the first CV, after being let go in the third week of starting a new job, I received a new offer to sign.

Statistics:

* 50 CVs sent,
* 17 screening invitations,
* 12 cultural fit/manager interviews,
* 4 homework assignments (usually <4h),
* 8 technical (=final) interviews,
* at least two (waiting for some results still) job offers, one of which was Schrödinger's meaning that they said they wanted me but have to open a new position especially for me, they never called back.

I have 3 technical interviews ahead of me, but I think I'll pass on waiting for the final results because a) it'll take at least a week b) I feel like I've found a nice place with a lot of autonomy.

Financially? In the end, I got the same salary as from the job I was fired from, plus better benefits (37-hour work week and 2% interest rate discount on mortgage, so some real money there if I ever take out a mortgage). Where are the downsides? In return, I have to be in the office 3 days a week (with the possibility of occasionally working fully remotely, e.g. around holidays or vacations) and a slightly worse office location, lack of the cool startup vibe 😉

About me? Java dev in the industry for the past 8, no Cloud experience or too many sexy 2024 keywords. I'm rather average when it comes to development skills. Self-taught. Recently I switched to Go, just to get fired and be forced to brush up on everything Java-related because there are only se few Go offers. also, I don't speak (fluently) the local language in the country where I live and work 😉

Impressions: out of those 17 interviews total (managerial+technical, 34 if counted the HR/screening interviews), maybe 5 companies I would seriously consider based on the interviews and how they were conducted. Most of them were very one-sided, interrogation-based interviews, instead of a partnership and mutual understanding and time for questions from both sides. The typical set-up for a technical interview was 60minutes for the company and 2 minutes (overtime) for me.

I thought that some people might be interested to see some stats, therefore I'm sharing. Country of residence: Sweden",2024-03-21 20:48:02

1b6kwh1,Is the Netherlands the remote working capital of europe?,"Remote workers save on average 72 minutes each day and thousands of dollars a year, are happier and even have more sex...

According to euronews 65% of dutch people worked at least partially remotely in 2022. The proportion of remote workers in the Netherlands is four times higher than in the UK or the US. The dutch parliament approved a law making working from home a legal right. Employers must consider requests for remote working and provide a reason for denying it.

Can anyone living in the Netherlands tell us your experiences with remote work or if not if it is widespread or accepted there? Is remote work ""normal"" or is it seen negatively by employers? Do remote workers get a pay cut or do they get paid similar to their non-remote peers?

1bozkzh,"100k offer in switzerland, close to the French border ","Hi,

I know nothing about switzerland, but got a job offer on LinkedIn,

In France I can save between 10k and 15k (making 50k) if good bonus per year while living in Paris. How much can I save in Switzerland ? I get mixed signals on Reddit, some say you can save a lot others say the opposite because of the cost of living 

Is the social life really that bad ? I didn't like the Netherlands because my social circle wad reduced to expats. I like being with expats, but it limits quite a lot the social possibilities. I had a very good salary in the Netherlands but that was not sustainable as most expat friends have left the country.

Should I jump on the occasion ? Or will it be a dead end just like the Netherlands 

Sorry if the question is asked too often,

1bo4zv6,Offer from Tesla Berlin Gigafactory,"Hi All,

I am scratching my head over the salary negotiations with Tesla in Berlin Gigafactory. I am not able to get any data on salaries online for a Senior Manufacturing Engineer with 7 years of experience in the same energy industry

I already make 4000Euros after taxes in another EU country with all the benefits like social security, pension etc.

When I looked up to the cost of living in and around that area the rent for a decent house is twice or even higher than what I currently pay which is 900 euros per month (in berlin its easily 1500 -2000 euros). I currently live in a small european town where the general living costs are also lower.

I am thinking if the cost of living that high in berlin than I would need atleast 6000 euros after taxes in germany. Is that realistic with tesla? Can I ask around 120000 euro gross per year which will be around 5700 euros per month after taxes after 43% tax deduction.

Can anyone tell me from their experience what could be a realistic ask? Am I asking to low or too high?

1bbwta8,Offer Evaluation,"Company in Barcelona: Eur 70k base, Eur 2k stocks, Eur 7k joining bonus, 10% base yearly bonus. 
Level: L4
Location: Barcelona
Not an EU citizen, company sponsoring work visa.


Currently based in Singapore with SGD 180k base plus SGD 15k. ( on Work Visa- Employment Pass)

Years of Experience 10 years. 

I am assuming the cost of living is cheaper in Barcelona than Singapore. But it is hard to take a judgement from here. 
Healthcare and Education costs for my kid is much higher her in SG, assumption is education is covered and my wife might be able to pick up a job there. 


What does anyone think about it?

Edit: Family of 3 (3 year old kid)

Edit2: COL in SG 

In SGD, I pay 3800 in rent. Around 2500 for my kid’s education ( 1 kid) . 1400 for groceries and eating out. 150 for transport. Electricity 300 miscellaneous another 1000. So around 9000 SGD  - 9500 SGD per month. Other medical costs can vary, my kid also takes some speech therapies here.

Edit3: Thanks a lot for all the answers, based on this discussion I am leaning in to reject this. The base seems to be low to manage a family. 
Few other considerations for me apart from financial:
- being part of eu, ( I was assuming the EU market will open up, which would have a lot more opportunities than a tiny island of Singapore
- Long term immigration, Spanish passport is pretty strong too, potential PR in 5 years, in Singapore that doesn’t seem like an option, my kid was born there and still no PR or citizenship. I can plan another kid who might be able to get citizenship in 2 years 
- My wife would be able to work, which is not an option in Singapore 
- Also more stability, I can get kicked out of Singapore really easily if I get fired, just 1 months notice, no worker rights for foreigners. They are also doubling down on reducing visa quotas. So there is always a fear of not being able to settle with the kid
- Singapore education can be a bit too much. Too much emphasis on grades, asian way of studying can get harsh and kids might not be able to cope up. I was under the impression that education in Europe is good in schools
- Get my leg in the property ladder. Singapore is a pipe dream. Small 700 sq ft apartment is like 1.2 mil SGD. plus there isa 60 percent tax for foreigners. So I have to wait to become PR ( which can even take 2,4,6,10, or forever ) Government housing is also dependent on becoming a PR which also has 3 years cliff period. In Barcelona I was eyeing on 300k euro apartments

Edit4: Thanks again for all the answers, I am still considering a middle ground so hear me out. Since this is primarily going to be WFH job what place do you think I can live in where the rent is maybe 800ish? It can maybe be 1-2 hour away from train. Stay there until I save up for buying a house or my wife gets a job. I want a place that is kind ( give some slack) to non spanish speaker. I intend to learn the language but realistically it will take me 1 year to have functional knowledge. ",2024-03-11 06:37:57
1bp15h0,Struggling to find a job in Vienna - Is my expectation too high?,"Context: I'm a senior full-stack dev with 8+ YoE, currently living/working as a non-EU foreigner in Prague (Czech Rep).

I've been looking for my new job in Vienna for the last 5 months. I've also applied for jobs in a few other cities, and Vienna is my most ideal destination now because the city is so modern, clean and beautiful yet the housing situation doesn't seem too bad.

Since the beginning of the job hunting (i.e. 5 months ago), I've had a chance to have meetings with 5 companies. Here's the stats:

* Rejected at the last tech-interview
* Rejected at the first HR interview (they decided to go with other candiates)
* Rejected at the first HR interview (no reason given, but it seems that **my salary expectation might be too high for them**)
* Rejected at the first HR interview (same as above. The interviewer gave me lukewarm reaction when I mentioned my salary expectation)
* I withdrew the process since the company seemed too small and the tech-stack wasn't matching what it was advertised

As you can see above, 2 out of 5 resulted in rejection (perhaps) because my salary expectation didn't match what the companies can offer. My salary expectation for a senior dev in Vienna is 70k to 75k.

Is my salary expectation too high? Is my tech stack (React + Node, a bit of AWS and k8s) unpopular, or has the job market there been simply bad?",2024-03-27 12:54:17

They already told him that he will have a lot of responsibilities, and that he will likely be the spokesperson for most projects they have, but they are only offering him 65k a year. Given that it's a more traditional company, they don't offer any extra perks such as car, bike, and so on.

Personally I find it really low, but it has been a while since I had to negotiate salaries so I'm not sure how to advise him the best. As for experience, he has 8 years of experience as a Data Scientist, and almost 18 as a professional.

He has been searching for a job already for a while, but as he's a foreigner in the Netherlands, and as his MSc isn't in data science, things have been a bit more difficult for him.

I told him that this is a no go, but I don't want to mislead him.

Edit: He's not entitled to the 30% rule. Some people already mentioned that here but unfortunately he can't get it. Also the company is offering a very low amount of holidays (25), which I understand that is standard, but strange for a higher position and given that he's over 40.",2024-03-13 11:05:14

They have over engineered the entire stack with event sourcing with replay-ability, micro/nano-services for smaller domains, fully asynchronous inter service communication, very experimental programming styles and libraries, anemic domain driven design everywhere in the code organisation, huge amount of boilerplate. Even for a very small fixes, diffs span 60/70 files and reviews are getting more and more complicated and lengthier.  


There is very strict waterfall model about the architectural decisions, everything plays out very correctly in their mind, and everyone just has to follow these things. If they don't like the code, they simply overwrite everything overnight.

1bnmp5c,Fully Remote Job for $50k in Germany for non-EU dude,"Hello everyone,

I'm at a crossroads in my career and potentially my life, and I find myself in need of guidance, particularly from those who have navigated the tech industry in Germany or have made a significant career move internationally.

**Background:**
- After being laid off, I've received a job offer for a fully remote position as a test engineer in Germany with an annual salary of €50k. I come with 7 years of total work experience, with about 3 of those specifically in test engineering.
- Previously, I was earning €61k in Canada in one of its very slightly more affordable cities (ie not Toronto or Vancouver but the next one lol).
- The move to Germany is partly motivated by the opportunity to obtain citizenship within 5 years, but I'm also open to moving to Switzerland after acquiring German citizenship. Additionally, I've considered Ireland and Belgium but was deterred by the housing crisis and the lack of high salaries or job opportunities, respectively.
- I did a bit of German in school and am probably A1. Will definitely get it up to B1 or even C1 if I’m motivated enough. Please feel free to recommend some resources to study German to a great level
- I plan to move on a working holiday visa initially and later convert to a Blue Card.

**Job Offer Assessment:**
- Given my background and the offer of €50k in Germany for a fully remote tech position, how does this compare considering the cost of living and quality of life?
- Are there specific benefits or factors I should negotiate or inquire about, considering my situation and the remote nature of the job?

**Potential Move to Freiburg:**
- I'm particularly drawn to Freiburg or its surrounding villages, attracted by the lifestyle, the proximity to France and Switzerland, and the potential for travel within Europe.
- Considering my salary and remote work, would you recommend living in Freiburg or elsewhere? What are the living conditions, community, and expat experience like?

**Other City Recommendations:**
- Besides Freiburg, which other cities in Germany would you recommend for someone in my situation? I’m looking for a good balance between quality of life, cost of living, and community.
- on the other hand, Munich is also appealing because it will be easier to find a new, higher paying job that might require in office time

 
**Blue Card and Career Path Concerns:**
- With a non-CS science degree and my experience in test engineering, do I meet the qualifications for a Blue Card? How does the industry view this background, and will it affect my career trajectory or citizenship prospects?

**General Advice:**
- If you've made a similar move or have insights into the tech industry and living in Germany (or potentially moving to Switzerland), what has your experience been?
- Are there challenges or benefits I should be aware of in making this transition?

I’m seeking a comprehensive perspective to make a well-informed decision, so any advice, personal anecdotes, or resources you could offer would be immensely appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your time and help!",2024-03-25 19:36:33

Somehow the company I work at managed to get an important contract from a big client, and needless to say, we’re completely overworked. Today the senior told me that I have to work faster and that I take up too much time to finish my tasks. The problem is that we’re never getting briefed about how to tackle the tasks. The internal libraries and our huge project were never explained to us and most of the time our seniors are so overworked that they don’t even have time to answer our questions.
Sometimes I’m spending 2-3 hours just to understand what the fuck is going on in the files I’m working with, each with at least 600-800 lines of code. The project was never explained to us.
I told this to my senior and he told me that if I want to become a senior, that’s a skill I need to learn.
In my opinion, we’re basically being treated as cheap work force, because we’re being paid as juniors, while the autonomous work we’re supposed to do is more of a senior or even a freelance approach. 
Am I right about this? What is the average junior developer with 2 yoe doing? ",2024-03-25 23:17:08
1bc1ces,🆘 Dealing with a micromanaging boss,"For some background, I recently joined a small team within a Brussels-based international institution. In total, there are six of us: three employees, two interns, and our manager. My role is quite interesting, I am paid very well, and it provides valuable experience for my CV.

However, my manager epitomizes a micromanaging boss! As I write this, he could be looking over my shoulder - no joke.

He is in his early 60s (just for some context, I am in my mid-30s) and is one of those old-school individuals who arrives at work at 8 AM and doesn't leave until 6-7 PM (sometimes I go out to walk the dog and I still see the light in his office switched on, LOL).

Our agency has a policy in place for working from home, allowing us to work remotely for two days. In my first week, he subtly pressured me to only work from home for one day, but I addressed the issue and managed to secure two days. Today (Monday) is one of these agreed-upon remote work days, and I stayed at home. However, I have just received a semi-passive-aggressive email from him, questioning why I didn't come to the office this morning. After reminding him that we agreed on Monday and Wednesday as my work-from-home days, he stated that he didn't receive any official email from me, and that our oral agreement isn't valid without an email. In comparison, other teams in the company have much more flexibility, as long as there is agreement on the days when everyone is in the office. Even then, they exercise a greater level of flexibility.

Speaking of working from home, he never takes advantage of this option himself, and is present in the office five days a week. He is a workaholic who enjoys spending time in the office. Since his wife does not work, she takes care of household tasks while he is at work (such as taking out the garbage, going to the post office, receiving deliveries, cleaning, etc.), while I live alone and don't have the luxury to delegate such responsibilities. As a result I do these tasks during the weekend and I always end up feeling dreadful.

He wants to know every detail about what I (and the rest of the team) do on a daily basis. He frequently comes into my office to inquire about my current tasks. He insists on being CC'd in every email and rarely use MS Teams (preferring to communicate via email, even for minor and insignificant matters).

Another example occurred last week, when I produced 40 content pieces/files and sent them to him. One of the files had a spelling mistake in its name. He took a screenshot of the file name and asked me to rename it, which came about two hours after he had asked me to prioritize another task.

It would literally take him 2 secs to rename the file, instead he opted to do a screenshot, crop it, upload it and send it via email. What a complete waste of time!

We have weekly one-on-one catch-up meetings scheduled for 30 minutes, but they typically last between 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes.

The rest of the team feels the same way, and when we have rare moments alone, everyone expresses their frustration with our manager. However, they have learned to tolerate the micromanagement as they are content with the generous salary and other benefits.

To be very honest, he is an incredibly smart and eloquent person with a tone of relevant experience (he started our as a journalist for the Economist and NYT, and later switched to international affairs), speaks 3 languages.... but he is just very uncreative, controlling and lacks proper time management skills for a person of his position. I noticed that even our 2 interns are better managing their time than  him!

As a result of all of this I feel deeply unhappy and I have already started applying to other jobs.

Any tips on how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!",2024-03-11 11:51:37

1behb2n,"Burnout, on a work permit","I moved to Austria on a RWR card and have been here for a year now. The project has been a mess since the beginning and still is now. Initially, I was excited to improve and iron things out. With the help of some team members, we managed to clean things up a bit but as I go deeper, it feels like everything is a never-ending wrestling match with no end in sight.

There were new projects which had me excited again for a while but when those projects were finished, I found myself stuck with this Frankenstein shit repos once again. It's impossible to troubleshoot anything because recently, our IT also removed our sudo rights and we can barely move without having to create a service desk ticket. Multiple developers have raised this issue, nothing happened. One time, they accidentally blocked Gitlab..

We have a new hire and I saw myself in him. He's so pumped up and excited about all the new stuff he can improve. I was very supportive of his ideas but felt bad after showing him a list of backlog tickets dedicated for improvements. All his ""new"" ideas and more are already there, blocked by some bullshit, and forgotten just so we can work on more important things that are also blocked by bullshit. It's like a graveyard of every team member's hopes and dreams.

It's depressing going through these old tickets and remembering how excited I was back then. Now I barely have the energy to work, not even from home. Today, I picked up another seemingly straightforward task.. and it's blocked by bullshit again. I closed my laptop and started looking for new jobs but I'm afraid I might get fired before I get another one.

I have been applying and trying to go to the Netherlands since I finished my studies as I have some close friends there, I got so many rejections without interviews because of not being based in the Netherlands, however eventually I had one company reply and I managed to get an offer, from what I have seen they have a great atmosphere, very positive work-life balance and take good care of their employees, I got that impression because I did the last round of interviews on-site as I was visiting the Netherlands during that interview process. Initially, they said they pay 4k per month but it turned out that the Dutch law requires a minimum of 5.3k for someone to be able to come and work from abroad, and after some consideration and crossing out some benefits that they might provide they decided to offer that amount, but I will have no raises whatsoever, my salary will always be determined by the minimum that the dutch government imposes, this will give a total compensation of 69K after adding the 8% vacation allowance, but because of the 30% ruling in the Netherlands I will pay less taxes for the first 5 years and end up with around 56k net.

I accepted that around the end of last year but it took them some time to be a ""recognized sponsor"" by the Dutch government, it's a company where they have never sponsored anyone from outside before. In the meantime, I did some interviewing and I got an offer from a well-known International company. so it's definitely a great thing to have on my CV, also I know from a colleague that I will grow and sharpen my skills there, especially since I got accepted as mid-level so there is potential growth to seniority, and have a higher salary, the total compensation for now is 65k which will end up around 44k after taxes.

I have been torn for a week not knowing what to decide, especially since getting into big companies is not something easy to do and involves some luck in my opinion. So I'm curious what you guys would choose if you were a foreigner in both countries, meaning I don't have strong ties in any of them and don't speak the languages of those countries, and still need to learn the language when I decide where to stay. any insights or opinions you share would be a great help.",2024-03-16 11:31:35

1b689g2,What is even happening in hiring anymore?!?,"I got 2 online assessments in the last week.

First assessment had me solve statistics tables, using ratios, percentages, under strict time limit. This was for a junior backend developer position. Before that, there was an HR screener call, which I consider normal.

Second assessment is a take-at-home that, for my skill level, would take about 2 hours to deliver. My problem: No initial call. I don't even know who I'm talking to, I don't have the ability to ask questions. I messaged them and they told me I should build the project before I even ask questions. If you're into video games, that message made me to ""frame perfect"" decline.

What is going on? Why can't we agree on some standardized way to hire people? Why do 10-people companies require a take-at-home before the HR screener? And why am I supposed to calculate profit margins of product sales reading graphs for a junior backend position, as if leetcoding and building personal projects wasn't enough?!

1bka4ts,Am I getting lowballed at my company in germany?,"I wanted to get some insights on the market in Germany and if my rate is fair given all conditions.

I am a full stack developer with a focus on backend for a startup company (4 years active) located in germany with their center being in nuremberg and munich.  
I have been working at the company since it's inception remotely from another company in southern europe.  
   
I have worked and coded on everything that was needed depending on scenario given the high workload and small amount of people so I've dabbled in frontend (mobile dev in flutter, web development in vue), backend (spring boot in java and microservices in go), configuring whatever was needed in devops in google cloud and handling stuff in kubernetes, helm, terraform (I am certified as a google cloud architect). I understand this has left me in a position of ""jack of all trades but master of none"" but I try to read much on technical books on my free time and do side projects to continue being a better backend dev specifically.  


Lately there have been a lot of hirings for either the backend or mobile side in which a lot of people have exceeded me in salary (I am aware of the base salary offered since I am part of the interviewing process), and it is discouraging since I am currently at a higher position than all of them in the company and I usually delegate the work. For my 4exp at this company  I am currently the ""technical lead"", while I understand that 4 years is not enough for me to fill that title I am trying best I can to help everyone on technical topics and complex architecture topics and for the moment I have gotten pretty good feedback. As a sidenote I constantly overperform in our sprints with a lot of them being me completing more story points than the whole team  of 7 members combined ( I understand this is also a company issue but I think its kind of relevant to mention).

I am currently paid 55,200 per year with no benefits while most new hirings go to 60-65k and probably more  since I am not aware of the final negotiated value, only the base offering.  


I have had a history of me being lowballed in the company given that I started as a junior on the company with a salary of 19,200 yearly, so with this limited information I would like to ask what would an average value of me asking a raise in the company be, currently I have not had a raise in 1 year and a half.

1bl5u3s,Maybe we just are not good developers?,"Note: I am speaking for myself in this post and those who may feel similarly to me. An article which I came across today inspired me to share some thoughts and gain some insight. 

Article source: [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/06/finding-great-developers-2/](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/06/finding-great-developers-2/)

A **very summarised** and **cherry-picked** **TL;DR of the article:** the article goes in depth of hiring the top talent, how to find them and pick them and that, obviously, top talent developers aren't on the job market ever and don't need to look for work because they are so sought after that everyone comes to them; they are also picked during their college years before they even graduate. 

Often, the top talent devs started programming from a very young age, experimenting with tech in their dad's office whilst other, ""normal kids"", ""played soccer"" or ""chased girls"" or were starting their ""garage bands"".

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I read Reddit daily to stay up to date with the tech news, trends and tools, see what is going on in the software world and to see if there is any hope of the market getting any better in the near future. I see posts daily where people similar to me - and those wildly different - ask you, developers already in the industry and seniors, for advice because their 500th resume was rejected and still not a single interview. 

Some of those people have even went to prestigious education institutions in a Russell Group / Ivy League colleges and graduated Summa cum laude \[i.e. with the highest distinction\] (some graduate in the US and come to the EU, I hear).

This made me stop for a moment and think: if a solid, top talented grad from a top university gets rejected, what hopes does a self-taught has in comparison? That's a rhetorical question, let's be real. 

Now, those below the top developers are great developers, people who send 3-4 CVs in their lifetime because they are also very sought after. Both groups are experts in their fields. Innate talent / knack for this sort of work. They did FizzBuzz when they were 5, wrote AI algorithms before turning 10.

My point is, there are very skilled developers who don't even make it to the two groups above, and there is much more of them, which seems to make sending out CVs and applying to jobs a waste of time for everyone. 

If you're not a true top talent or a great dev, your CV is binned by the ATS. If you're not coming with X amounts of years of experience your CV is binned. 

Filling out your details and singing up to job boards is a waste of time because nothing ever comes from it: just spam, ghost jobs, fake ads that farm your details from the CV and scams for promised work when it really is just free labor extortion - even on LinkedIn.  

It begs the question in my mind, how to stand out to make companies come to you? People have portfolios, projects, very interesting and creative ideas, people are grinding leetcode, and more. Yet they often don't even see the automated rejection email.  

Lastly, maybe we are just not destined to be developers, no matter how much we may want it or how much effort we put it for X amount of years? 

Off-topic, but I am also curious what happens to devs that are below the expectations so to speak? How was your work experience, what tech stack did you work with? What are you doing nowadays?

The job ad is posted in Finnish and the following is by Google Translate:

We expect from you:

* Strong experience in software development and excellent knowledge of modern web development
* In-depth knowledge of frontend and backend technologies
* Understanding of open source projects and software solutions with high usability requirements
* Ability to lead the team towards common goals and solve technical challenges
* Excellent communication and interaction skills and teamwork skills
* **Although most of the work is done in Finnish, we also require knowledge of the English language**
* Experience or interest in the development of public transport and map services is a plus
* You quickly learn new things

To our advantage, we consider:

* Experience with map libraries and technologies such as React and Java
* Previous knowledge of OTP (Open Trip Planner).
* Understanding of cloud services in Azure environments
* Experience with real-time data processing and scalable architecture
* A bachelor's or master's degree in information technology or a similar field

Unfortunately, I don't know any Finnish. Language barrier is a real thing in finding CS jobs. I wonder how people are finding jobs across different countries, where each EU country has a local language.

If anyone has succesfully landed a dream job overseas, would you please tell me how you get over the language barrier, thanks.

1bmu4i3,"I'm stuck as a Sr. SWE at a mediocre company, career advice?","I am Sr. SWE with around 7-8 yoe from ouside eu. I was hired by my current company around 4 years ago and for the first 1/1.5 years I worked on my on my own independent project with another co-worker so I was more or less abstracted from the company as a whole.

After that period I was relocated to Austria, and since that initial project was finished I started getting assigned to other teams. After some time I started seeing all the other projects are crap. Either extremely old, no testing, bs architecture, arbitrary design decisions, etc. I jumped through a couple of projects and it seems like everything is like that. Also as a sidenote, in the last two years the pay became increasingly stagnant so there is absolutely nothing wanting me to keep this job.

Around 6 months from now I started browsing another companies to move on, because until that point my residence was tied to the employer so I wasn't able to switch jobs without doing all the paperwork from scratch.

The thing is, in summary, that I didn't work in any decent project in the last 2 years. So I have almost nothing to show for. All the projects had been ranging from completely mediocre to barely tolerable.

I been going through multiple interviews in the last couple months without been able to land a single offer. I am desperate at this point, just the thought of wasting another year in this company is destroying my Psyche. And I know, with each month it passes in this company I am been buried deeper into becoming unhireable.

So I am completely stuck. In the interviews I am basically ashamed of talking about my experience. I have nothing to show for. I cannot go and tell them ""yeah so basically the project I am working now is a dumpter fire without any architecture thought beforehand with a lot of copy&pasted code, with no tests at all and basically deployed by some guy copying a jar file into a windows server machine when he's asked to""

I also cannot focus on what I do in the projects because in this last 2 years my tasks are basically going into them and try to salvage them from the ground into something usable. Even the success stories are in soo crappy projects that I feel the cringe just explaining what the projects are and their status.

I always try to keep up with the latest technologies, best practices and everything but my efforts are mostly in vain because for example even if I read and practice a lot of TDD, I am absolutely not able to use it in any project so I don't have any real experience with it. The same happens with all the other topics like concurrency, redundancy, HA, database sharding, memory management, etc. I had absolutely no way of gaining any meaningful experience on any of those topics besided what I've read in books or seen on videos.

So I don't know what to do now. I am completely exhausted and mentally drained after multiple months of studying, doing interviews and failing miserably. What should I do?

Lie about my experience and tell I have 3/4 years of experience to try to get into a decent company in a more junior position? Lie about the projects I worked on? Just accept I am unhireable and try to get by as a mediocre swe in a mediocre company?

Any advice or help is welcome. Thanks.",2024-03-24 20:10:10

• Working in the Netherlands right now as a Senior Software Engineer. Current total compensation is 80k base + 5k bonus + some goodies like phone bills and NS business card for public transport. I have 5 weeks vacation and 40h work week. I also have 30% ruling for 3.5 more years, making my yearly net earnings at least 65k.
• I speak fluent German and have an EU citizenship.

Want to relocate to Switzerland for the mountains, but not lose out too much on current standard of life.

Offer that I got as a Senior Consultant in a consulting firm in Bern.

• 100k francs base salary
• about 5k francs a year for food costs when I'm at the client location.
• About 20k yearly bonus, dependent on company earnings but independent of my performance.
• Phone bills covered 
• GA card
• 6 weeks vacation but 42h work week
• Some other goodies

It's a bit off from what I had set as my preferred amount (120k base + 10k bonus), but the market doesn't seem so good right now. Company seems very nice and the salaries are quite transparent (they showed me quite well what could be earned with future promotions).

Is it worth relocating for this, or should I wait a while?

1bho5sv,"Looking for programming/developer positions in Germany, and getting barely any interview invites","Hi long-time lurker here :),

I am struggling to get interview invites from companies that I applied to; therefore, I am in dire need for help from you guys on improving my CV and general advice.

**Background**: I am graduating Masters (in scientific computing or computational \[not CS\] science) in Germany soon, and currently applying for companies in Germany for software development. Since the job market is really bad now and I have work experience in web development, I am going for full-stack or back-end jobs. I am also interested in low-level dev, CUDA or graphics dev, HPC (OpenMP, MPI etc), but don't have full-time work experience in this area. Therefore, I am planning to switch to these more niche/specialized jobs once the job market gets better (1-2 year probably).

**Language**: My German is still elementary (A2/B1), and I am really focused on improving my language proficiency right now. I understand that not being fluent in German heavily limits my options.

**Here is my CV**: [https://imgur.com/78n854J](https://imgur.com/78n854J)

**Additional questions**:

(1) how should I tailor my CV for positions that I apply to?

(2) Is being programming language agnostic a thing in Germany? or do I have to look for positions in a certain stack (.NET/C#, or Spring Boot/Java etc)?

(3) how can I market and sell myself better as a programmer.

1bnq9jo,Self-taught developer with about 2 years of experience. Employer told me they won’t renew my contract which expires in 3 months. Please help me figure out what’s next (NL),"I have a bachelors in business and some (+/- 3 years) working in marketing and sales for tech companies. I hated where my career was going and decided to code again a about 3 years ago and did a bootcamp to get a certification so I could land a job.

My current employer is my first job as a developer. When I first joined I was told I would get a lot of coaching and my lack of experience wouldn’t be a problem as long as I had willingness to learn. They offered me 35k a year with a fixed 1 year contract and hired me as a Junior Front End developer. The idea was for me to work with React and TS to modernize their web application (SaaS) which was written almost entirely in PHP. 

After I started it became clear that the commitment to coaching simply wasn’t there and my team lead was too busy and stressed out to spend anymore than 10 minutes talking with me or answer my messages in Slack. My team had two other people, a senior front end developer who was actually more of a UI/UX person and a Junior with 3 years of experience. The UI/UX guy was also overworked and just didn’t have the time or patience to teach me anything so I ended up stuck with a junior as a coach, he meant well but he himself was still not always sure how things should be done. Also, it turns out all the legacy code was in a single PHP project which is about 10 years old and a total mess which everyone in the company agrees makes it a pain even for the experienced people there to work with. Apparently, there were talks to get rid of this PHP project for years but it simply never got done because reasons. Needless to say I struggled a lot delivering much value since I was always left with unanswered questions trying to figure out how to do things. 

After 6 months they finally realized things were fucked and offered to move me to a back-end team where I could get more coaching. I agreed because I am motivated to learn as much as I can. Up until then they straight up forbade me to work independently in anything involving PHP as they said it would be meaningless to me since they wanted to move away from it.

In the new team I actually got coached by the team lead and started learning how the PHP project worked and more about the back-end. They renewed my contract for another year and said they were happy with my progress. Nevertheless it was challenging since my team only had seniors and I was always slower and often needed help fixing my code or improving. I never had worked with PHP before and it was far removed from the basic JS/React domain I was learning up until then. They also required 100% test coverage which was new to me. Not only that, they are big fans of working test-driven which means we had to let the tests drive our development which is not necessarily bad but it also takes learning to do effectively and slows things down. They also don’t like to simply show you how things are done and explain why, but rather wanted me to figure it out and when complained if I took too long, if I asked too many questions or if I didn’t ask enough questions. Needless to say I soon started to loose motivation and the developer experience wasn’t much fun and I was often stressed.

In the last months 3 senior developers and the CTO quit which put even more stress on the 4 senior developers that remained. They hired a new senior developer but he quit after a month.

Last week they told me they will not offer me a new contract when my current one expires. They said the quality of my work is not what they need as I still require supervision and take too much time.

I was already not enjoying the company, the messy code and lack of guidance. I thought about leaving but was honesty afraid of not getting a new job since I don’t have a CS degree. I also enjoyed the chill culture without enforced deadlines, little hierarchy and some colleagues became friends.

Now, I’m left with 3 months to find something else and I’m not sure how to go about it. I regrettably didn’t code much in my free time since I started working because I simply didn’t have the energy to do so after commuting over 2,5 hours each day to and from Amsterdam.

I gained some experience in the backend and front end but I don’t feel like I master either.

My initial plan is to sharpen/revise the basics and work on a many projects as I can but I’d appreciate any advice on increasing my chances of finding a new job.

1blx9qw,Software Engineer Salary Expectations,"I’ve looked at glassdoor, payscale, techpays.eu etc. but I still have some questions, so here I am.

- CS Degree
- 7 years experience (a lot of Java & DevOps work on enterprise projects, some mobile apps in Flutter, some cloud work with AWS & GCP, a couple of open-source projects - won’t go into it all here, but point is my tech exposure is broad (maybe I’m being naive?) and I back myself to solve most problems & learn new things if I have to.
- Have been working on a project at one of the big banks in The Netherlands for a year and a bit, via a consulting firm. I’ve been working for the consulting firm for 3 and a bit years, originally in another country before I immigrated here with them.

My questions:
- Is €60,000 a fair ask as a base salary in The Netherlands, given the above details?
- My employer claims that their salary increases are “benchmarked against market salaries” - aside from sites like glassdoor, are there any other reliable sources that can be used for these “benchmarks”? If so, links etc. would be appreciated ;-)
- My employer also uses the statement that “base salary is just one component of your total remuneration package, which includes various benefits such as mobility allowance, car lease, pension contributions, work from home allowance, bonus”, as an argument as to why their compensation is fair - is it fair to assume that the “benchmarks” from sites like glassdoor etc. are according to base salary? And that other companies will likely have their own “benefits” on top of the base salary?

I hope I’ve phrased this as well as possible. But if you think there are any questions that I should be asking, but am not, feel free to feel me! :-)

1bdscf1,Torn between Software Engineering and Machine Learning Engineer for someone with ~4yoe,"Hi folks,  


Background:   
I'm a mid-level software engineer at a big tech based in Amsterdam. I did an integrated Masters with Bachelors in CS and MS by Research in Computational Linguistics, and enjoyed most of it. Towards the end of my academic exp, I was deep into latest NLP techniques and published a couple of works in decent conferences. However in industry, I've always been torn at choosing between ML vs SWE. I initially chose SWE because I wanted to upskill there after being deep in a research oriented ML pit, and am grateful for the choices I made. Career progression has been pretty good till now: moved from India to NL into a pretty nice job, got promoted from junior to mid-level last July, have dabbled across various tech stacks and also had stints as an SWE in a Data and Machine Learning team in my previous org.  


I'm at a position where I like SWE and would want to upskill to senior level (slowly but steadily working on that), but am also being offered MLE roles at my current org where work is at intersection of ML and SWE. Now the work at intersection could be very interesting, but I fear what if I turn into jack of many trades and master at none?  
Also, I've had moments in past where I've found ML roles to have too many expectations vs too little incentives:  
* Be a good ML practitioner (with brushing up quite a bit of the math,stats,ML, recent advances)
* Be a good SWE to be able to get these models to production, monitoring etc.
* Pay and levels seems to be at-par with SWE more or less.

At the same time, SWE has a few threats too:
* Hordes of supply for SWE out there (supply >>>> demand in foreseeable future)
* SWE is likely to be partially automated out as a role (looking at scale of employability here)

Am I overthinking and should dive into the ML role like a challenge and potentially fulfilling adventure? Or keep things simple and get to being a better SWE?  


Thoughts/Experiences are really appreciated!

2. Doing the online assessment (HackerRAnk or similar) and being rejected (even with 100% test case passed).

I'm wondering if my Resume is a problem, so I'd like to receive any possible feedback.

1bqkj3z,How did your first onboarding go?,"I've previously discussed how much I dislike my first professional role as a test engineer. One thing I've come to notice that's different from my internship and first role at a small company as a developer is the lack of training or onboarding. The only thing they gave me was a zip of a previous selenium test project, and told me to f*ck around with it basically. Biggest problem is, since I'm the only typescript developer in the entire project, there's not only no mentorship, I'm the one responsible for teaching typescript to my senior manager. Not to bad mouth them, but they didn't know how to npm install and even then, they redeclared globally accessed functions (the expect function from jest) and called me three times to resolve their issues. 
There's 27 people in the project, and I'm basically the sole tester. I think the lack of safety and basically always doubting my design and testing choices is what makes me so sad about it.
On the previous company I was, I had a mentor I could ask and they would sit with me on code reviews and provide valuable knowledge and sources to dive deeper into. I also had to report that there's literally no error handling on the API, every route returns a 200 regardless of what goes on (getting a resource that doesn't exist returns a 200 with an empty response).

I think on your first role, having a good manager and mentor basically makes or breaks it. Thankfully, I think I will find my way out and go somewhere else, a smaller company maybe with a manager / senior that actually writes the language I'll be using",2024-03-29 08:56:37

Some background: I have been working as a Junior for a fairly large Company for the past 2 years now. I started out of Grad School at 52k€ and I was happy with this as a starting pay for my first ""real"" Job. After 1 year at the company, I had shown some growth but if I'm being honest, I definitely wasn't ready for mid-level just yet. I didn't get a promotion, but I also didn't get a raise with the reason ""we hired you with an already high salary for a junior, so it wasn't in the budget"". I was of course frustrated, but I remained professional and kept working on improving and growing as a Junior.

My second year at the company was a rollercoaster, involving a toxic new hire and our team being moved to a new department. This caused nearly everyone in the team to jump ship except for myself and another Senior, meaning I suddenly had to pick up a lot of slack. This pushed me a lot and forced me to learn quickly, but I came out the other side and since then, I have made noticeable impacts around the company, with many of our end-users and stakeholders regularly coming to me with questions and project proposals. I also started being in the on-call rotation, and with just 2 of us, it meant that I got a fairly nice extra bit of pay each month. I had definitely felt that I was making at least Mid-level contributions to the company months leading up to Promotion Season. 

At the 2 year mark, I had finally gotten the promotion I had been working for: Mid-level, exactly what I was expecting. My first raise in 2 years, however, only came out to around 8%. A raise is a raise, except our on-call rotation will soon include a 3rd member, meaning my take-home pay (including on-call) will not change, and might even decrease slightly. I know that a promotion is a cause for celebration, but now I feel frustrated that my promotion only changes my Job Title on Slack and most everything else will stay the same. I would feel bad about leaving the team, since I rather like working with my other Teammate, and he would be alone with a new hire. I also realize that it's not typical to get 2 weeks of on-call pay per month, but honestly the money was more impactful vs the coming decrease in on-call shifts. 

Any advice?",2024-03-18 14:49:28
1bejrse,Ease of changing jobs in Germany vs UK on visa,"I have been reading very conflicting reports on this.

- In Germany there is very little burden on employers to ""sponsor"" your visa. In fact, there is no sponsorship concept as such. But the market is smaller, and a lot of jobs require German. Also they hire a lot based on ""tech stack"" and interviewing process is a bit slow and archaic. Depending on what tech stack you have used previously your choices are quite limited. But this problem continues only for 21 months on the blue card which is when you should get your PR. So it might be more likely to ""survive"" this period and not get kicked out of the country. Then you will have your PR.

- In UK, there is a lot of burden on employers to sponsor you. It costs them a lot of money and admin responsibilities. But the market is huge. English is enough. The companies are more ""advanced"" in tech. So if you have something really impressive to bring to the table, they will not account for things previous tech stack too seriously. The hiring process is also more fast. It takes 5 years to get ILR. If you get laid off/fired within that period, you get 2 months to find a new job.

The company has an enormous tech debt and I've become very good at keeping everything afloat but to my dismay I'm yet to write a single line of code. 


I've become a critical member of the team and therefore climbed in salary very quickly. Everyone in my team often states that they would be screwed if I ever decided to leave.

My boss still tells me that I'll be developing ""soon"" but I'm slowly realizing that with our tech debt it will probably never happen. I have a kubernetes project coming up that im leading which is pretty much the only thing I'm excited about.

I'm very passionate about becoming a better developer and I love programming. But since starting this job I feel like I've only worsened and the only time spent developing is outside of work. 

I've been interviewing for various positions as a software developer but that would probably mean a lower salary. 

My options are:

1. Prioritize my learning, take a lower salary and leave.
2. Keep a high salary and stay. 



Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.",2024-03-21 11:32:04

I'm a first year MSc student in a top 20 university (according to QS Ranking). I'm looking for an internship.

I have good grades, work experience (1y+ doing NLP in a big company - 100k+ employees), I'm currently working in a lab at my uni, I have a paper where I'm second author in a top conference, and a lot of projects relevant in the field.  
I managed to get interviews this year at IBM Research, Amazon for SDE, Uber and AXA (all of them without referral, and that's for now at least).  
However, even with the referral link from a Googler, I can't even manage to land an interview for the Google Student Researcher or other position. Same for Meta and Apple.

Any idea of what I could do better?

1bdz9pb,Is it still viable to expect to break into the field nowadays? (Germany),"Before this gets accused of being low-effort, let me explain.

I've been doing a lot of research lately, because long story short, I am from the US, working a fairly dead-end job in Germany. I'm trying to get something with (a lot) more mobility and value, and that led me to coding; along with the fact that I've always loved messing with electronics and computers, and just general technical problem solving.

Software dev seems like the perfect fit for me, from everything I've seen; the relative freedom, the fact that it's project based and can be remote, the problem-solving and the fact that it's mentally challenging, and the fact that it is relatively low customer-service (as compared to being a server or bartender, I mean).

I've done plenty of research online for resources to learn, and found TONS of free ones; I feel confident that I could follow free or cheap resources into a pretty high level. Which is good, since university would be VERY difficult to fund at this stage in my life, especially since I would have to quit or limit my job. It is much easier to study on my own time.

The only problem is... I've done a lot of googling about this, and found VERY split answers; is it viable to expect to be able to actually land any jobs in a year or so, especially with the rise of AI? I know everyone recommends to make projects that set you apart (i.e. not just tutorial projects, and try to add to open-source projects to build a portfolio), but I just worry if there are (or will be) any openings for these jobs, or if AI will replace them. As an addendum, I'm wondering if I should try to focus a bit more on something like security, or maybe AI science, to try and counteract this.

Or, is it all just overblown, and will I have minimal trouble finding a job? I'm not afraid of putting in the effort, and I already feel like I have a bit of a knack for it; I'm willing to gruel away at it and build some worthwhile projects though, and I have high standards for myself and a lot of motivation. I just don't want to learn these skills and then find out the market is completely oversaturated.

Also; is it true that jobs care much more about your portfolio than if you have a degree or not?

Thank you for any answers, and like the title implies, I am asking mainly about the German job market (because this is where I have a visa right now), but I feel this applies to the entire EU.",2024-03-13 18:45:27

1b6ha0n,What feels more right on CV? - 'working student' or 'research assistant',"A little naive question, but it bothers me a little - 

I will be applying to graduate programs, PhD positions (main focus) and also few ML related positions in industry in coming months as I will be graduating this Sept/Oct. 

By then I will have 1.5 years of experience working part-time (20h per week) for a research institute in germany (well reputed). I am employeed as a 'research assistant' (as per contract) but under category of a working student (popular in Germany). So I suppose I can use both while filling out my CV. 

Any suggestion on what should I use. It does matter in my opinion, as research assistant is also a full-time position designated to PhD students. And also I don't want recruiter to consider that I was just into pure research work (only documentation, literature review, etc).

1bk2nrz,Is a career change/masters degree worth it after 14 years of experience working on the same platform?,"I hold a 4-year Bachelor of Computer Engineering degree from India. I live in Germany since the last 10 years have been working in the automotive industry for the past 7 years and work on a niche tool as a software architect. In all I have a total experience of 14 years in the industry.  
The niche tool is now going to move to the cloud and I am transitioning into other roles internally. However, I am not satisfied since the last few years and feel stagnated and stuck. In the meantime, I also suffered from anxiety and depression for which I got therapy and healed, but the scars still remain.  
I feel I have lost some time to grow in my career. I was a driven and ambitious person who lost all drive since I moved to my current employer around 7 years back and have been stuck in the same job.  
I also have a credit coming on my name soon and had a baby a few months back so I want to also cover my bases and not take unnecessary risks.  
Questions:  
1. Pursuing a master's degree seems like an option to me but I am lost as to where the market demand is where I would enjoy working (I know AI and ML, but I am not sure I would like to be in those fields). Preferrably, I would like to do distance learning (correspondence courses so I don't have to attend classes).  
2. Is a master's degree that a good option or would that be a waste of time and would I be better off doing certifications? If yes, which?

1b86e5d,"Cons of getting into contracting, besides the obvious?","I'm a permie software dev in the Netherlands. I've been thinking about some changes in my career and one of the things I'm considering is going down the contracting route: significantly higher pay, ability to do remote jobs from other countries, being generally more free, all appeal to me.

The general con of lower stability and security is something I am ok with at this point. I'm wondering about some other cons that going down this route might have:

1. **Work life balance**   
Has your WLB remained similar or atleast not gotten much worse moving into contracting? Also, now that we have some high-paying regular jobs like FAANG's, finance and HFT available in the EU, how does the WLB compare?
2. **Quality of work**  
Majority of the contracting positions at least here in W. Europe seem to be at banks, government institutions and places which aren't exactly synonymous for having the latest tech and standards. Where SWE is a cost-center and not a revenue-center. Will your learning and experience suffer, and would it be a hindrance in your resume if you want to join full-time later at a tech-focused company?   
I might be wrong in this of course. I see very few positions advertised as contract in startups or tech companies locally. Also, my understanding is that bigger tech companies prefer to get their contracts through contracting/outsourcing agencies instead of individual contractors. I do see some remote positions from startups in the US though.
3. **Possible salary ceiling?**  
The starting rates for devs are definitely high. But unless you land into a specific niche skill that's scarce and you're a regular Java/Python/C++ engineer, will you be hitting ceilings in the hourly rates that you can charge?
4. **Career progression**  
If you go down the contracting developer route, it seems like a completely IC position. In future, if you want to get into say tech lead or engineering manager type positions, and scale the career ladder that way, how could you see the transition happening?",2024-03-06 17:58:59

1bsbqkd,Feeling a bit stuck as a 8YOE Data Engineer,"I feel like I have accumulated a fair bit of experience now, starting with data analysis for a year then switching to proper DE in Java, then Scala (for Spark/Hadoop). And now I have been working in Cloud-based data pipelines and data warehousing for the past 2 years. Now as a senior I'm thinking about going into either higher-level engineering, or into management.

But the strange thing is, I'm currently in a team where everyone has the same level of experience, if not more. And this makes any career progression very difficult: there is no good way to stand out or lead initiatives, because any idea (no matter how good) needs to be challenged or vetted by everyone, which then becomes a team result (unless going rogue and backstabbing the team, which I find despicable).

I could go on and on about how this setup is not great, about what management does wrong, but I cannot change everything as an individual, and I've just accumulated frustration as a result.

Now I'm asking myself ""Should I just leave?"" because obviously that is what has led most of my career progression, but at the same time, I may just be complaining because it's not progressing as fast aas I'm used to and it is up to me to make it happen.

  

Pros:

- I like the company. Its mission is well aligned with my values

- I have equity that is already appreciating in value (and will get more by staying)

- Despite questionable management in our BU, we have a new director that is already kicking the anthill and things could go the right way (or not)

- Other engineers are smart and the work it is very stimulating

- Great parental leave/benefits (I have a new born baby)

  
  

Cons:

- No career development path (no objectives, no feedback)

- Management inexperienced in Software, leads by project and not by product

- We are overworked and under-funded (we got promised headcount, but still no recruitment on the horizon)

- Salary is a low compared to what I can get: I have \~70k€ and got a job offer for 80k€ (but had to decline because of incompatibility with new parental situation)

reason for such a long gap and no job since october: I went to Japan for a few months to try move there and while I had some success, getting 1 very poorly paying job offer that I ultimately turned down as I decided to go back home, wait and see if the housing situation fixes itself within the next few years before deciding to go Japan again as I ultimately want to stay near family and close friends and not restart my life again.

Anyways now back in EU. Ive been applying to probably every frontend/fullstack position that I see (probably at like 250+ atm in the last 2 months) and theyve led to maybe 1 or 2 intro calls but its always the same just a big pile of either ghosting or the typical ""while your experience is great blah blah"" rejection. I cant even doubt my technical skills as I dont even get a chance to showcase my capabilities.

The cv is the one everyone says to use. I dont think my bullet points are the worst, maybe not the latest and greatest but certainly not bad right? I can only stretch the truth so hard... 

Is it really my wording? is my tech stack that bad? or does it seem too ""accomplished"" and I should dumb down the bullet points? I dont know what to focus on. Im in the process of making a personal site that at least showcases some design skills and projects and have started to get into C# with game engines again just because Im feeling very down in my abilities rn.

Ive talked to so many people now but none of it gets results, even my old boss who moved to Australia and said he didnt see any issue but he also knew my abilities so there was bias in his feedback.

I told my manager I am not super happy with this, that I never wanted to be purely front end and nothing else, but of course he prioritises what's important for the business (can't blame him for this, I know). 

Can more experienced devs gives me advice how can I play my cards in a way that doesn't pigeon-hole me in a 'front end dev' box that I won't be able to get out of? Also the technology we use is very niche and unpopular, so an even bigger reason I want to keep improving in the backend part - I don't want my skillset to be limited to this niche technology almost no one uses ... 

Do I stay patient and trust when the pressure is less I will be given back end work? 

How do I keep my back end knowledge in check apart from youtube videos and blogs?

Any advice will be greatly appreciated, thank you!",2024-03-16 12:27:19

1bp4avm,SAP MLOps Engineer Intern thinking about his next step,"Hello everyone,  
I'm excited to share that I'll soon be embarking on my internship journey with SAP France as a MLOps Engineer Intern. Currently pursuing my French Master 2 in Machine Learning, with graduation slated for September, I bring prior experience from a 6-month internship at a startup as a Data Engineer, where I worked extensively with Azure Stack (Databricks and Data Factory). And also a 3-month internship as a Data scientist.

I'm open to relocating to other countries such as the Netherlands or the UK but as a Non-EU National who will need a Visa Sponsorship I find it too difficult to be recruited as a new grad, So I understand my best shot is just to target the french market to change my visa status from student to employee which is an easier procedure comparing to other mentioned EU countries ig.

  
Do you suggest aiming at graduation programs or just normal entry-level jobs?

  
I have asked the interviewer about the possibility of being hired after my internship, He said there is a small chance. If they do make an offer, do you think it will be a good start?

  
Do you know companies willing to offer 50k or more for a recent graduate or should I adjust my expectations? I'm more comfortable in English environments but I can conduct business in French too.

  
I am ready to put in the hard work in the next 6 months to improve my resume, but I'm confused, should I focus on certifications or work on some parallel projects? I recently learned about LeetCode is it worth it to improve my resume as a DE?

1bofe4m,How to deal with having all my proposals shrugged off?,"Hi everyone, I'll preface by saying I'm a junior(< 1y exp) that's self-taught learning since 2020, so I might have some weird assumptions due to my inexperience—I'm looking to know if this situation is normal and I'm way over my head.

I'll start by describing the company codebase in few words: no tests, files with thousands of lines, culture of copy pasting everything, abbreviated/cryptic variable names, and all business logic in stored procedures.

The technical debt present in the application results in something like 80-90% of the time wasted and I found many possible improvements that'd cut that time significantly. 

Thus, over the past months I've have been mentioning to my senior/lead/manager(same person) possible ways of bettering things, ranging from developments that would reduce the codebase's size tenfolds to actual security issues that needs to be fixed(e.g: auth is done hashing a password with no salt).

Every time I make one of these proposals, there's a small discussion between me and him, which usually ends with him saying ""yeah, you're right, but we won't do this cause it's unimportant/style issue/there's no time"". I'd like to highlight I'd absolutely not mind being told I'm wrong due to x; my issue is that I'm told I'm right but we won't do it anyway cause (no) reasons.

After having this repeat something like a hundred times and being forced to work with horrible code with no chance of improving it, I'm starting to be very demoralized by this, as it feels like I've been just hired as a code monkey(no think, just do) when I believe I could have a much bigger impact if given the chance.

- Custom ERP system - moving old API stuff from delphi to c#, lots of overtime and a shoddy frontend, got fired over bad language skills and poor communication (my bad, I speedran a german language certificate when I came to  the country)
 - Microsoft Dynamics Dev - corporate job, bending and twisting Dynamics to make it work with the rest of company services - quit because I couldnt stand how much I have to work against Dynamics instead of with it (I thought learning Dynamics was useful, pay wasn't bad)
- DevOps/IT Helpdesk - another corporate job, I was not allowed to do any development myself except for making pipelines, which is not how it was advertised. I got frustrated and started phoning it in, getting laid off in a month, plus i got cited for language problems again.

1bi1nme,"Need advice: laid off, have an option to accept lower salary offer or continue interviewing? ","Hey all, 

My employer (a startup from Munich) had to lay off 70% of workforce due to operational/funding reasons in January. Being in Germany with notice period of 3 months, I'm atm on garden leave until end of April. My role was senior software engineer with TC 115K.

I started interviewing last month and i must say that the market outlook is not the best for software engineers atm. In general it seems the salaries have gone lower.

I have finally received an offer but the offer is lower than my current compensation. (90k offer vs 115k current TC). My current position is senior software engineer and the offer is for tech lead role which is 50% hands on and 50% people management. So on paper, the role itself is good from career perspective. 

But I'm sure that the offer is lower on purpose due to them knowing that I got laid off and looking for a new job. 

Now i have 2 options. 

1) accept this offer. While it's lower than my current TC, it's better than unemployment. There's also a 6 month probation in which either party can terminate contract on 2 week notice.

2) decline this offer and continue looking for a better option with more compensation and benefits. I still have some time until end of April. I have some good active applications/interviews but none in advanced or final stages atm.

I'm inclined to accept the offer considering that's the only offer i have atm. However, some close friends also advise me against joining this company if I'm still gonna be looking for a better offer. They're concerned about me leaving company after a short time and say it's a shitty move (i dont disagree with that but i don't think I'll be happy with a 20% pay cut). 

Just wondering if someone else had to go through the similar situation and got any insights to share. Thank you.

I personally like the UK far more than Sweden, however despite the bigger market for Software Engineers and better salaries, the requirement for visa sponsorship makes it harder to get a job in UK for international students.

I'm a kiwi (currently living in NZ), 8 years exp in .NET, PostgreSQL, AWS, little bits of Ruby/Javascript.


I've been applying for roles for Amsterdam and for most of them I'm getting instant denies with no reason - even though my skills are a great match for the role. I have had some interviews and progressed with some companies, but ultimately did not land a role.

I understand the market is in a bit of a slump, and I suspect seeking relocation makes me a less desirable candidate compared to the many other applications they'd be receiving.
  
My questions are as follows:  

1. Does my experience in looking for roles in Amsterdam line up with yours?  

2. I'm considering looking for roles in London. Kiwi's can get a Visa easy, and don't require work sponsorship which means I could move first then look for roles if required. I've heard from some people that the job market in London is good (or atleast better than Amsterdam). In your experience, is that true?  

3. There are many companies that offer fully remote work from anywhere in Europe. Is there a Visa that would enable me to work for these kind of companies? It seems I would need to be legally entitled to work anywhere in Europe, but I don't believe there's a Visa for foreigners that enable that?

1bb8ypw,Career crossroads: choosing between 3 options,"Hi,

I'm a Software Engineer with 6 years of professional experience living in the EU. I have my BSc and I am working on my MSc via online education. I also have some certifications and side projects on all kinds of things. Most of what I've done professionally is infra, internal tools and test automation, but I've been trying to get into product development for a while now.I've been working for a big company full of super smart engineers and interesting projects for the last 2 years, and it was great until last year. I was assigned to be the only engineer working full time in the Release team of a mid-sized project. So I've been working mostly alone, with not very interesting technologies compared to the rest of the project (containers, jenkins and gitlab pipelines and some scripting in bash and python). I also work 100% remotely, which was initially a good thing, but since right now I have no team I'm living the groundhog day over and over working alone on the same boring stuff everyday for a long time, and feeling I'm falling a bit behind as a SWE. I was told I would probably promote to senior this year if I did a good job on this team though.

A month ago or so I got contacted by a recruiter for a Senior Backend position in a small startup. Although I haven't done any backend work professionally, I went through the interview process, did well and seemed like I was a good fit, and got an offer that is higher than my current salary. This company is quite small (less than 200 people) , full of young people, and the work is hybrid (3 days in the office with some flexibility). I also would have far fewer benefits and perks than what I have right now. On the other hand, I would do real product development work in a modern cloud web application in the health tech domain. All their backend is currently written in PHP (Laravel), but they are allegedly planning to migrate to Go, Rust, or a similar language (but who knows?). I would also learn DDD, CQRS, hexagonal architecture, and other architectural patterns which is a big plus for me since I really enjoy domain modelling. My feeling is that the company is pretty chill. They told me they don't do overtime, and everyone I met during the interview process seemed super nice and helpful. I'm a bit scared to take this offer for several reasons: changing from mid-level to senior, changing from doing infra to backend, going from remote back to the office, going from a big company to a small startup... And since I come from a big company they also have big expectations for me (I think), and although I am pretty hard-working and focused and think I will deliver, it's still a lot of pressure. Also, my wife recently stopped working, so we have a lot of expenses and just one income, and although we are doing well, stability is really important for me since I don't want to ruin what she's doing now.

In parallel, I also applied internally for a QA position in one of the cutting edge AI teams of my company. They mostly do cloud AI infra, so it's not like they're building LLMs or anything like that, but super interesting stuff still. I'm not sure which technologies I would use, since each team uses a different thing for their automated testing: some teams use Go, others Robot framework, others Cypress... I told them about the offer I got from the startup and they matched it, so the salary would also be better than what I have now. I can see a path forward where I get really involved in the project, do a good job, and attempt to switch from QA to Dev in 1-2 years, and end up doing development in a really cool AI project. The projects are mostly open-source so I would be free to start contributing to them whenever I like. However I'm scared I get locked into the QA silo for life. QA is pretty technical in my company though, basically 0 manual testing and everyone is really skilled and technical, but I still would prefer to do development.

Finally, my current manager was sad to hear that I was probably going to accept one of these offers, and offered to move me to a development team (AFAIK without salary increase). This team is full of highly skilled, very senior people, and they work on open-source projects most of the time, mostly using Go. But at the same time, the engineers working there are really busy and I know they won't ""hold my hand"" or mentor me in barely any way. Also, the domain is not very interesting for me, and certainly not as cutting edge as the AI project, so I would be there mostly for the tech they use and the nice work experience.I have to make the final call in a couple of days. For now, I'm mostly leaning towards taking the QA position in the AI team and ride the AI wave for a bit, working hard and trying to make the change from QA to development in 1 or 2 years, after I finish my MSc. But, as I said, I'm scared I get stuck in QA for the rest of my life (not necessarily a bad thing, I just enjoy writing software more than testing it). This position involves a nice salary bump, keeping all the perks I already have, and less risk than moving to a startup.

What would you do in my shoes? Is your reasoning the same as mine or do you think the 2 other options would be better?

EDIT:  
TL;DR: I don't like my current job and I have 3 offers on the table, and I need to make a decision in the coming days (tomorrow or the day after tomorrow). What's the best long-term option: to take a QA role in the field of AI and try to pivot to a development role over time, to take a backend role in a startup, or to take a better role in the same project I'm working right now (not a very exciting domain for me)?",2024-03-10 12:13:16

1b92uov,Am I in burnout and underpaid? How do I get out of this burnout?,"I have graduated 4 years ago and I have been working since then for a small branch in a quite big corporation (not FAANG). I am the only developer in this branch that is doing anything webdev and APIs development and there is one more person that does embedded development and that's it. 
In the past 4 years I've been working on a webapp using React, mobileapp using react native, a backend using expressjs and it is used by the webapp and mobile app, a desktop app that doesn't have the same functionalities as the other ones, basically is a different tool, and some small internal apps for the in-house production lines or similar. 

I've been working on this just myself, there was no one to help me or to learn from, I had to take care of the design, UX, testing, servers, databases, email system, azure cloud, security, publishing the app on google play and app store, making sure everything is compliant, pretty much everything to get a system from 0 to production. 

Unfortunately I had to rewrite or redesign the webapp, mobile app and backend a few times because the manager suddenly got some new ideas that are not compatible with the systems I have made, also a reason why it took me so long to make them, and honestly it can be a bit annoying to keep rewrite the code so many times because I am not being told from beginning what else they will want to add in the future.

Now, I spent the last few months on implementing a new ""feature"" in the mobile app that requires me to rethink 30-40% of the systems I have made until now because implementing this ""feature"" is creating many new problems, and I've just been told that they also want to add in the future many more things and I belive I will have to rewrite a lot of the code again. 
Now regarding this, for a few months I feel like I cannot concentrate for more than 30min- 1hour, I feel that everything I am doing is wrong and that what I am doing it might not even work how it is suppose to because I am focusing more on delivering the features than testing, and there is no one to help me constantly test any functionalities or if the app is working properly, only once a while someone tells me that the app crashed or that this is not good and it has to be like this and that. 
My last 1-2 weeks has been horror, I need to redesign a piece of code, not a big one, not too complicated, but I cannot think, I just stare blank at it, I cannot concentrate at all, or think at it, I know I have a short deadline but I cannot get myself to do it and finish it, i feel overwhelmed. And today I am being told that next week. I need to implement a feature as soon as possible on the desktop app that I just finished a few months ago. 

I am exhausted from changing my code again and again and again.

I don't have a project planning, I don't have a product backlog, kanban board or anything, I am just being told that ""we want this by this time"" so I get to work, and going back and forward between backend, frontend, mobileapp, desktop and so on, it feels like is draining me and it takes me a lot of time to finish something properly.

When I look back at me code it feels like only me and god will be able to understand it, I highly belive that this code looks like trash, is poorly optimized and probably doesn't respect many programming rules. 

Some friends told me that I am doing the work of a team of atleast 6 people and probably I am not even paid enough for it. 

I don't know what I can do to get out of this state, burnout or whatever it is, I cannot concentrate not even 1 second, I feel like I fly in an empty space. 

Does anyone has any tips of what I should do? And how to get out of this state?

after completing my CS masters degree after taking almost twice the average duration (although with very good grades), I started my first full-time role approximately six months ago at a company specializing in business application development within a niche sector (imagine tax calculation software tailored for the shipping industry). The company employs a predominantly home-grown and antiquated technology stack, with many C++ components being over two decades old, communicating via custom TCP protocols. Nearly every aspect, from logging to the HTTP server, has been internally implemented by the company. Working with this old code is a headache, because it's been patched up over 20 years with too little investment to reduce technical debt. 

I'm worried that sticking with this job might not be good for my career because I'm mostly learning about stuff that only this company uses, and I don't want to continue working with C++ in general.

1bgytol,"Freelancing in Europe (Italy in particular), how is it really done? Is this normal?","So, I'm in a situation that doesn't fully convince me but two separate people from two companies told me it's normal, so now I have to ask here of course.

I live in Italy and I'm trying freelancing for ""consultancies"" aka body rentals. 

The thing that is weirding me out is this:

basically as a freelancer you are given a series of tasks during a project and you're paid hourly to do that task. Which becomes weird at a certain point because I feel it creates an atmosphere of competition to get ""more tasks"" against other freelancers. Also there is no incentive to try different things out to see what works best because you then have to charge and justify the hours. 

It also makes the whole ""the slowest freelancer got more money than the fastest freelancer"" much more visible than a daily rate would.

Is this how it's done everywhere? Because it kinda sucks.

When I heard about hourly rate I thought it was there for occasional interventions and I thought a day rate was there so that a company could buy a set amount of days and make sure the freelancers had enough time to work TOGETHER on the project, but instead a day rate is just the sums of 8 hours even if done in different days!

ps. I've flagged the post as ""experienced"" because I've been a software dev for 10+ years at least, it's just the first time I'm working in these environments",2024-03-17 14:27:43

1bc0pax,Advice needed: Feeling trapped – How should I continue?,"tl;dr I quit my job to do freelancing to stay in Spain. The market is bad and I don't know how to continue my career. Looking for any advice to get a broader perspective.

I'm a 30M German, have a Master's degree in CS from a German university and have been working for the past 4 years as a Software Engineer with an enterprise company in the automotive sector for around 60k which afforded me a good lifestyle in East Germany.

Since COVID the company was 100% remote so I decided last year to go to Valencia, Spain for three months initially because I felt the need for a change and wanted to step out of my comfort zone again. Then I enjoyed it so much that I decided to move here for good in September last year. The weather is obviously great, I've a good group of friends here, I enjoy learning a new language, I'm dating a girl that I really enjoy spending time with and so on. It has always been a big wish of mine to live abroad and I'm finally doing it. So far so good.

Another big goal of mine is to have my own (small) business at some point and I always try to build something on the side in the hopes that one of these experiments gets some traction and provides value to people. Because of that and also because I didn't feel that I was growing anymore in my current company, I decided to quit it to go into freelancing.

Unfortunately, as you probably know, the market is really bad atm and I barely get any response from any potential clients I reach out to but I already got two amazing offers from big companies in the German market with compensation packages that I never thought would have been attainable to me. However, both wanted me to come back to their office in Germany which was the reason I declined them. 

This is my first month without a job and I'm currently sitting on a runway of about 6 months, so my main goal at the moment is to figure out my next career move. I'm using my time to reach out to potential freelancing clients every day and keep myself interview-ready by revisiting DS&A and system design topics. I also continue building my current side project. 

Experiencing this market, however, I feel more and more that it might not work out since most clients want somebody with more years of experience and I might be forced to also send out some applications for full-time positions. Looking into the Spanish market makes me afraid that I won't be getting some decent money (minimum 40k) and a position that I'd like to work in.

Now I'm reconsidering all my options. I'm thinking about sending applications everywhere in Europe just to check what opportunities I'm having and then take a decision, even though I'd like to stay in Valencia. I value a healthy and balanced lifestyle but I can definitely work hard and would also love to contribute to something meaningful. There are also definitely companies that I'd like to work for, e.g. Stripe, Spotify, Apple, to name a few...

What would you do if you were in my situation? Would you continue trying to score a freelancing gig? If you were to send out applications, would you focus on the Spanish market first and only look abroad if nothing is appealing? I'm aware that finally only I can decide at the end but I'd be very happy to get some input from you to get a broader perspective.",2024-03-11 11:11:36

They had flown me over for the final interview, started the process with migri, etc. I sold my car, most of my belongings, let go of my way under market rental house, etc. I moved overseas ahead of the start date (to Sweden where I had a WHV) to do the embassy stuff and things were progressing quickly. A few weeks before I was due to start in Finland, the offer was rescinded due to restructuring. Bummer. 

Long story short, years later, I'm in Canada again interviewing for European companies. The job I have now, I kept interviewing literally up until the day I started in my current role just to make sure. I am currently interviewing with four companies (3 DE, 1 NO) with varying process lengths (and applying to more weekly). Provided I get an offer for one, should I immediately stop the process with the others or continue just in case? Both countries require me to apply at the Embassy on the other side of the country, so that would give me a bit of time to finish whichever further interviews I may have.

I have 4 years of experience as a software engineer. 2 years ago I started my CS college degree. I learn at university that let's me attend online lectures, turn in homework via internet and only sometimes attend in person on weekends (for exams and such).

I am afraid that the fact that I am attending college may scare recruiters off. My way of thinking is that at first everyone thinks that it's nice and cool. But the second thought is that, let's better not hire him until he graduate because he won't be giving 100% at work because of school or something.

Because of this fear I explained briefly on my CV (where I did put that I am attending college) that I am learning mostly via internet and attend school only sometimes on weekends.

I did 6 months of analytics, mainly using Tableau, then a year of software engineering where I joined a team who 95% use a low code no code solution. I've managed to avoid using that and have almost exclusively used Python.

My main issue is I am the only one using python, so my code reviews consisted of talking the lead through my code, there was never any feedback given. Because of this I feel I don't actually know very much about best practices or what code would look like elsewhere as I've essentially been given free reign without guidance.

I'm now coming to the end of my grad scheme and they've told me they intend on keeping me on assuming they can get headcount and funding etc. However I'm going to start applying because I don't feel I'm learning as much as I could.

1b77g26,Solution Architect vs Software Engineer,"Hi everyone, I recently graduated (Master in Computer Engineering) and have been looking for a job in Software Engineering for a while.   
  
One of my main goals was to find a position outside of my native country (EU) and I was mainly targeting Germany, Netherlands, France, UK and Ireland. I think that my search has been harder since I was looking for an English speaking job, but I managed to get some interviews/online assessments, even though I don’t have any previous technical internships to fill my CV.  
  
At some point I was in the last stages with a small Germany company (\~200 people), but to avoid putting all my eggs in one basket, I have meanwhile started interviewing consulting firms in my region. I got quite easily a couple of offers.  
  
I was also contacted by a recruiter for a position as a technical consultant in a product company in the area of data processing. After a bunch of interviews I got an offer from this company for a salary which is much higher than the average of what new grads are taking here (or at least much higher than the other two offers that I received).   
  
My main concern is that this role is not what I was looking for. It’s a customer facing role that involves making prospects to potential customers and then helping them to integrate the solution proposed into their system, customizing the company products for the customer needs. So the role is like a Product Solution Architect / External Consultant, that will require me to make several trips to meet with customers.   
  
I’m afraid that I will not get transferable hard skills and so switching from this type of role to a pure SWE role will not be straightforward and that I wil have to “sell” my skills to make the switch.   
  
What do you think about this? Am I making a big deal out of nothing?",2024-03-05 15:08:44

1b68i7g,No guidance in an internship project,"Hello everyone,  
  
On February 14th, I graduated in Computer Science, and the very next day, I started an internship at a company working in the field of Data Science/AI. They assigned me a project for which I have complete responsibility, from choosing the technology stack to full development, without being supported or guided by a senior figure or anyone else. The project involves developing an interactive tool that automates the creation and management of a database from a set of related Excel sheets.  
  
Today marks the beginning of the three weeks dedicated to developing the tool, and I feel quite disoriented. I'm not sure if I'll be able to complete it since it's quite a large project, and my current knowledge doesn't allow me to develop it entirely on my own. I don't know how to proceed as I've never created something from scratch, and I believe having an experienced individual by my side would be very helpful, especially since many problems are arising regarding the choice of technologies I've selected and I have two weekly recurring meetings to update my boss about the situation (first is tomorrow lol).

1b66h15,Should I go for this PhD?,"Months ago I applied for a PhD position in AI/ML in one of the most important companies in this field. The PhD role was a perfect fit for me because of some research experience I acquired during my MSc. Then I totally forgot about this application and I continued with my life. I'll graduate in one month and I'm looking for a SDE graduate in a FAANG.   
Lately I've been contacted to set up an interview for the PhD position. And right now I honestly don't know what to do. The company is really an important one and this opportunity might completely change my life. I'm really interested in the PhD topic as well. However I'm not sure I'll like the PhD/research life. From the research experience I had during my MSc, being a PhD/researcher in the university means dedicating all your life to the scientific progress. Your work life and personal life completely coincide. And this is something I would like to avoid at all. At the same time, I don't know if doing a company PhD in one of the most important companies nowadays would give me a better work/life balance with respect to a university PhD. Finally I'm also a bit worried money-wise. I live in a country where doing a university PhD means living with your parent because you don't get enough money to live on your own. I don't know if it's different with a company PhD. At the same time, I'm  sure taking a PhD with this company will give me the opportunity at least to interview as a research scientist in FAANG, which means having a stable economic condition for all my life. I know I shouldn't take in consideration a PhD for money, but in this moment of my life it's something I need to take in consideration.  ",2024-03-04 09:05:48
1b5te9a,[UK] Should I take Voluntary Redundancy in Current Market?,"Dear All,

I find myself at a crossroads and am seeking your advice on a challenging financial decision. I am a 25-year-old man working in the technology sector, and after four years with my current employer, I've been offered voluntary redundancy (if they accept me). The package amounts to £42k, which, after tax, I estimate to be around £38k.

One of my primary ambitions is to step onto the property ladder, and I believe this lump sum could significantly speed up the process. Although it necessitates finding another well-paying job to secure a mortgage, the larger deposit would undoubtedly open many doors for me.

I've been contemplating accepting the redundancy package. I've been wanting to find a new role for some time considering my enthusiasm for my role and the projects we're undertaking has been lowered, leading me to believe that exploring new opportunities could be beneficial for my career. Additionally, living with my parents means my current expenses are minimal, allowing me to save the redundancy payout and rely on my emergency fund for any immediate outlays. Another important point to note is that the company provides 2-3 months where you serve your notice period, allowing me to search for other roles within that time (not sure how to negotiate a start date that far in advanced though)

However, my main concern lies with the job market. I've heard that securing a position in tech, particularly one that matches or exceeds my current salary which is 84k, can be challenging. The prospect of accepting a lower salary is something I am keen to avoid.

What do you all think? What would you do in this situation?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated

Thank you",2024-03-03 22:00:24
1b5dn93,Should I go for a master's degree in Germany or accept the offer?,"Hello everyone. 

I am a senior Computer Engineering student from Turkey. I speak English(IELTS 8) and German (currently taking B1). I have been working as a software developer at a local company for \~2 years now. I have 3.2 CGPA and will be graduating in the top 20% of my class. The main reason I am asking this question is I am in dire need for some guidance as I am currently sitting in the middle of two chairs.

My first option is getting a master's in Germany. When I started uni, I always thought of getting a master's degree in Germany and settling down there afterwards. However I needed money, so after my sophomore year, I started working at a part-time job. I am currently earning 1500 euro/month (considering the minimum wage is 400 euros, this is an above-average job in Turkey). The problem is since my degree does not cover some theoretical CS foundational topics, it is hard for me to get accepted to TUM, TU Berlin etc. (I could take those classes as electives, but I did not). That's why I am thinking of applying to tier 2 universities but I doubt I will find a job in Germany after getting my degree if I graduate from them. (I would also appreciate any recommendations that accept students in my positions and are not as strict.)  


My second option is continuing to work in my current job here and also getting my master's in the same uni (top 200 in the world in CS ). My boss recently brought up this topic and told me he would support me and provide the flexibility to attend to classes while getting my master's. I will probably be earning 2500 euros/month net salary after graduation. They want me to lead an R&D project at the job and this will also be related to my master's thesis. I like the company's trust in me and their offer seems very good for a fresh grad.

I would appreciate any suggestion. Thanks in advance

1boyubn,Seeking Guidance: Navigating a Decade of Software Development Without Formal Proof of Employment,"Hello everyone!  
  
**PS:** A heads-up, this might be a lengthy post as I need to detail my predicament comprehensively. Those not keen on reading through can skip to the tl;dr section at the end. I'm a 30-year-old striving to make my mark in the tech industry as a software developer. I'll start by summarizing my career journey, and then delve into my major challenges and aspirations.  
  
**Part 1: Career Summary**  
  
My career kicked off 10 years ago as an amateur freelancer, dabbling in WordPress plugins, PSD-to-HTML conversions, and crafting websites with basic HTML/CSS/JS/PHP. After a year or two of freelancing, a chance encounter with a local businessman led to a job offer at his company, where I was the sole developer. The company was a small venture, securing projects through their social circles. As a junior developer, my growth was through trial and error, without any senior oversight or mentorship. Over time, other developers joined, mostly juniors or specializing in mobile, which didn't much contribute to my professional development.  
The businessman eventually expanded, creating more companies but maintaining the same operational model. I became the go-to technical person, though my knowledge plateaued at what I could gather online and through experimentation. None of the projects reached a scale that required addressing the complexities of modern software engineering or generated significant revenue.  
Later, this businessman moved back to Asia and launched a startup, inviting me to join as the CTO. Without any experience working under a senior developer, I leapt through my career stages. LOL. Accepting the offer for various reasons, including international experience and financial benefits, I found myself in charge of the infrastructure (entirely AWS-based) and a small team, developing a product that, again, did not reach a significant audience, partly due to its B2B nature.  
Fed up with the cycle, I parted ways with the businessman and returned home. After a break, I started job hunting with immense self-doubt but quickly found a decent job, where I continue to work today.  
  
**Part 2: The Biggest Problem**  
  
My major issue is the lack of tangible evidence from my past jobs, as I mostly worked for the same person across different ventures, none of which left behind contracts or formal records. This situation makes it seem as though my resume is fabricated. My current role, although not illustrious (it's in online gambling), is remote and pays $5.5k/month. However, I worry about finding future employment should I need to move on.  
  
**Part 3: Objectives**  
  
Despite seeming insurmountable, my goals include finding a software development role in a genuine company and potentially moving to Europe with a digital nomad or skilled worker visa. However, the lack of verifiable employment history poses a significant challenge.  
Additionally, I've been exploring machine learning as a hobby, completing specializations like deeplearning.ai. Considering a career shift into this field, I wonder about its feasibility and the potential financial step back, especially at my age.  
  
Thank you for making it this far. I'm open to any comments or criticisms regarding my situation.  
  
**TL;DR:** I'm a 30-year-old developer with 10 years of experience, mostly working in various roles, including CTO, for companies owned by the same person, most of which no longer exist. I lack formal proof of this employment history. I'm looking to move to Europe and secure a legitimate software development role. What should I do?

Next fall i'll finish my Comp Sci Bsc in Budapest. Our curriculum is 7 semesters long. Although I'm Hungarian, I don't want to continue my studies here at BME. There are several reasons for that, but I think it's out of the scope of this post. I would be happy to complete my masters degree abroad but as I checked the possibilities I have lost count so I have come to you to ask for help.  
So far I have checked TUM in Munich, DTU in Copenhagen and KTH in Stockholm. So far I have dealt with embedded systems, usin C/C++. Also I research the formal verification of concurrent distributed systems. In the future I would be happy to explore computer vision and unify that knowledge with my embedded experience. I know there are tons of schools I haven't mentioned, if anybody knows some good choices I'm open to any suggestions. However my main concern next to good education is the affordability. Unfortunately my family won't be able to support me financially. In the best scenario I can save up to 7000 euros for this 2 years of my life. I know i'll have to work in some form, and get an income. So my question is the following:  
Could you give me some advice on where could i get the best education and stay alive financially? I'm okay with working but I only speak english and hungarian, in some places this is a huge drawback.  
Thank you for all the help in advance. I know there are tons of things i can find online, mainly I'M interested in the experience you guys had earned in the different countries.

I was recently exchanging emails with a person that represents a company that goes by the name ""Pacific Liteforce Sales"" regarding a Software Engineering position that is fully remote. On paper, the role sounds pretty good, almost too good to be true. The hourly pay and benefits they claim to offer sounds nice, but it doesn't seem legitimate. There was no formal interview process, no formal introduction, just me answering behavioral, workplace related questions they had on some PDF file, which were apparently more than satisfactory to them? They said they'd send a check for office supplies and setup for the training + job, which is apparently a common scam. These companies/individuals apparently send fake checks, claim they sent too much, then ideally trick the victim into sending them the excess amount. 

It's weird because, they claim they'll send me an offer that I'd have to sign, doesn't that legally bind them in some way? Very strange situation.

1bhw15x,Is 25% pay bump worth it if the rest of package is worse?,"I work in the UK. 3 YOE. I’m on £45k + bonus + stocks that can give me something between 48-55k depending on how well company did last year. I have really good benefits, company is chilled about how many hours I work, when I work, but there is potential for lay offs (there has been layoffs already last year). I’m not really crazy about the things I’m working on, but slowly started to get comfortable with codebase.

I’m will probably soon get an offer from rival company, so working in almost the same niche field, probably tasks at work etc. As mentioned - not very hyped about it. Benefits are not as good as my current company, 3 days less annual leave, no stocks, potentially some bonus, but not guaranteed, seems like they are less flexible about working hours. Buuuuut base salary will be £60k which is 25% increase. Both are fully remote UK positions.

Market isn’t great. I’m getting constantly rejected. I have good chances of getting this position because I gained experienced in a niche stack that this company is using. There might be max few candidates that are as ideal for them as me.

I’m torn! 25% is quite significant increase. That’s around £700 per month net more, but if not for the increase I would probably not consider this company! Using an offer as leverage to negotiate pay increase at my current company is not really an option.

1bgxqx0,Quitting my job to do a CS Master's?,"Hello,  
  
As the title suggests, I am thinking of doing a master’s degree and I’m not sure whether to quit my job and go full time for a year or keep working and do it part time.  
  
For reference, I am a 24yo working as a Graduate design engineer (soon due a promotion). I hold a first class bachelor’s in civil engineering, and I’ve been working since I graduated so around 2 years. I still live with my parents (ofc I pay my share as I am working but this has allowed me to accumulate some savings), but I am thinking of moving very soon depending on whether I keep working or not.  
  
Lately I haven’t been feeling fulfilled with the job I am doing (ik this happens alot but i feel like i am young enough to do something about this), and I really do not see myself sticking to this mainly because the opportunities at this company aren’t something I am particularly interested in. I have thought about the idea of looking for a job in a different sector of CE (highways, railways, bridges etc) but before doing that I wanted to give something I am passionate about a go. Since I was young I was always into computers and tech in general, and throughout my teens I did some coding as a hobby. I have also been doing some self-taught work lately and I really enjoy the programming and problem solving aspects that software engineering has. I have given myself until May to really see if the tech industry would be something I genuinely see myself getting into.  
  
Anyways, I have done some research online on the various ways one could break into the tech industry and afaik, the most likely I can do this is by getting a master’s as well as work on my portfolio. The idea of going back into academia and getting a master’s really excites me as I was always interested in learning new skills and knowledge, especially on something that I feel passionate about. My idea, is to start working on my portfolio as soon as possible and start my master’s in computer science sometime in September. After doing some more research, I was faced with 2 main options:  
  
\-	Quit my job and do a master’s full time at a university.  
\-	Keep my job and do a master’s part time while working on my projects.  
  
Quitting my job would mean that for a year or so I won’t have no income which isn’t the end of the world as my parents have kindly allowed me to stay with them therefore my savings can comfortably last me for a long time. However, I understand letting go of a job is not the smartest option, but I believe this will allow me to fully focus on the master’s  and my portfolio and I am sure by the time I complete my degree I will be in a positon to apply for graduate roles, granted I have a solid portfolio.  
  
The second option is to stay at my current job (around 40hours a week) and do a master’s part time for 2 years while also working on my portfolio. The issue with this is first of all, the vast majority of people online say that these online master’s are just a money grab and are really bad due to having minimal support and the curriculum is not taught well. I wanted to apply to the MSc Course at York University, but the reviews are mostly negative which has honestly really put me off. There are some other course from lower ranking universities but I can’t imagine them being better taught that York’s course so I don’t know. Secondly, due to the lack of support I am predicting a minimum of 20 to 30 hours per week of self-study, which coupled with a fulltime job and allowing some time to work on my projects sounds like a nightmare to deal with.   
  
I understand that the market right now is all over the place and this has been my main worry to not let go of my job. Furthermore, I know that SWE is very competitive especially the entry roles hence why I want to go thru the master’s route rather than just simply completing some bootcamp. I would really appreciate if somebody could give me some advice on what option to pick or whether there is a third option that I am not aware of. Thank you for your time 😊.

1bg3z3m,Benefits of learning a new language when looking for junior roles in London,"Hi reddit, I've been looking for entry-level C++ jobs in or near to London for the last couple of months and am not making great progress (only one interview so far). I've been using C++ for hobby projects for a number of years and, besides some use of Python at university, this is the only language I would consider myself 'familiar' with. I have a good degree (STEM, Oxbridge), an active GitHub and what I think is a reasonable CV, so while I am hopeful that I'll get my foot in the door eventually it's starting to get a little demoralising.

My question is this: would it be good use of my time to learn another OOP programming language to increase the number of roles available to me? I'm seeing a lot of C# and Java roles posted in London, and wonder whether learning one of these could be a more pragmatic move than just plugging away with C++ (which, admittedly, I really enjoy using).

1bdslud,2 yoe in research labs only in computer vision. What should be my next steps?,"Hi,
Based in France. I have a masters where I did 2 internships in a good research lab and then started working as research engineer in a public lab for ~2 years. They only offer temporary contracts and there is a limit to how long you can work with these temporary contracts in France (you can try for the few research scientists positions but jts if you have phd/post doc plus good publiching track and experience, so i need to move on).
I didn't go for a phd and don't want to now since I felt I didn't have the right motivation and didn't want to do it for the sake of it. Didn't see myself as a researcher either publishing all my life. Research Engineer is a sweet spot.

From internships/job, I've so far co-authored 4 papers in computer vision conferences (neurips, iccv, cvpr, miccai) in the topics of 3d reconstruction and human modeling. But that's pretty much the achievement which is probably meaningless for jobs in the industry. And thing is, I feel my skill stack being also limited to research workflow might be little interesting to the industry (practical experience with only python vs c++ for example). 

And i feel i should switch to industry (instead of another contract in a research lab) since honestly, even though these papers might seem nothing, they take a lot of effort and work and the whole publishing cycle drains you mentally. And the compensation you get is really low I feel in these public labs (32k brut).

When I look around for jobs, I see mostly poorly defined descriptions but titled data scientist or mainly MLops. Nothing specifically related to what ive done being needed. I have 7 months left on my contract. What should I start learning/doing or what could be an ideal focus for job search with such profile? Id like to stay in France and even in the same city near lyon since im a foreigner and i feel more settled due to having made friends and understanding the language. Your insights would be helpful.

Those companies did not care about the formal job title on the contract. So everyone employed had like ""Java Developer"" in their contract. However, the actual role within the company differed. Someone was a medior, some senior, some were leads. Some were FE, some were BE and so on.

In my case, let's say that I am a ""Java Developer"". However, beside Java my actual role is more of a Staff Engineer / Technical Lead. Beside coding I am also responsible for leading software architecture. I am involved in system design, supporting BE & FE engineering and DevOps. So based on the previous should I specify on the CV that I am a ""Java Developer"" or should I put ""Technical Lead"", etc..?",2024-03-12 20:57:38
1bd72dh,Is B2B contract good idea for Junior?,"Hi all,

I am full-stack .Net-React developer 1 year experience. My hope to get a job where I am living (Northern European country) is so low. I am thinking of applying for Junior roles in other European countries, however, my biggest issue is not having a work permit there.  
So I am thinking of creating a company name and offering B2B contract to employers, who need junior .net developer. From my simple mind, I think the benefits for employers over hiring someone permanently are:  
- Flexible contract, they can increase/decrease working time or even end the contract whenever suits them

- Lower risks compared to hiring a perminent employee. Don't have to care about sick leave, holiday etc

- Everything works legally

Before I work on this plan, I would like to ask your opinions, how feasible is this idea, and what challenges I may face? Thanks in advance!",2024-03-12 20:05:54

**- Are you available to work from the office at least 3 days a week?**

I want to apply to a **Stockholm** or **London** internship. If I get accepted for the internship I will obviously travel to Stockholm or London for it and stay there for at least 10 weeks. But as of now, I cannot say I am located within a commutable distance to the respective offices' locations.

I am also wondering if Spotify offers housing for interns that don't live in the cities where their offices are located? How do these people prepare for applying to the internship when they're not from the office locations?

so I got an offer of a Marketing internship at NVIDIA in munich. My goal is actually to work as a Product Managemer at a Big Tech company or at a Tech Startup that pays like big tech. Besides the fact that it is a Marketing and not a Product role, there is the other (in my opinion very big disadvantage) that the internship period is 12 months (!). Now I am asking myself if accepting this offer would somehow help me to get to my initial goal.  
  
By accepting this internship I hope for 2 main things:  
  
Transitioning to Product inside the company (would love to work at NVIDIA)  
  
Having Nvidia in my resume could open doors for other big tech companies when I apply to them.

1blul3l,how to approach my manager about insecurities in my work performance partly due to a health issue,"this may be an off the wall question for this sub but i guess i'm dealing with a bit of a mental crisis about this situation right now didn't know where else to post.

long story short i took a sick day last week and let the whole team know. i used to prefer just telling the manager, but my old one would have me tell the whole team so i carried that habit over to my new team. my new manager (who is amazing) requested that i actually just let him know personally next time, because he'll always tell me to take the day off but doesn't want the team questioning the veracity of my claims as he's been on teams where that's happened before. it hadn't even crossed my mind that he or the team would question whether i'm really sick, so as kind as his request was, it did trigger an insecurity for me, i'll explain why:

i have three tickets on our board right now. one's in test awaiting incidents to confirm my code changes are working, so it's understood it'll be there a while.

the second is an ongoing project i'm assisting with that has nothing to do with this team, it's just on our board to track my activity. another manager requested my assistance with this task, and my manager encouraged it as it could go in a ""portfolio"" of my accomplishments so i could be put up for a promotion next year.

the third and final ticket is a small task that actually does relate to this team, and this is the one i'm insecure about. i was moved to this team 6 weeks ago, and my manager has emphasised that it's better to do things slowly so i can really learn them, but i'm starting to get a bit insecure as it's a ticket from the last sprint that's been moved into this one due to me taking my time, and we do want to go ahead and get this released.


with that plus the sick day, i'm starting to worry it looks like i'm taking the piss a bit. i wanted to request a week off about 6-7 weeks from now for a family event in my home country. i want to request the time off as soon as possible to give enough notice but this current situation has me thinking that requesting a week off is not going to look good. i'd never worry about a sick day or vacation week normally, particularly with this manager as he's very pro-taking-time-off. but the thought that anyone would question whether i'm lying about being sick, plus my slow moving tickets, has triggered this insecurity in me about my place on the team.

 i am a bit torn between wanting to maintain medical privacy and also explain to my manager what's been going on with me that i needed to take that day. i feel like if i told him about this health issue i'm dealing with it would explain things, but it is pretty personal and i don't want it used as ""ammo"" against me so to speak, as people can't help their biases. and i don't want it to look like a get out of jail free card, regardless of my health i do have a job to do.

this is made worse by the fact that i'm a non-EU citizen on a work visa so without the job i'm basically toast for living in the place i've called home for over 5 years. i haven't gotten any negative feedback about my performance but i'm starting to feel insecure.

maybe it's more of a brain dump than anything but i am wondering if i should at the very least approach my manager about my insecurities, if i should tell him my health issue or at least allude to it. or maybe just quietly get my ticket released next week, request the week off for mid may and not say a word. this is ireland by the way. thank you. :)",2024-03-23 15:16:57

1blnm6v,Looking for insight on jobs post graduation in Netherlands and Denmark.,"Hey everybody. I'm a non-EU software engineer with 3 years of experience looking to move to the EU. I've received admits to VU Amsterdam and DTU Denmark for a Master's program in Computer Science. I'm looking for some insight on which one would be the better pick.

&#x200B;

1. I understand the job market is not great around the world, but where would a post-graduate engineer find more luck? I have heard that the NL has a more developed IT sector, but is it significantly better than Denmark?
2. Is there a difference in how courses are taught between these unis? The EU has a more application oriented approach to education as I understand, but I'd appreciate more input on this.
3. The masters at VU requires a project as part of the curriculum, but the one at DTU requires a thesis. Which one would be easier/better?
4. Housing does not look great anywhere, but where could you find housing easier? Does applying for student housing through the uni make my chances of finding a place better?
5. How's obtaining the work visa like?
6. What has been your experience post-graduation in either country?

&#x200B;

My analysis on what I could find online leads me to believe that the NL might have a better market for software developers. Would that be the better choice despite housing being an issue? Any advice is welcome. Thanks and have a great day.",2024-03-23 08:49:54

Last year I graduated with a bachelor's degree in software engineering and was hesitant about pursuing a master's degree and working in a FT job. So I tried to have my cake and eat it too by applying for a junior Java developer position in the government where I can study and work part-time if necessary (I have 4 years of Java experience due to college).  
  
The master's degree will take me about three years, so I figured that by the time I graduated I would have three years of experience AND a master's degree that would allow me to apply for a medior dev position at another company.  
Now here's the twist  
I applied for the government job because I knew how low the workload would be and how easy it is to study while working, but I had no idea how little I actually program. And this makes me very concerned that I might not live up to the industry's expectations of a 3-yoe developer.  
  
Out of fear, since I started working, I have been programming projects in my spare time to improve my skills. I worry if this is a bad career move as I am a very ambitious developer and want to become highly skilled. And if so, what I could do.

I'm currently in my 2nd Semester of my CS BSc, and I've been applying to a lot of places for Summer Internships.

I enjoy  learning tech however money is a big factor for me especially as i am getting older(I understand the high salary will come over time and i am willing to put in the effort).  One of the most common entry -accessible tech career paths with  large earning potential that i have come across is the field of cloud engineering/ computing.

- €27,500 at ALTEN, working as a consultant on a project with Leonardo Aircrafts;
- €32,000 at Synergie, working as a consultant on a project with Stellantis.

The position at Leonardo offers an average salary (for Italy’s standards), while the one at Stellantis provides better pay and the chance to work for a private multinational (unlike Leonardo, which is partially state-owned).

My main concern with Stellantis is that it would lead me into the Automotive sector, which isn’t my long-term goal (I’m more interested in Space).

My question is whether transitioning back into the Aerospace sector would be challenging if my initial job is in Automotive.",2024-03-13 20:41:28
1bdbh5d,Should I relocate or try job hunt? DevOps,"Hi Reddit, I need help. 

I'm DevOps engineer with \~9 YOE, but primarily in Automotive domain (so I don't know cloud and k8 and market is limited to me). I'm non-EU citizen, moved from Ukraine when war started. 

My current project is moving from Poland to Bulgaria to reduce costs. Company is offering to relocate me, but with cost cutting. 

Currently my TC in Poland is 71,300 EUR Gross Annual, so it's about 4300 EUR take home per month. 

In Bulgaria suggested TC will be 50,300 EUR Gross Annual, so it's about 3500 EUR take home per month. Pay cut is underwhelming, but mostly fine as Bulgaria is a bit cheaper than Poland as I think.

Problem - there is no job security and guarantees, that when I'll move to Bulgaria project will not close right away/end of the year/etc. And company expects me to relocate pretty fast, but I have my apartment contract till mid summer in Poland as one of obstacles.

Should I agree to relocate or should I take a leap of fate and try job hunt? I'll also have very limited time frame (like 2-3 month to search being still employed in current company and 3 more month as Blue Card holder). I'll be forced to move our of Poland if I don't get a job in that time.

1bd73nx,Will I Ever Land another Data Job Without a Degree?,"Hey everyone!  
  
I'm a 20-year-old working as a Data Engineer in Madrid, and I could really use some advice about my future career prospects. Here's the deal: I don't have any degrees or official education – I'm completely self-taught, with just a few courses. No bootcamps, no college, just high school and a passion for data.  
  
Somehow, I managed to land a job at this investment group, and even though my title is ""Data Engineer,"" I find myself doing all sorts of tasks – from creating models to deduplicate data to building simple lookup tables. The pay is decent (18k after taxes per year), and I've only been here for 3 months.  
  
Now, I'm starting to worry about my future. Will other companies even consider me without a degree? How tough will it be to switch jobs down the line? I'm afraid my lack of traditional education might hold me back, but I'm hoping my hands-on experience and self-taught skills will count for something.  
  
If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any words of wisdom to share, I'm all ears! How can I make the most of my current position and set myself up for success in the future? Any tips for job hunting or salary negotiation as a degree-less data engineer?

1b7m76k,Advices for the future and career feedback for chem eng that switched to swe,"So, a little background regarding my career path. I am a chemical engineer with a master's degree. After spending my initial period out of school conducting research in an AI-aided molecular simulations-related topic (which led to some interesting publications), I changed career paths. My first job in tech was at a big bank as a Data Software Engineer, where I managed to grow my skills quickly due to a very good team and a fantastic mentor. Then I decided to leave my country, mainly due to extremely low salaries, and started interviewing with companies abroad, some of which were very big names. I managed to land a job at a non-tech startup whose product seemed really intriguing to me as a software engineer. Also, it seems that the startup has fairly good chances of growing.  
  
In my first job, the scale of the product was quite large, and I mainly worked on extending an automated ETL framework and undertaking some other side projects using Spark, Airflow, and Python as the main programming language. I wrote well-tested code following OOP best practices and modern Python conventions. If the pay was good enough given my team and mentor, I would never think of changing jobs.   
  
In my second job, the scale is much smaller, and the development processes are much faster without the same attention to detail. I don't gain experience in such specific topics as in my first job, but I feel like I have a more general overview of the development lifecycle: dataflows to populate our database, data quality, alerting mechanisms, monitoring, web scraping, deployments, full-stack apps mainly focused on backend, IaC to create resources in our cloud, etc. Our entire software infrastructure is hosted on AWS, and we mainly use Python for our backend services, mostly employing a microservices architectural approach based on Lambdas. I am quite happy in my role, but even though I have a broad overview due to the nature of startups, I feel like I am not delving too deeply into advanced software engineering topics such as maintaining software in large scale, multithreading, asynchronous programming, Kubernetes, etc. I am pretty satisfied from my payment and my life right now (even if the payment is not top but enough to live very comfortably), but I cannot see my self staying in the startup forever.   
  
After some recent job applications, I've noticed that compared to when I was in my first job, even five months in, the percentage of callbacks for interviews has decreased significantly. I know that we are going through a serious market crisis right now, but that has put me into second thoughts regarding my career choices given that I come from a non cs background. As a result, I feel very uncertain about my future. What I would like from you, is some advices and feedback regarding my career thus far and regarding my future potential. Note that I haven't focused on solving Leetcode problems yet. Even though I understand the problem solutions when I see them, I feel exhausted after the daily 9-5. Also, it would be highly appreciated if anyone could propose CS career roles that seem like a good fit for me, even in non-typical tech companies (eg given my background that blend chemical engineering/scientific modeling with programming) which might be a good match with my profile.

1b6idq9,Google Step Interview Went Bad?,"I recently interviewed for Google Step (EMEA). However, in the first round of interviews, the question was kind of weird and the interviewer helped me out a lot (they gave me hints but I did not necessarily ask for a hint, besides asking questions about their suggestions) when we tried to optimize the solution. I am not sure if the end result was what they were looking for, we did not really have much time left to discuss it other than its time complexity (which I could have also stated wrongly). 

The second one was somehow better, I did not receive many hints and I came up with a better end result, although the interviewer really did not seem to acknowledge whether or not it was correct. I may have also stated the time complexity wrong for this one :D

Knowing this, I will work at this current role for a few months whilst also grinding interview questions. Then I would apply to FAANG/AI/Trading Companies. Ideally would be FAANG, however since I will have Rust experience, I could earn more in Trading.

1bsl1dg,Staying loyal to company or leave?,"The company I am in has great values, it's not tech giant but people are treated like people. They prefer to pay decent salaries than to pay shit just to present amazing revenues. It's no six figure but it pays above national average. It has good work-life balance, it's hybrid but technically I only go to the office to meet my coworkers and go have lunch and chat with them, like once or twice a month and because I want to. The work environment and people are good. I wanted to switch from QA to backend development and even though I had to wait a bit, they satisfied my request. I am doing a bachelor in computer science in parallel since I am career changer and they give me the days off to take the exams without any fuss. This is really important to me because, since I started the degree, now so close to the end I don't want to risk not finishing it due to lack of time. 

Fasforward 1 year the project I joined as a backend developer is ending. The project was a bit boring in terms of business but with an excellent codebase and highly competent people technically speaking, people with 10+ of industry experience and it was in the Java ecosystem. 
The thing is, now that I will need to placed in a new project, I don't like the path towards which the company projects are moving into. It's a consulting company so the techstacks are defined by what the customers we get, want. I was presented a data project in which I would be required to learn an obscure technology that nobody knows of. At first I thought it would be to do some APIs that'd need to integrate with it but I think it's really to just work in the technology environment that only involves some groovy scripting. I would not like that, for me it would be like regressing to the times when I was working as QA. In such an early phase of my career I would prefer to stay clear of niche proprietary technologies. 

I already communicated to my manager my fears but obviously he can't do much right now. Besides that project there's other projects coming in that involve lot of low code CRMs which I also do not want. I could pass the project and wait for a better one to pop up - no guarantees it would - but then I'd be on bench not doing anything useful anyway, that's not good for me, and while certainly the company would not fire me, it would also not be good for them in the long term. 

I was not planning to leave the company because I had no reason to, I didn't go on Linkedin for months. But now I am fearing that if I am pushed to a project with a tech stack in which I would not evolve that would not be good for me long term and I should probably change company. Ofc I am always a bit afraid of ending in a company that has a bad work environment or one of those that lays off when shit hits the fan just to present good numbers to stakeholders. I am also afraid I am not that good of a developer, just really average, and in a more cut-throat company I would not survive and they'd probably fire me, so maybe I'd be better off with an easy project. On the other hand I will never improve if I don't get the chance to work in technically challenging projects...

What do you think? would you stick with working with a not so good tech stack for a couple of months until something better comes up (if it does) and keep job security? or is it more harmful to not take the risk to change companies in this situation because it would harm future career prospects? I mean does technical excellence even matter for future career prospects given the state of the art with AI?",2024-03-31 21:10:29

Is there any chance that the new employer would cross-verify it ?,"I have been offered an international opportunity, in which I am initially offered to work via remote.com (the company would pay remote.com, and remote.com would pay me) for at least 3 months until my VISA is approved! Once that's done, I will join the team onsite in another country (Germany), and my employment contract with that company will start. Now, I am in a very difficult situation. I initially lied to the new company, stating that I had a 30-day notice period (even though my actual notice period is 60 days) to get the opportunity to interview. In the last stages, they have offered me to join via remote.com the very next day from my last working day (30 days). I am now in a situation where my previous company's working days would overlap with the new company's working days for the first 16 working days of the month. I am released from the previous company in the second last week, so my last week is completely dedicated to the new company (basically remote.com in this case). I tried to convince the new company to delay my joining date due to some personal commitments and so on, but they finally said that it could be a dealbreaker for the hiring manager, so I had to agree to their joining date (which is the 31st day of my notice period with my current company). The main concern I have is whether this short duration of overlapping could count as dual employment. (Technically speaking, I would be in a 3-month contract with remote.com, right?) Will remote.com diligently check this overlap of the 16 working days? Please help me; I am not able to think clearly at this point. I have barely managed to write this post.

1bm75ka,Choosing Between MSc Programs: TUM vs. Imperial College,"Hello everyone!

I’m at a crossroads trying to decide between two MSc programs and would love to get your thoughts and advice. Here are my options:

1. Computational Mechanics/Comptational Science and Engineering MSc at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) - 2 years
2. Applied Computational Science and Engineering MSc at Imperial College London - 1 year

A bit about me:

• I completed my bachelor’s degree in the UK. 

• I speak intermediate German and am keen to improve it further. 

•I’m an EU student but considered an international student in the UK. 

•My career goal is to work in software engineering or a similar field.

Given my background and objectives, I’m weighing the pros and cons of each program. The TUM course offers a chance to enhance my German, which is appealing. The Imperial course is shorter, which might allow me to enter the workforce sooner. However, I'm not sure where the tech market is currently considered better.

I’m curious about the reputation of these universities in the field of computational & software engineering, the network opportunities, and how employers view these degrees. Obviously both are prestigious universities worldwide, however, considering my status as an EU student in the UK, the financial and living aspects are important factors for me.

If anyone here has experience with either of these programs or insights into the computational engineering fields, I would greatly appreciate your advice. Which option do you think would better for me?

Thank you in advance for your help!",2024-03-24 00:08:24

Distributed Network Architectures
Industrial Vision and Processing
Machine Intelligence
Network Routing and Switching Technologies
Network Security
Real Time Operating Systems
User Experience and Applications Development

1blxvzc,Mech engineer becoming more interested in development,"
I’m a cfd engineer and as I’ve worked this job I’ve realised that my real interests like in the actual development of the software. 

There’s kinda 3 routes for me progression wise. I go into management, I go into a wider design role, or I go into development of software. 

The last one is the hardest, but also the one I’m most interested in. As I get deeper into this job I’ve started developing solvers with c++, making python applications, using scripting to analyse results, parallel computing, looking at the cloud and on prem servers, linux, bash. love this shit (as far as a job goes lol). 

How hard would it be for me to shift? I’m 27 so no longer a fresh grad. Are there any places that would value my background and be open to taking me on as more of a developer/data scientist? Thanks ",2024-03-23 17:36:17

1bk5yks,Which path should I pursue?,"Hi,  
I wanted to make this post to get some opinions about which career option should I pursue.  
I currently live in Finland and have completed vocational studies in IT, focusing on software development. I have a spot reserved for me in a university of applied sciences to become an engineer in the same field. These studies give me the option to focus on one of two branches:  
1. Software engineering. Starts with the basics and progresses into a wide variety of fields, including machine learning / AI, industrial IoT as well as cloud technologies. The possible career paths are mostly software engineering and related fields.  
2. Cloud infrastructure. Consists of a deeper dive into cloud technologies as well as a deeper understanding of networking. Systems used and focused on include Microsoft Azure as well as Amazon AWS. The possible career paths are sysadmin, as well as practically all other networking related fields.  
The other option that I have is re-applying to become a robotics/automation engineer. This option would give me the understanding of robotics and the needed software skills to work with them. The studies also include courses in AI development. If I choose to go this route, I won’t lose my spot for the other university, so practically no harm done even if I don’t qualify, other than the extra hours used preparing for the evaluation exam. The possible career paths are engineering roles in industrial as well as service-based automation.  
I am very much into tech and any of these paths will give me a possibility for a career that I am more than happy with. I personally am more drawn to software development, especially in the AI space, but my worry is however that the huge number of junior software developers as well as the growing concerns about AI’s impact in the field could make finding entry-level employment difficult when I finally get to start my career in 4 years. While no-one can predict the future, I would like to ask fellow students as well as experts alike, what does the future look like for these fields and what would you do in my situation?",2024-03-21 13:00:29

I feel like the solution architect is rather manageable for me with my current experience, the data engineer - I do have Python and SQL skills albeit need a good refresher and have no real work experience in it which might be difficult to go straight full remote. 


Do you guys agree that Architecture and Data Engineer are equally viable paths to go full remote? In my opinion Architecture is more client faced, whereas DE is not. I would prefer DE but would probably need an on site role first compared to Architecture.

1bfaqn5,undervalued & underutilized at work? Or tripping?,"Okay let me preface this by saying I have an almost a full decade of active SWE experience. I would place myself in the high end of senior just based off on what other people who have similar or higher titles that I’ve worked together with can do with ease, or know. And I’m being as modest as possible. 

After a series of events I found myself having to switch jobs recently. The new job is okay pay wise. It pays a bit more than my last job, but still not the highest I feel like I could command, and also not what I wanted. I’m fine with that though, since it is objectively okay for me, and already even more than I was earning before. 

My problem is this: I feel like I am close to losing my mind at how much my skills and experience feel underutilized in this role. I don’t feel challenged at all, and even when my experience should be relevant I have to compromise with a colleague whose ranking in this job is higher than mine, or other colleagues who have been at the job longer but definitely do not have the same amount of experience which would have given them the perspective I have, almost always leading to a bad outcome which I have to then help fix. All of this without any accountability. 

I feel decorative. But I tend to freak out whenever I know I’m not growing at a role. And this job easily feels like a job where skills go to die. It’s not that I want to work so badly, I just want to work at a job where I don’t feel like the soul is being sucked out of me. I also definitely don’t want to hitch my ride at a place where things are not cohesive enough that bad decisions have no consequences and get repeated despite how hard I try to stop them. And when I try to bring it up I’m told some bs corporate mantra. 

I know the job market is tough and I think the onus is on me for applying for a role that i seem overqualified for, but then again, how would I have known this before coming in? Senior engineer is a range that people define as arbitrarily as possible. 

I’ve also considered upward mobility but I am not inspired at all to do that. Mostly because being asked to do more while currently being unable to truly own or do anything due to the culture or existing state sounds like a nightmare. No, I can’t pretend either. 

In this moment, I’m a few months away from quitting whether I have another job lined up or not. 

But I’d like some perspective. If you’ve ever been in this situation, how did you handle it? I ideally would like to not job hunt soon, but I’m also really worried about my mental health and burnout.

What do you think I should do differently? I will clarify whatever I feel comfortable clarifying. ",2024-03-15 10:25:50

I've got my sights set on the Information Studies program at UvA, but there's a bit of a hitch. Despite having a ton of programming experience (over 40 EC worth!) and Data and Information Modeling (both have a min of 12Ec requirements), my stats course only covered 3 EC instead of the required 6 EC.

1bdv7mg,Please help me decide,"I am currently based in Bavaria working for Berlin based company, I was hired remotely but now company is forcing everyone back to office and I simply can not move to Berlin.

I am mostly into mountain sports. 

Now it's tempting to take the offer and move to Ams but then I would be away from nature and mountains or I could stay and let the company terminate me due to violation of policy (to be back in office) or keep looking for lowly paying jobs in Munich.

1bdsosy,Career advice in Data science,"First of all I have been roaming around this subreddit for a while and absolutely love the support and advice this community is capable of, so thank you for all of this as I've learnt a lot reading through it.  
  
I am a student doing an Artificial Intelligence masters degree from the south of France. I'm doing my master's in 3 years, as I've taken a gap year in the middle (which is this year) and will start the final year next september. During my first year, I did an internship at a local Big Data company, that I got through personal connections. The internship went amazingly well as I managed to fit in a small team in the R&D part of the company, and I got to work on projects that some went into production. I went back to uni for a semester (september 2023 - january 2024), and I very luckily got a 6 month contract as a developer/data scientist at the company I mentionned earlier. Next year will be my last year at uni, and it will be separated into one semester of classes, and the other will be an internship (it's gonna feel strange to go back to being an intern). This means that at the end of my studies, I will have about 1.5 YoE, which i think, to be honest, is quite the headstart. I have never been a great student, quite the opposite, but once I get onto a tangible project I am interested in, I lock in pretty hard (I learned more during my internship than during 4 years at uni).  
  
The thing is, I feel pretty lost as to what to do directly after I get my degree. I have been looking at freelancing a lot but it seems rather hopeless for someone with not much experience. On the other hand getting stuck in an office job straight away isn't very appealing either. Working in the same company I am currently in would be a safe option but I'm also not sure if I want to, as the pay really isn't that good (about 25k before tax). The pay is an important aspect for me, I want to make enough to be able to save up. I'd love to go to the US since the revenue in data there is astronomicaly high, but the struggle to be able to work there is hell apparently. So yeah I don't really know what to do/what I should start thinking about for the future. If anyone would like to share their experience and the choices they made at the start of their career I would love to hear about it (sorry I know I'm being vague but it's quite vague in my head too)",2024-03-13 14:22:15

1bdc4q2,Warsaw/Poland tech salary not matching living expenses?,"A lot of people here on a different thread was voicing out that 12-16K PLN net is really a great salary to get in Warsaw, but it really does not make sense how this would come under the “great” umbrella, especially when renting a place in Warsaw would cost somewhere around 3k zt  + 600zt utility and for  living expenses (monthly) that’s another 3 to 3.5 k
So in the end you are left with somewhere around 4K to 6k zt on a good month.


I was actually on a very high salary (upper 20s ) until I got affected by the layoffs

I got an offer for SSE which is somewhere around 13K net in Warsaw and it seems to be way too lower to make any meaningful savings after decent expenses. 

Also I’m noticing that there are some poor WLB that’s been going around in few companies that’s kinda killing the whole point of Europe having good WLB in tech, the one quality incentive that I’m okay considering over compensation. Is this because of current market conditions or has it always been like this?

My friend got an offer to fintech (visa) and he is more or less being offered 12.8K net as well for a senior software analyst role.
He is more considered about WLB since his past company the WLB sucked but the pay was very high so it did not matter much.

1bbflmm,Concerned Final Year Student,"Hey guys!

After seeing so much pessimism I see here, I want to ask for help from you guys.

I am currently a final year student in BSci Maths and Com Sci at a Top 3 Uni in the UK (I’m sure you guys can guess) but I have had a lot of issues with my health throughout the degree.

I was diagnosed with Autism at 22, and I will graduate in June of this year (at age 25). I’ve had a lot of issues with university, but despite this I will probably finish with a 2:1 or 2:2. I continue to have issues with anxiety and depression, but I have made a lot of progress on this after my diagnosis.

I also haven’t been applying for a lot of roles as I know I would be fried if I applied to a lot. I haven’t done any leetcode yet as I’m still struggling with just doing my university degree. Because of this, I wanted to take the time to focus on my university degree (as a degree is better than no degree), and then after I graduate I can focus on job applications and leetcode/takeaway prep.

I just wanted to ask people constructively and maybe with knowledge about this on how I can enter the job market (literally any job since I know it’ll be hard to have any preference). I have both UK and an EU Schengen citizenship, so I have a wide net to apply with. I also have 2-3 months internship as a full stack developer, but at a company outside of Europe.

I know of routes to apply for jobs through employability, and I will keep an eye out for those in the coming future, but what other suggestions would you guys have for me? Do you have any tips you could give me outside of just applying for roles, messaging connections etc? 

\[Please no people in the comments just moaning about the job market, I know its bad, and I know it’ll be harder for me not going down the traditional route, but I can’t really help it. Health is my priority; I can’t work if I’m unable to put in the effort at the job\]",2024-03-10 17:20:52

1b6egrj,Pay cut for more relevant work?,"Hi!

I work on an infrastructure/platform team. It’s great since I get to work on higher level systems architecture and exposure to tech like Kafka but the downside is I don’t write much product code. 

In my country (UK) I would say I am paid a good wage: about 90K per year with a bonus and I have maybe 4-5 YOE (including internship). 

The caveat is that I do not get to hone my skills in say java or go. Instead I am jumping around languages or writing docs and not necessarily working on features that move a needle for direct customers. 

It seems that my options are to crack a FAANG company or to jump ship and take a pay cut but get some more experience in a transferable tech stack. 
One of my fears is that if I do well in FAANG interviews I may not pass at say the manager interview due to not having aligned experience with an SWE role.

I understand the market isn’t too hot in Europe so I’m happy to accept a bit of a pay cut but ideally as small a one as possible.

The number of jobs and projects are declining since years (especially the current job market is dead). Currently I am stuck on a 20 years old legacy support project, waiting for shutdown and to be unemployed again. The uncertainity of projects, low demand for mssql stresses me. The only positive side that I would have some time to learn during this job and during the unemployment for a year.

My frustration (challenge) is that I do not know how should I invest my time, which satisfies all these conditions but also realistic.
1) I think it should be related to mssql or at least microsoft stack. It does not make sense to forget and cut 25 years from my CV at age of 45. What related skills would provide me job high security at least between mssql contracts? 
2) I am single earner (responsible for non earning wife and small kids living in a very high cost region). I can't afford to compete with fresh graduated juniors who are currently desperated to get any job. So the transition should be done in max 1.5 years to get a medium paying job with real chances
3) how can I do the transition, to get a job without work experience in the new skill? Even junior positions require many years of experience, layoffs for seniors too.
4) during application, the employer usually does not understand the change and will think that I will leave the job as soon as I get a double paying mssql contract again. And he is right, the financial pressure to feed the family I still have. And I still love mssql:)

1bir83x,What are my chances for getting my first job as a web dev and keeping it with this plan? Any ideas to improve or change it? ,"Hi fellas! I wanted to share my plan with you so I can know if I will succeed in my efforts. 
My plan is to use this web app that gives you challenges in the form of figma designs with feature lists so you can build it and make your projects part of your portfolio. 
I am considering having my own personal website with my portfolio. 

https://www.frontendmentor.io

I will build a CV with a canvas template too. 
Once I have built enough apps I will find a list on the internet with web dev agencies and then I can either use LinkedIn to find the manager for each company and send them my resume with a link to my hosted projects and their corresponding GitHub repos my personal website too. 
I could also ring up their number and ask the person behind the phone for the manager’s email so I can send them my resume. 
The idea is to build a worthy portfolio as I gain confidence in my skills and skip hr contacting the manager directly while also making it as easy as possible for them to assess my talents. 
The next step is the interview and after that my probation period. 
For the interview I am going to learn from this woman that prepares people for the global talent visa in the uk. 

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuFAJN39xtmHJDIoktdY8phMYP1qdlrb&feature=shared

I am gonna ask for example about the promotion structure. 
Then there’s the probation period for this I am going to ask my supervisor for feedback as I explain to them my approach to a problem before tackling it. Then I implement and during the implementation I will always ask as soon as I have a doubt or a question no matter how stupid it might seem as I gain more confidence asking for feedback on how  independent from supervision I am becoming and how I can improve after implementing a solution. 
That’s it.
What do you guys think?

1bhxfcu,Should I take an extra semester in uni for better grades? (Germany),"Hi everyone, I have just finished my 3rd semester in my bachelor's in computer science in Germany. I am also working as a working student software engineer at an IGM company that's reputable in the region.

Unfortunately, handling the full load of courses as well as having a part-time job is resulting in my average grade being pretty garbage (over 3.0). I intend to omit this grade from my CV when applying to jobs in the future.

I also intend to continue working for the same company I'm working now for my first full-time job, but my main goal is to eventually get into a FAANG (shocker).

I wanted to ask if people here think it would be better to take an extra semester/year and focus on improving my grade, or to finish the degree in 3 years, not mention the grade to employers, and gather experience by starting to work full-time earlier?

My personal opinion is that since I'm not really worried about getting the first job, my grade will matter even less for the second job, so I should still be alright. However, I admit I am getting slightly discouraged as I feel like I'm failing to reach my academic expectations in uni, and I'm a bit worried the grades could be an obstacle when applying to top-tier companies in the future.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Does anyone who was rejected from a top-tier company feel like they could've gotten in if they had better grades? Thanks a lot!",2024-03-18 18:07:38

1bfmg1e,Just got promoted from junior to mid but not sure what to think of my abillities,"My experience is as follows. I work with c++
1. intern for 3 months (did nothing as if benched)
2. Junior for the same company 3 mo (did nothing benched)
3. Swapped companies in hopes that i would do something 8 mo. Ended up doing very meh work i can barely call it development
4. Swapped to actual company.

First ~6 mo did nothing as if benched (almost gave up) then things picked up a lot (here for about 1y in total)

At first it took me 1 w to make a very basic change. Then they gave me a more complex task, which surpised me since i went from a simple change to an entire component i had to write myself that had to synchronise messages coming from one thread and split them among different channels and with the help of another thread notify subscribers of those messages.

Which made me happy i was like ""ok it game on"". And it even kinda worked first time except some changes i had to do because of some things i even warned about.

I've had to write a general abstraction for a boost timer so that they can make timers on the fly.

And then i kept going with tickets i dont really remember details about. 

The other more senior guy in my team even started to ask me for help sometimes and i even somehow had to explain to him how template types get evaluated, which i took as a big compliment

I reluctantly asked my team lead for feedback and  if he thought i should ask for mid. He said that he is very happy with my performance, my relationship with the client and the fact that i am pretty much autonomous. Then asked about my experience and said that that is the only thing that may be used against me but still said that i should go for it.

So i decided to ask, things went pretty slow, it took about ~1+ mo to have a meeting scheduled to a review. And in that meeting the guy left pretty pleased with our discussion, and i even was a bit over the moon happy because he said that he discussed with my teamlead and their disscusion got to the point where he had to ask him if he thinks that i can do his job to which he replied ""The only thing that may hold him back is that ,maybe because of his inexperience, he doesnt risk and is unsure of himself"" which i took as a big compliment.

Now 2 weeks later after that discussion i get the email telling me that due to my performance they are inceasing my paycheck.

Today i was talking to the guy that gives me the tickets and i usualy have to talk to to get info about my tasks and somehow estimations got mentioned. And i said something like, i am not sure how long these tasks should take i hope i am not taking too long. His reply was ""For now i'd say no. You're in line with our estimations and i appreciate your autonomy"" which is not bad at all but for some reason left me feeling weird.

I dont know why despite everything beeing good  or above good i still am not sure if i deserve it

I got an information that I will have a coding task in which I will have to build a web server and code some logic. How should I approach it?","Hello! Like I stated in the title. I was invited to participate in an interview for a Senior SWE role. After HR screening I am invited for a technical part of the interview. When I asked how it will look (leetcode style, theory discussion or something) they pasted me rather precise question that involves building a web server and coding up some back-end logic.

I wanted to ask you, how should I approach? I am a little bit flabbergasted as the youth says. The task at the same time is:

Easy enough to somehow, learn/memorize whole solution (I would say around 300 lines of code across two, three libraries and a third party framework). Or print out few pages to tape around the room if someone is into cheating.

And at the same time, hard enough to for example be quite heavily lost if the task will be changed on the spot on the interview day.

The task description leaves some interpretation on for example which framework should interviewee use for web server and details like that. (I would guess that they won't insist on a single particular framework choice?)

My question is, did anyone of you encounter this type of an interview? I am simply wondering, is it a trap?

As far as I am looking at that, I would simply do this task before interview date, write down steps, notes, my exact choices for data structures and libraries and motivation behind it. And simply, well ... learn (memorize?) all of it?

Is this some kind of a trap that I am not seeing? Or companies simply go with logic if the candidate made an effort to memorize solution before, he will make an effort to do the good job on site?",2024-03-12 14:44:52

What would you do?

For background I am a Masters CS student finishing his thesis in ML - I have until the last day of May to deliver it and I haven't started writing anything, just pure coding and have not yet evaluated my methods, which should only take around 1 week I think.

I started applying for jobs mainly in ML, which is what I have the most experience in, but have not had much traction mainly because almost all jobs ask for 2-3+ years of experience. I then decided to broaden my search and decided to apply for roles where ML was a ""bonus"".

I managed to land a SWE position this week, but they want me to start in the beginning of April. Turns out almost no project uses ML at all so yeah that sucks, but the offer is very generous - it's the equivalent of a regular 4-5 yoe SWE position in my country (I was extremely lucky and this is honestly more than I deserve, hence why I am considering it, even tho there will almost certainly be no ML).

I talked about the possibility of starting part-time until I finish my degree and they will see if it is possible, but even then, I don't know if I should take it because what I think I enjoy the most would be working on ML and not on traditional SWE stuff - won't this look bad on my CV if in the future I want to do ML related jobs? Most of the jobs I see ask for years of ML experience, not regular SWE experience...

Ideally the interview process would be much longer and I would have a longer time to apply for ML positions (maybe it's too early for non FAANG companies in my country), but their speed caught me by surprise... Is there something I can do to keep the offer in my back pocket until after I'm done with my thesis just in case I can't get something in ML?",2024-03-22 13:35:24

Is Uk still worth moving. I'm flexible on the location within Uk as her job is flexible as she is with NHS. I have been seeing posts where Uk has been doing bad economy wise. 

I have been pretty happy in my current job - good pay , good work life balance. Company has been doing well too. So it's becoming a hard choice for me. She is okay to relocate back to India to find a new job. She is not very happy with her job so she doesn't mind it. But the recent layoffs that's happening and the advance on AI has been a scary factor too. So surviving on one person salary is risky.

Do you think I would be able to get a job paying more than current one ( considering cost of living is high ) in Uk and how good it would be for my career to have maybe 4 - 5 years in Uk and then relocate back to India.

I did German A1 course in 2020, got rusty now. However can pick up the language.

I want to migrate to Germany and upscale with a course. However wish not to do another masters program as it’s pointless and also I believe that 2 years program will throw me off career. 1/1.5 year duration preferably.

Are there post masters specialisation courses?

what are programs for working professionals or post masters? 
are those provided by public uni and falls under student visa?

1bn17ay,Want to transition into a more software devcopement role ,"Wasn’t sure what flare to put in but a little background on me. I’ve graduated in Physics at university and done well. I’ve really enjoyed the programming modules I took which involved learning a lot of Python (matplotlib, scip etc). After that I did an apprenticeship in data whilst working at a consultancy company. The apprenticeship involved learning Power Bi, R, SQL, Python (Pandas, Seaborn etc) and also used random forest, time series forecasting, logistic/linear regression and etc. 

My role is like a junior analyst role with the company I did my apprenticeship with. The thing is I’m starting to realise that this career path isn’t for me. So far I’ve been here for 2 years. I want to move towards more programming/development side of things as those were the parts I enjoyed most. I have good soft skills working withh stakeholders and other teams, I have projects where I used all the things I’ve learnt. 

What should I learn or do more of to transition? Anyone who came from a similar background? Thanks ",2024-03-25 01:11:44
1bmk6oo,What to do now?,"Rant alert, and apologies in advance for the long post, summary is: I am stuck on what to do after I graduated and can't find a job. My experience is all over the place, and basically: Jack of all trades, master of none, except I am not a proper jack of all the trades (bit of imposter syndrome I hope). What do I do?  
Fresh graduate and just stuck on not knowing what to do.  
I have experience as a ""junior"" system administrator at a school, and junior in quotes since there was no senior. I was alone, but still didn't do anything massive, so I wouldn't call myself a full on system administrator.  
For example, I set up their website including domain purchase and sub domains and such, but it was a drag and drop, not to be confused with experience in HTML/JS. I set up their LMS, a script setup. I signed them up to Google suite for education. Set up their accounts, and their classrooms.  
Besides these, I handled also support for the teachers and students/parents. Whether for their accounts that I made or hardware needs. For example, fixed computers around the school, Set up a school network, which is literally just plug in switches and one consumer level router, that came from the ISP.  
I sometimes also help with the camera system, debugging what the issue is, whether network, or the camera it self.  
Besides this ""work"" experience, I also did the internship with them where I coded a python script/program, that would handle their attendance sheet to clean it up and provide them with late people, and how late they were, etc.  
In the mean time in Uni, my whole life was Java. We were taught OOP in Java. We were taught coding itself in Java, and all projects was in Java, including my thesis project where I used for the first time Spring, and this whole environment to make a web application. P.s. I am uni graduate of an EU uni (Hungary,Budapest), but am not an EU citizen.  
I speak English as you can see at a C1 level, and a bit of German, but only up to like A2.  
So now I don't know what to do. Do I focus on learning more Python? go down the data engineering path and so on? or should I focus on more Java, and its frameworks, Spring and such? Should I focus on learning German properly? Should I work on getting certificates or badges, like AWS or similar?  
Salaries I saw, show that Data related roles such as Data engineering and such are higher than those in other fields. But its not like I am getting anywhere in either, so not sure it should be a factor, but its what made me interested in maybe learning more python and related tech.  
I have been applying for months now, and haven't reached the interview stage except for once. I have tried applying to almost everything: Python, Java, System administration, Teaching, Support.  
I understand the job market is bad, so what do you think I should do to improve my chances?  
Sorry for the long post, and would've posted my cv but there is so many copies, I am not sure what I should post or not, in all cases its here also on my profile, for some reason I can't post pictures here, but you can see the actual details in the paragraphs above. For example more experiences that I wasn't sure to include or not, is more teaching I did while at Uni.",2024-03-24 13:00:20

1bp0zbl,Do I have any chance of getting into TU Delft with 7.3 CGPA? Details in description.,"Hi guys, I am currently a 3rd year Electronics student in a university in India. I have a CGPA of 7.3 (on 10 scale) right now and I can try to push it to 7.5 max in my final year. I want to pursue my MS from TU Delft but unsure about if I have any chance of getting into that uni. Their website says that you need at least 75% of the max scale to be eligible for applying but I am pretty sure the cutoff for admission would be way higher than that.

I wanted to give it a try but don't really have enough money to waste if my GPA would be the bottleneck. Exams like GRE or IELTS are very expensive for Indian standards so I would only take those exams if I am at least 90% sure that I have a chance.

Talking about my skills and experience, I am from a research university and I have worked on two research projects in my uni. Both are related to systems security. One was related to blockchain security (idk much about blockchain tho, my work was mostly related to distributed systems and network security) and other is about side channel attacks in Android. Our projects have been going great and I have contributed enough to count them as a research experiences. I also did a winter internship in a small Canadian startup where I worked on building a GUI application using C++. I am actually very good when it comes to practical stuff but I suck at theoretical knowledge and that's why I have a shitty GPA. My coding skills are above average. I mostly work with C/C++ (slowly shifting to Rust) and Python. I have a good enough experience of low level, kernel programming and ebpf scripting. I also have a really good understanding of the Linux kernel and Linux as an operating system as well (have been using Arch and writing bash scripts for 4 years now).

Since I have Electronics background, I know a thing or two about Arduino and FPGAs as well (I have worked with Zedboards in my initial years). Embedded programming is not really something I am planning to pursue as a career but it is also one of the domains of my interest. And finally, I am a beginner in Machine Learning (will hopefully be good enough by the time I graduate). I am currently reading the book Intro to Statistical Learning (https://www.statlearning.com). Right now, I just know enough ML that I can take a dataset, pre process it, and use it with a Machine Learning model and make things work somehow lol. Just trying to understand the math behind the models better so I can take decisions on which model to use when and debug the problems with ease.

This might be unrelated but I have a passion of hosting servers for my personal use. Currently, I am hosting multiple services at my home using a Raspberry Pi as a reverse proxy and multiple machines which are running services for image hosting, media hosting, my git repositories and a lot of other stuff. I am almost entirely dependent on my self hosted services.

In conclusion, I feel like I have the required skills required to pursue masters in a prestigious uni like TU Delft but my GPA kills all my motivation every time I think of pursuing masters. I have honestly no idea how important GPA is in the EU that is why I am asking here. Should I even try to apply or should I just forget about masters completely and start looking for jobs?

Also, if you guys have any other university recommendations other than TU Delft, feel free to talk about them. I just thought TU Delft would be the best option for me because obviously it is one of the best universities but also I love Netherlands. I love cycling and using public transit and Europeans, especially Dutch people are best at it :D

I’m currently exploring the possibility of relocating to Europe for work and am seeking your insights to make an informed decision. My options are the Netherlands, London, or Poland, and I’m trying to determine which location might offer the best opportunities and environment for someone with my background and preferences. I’m particularly interested in your perspectives on the job market, lifestyle, and any potential challenges I might face.

Background:

Nationality: Australian, with a Polish passport.

Language Skills: Fluent in English; proficient in Polish for daily conversations, though not fully business-professional yet.

Experience: 3 years as a software engineer, with a preference for front-end development.

Goal: To leverage my EU citizenship to work in Europe for at least a year, gaining international experience and perhaps exploring my cultural roots in Poland.

Questions:

	
1.	Job Market Comparison: How do the job markets for software engineers compare in the Netherlands, London, and Poland, especially for someone with a front-end focus? Are there significant differences in opportunities, technologies in demand, or industry presence?

2.	Language Barriers: Given my language skills, would I face significant barriers in professional environments in these locations, particularly in Poland where my proficiency is conversational?

3.	Relocation Challenges: What are the common challenges faced by international relocates, especially from outside Europe, in these regions? Any tips on navigating them?

4.	Cultural and Professional Adjustment: How easy is it to adapt to the professional culture in these areas for someone coming from Australia? Are there any specific aspects I should be prepared for?

Hey everyone,

I'm at a bit of a crossroads in my career journey and could really use some advice. Here's a bit about my background and the dilemmas I'm facing:

Background:
- Graduated with a BCom in 2023 with a GPA of 7.90.
- Currently pursuing an MCom with a GPA of 10.00 in semester 1, will make sure the gpa stays high.
- Working in digital marketing at an MNC.

Dilemmas:
1. MS vs. MBA: I'm torn between pursuing an MS or an MBA, unsure what field to pursue for a high paying job. It's worth mentioning that I'm not particularly skilled in finance or IT.
2. Inclination: I have always been more inclined towards strategy making or event management or client facing roles. 

Questions:
1. Timing for Application: When should I apply for studies abroad? Is Fall 2025 the right time, or should I consider later dates?
2. Job Experience: What type of job experience should I gain in the meantime to enhance my prospects?
3. Preferred Country: I'm open to studying and settling abroad in a country where I have good job opportunities to pay off my loan, and possibly migrate to other countries from there. Preferences are US, UK and EU.
4. University Preference: I'm only considering top universities (e.g., Top 20 in the USA or Top 5 in the UK) Cause otherwise it doesn't make monetary sense.

I'd really appreciate any insights, personal experiences, or advice you might have regarding these dilemmas. Thank you in advance for your help!",2024-03-15 05:37:30
1bci3u4,Getting an 80k€ Job with 5YOE in Germany,"Hello swarm!

I've been working as a Frontend-/Fullstack-Developer in the last couple of years. I have 5 YOE, of which I was freelancing 4 years, mainly for enterprise customers. Techstack was TS/JS, React, Vue, GraphQL, NodeJS. Recently I also dived into Golang. For the last year I've been working on a project as a Senior dev. I live in Germany, speak fluent English and I'm a German native.

Freelancing has been fine and lots of fun, but I would like to stay in a role for a longer time to have more impact and take on more responsibility. The pay while freelancing was substantially better than it would have been if I'd had been employed. This is the main pain point of seeking employment and after given it some thought and calculation I defined for myself that I would not feel comfortable to take on a job paying less than 80k€. Also I'm planning to buy a flat this year and would need this amount to make it work financially.

1bmyk6m,Switching from pharmacy to software engineering - any advice welcome,"Hi all,

I (30, UK) have been a pharmacist for 10 years and I’ve made the decision to switch career into software engineering. 

***My reasons are:***

* Personal interest in the sector
* Enjoy technical roles
* Disillusioned with healthcare sector in the UK

***What I’ve done so far to pursue this goal:***

* Started FreeCodeCamp and began learning journey with HTML/CSS
* Looked in to bootcamps, came close to starting NorthCoders but decided on going to uni. Started learning JavaScript
* Enrolled on to MSc Software Engineering starting next academic year (the course is mainly C# desktop and Java for mobile development)
* Continued FCC gaining certifications in order, starting with Responsive Web Design and just completed Back End and APIs. Start QA this week
* I’ve made notes in Obsidian as I learn and pushed FCC projects/other relevant code to GitHub repos - both of these have been invaluable when revisiting something like React and I forget a concept etc

I can’t stress how much I’ve enjoyed learning coding with FCC. At times I have been stumped and stressed, but coming through that by working the problem has been massively rewarding. My concern is that past FCC I don’t really have a plan. 

I work full time and have a relationship, so I have maybe have 5-8 hours a week to spend learning. This is probably why the above steps have taken ~7 months. 

***My questions:***

1) Next best steps in the 6 months prior to starting MSc. Should I start learning Java and C# to get a head start? Should I focus on building my portfolio in languages I already know?

2) I’ve seen plenty of project ideas that can add to your portfolio. My thinking is that many others will see and use these too. What are some core principles to building a portfolio project that stands out against the rest? I would think good documentation is a must but I’d imagine most recruiting managers don’t have a lot of time to deep dive a portfolio?

3) Any other healthcare professionals that have made the switch? Are there any niche roles out there or is it best to make a clean swap?

Thanks in advance. Any advice is appreciated. 

PS: as a funny aside, I actively decided not to pursue tech aged 16 due to a shoulder and wrist injury, and I was concerned excessive PC use would aggravate these injuries. Joke’s on me: most hospitals are now using e-prescribing and I use a computer for ~7 hours at work and 2-3 hours at home per day!",2024-03-24 23:14:17

vfssiy,(Warning: Bit of a rant) Skill Shortage in Germany my arse!,"According to this article

[https://www.findajobingermany.de/articles/why-germany-needs-more-international-software-developers](https://www.findajobingermany.de/articles/why-germany-needs-more-international-software-developers)

There is a serious shortage of IT workers and Software Engineers in Germany.

Other points this makes:

&#x200B;

1. Germany is a great country to work in. And there are over 100,000 open IT positions in Germany.
2. Germany has a shortage of tech professionals
3. The high demand for software developers shows the serious changes that  are taking place in the course of digitalization in companies.
4. ""A vacancy for half a year or more is a small eternity and can  lead to projects being relocated to other countries or failing to  materialize at all. Every vacant IT position causes costs in sales, puts  a strain on companies' ability to innovate and slows down the necessary  digital transformation. The lack of IT experts threatens the  competitiveness of our entire economy”, says Achim Berg, President of  Bitkom.
5. There are not enough IT professionals on the German labor market to  begin with. The demand is high because there are not enough university  graduates, and Germany is aging.

And so weiter...yada yada yada blah blah blah!

Okay, so the Job Market is ficking awesome in Germany and I, an experienced IT professional and software engineer with excellent ENglish skills and fair conversational German skills (And I want to improve if I can land up in Gemany), have applied to nigh on 100 fuking open positions from various job boards like ficking LinkedIn, Xing and even Stepstone.

No joke, I DID send out 100 applications and in some cases even tweaked my resume to the job I am applying to so it is more relevant.

But did I get even a callback? Noooo! Straightaway rejection! Generic fuking rejection emails most of the time while SOME times I get a fucking straight answer from the HR but most of the time it is the same old bullshit schieße:

""We have seen your qualifications and are impressed but we have decided to move on with other candidates. Best of luck in your job search.""

I mean fuking WHY??? Why have you decided to move on with other candidates!

Meanwhile the media portrays the skill shortage in Germany as nothing short of a national crisis or emergeency! If not treated the entire country or economical system can collapse, yada yada yada. ANd then to international developers they write in big bold and shiny letters:

&#x200B;

'WE NEED YOOOOOUUUUU! EXPERIENCED DEVELOPERS REQUIRED FOR GERMANY! COME APPLY! GET THE BLUE CARD AND EASILY MOVE TO GERMANY! BLAH BLAH BLAH!""

&#x200B;

SO where da fuk is the skills shortage? If compaNIES are soooo desperate for talent why am I not even getting a phone call at least so companies can test my skills? I had at the most 2 technical interviews in comparision to the 100 applications I sent out. WHy da fuk can't I get more interviews! At least interview me first before rejecting me so atleast I feel I didn't waste my time making an account in your clunky 90s type HR software! Grrrr! Makes me so mad!

And that's another thing. Most of these companies have clunky outdated software that I have to make an account in and then retype all my experiences and education, even though all that is in my resume!

Also, please note, I have ONLY love for the German people. The people who contacted me and did technical interviews were wonderful people who were very polite and courteous to a non-EU person such as me. I know lots of Germans love people from my country and my culture too. I really want to move to Germany and be among one of the best countries in Europe but damn it is difficult!

I must say, I just don't get it. Sure, if we only talk about pay it's one thing, but many seem to just have Switzerland in a very high regard. For me, it couldn't be more opposite. As a swedish person myself, it seems like they are even a more worse , orderly and conservative version of us.

You never hear about anything exciting from Switzerland, they are known for banking and medical tech and watches. They are not part of EU so you can't just randomly move in and out and meet people from all over. It's super expensive. The food is nothing to talk about, do they even have something other known than fondue ?

I don't know any big conference or software meetup there. In London, Stockholm, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin etc there is everything from devops to crypto currency to growth hacking marketing  meetups you can go to every week and enjoy yourself and get free food and beer.

* Public free healthcare not tied to the employer is great when there is layoffs everywhere and you don't need to stress about medical expenses
* Compulsory unemployment for 70-80% of salary + private income insurance on top 
* 2-3 months resignationt time forced by laws or contract, meaning you can say good bye to colleagues and do proper handovers while not getting stressed about next job
* EU citizens has passport/visa free movement , meaning if you work in spain or denmark as a german or italian, you can stay as long or short as you want. or move back to your friends or parents a bit, or look for a job from home or any combination of those. No need to schedule visa appointments or have a company sponsor you
* Strong unions usually, meaning you can not do a Twitter style layoff from one week to next
* Free or almost free/cheap education makes it easy to study at a market down turn. Or add knowledge, for example I'm doing a C++ course remote at a swedish university while working
* Most of this because a lower salary up front but over time it can benefit us",2022-11-07 15:09:32
18qng3o,Why all of a sudden programmers are supposed to know irrelevant stuff?,"Hello everyone. 

So I started seeing this strange tendency where employers/companies/other programmers expect any programmer to know plenty of stuff that is not always used. For example: rest, how does the interner work, https, ip, soap, low level stuff, memory management, registries, networking, ci/cd, language specific internal stuff, etc.

I dont understand the reasoning behind such strange requirements. For example we've all seen numerous job ads, where you need to know A, B, C, D, etc. But we all know that you dont really need to have deep knowledge about those things. 

Ive noticed many times that the requirements in the job ad and the stuff that you actually do in that position are two completely different things. Yeah yeah, I know that job ad is just a wish list. I can give you a couple of examples from my experience. The job ad said that you need deep knowledge of Git, but in reality, I just needed to know ~20 Git commands. The job ad said, that you need to know and understand data structures and algorithms, but in reality I just looked at my colleagues' code and learnt what data structure we were using for what. I didnt need to know, that set doesnt allow duplicates, or that objects are stored in the heap, etc. But there were many times, where we faced a problem, and our team spent time learning JVM internals and other problem-specific things. 

Imagine a situation. There is a technical job interview, an architect/senior asks ""Do you know how does thing A work in Java?"", the candidate says ""No, I havent had problems or tasks, where I needed this specific knowledge"". And then the candidate asks architect/senior ""Do you know how does X work in Java?"", and the interviewer says that he doesnt know it. What Ive seen many times is that the candidate will be seen as incompetent, bc he doesnt know about A, but the interviewer IS competent, but he just used X a long time ago, so he just forgot :)))). But maybe the candidate has designed and implemented many difficult systems, and the interviewer (compared to the candidate) is less knowledgeable? Maybe the candidate built his own OS/browser/computer from scratch?The criterias by which the programmer is judged ant put on the ""good programmer"" or ""bad programmer"" shelves are fucked. 

I have experience and I can tell that its all about your willingness to learn rather than already knowing some stuff and being stubborn and unwilling to learn. A person who knows less stuff, but can quickly learn whats needed and be open minded is more valuable employee and teammate than a person who knows A, B, C, D and acts like know-it-all. You cannot learn everything about programming/Java/software, because the number of things you can learn is unlimited.

Software development is just a business. I dont care about two programmers participating in dick measuring contest, where they throw a bunch of technical jargon/details at each other and try to prove that one is better that another. All that matters in business is being able to adapt, being agile (not the methodology), and always willing to learn. The person who loves walking, will walk further than the person who loves the destination. Ive never had a problem with a humble programmer who didnt know what I/our team needed to know, but was willing to learn, was curious and had fun programming.

No one could explain to me why programmers are supposed to be know it alls, to have ""CS basics"" when they are not needed. If a person hasnt faced a problem, where he needs to know how does the internet/rest/apis/db normalization/etc work, why is everyone expecting such knowledge from any programmer?

Can smb explain this to me? Am I missing smth? Why is everyone gatekeeping programmers?

Edit: So far no one can explain in detail why such way of interviewing/requirements are okay.

Edit2: Im not trolling. I just want to understand the reasoning behing such irrational motivation and criterias. And it seems that people just want to pour all the crap on me? The fuck is your problem???",2023-12-25 17:55:24

I was raised bilingual in English and Spanish in Florida (mexican mother) and learned French fluently in university, i also have conversational german and Portuguese and can understand italian. So europe is my linguistic paradise.

When I saw the pay on glassdoor for software engineers I was confused.

Here in the US a senior software engineer is viewed like a senior surgeon or a senior Lawyer and is very much white collar, all of these careers being paid 100k to 200k USD.

So im so confused at what the situation is like in Europe.

I like that there is universal health care but at the same time housing seems more expensive for the size of the place and the pay is 1/3 of the US and all the software engineers on reddit explain it to be a ""rat-like"" blue collar job people look down on?

What is the other alternative? Investing ton of your time and not learning almost anything as a senior? That's just not good time managment. I am always up for education and learning. Not for wasting your time. And yes it's unfair to those who actually went to university but none of us made the rules. Some of you asked how to do that. I'm not specialist but I've lived in a few countries. In cheap countries you can easily do that, but knowing somebody helps. In rich countries you need to know somebody at the university, but making connections like this is not that difficult. Especially as higher middle class which you are with your job. Also you can buy degree in any country, it's not important if it's from somewhere far. If you are too lazy for having nice vacation in Southeast Asia, then cheap countries in Europe will gladly take some amount of your monthly salary.

tct40j,Help w/ Fresh Grad Salary Germany,"TL;DR:  asking for 60k, freshgrad working on web apps (outside FAANG).. realistic in 🇩🇪 ? If not, which country would this be a realistic say?

A throaway account because im quite active here and i worry that some1 may find out who I am haha.

So i need a bit of advice. Im currently a student on his last semesters of his B.S studies and been working as a working student since my first semester here in Berlin. I work mostly as a Frontend Eng, and ive worked for different companies in germany/eu.

Okay, lets cut it to the chase. Id say I love to focus on what I do great, that is creating web applications. This means im looking to get a job lets say as a frontend eng after I graduate.

But, im in a funny situation.  Atm, I work 2 part time SWE jobs, and both jobs r chill. Im earning the same amount of money (+-100eur diff) after tax as a fulltime who earns 50K (after tax, too).

The thing is, the salary im seeing for fresh grad (non FAANG) are like around 50K, and even some are 40 something (😣wtf). So my question is, is it even realistic to ask for 60K as a newgrad working on web apps? Are these numbers up to date?

Sure I can maybe negotiate up to 55k or smt (this seems to be the upper number Im seeing on the internet). But after tax, thats only gonna be like ~200eur more vs wht im making rn, while that full time position comes w/ so much more responsibilities, working hours, you name it and less perks in general (not from work) as I wont be a student anymore in the country.

My goal is to get into big tech (minus Amz) to reach such numbers (probably higher actually) post graduation but what about the “usual” companies? Has anyone done this before? Which companies if you dont mind sharing? What country?

For more info: non EU, has ~3yrs werkstudent n intern experience (incl. one big tech.. does this even help? Lol. Prob sounds desperate but im just a village lad trying to secure max TC while I can).

199nafc,How realistic is it to be able to afford a fancy car as a software developer in EU?,"Let me start off by saying that this might sound like a dumb question to most of you, especially those of you who don't really care about cars, and that's okay I understand that. But here's the thing: I am a developer with 2 years of experience living in Eastern Europe. I'd say I'm living a pretty good life. Making 35k/yr which is not a lot, but I never really felt financially in a bad spot. I am not a big spender, but I frequently go out with my friends, I have hobbies, I go to concerts, I travel, but at the end of day I really don't spend a lot of money on ""dumb"" shit. 

But one thing that I am more than passionate about are cars, and I currently own my ""affordable"" dream car, a 2016 Mazda MX-5. My concern however is, I very often see developers from the US fresh out of college purchasing like 100k$ cars. I understand that salaries in Europe are and (probably) always will be lower, but how likely am I, as a software developer in EU, to be able to afford let's say a Porsche 911 for 100k sometime in my future? Obviously that will never happen with an Eastern salary, so all countries and options are in play. Is it at all possible? Or is such luxury only reserved for executive positions?

yzzhji,"""you can work fully remote but you must relocate"" - companies not open to B2B employment","Hi all,

I'm from eastern Europe and looking for a remote job - mostly in Germany. I've had interviews and sent dozens of emails to companies that have open positions looking for my exact skills and experience, however \_nobody\_ wants to work via B2B contract (where I issue them monthly invoices), only permanent employment - some even replied ""we're not looking for a freelancer"", which is not what I'm aiming at.

It seems that if job listing doesn't explicitly say ""*position is available for applicants within Europe / overlap of X hours with CET""*, it's only available within the country where the company has its offices.

I've tried hiding the fact that I'm not willing to relocate (di\*k move, I know) until I've had multiple rounds of interviews and got an offer....but got rejected as soon as I mentioned my unwillingness to relocate. Leaving friends and family behind and relocating just to work fully remote is of course stupid, not to mention the income tax, pension etc. headaches that come with dual residency.

I realize it's completely up to the employer to decide what form of employment they accept, but I'm interested if someone else was in the same position and managed to convince the company otherwise.

Companies don't seem to care it's actually win-win for both sides - I cost them tens of thousands of € per year less (they don't have to pay me 13th and 14th salary etc...) and I don't have to relocate. Your experiences?

wu81zv,Relocation to UK - Suffering now," Hello All,

I am from India having 10 years of experience and moved with my family (spouse and toddler) with a compromise on the pay and role to the UK.

It's been 45 days I joined the organization and I feel the work very hectic. Manager keeps demotivating me telling that my performance is not up to the mark.

Work is relatively new and there is lot of bureaucracy involved. The documentation for the technical aspects is also not that great.I was expecting a better work life balance which is never the case. I am not sure what should I do as the next step.

If I have to switch to a different company, I would be needing VISA sponsorship which is making the chances a bit limited.

I would request the group to help me with the following queries:-

1. I am not getting positive vibes regarding the work culture in the UK. The current company never thought of the personal commitments I had to undergo during the initial phase. ( finding house, opening bank account, adjusting to the climate etc ). Do you think should I try for a different firm in the UK for a better work life balance ?
2. I have developed couple of services in the last sprint which includes all the phases ( unit tests, performance tests etc ). I have learnt a lot in the last sprint but I feel dejected (sometimes depressing thoughts) with the feedback. What would be the realistic expectations in a month of joining ?
3. Should I move back to India and search over there? Maybe the work life balance might not be great but at least I will not be compromising on many aspects which I have to do in the UK.

Kindly suggest.",2022-08-21 19:32:11

s30h9z,What is the most financially attractive EU country for SWE?,"The premise is simple. For a while now, I've been trying to find / define what the most financially attractive countries in Europe are. The factors that I am considering in particular:

1. Taxes & deductions

Many countries are trying to attract talent to become liable in their tax regimes. E.g. Netherlands has a 30% ruling lasting 5 years. Italy also has a 70% tax relief. Portugal has a 100% tax free regime for foreign income. Poland has 85k zloty relocation relief for 4 years. All of these HUGELY impact the net income and value of working in a particular country. Most tax calculators don't offer an option to account for (or even mention) these deductions.

2) COL

3) Average vs Top dev salary

4) Currency (if local) volatility

I know where I can find most of this information e.g. numbeo, relocateme, levelsfyi, etc. The question: is there a tool / calculator to estimate all this in one place?

Also, where can I get information about attractive tax regimes without explicitly looking for them in each specific country?

199o0rn,Fresh BCs graduate from Italy in Switzerland. What to do next?,"Hello there,  

I am a fresh graduate in CS (BCs) from Italy. Not the youngest one though, I am close to my 30s; unfortunately I started my studies pretty late. One week ago I moved to Switzerland to start my career as Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer or similar roles. I love data and statistics and I focused my studies on those topics.  

I am looking for a job on various job portals (LinkedIn, Indeed, [jobs.ch](https://jobs.ch), Glassdoor, SwissDevJobs, etc) and I'm always getting rejected even though I send dozens of CVs daily. The main reason to my rejection is because I don't speak German, even though I am willing to learn it while working if necessary.   

My main objective is to find a position here with a salary of approximately 120k CHF, a salary that I can only dream of in Italy. For my CV I used [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) as template and I've written in my cover letter that my main objective is to remain here.  I am a humble guy, but I feel competent in what I do and what I know. I know it's a bit early to speak, but I am already thinking on what to do next.    

Given the limited opportunities in Italy, I am considering dedicating myself to further studies and obtaining an MSc degree if my career in Switzerland does not progress. Working in Italy can be challenging, despite the advantage of not having to pay for rent, and the cost of living being lower than in Switzerland. Fortunately, my hobby generates some income, allowing me to afford continued studies.    
An alternative plan is to seek remote work from Italy, targeting positions based in the EU with a minimum salary of 80k/yr. I have already discovered [Otta.com](https://Otta.com) and submitted some CVs.    
I am passionate about learning, and pursuing an MSc would be my preferred choice. While my dream job is to be a researcher in my field, I also have aspirations of starting a family with my partner. Given my age, I believe it's time to actually start my career.  
This outlines my current plan, and I would appreciate hearing feedback from people with more experience and knowledge than me.    
    
Thank you so much!",2024-01-18 11:27:10

125dc7c,"Do not underestimate importance of language when choosing the country, because Europe is a mix of different non English speaking cultures.","Many ask about ""Can I come to this country if I don't speak the language?"".  
Short answer if you're a junior: no.

&#x200B;

Long answer if you're not a junior.   
It's complicated. Many non - international companies (which is a majority) won't even care about you. Sometimes even if you can speak the language but you're of a different nationality, they won't care. 

It's true that in IT it's a bit easier, but that's the standard in most Europe among all careers. Many here are racists. It's not like they don't like other cultures, it's more like they don't want to deal with them if they don't have to. It's just easier. There are same rare cases when grads have found the job in Western Europe (that's where most want to go) but they either have studied there and had some connections or are very good at LC when the big ones were hiring etc.

So many different countries next to each other, but majority don't live in other countries, they rarely visit them during holiday. Those who move usually move from cheap to a rich country, so suprisingely they might be more open mided.

Getting the stuff done, getting around when you don't know the language? Very difficult. Some might even refuse you a service if you don't sound like a native, more so if you don't even look like one. And if you're not even from the EU, there's ton of official stuff the company have to deal when hiring.

There are at least a few countries in Europe that I considered, but I'm waiting until I can go fully remote. If I decide on a country it will be long term and I will learn the language. I am so careful and I am EU citizen. Some will disagree but living in a country for a year, learning and forgetting the language and then moving to another country is just a waste of time. I did that, it's not worth it.

&#x200B;

If you can speak English only try going to the UK and work for stupid salary or become a qualified senior and maybe some international company will hire you.

I don't want to discourage you, just stay realistic. It will give you better chances of doing so.",2023-03-29 04:44:14

It's a sort of fintech company in the city center. When I went there for the interview, everyone was dress very posh (mind you that I've always worked in science environments, where people might even go in a tracksuit, so my perception of ""posh"" is quite skewed).

I have been using Glassdoor as reference for salaries for senior engineers and searching for net income calculators online for different countries (Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, UK, Ireland, etc) and it seems that at best you can come up with less than €4000 a month of net pay on the highest average salaries (€80000 a year). The only two countries that I've found don't cut almost half your income on taxes and contributions are Switzerland and the UK.

rnt4oe,I am so frustrated.,"Hello, I am Tuna, a computer engineering first-year student.

My biggest motivation and dream is to live in Europe as a software engineer like you guys and be an accepted person for educated Europan people.

I have spent 2 years studying for university exam in my country, Turkey

happily, I ranked less than 2k in 4million students

then when I was accepted and started my university, I have passed the English exam and started lessons directly instead of getting 1 year of English preparation program. It was a surprise for me as I am not that much confident about my English. And my lack of English affects my grades a little bit.

I moved to another city and since a lot of things changed, and those things were below my expectations (for example being in prep. students campus and dorm so I have to walk every morning to the main campus) I felt very depressed for several months.

when I get used to a lot of things and started to feel better, midterms have come and I was still happy thinking I did well. when I found out that I get grades like 52/100 in MATH 101, I continued to feel bad and my confidence in math or my intelligence got very low. I was the best in my high school in math. I think it changed because of the mentality of university. I am still studying but I do not understand how I get bad grades.

this month as a senior student suggested, I applied and got rejected from the google freshman program, my ticket to have a little bit of early hope to live in Europe and according to my observations, they usually offer interviews to the people with high GPA. So next year is most likely be the same since I am unable to get an extraordinary GPA this year. This was an example of hope of mine getting lost. I know it was just a single opportunity, and i will experience other rejections in the future but it was the only opportunity i knew.

Do you guys know any formula, a path that is guaranteed to make me accepted to a position anywhere in Europe? Or any information that simply will motivate me again?

now I feel depressed for 3 months and I am losing my interest in software engineering. I feel very lost and I have nobody to ask advice other than you guys. Nobody knows around me which I don't know. I fear that I will drown in this rapid inflation and dictatorship in Turkey.

I wish that I can express myself enough using English, sorry for the possible mistakes.

Do you have any advice for me?",2021-12-24 19:31:49

Everyone wanted to be doctors, lawyers, yada yada. Anyway the cs hype has really picked up in the last three years. I know many more people who want to do a career in cs. I will admit that cs and AI, tech, software, etc is part of the future of almost any industry, but I know that the rising numbers of cs majors is cause of the benefits cs provides. May be wrong, but: wake up at 10am? write a few lines of code and debug? meetings? 80k + a year? wfh in a A/C environment? who doesn't want that? I would be lying if I said I weren't into CS for these benefits,

 with the large amount of layoffs in FAANG, big tech, startups, will the demand/number of cs majors decrease? will this career lose its hype?

\- 1. person going into cs because they actually are interested in the major/field

ogs04o,EU's position in 'war for talent',"so there is a competition inside the west ( North America , Europe and Australia) for high skilled immigrants ( students included) mostly from Asia ( practically speaking , from India and China  ), which is often called 'war for talent' .  

Now me myself being from India i can tell you , every student after his/her studies dreams to immigrate to US mostly due to the fact that US had a reputation for being quite open to foreign talent and having very high wages with high no. of opportunities plus also given the fact that it is a english speaking country . Now as for talking for Europe ( before Brexit ) , most ppl went to UK mostly due to the same reasons as the US. Some ppl did immigrate to other European countries , but it was mostly insignificant when compared to 'anglophone countries' (i.e. english speaking countries) and that too mostly to germany mostly due to its reputation for cars which mostly attracted mechanical engineers ( from an Indian point of veiw).

Now after the anti-immigrant polices of US most immigrants have mostly chosen to immigrate to other anglophone countries and not the rest of europe mostly due to the fact that rest of europe's first language isn't english coupled with the fact that when you have english speaking countries welcoming you then why put extra effort in learning a european language .

After Brexit , the only english speaking country left in EU is Ireland which is not known for having much of a industry when compared to its neighbour UK , which then makes EU not so attractive for high skilled immigration. 

Now what do you think should EU countries or EU as a whole should do to attract high skilled immigrants to it as EU is already facing a demographic decline , which immigrants may somewhat fix it ?",2021-07-09 09:26:30

153l0h5,I have compared Engineer salary in Germany to Teacher salary in SEA and I want to cry about that.,"For those of you who don't know. Being a Teacher in South East Asia is kind of trendy adventure that serves as a break from ""normal life"". You go to a distant country, try different lifestyle, make friends etc. You can be any kind of teacher but most are English Teachers. Technically Degree is required but amount of folks who do that on fake degrees is enormous. So you can go there as soon as you're an adult and make more then junior and most of mids in Germany. Without any qualifiactions.

Salary depends on the country but if you spend an hour on research you will just go to the one with a better salary. As non native English Speaker standard rate 18$ net hourly that goes up to 24$. If you do business English it's about 30$. Monthly cost for comfortable lifestyle about 1.1k $. This doesn't include some non paid activities but if you're used to it it's no more than 2 hours a week. If you are qualified and teach in an international school it's usually more than 3k $ monthly, not sure how much. If you're an Engineer in Germany (one of the top countries in Europe for Engineers) and get 60k often mentioned on this sub that's 18 euro net hourly.

The thing is many teachers grow tired of this lifestyle as they say ""they can't save enough to have normal life in their western country"". Lol, I guess they haven't checked salaries in western countries.",2023-07-19 04:50:22

I just want to know if it is a good offer because I am not sure what is a good salary for a front end developer in Antwerp and would just appreciate some general info and if there are any developers who currently living in Belgium I would really appreciate your feedback.

\*I have also posted this on the Belgium forum, and got great feedback but would love to hear from other developers specifically. 

So the offer:

59 995 Euro a year

Will provide laptop and phone

Meal vouchers

A car - if he doesnt want a car it gets added to the salary

No leave for the first year, (i think this is belgium law that people have to work for a year before being able to take leave) but from January next year 25 days of leave. Don't think this is a big deal, because as relocation we probably wont be able to afford long (more than a weekend lol) holidays in the first year in any case. 

SO my questions:

1. is this a good offer for a front end developer? How does it compare to the average salary? Bear in mind that I, as his wife will not be able to work immediately (need to find a job) so he will have to support me. 
2. Should he accept the car or is it better to ask for the amount to be added to his salary. How is the public transport in Antwerp? is it even necessary for him to have a car? - he will be working from home three days a week and has to go in to the office twice a week
3. How is the life for expats? Is the language barrier a huge problem? Are people willing to speak english? We will of course try to learn the language and we speak Afrikaans which is quite similar to flemish, but trying to learn the language will still take time. 
4. What is the average rent for a place in belgium? Is it difficult to find a place to rent in Antwerp? And is there usually a big deposit (like 2 - 3 months rent) payable?

And any general tips or feedback on working in Belgium as a developer would be much appreciated! Thank you!",2022-02-16 06:48:00

within my side project ([jobsforit.de](https://jobsforit.de)) we are planning to run a series of youtube interviews with software developers working at cool TECH companies. The idea is to chat in a chilled and non-formal way about the ""**behind the scenes**"" of working for XYZ.

The first firechat will be with our buddy from **Google**.

It will be our first appearance in front of a camera so I'm already sorry in advance for probably not the highest level of professionalism xD

Nevertheless, we want to give you as much value as possible. **To help us do that please write in the comments the questions you would like to ask a Googler!**

P.S.

if you don't know what to ask, pls at least let me know if this idea is interesting for you. Much appreciated!",2020-09-20 15:09:20
hyon1b,How can a non-EU move to Berlin?,"I'm a recent CS grad from a non-EU country. I just started a remote contract for a Berlin based software firm. They cannot help me re-locate as they are very new and have not raised funds yet. I'm supposed to work from my home country. It's been 2 months at this job. I also got admission at 3 universities in Germany (starting winter 2020 semester).

The company is ready to turn this into a part-time job if I come study in Germany. However, they cannot hire me full-time and pay me enough for a EU blue card.

My goal is to work in Berlin as a software developer and earn atleast 45K EUR / yr.

There are two options:

1. Continue working at the current company for a few years, build experience. On the side, keep applying to Berlin jobs online (while sitting in my home country).

2. Study masters at a German university for 2 years (starting Oct 2020). After graduating, look for jobs in Berlin. While studying masters, continue working at the current company as a part-time employee.

What would be a better route?

Does being physically present in Berlin increase the chances of getting a job compared to applying from abroad? Are the increased chances from physical presence worth spending 2 years at a university?",2020-07-27 08:50:14

18dctjv,"22 years old, founded a profitable business which will not be profitable in the future, what to do next?","In late 2021 I opened a business that profits 360k/year (and competitors at its peak being in 60k/month, a rate which we are growing to), it’s related to IT, all I do is coding basically, I don’t want to get into what I do specifically. This is absolutely bonkers money (tax is 7%), especially for where I live: Russia, and where I would’ve gotten a job if not this (EU). I know for a fact this business will not be profitable in the future: definitely not by 2028, so it’s a ticking time bomb on how much money I can save up to boost my 20s and future life. My obvious question is what next. Of course, hopefully I found another business but realistically. The field I do does not exist in the job market (part of why it’s successful: almost no competition), I code 80% of the time in Python and 20% in JS (making web tools in React for the business). Before I opened this business I was freelancing for about 2 years, the most recent was working for a German startup (which failed) as a full-stack. The experience I got from that last gig was good, it’s not something I get from my business in which I’ve only got myself to rely on, no code reviews or something like that. My concern is that I’m degrading compared to other people my age that are currently working and getting experience. While I of course am forced to learn about new technologies, it’s not on a fast pace like it was before. For example, I still don’t know how to use docker even though it would make my life so much easier, and I never found the time to force myself through a crash course in a long time. What do I do if I need to get to the job market afterwards? Will my experience running a business be useful? Can I go as a mid-senior developer straight out of the gate? What would you do?",2023-12-08 02:51:10
17p5zcm,Compensation thoughts,"Hello to all. 

I have a question about my compensation. I'd like to hear if I am being underpaid for my 1.5 yoe.

My current TC is 62k euros gross. I live in one of the eastern european countries. Work is fully remote with 5 to 6 visits per year to the office in one of the western european countries.

I enjoy the benefits of not having to pay very high rent (currently I pay around 450€ per month) due to lower standard in my country.

I would like to ask if it is possible to get bigger TC working remotely or is relocation inevitable?

18nund0,Which country to move in?,"Hello. Yes, another post about choosing a country to move. And no, not another post about choosing a country. I know there has been tons of posts, but they seem to lack valuable information about the OP. Heres my situation:

I live in Lithuania(native EU person), earn 2k euro net, spend 500, save 1500 eur (obviously). 

I dont eat out, dont order food, dont go clubbing, shopping, etc. My expenses are: bills, food, gym, public transport. Dont have car, kids, wife.

I dont care about the climate, mountains, scenery, tech stack, or if its 20 year old legacy codebase

I dont care if I will need to live in one country, and travel by train to another. I dont need fancy apartment - one room is enough for me.

Im looking for a place/method where I can save more money (not talking about percentage from my monthly salary. Im talking about more than 1500 euros).

I have 3 years of experience, have CS degree, have worked in the finance sector, Im more of a back end dev.

This situation of mine doesnt make the pool of countries any smaller. Can you guys help me? I was thinking about Austria, Germany, Poland, Switzerland and Scandinavia. Do you know any details that would help to eliminate any countries somehow?",2023-12-21 19:10:19
pwhdb8,Are salaries in EU countries for worth it at all?,"Reading places like r/learnprogramming, I got the idea of web dev as the ultimate not insanely hard to get in, good, high paying job with tons of opportunities that would be great to pick up in college before actually getting in the career I want, and as a backup if I happen to fail at it (I already do a bit of game dev as a hobby and I took HTML classes in school so it wouldn’t be very hard to learn).

17msg18,Is the market quantifiably bad or did I just make poor life choices?,"Seeing a lot of posts recently from new grads saying the market sucks so I decided to share my interview stats.

**Context:**

* Graduating with a Master's in SWE from a no-name uni in Central Europe (T-100 worldwide).
* 2 previous SWE internships at reputable Tire 3 companies.
* No special extracurricular activities/projects.
* Applied to only Tire 3 companies (since I had the luxury of a return offer).
* Top 10k on Leetcode, so fairly good at interviewing.

Snakey diagram of my interviewing stats \[[https://imgur.com/a/oHhlFl2](https://imgur.com/a/oHhlFl2)\] (Not sure why I can't just upload images in this sub) Overall I would say I got lucky/did well even though the 50% ghosting ratio is pretty disheartening.

**Things I would do differently:**

* Going to a famous uni, I was pretty nonchalant about picking my uni, in hindsight going to a more famous uni would have probably helped.
* Getting more internships, during the first few years of uni didn't do internships for various reasons, in hindsight should have tried to get into Google STEP or something similar.
* Make more connections, never really attended job fairs or conferences (typical CS introvert), in hindsight might have made some interesting connections there that could have helped.

*Feel free to ask questions in the comments will try and answer without doxing myself.*",2023-11-03 10:59:48
em1v9m,Here is why you should not move to UK,"Hey ladies and gents,

Here are my two cents about what I've observed and experienced.

* Unclear immigration system post Brexit

UK is planning to implement a point based immigration system. A solid system takes ages to develop. It's been known that Tories are against immigration and trying to reduce net migration. This is not like that they are against unqualified migrants, their policies are against software engineers as well. As mentioned one of the guys below a permanent residency application for a family of **4 people costs £10K**.

As an engineer in Germany with B1 level German you get permanent residency in 18 months in there. Whereas it takes 5 years in UK and for every year even though you contribute to NHS (national healthcare) monthly with your salary you still need to pay £400 extra per year to be eligible to what so called as free healthcare.

* Terrible healthcare

I can see why Brits support national healthcare. But NHS is yet another underfunded organisation. Do a quick google search (or [https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp)) to see in general how terrible even GP services. For special treatments there are waiting lists for years. Moreover a standard single guy who earns 50K a year pays **4900 pounds** per year for healthcare!([https://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk](https://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk))

* Housing

Not only is the housing expensive in city centers the flats are usually unmaintained, quite old and small. There are majority of houses with two water taps ([https://twitter.com/leoburtscher/status/996281035234082816](https://twitter.com/leoburtscher/status/996281035234082816)) in here. It's unbelievably popular to see flats covered with carpets everywhere in the house. Unfortunately I had to rent a flat that was even covered with carpet in the fucking bathroom.

Letting agents are like a mafia that government cannot touch. Every people I spoke to have some issues regarding maintenance in their flats. Usually something gets broken and it takes 3-5 months for them to call a contractor to inspect it.

* Expensive and low quality of life

Unfortunately transportation is extremely expensive in UK compared to Europe. In cities other than London it's not developed at all. It's not something unlikely to be seen that in a small town there are different bus companies and you gotta buy weekly tickets for different companies just to get around in 3 miles radius.

Driving a car is extremely expensive and insurance is your main cost. I have both driving license from my origin country and here in UK where I have taken the test. **Say** your company has given you a **Tesla Model S** for you to commute( i mean you get it feel free in a legit way but you gotta insure it) . Basically you won't be able to afford insuring such a car. Where as my friends who live in US are rocking their sports cars. Here is a screenshot where I tried to insure a Tesla Model S P90 and only one company has given a quote. IT COST 15K to insure it. (I have 1 years no claim, no previous crash mid 20s) [https://imgur.com/2se8fWw](https://imgur.com/2se8fWw)

Edit: Funny tho how minds driven by austerity are telling me to buy a cheaper car. I'm not getting a Tesla from my company. Nobody gets this as a developer for a company car. I am showing you that  a car an American dev can afford is something that you can't even insure even if you get it feel free

Even in a city like Manchester, a pint can cost you over £5.5 in a non fancy place. I lived next to Waitrose where allegedly Queen shops from yet the fruits are horrendous Kalamata olives are nothing like I tasted in Greece.

Allegedly this country has 2% inflation rate. But I can certainly see prices are going up around 10% compared to last year this time around. In addition interest rates are low when you try to save it. But when you try to finance a car as a guy who pays his credit card full each month, I'm getting quotes like 12-19%. But when you try to save £500 each month your bank would give you around 0.6% rate.

These are my opinions and I certainly believe UK is as capitalist as US with less opportunity but more austerity. Please leave your objections where you think that I'm mistaken.",2020-01-09 00:42:55

195h6yh,So for over 6 months I have been harassed by two toxic coworkers,"Ok, so I was hired as an intermediate developer, and I had to deal with two toxic developers and it seems my supervisors are consciously allowing this to happen. First, one of them kept giving me ultimatums as a senior developer to fix some bug. One time, it was because he misread an error log and he never said he was sorry, and the other senior developer was kinda laughing while he was doing that. The second time, it's because I removed some validation code that was getting triggered on page load and to me it didn't make sense, because no one does that, and he got mad and shouted at me. I just tried to defuse and the guy then complains to the manager. The manager ask my version of what had happened, and seemed to be extremely dismissive about it.  
  
Anyway, he complained while I didn't when I should have been the one. In the meantime, I enter a lot of bugs, and try to fix one hard bug and one easy bug every day and I ended up doing 70% of the commits, and that same senior developer seemed to have an issue with it. He wanted me to assign them to him, but he should know the application better than I did, so I was kinda confused, so I ignored it, because the other senior developer didn't push for it and he was the lead. And by the way, I did 30 tickets, and the guy who was supposed to be the lead said I have nothing to say everything is perfect, I don't need to review your code.  
  
Anyway, at some point, the other senior developer told me to slow down without saying what I should be careful of, and by the way none of the code was getting pushed to production, so I don't know why he was so insistent on this. But anyway after getting a bad review, and during which my supervisor told me that I should focus on quality and so I did, but then recently they started accusing me of not working hard when I am trying my best to check every single line of code so they don't screw me over by pointing the finger at me like they do, but they did and then after telling I am too slow, they mention some things I did like using an old component instead of reusing the new one, but after they told me it was OK to do so since we had to develop fast and the appearance was OK, but I guess they forgot about this, but maybe I am misremembering, but they did say to do things as quickly as possible to not miss the deadline.  
  
By the way, they keep talking behind everyone's back, they told me that they fired a junior because he was bad, but looking at how they can't mentor, write good code themselves, and how they blame everyone except themselves, I guess I can't really blame him. And then he mention the other senior developer who left after one year, and they blame everything on him while I see them write bad code like not awaiting a promise inside a RXJS pipe, writing an async function inside a class and doing a for loop instead of making a batch call, using setters and getters while making deep copies instead of recreating the object with new, using jQuery inside of Angular, and so on. They keep gossiping, and they even photoshopped their old supervisor expecting me to like it or something, and geez, I don't even know what to say. He even made the current supervisor look bad, and I told him not to do it and he just went at it, and keep saying things like I am going to kamikaze into the meeting and dish it out and stuffs like that. I am going insane.  
  
Also, the supervisor missed 30 meetings, and when I told her if she's going to meet me, she told me to not harass her and proceeded to forget and leave me in a corner, which makes me think she's really unprofessional. The other day she screamed at me for interrupting her over a Zoom call, and it wasn't intentional at all.  
  
Anyway, I tried to ignore those two toxic people by only trying to say things as professionally as possible while trying to defend myself, and I keep getting indications and they're not even trying to hide it, that they're talking behind my back and are trying to pin the blame on me for their shortcomings.  
  
I am probably forgetting things, but they give me conflicting instructions, they're super toxic, and I am in a bind, because I left my older job, because the supervisor wanted me to make an AGI that automatically create workflows on the frontend, like he wanted a front-end library or something. He wanted me to add a big functionality over an app that was not performant at all (below 10 fps in frequently occurring workflows), etc. Anyway, is this ground for some sort of legal action? I think I sent an email to HR to see if they're going to gaslight me, but the guy joked he had a meeting with HR probably because of his toxic behavior, so something tells me that nothing will happen.  
  
Also, by the way, I did my tasks faster than the whole team estimated the task to take by 6-7 hours for all three tickets I did recently and they're accusing me of not working hard. I think I have more lines of code and commit pushed in my last 2 weeks. Not only that they criticize me for some old code they should have reviewed and refused to do, because it slows them down. And they complain about them having to merge my tickets sometimes! And I took 2 hours to help one of these senior developers fix their merge request, because he broke the whole branch and taught him how to fix it and countless other things I don't want to mention. I ran the whole chat I had with them through ChatGPT and they found six glaring issues, and after trying several times ChatGPT found 0 issue with what I said. It said I was only defending myself, be engaging in technical discussions, discussing collaboration, and expressing a willingness to address technical matters.  
  
  
  
Now, I am not perfect at all, but I did everything I could to literally talk like ChatGPT as I they kept abusing and disrespecting me. If you think I am in the wrong, I really wish we swap places.

The only reason that i would like to take the offer is because i would like to grow professionally and work for a year or so and then switch back to freelancing.

What are your opinions? Anyone knows what's the company culture like, for software engineers? I wonder if it is worth it.

&#x200B;

\*\*Update\*\*

&#x200B;

In order to share more details about my situation. I'm a self-taught engineer that is super passionate about tech, Golang, microservice design and implementation, GCP, Docker. Essentially i just love to learn new things.  


Atm, I am working as a freelancer and I am specialised in building microservices (Go, Docker,  GCP, etc.). The reason why I am even considering the offer is because I miss working together with people that challenge me and from which i can learn. Atm i am building an application from scratch for my client but the work is quite lonely, and the team mates from the client company seem to be rather passive and not super cooperative.  


I am honestly thankful to all the comments and I must say that I will decline the offer and try to start thinking consciously on ways to enhance my engineering experience at my current workplace, try to learn more in my free time, and perhaps find extra/different interesting collaborations.   


Community, today i learned from you that I should not cut pay, loose the freedom of remote work, commute appx. 2h per day to work, just in order to eliminate my professional complex. It can be solved with better ways. Thank you everyone! ",2022-10-22 16:20:26

yt0pqd,Need help! Is this a lowball ?,"Hello everyone,

I’m non-EU, recently received an offer from a startup for senior UX role with 77k EUR in Oslo, Norway. They support visa and flight ticket as well as 2 months rent.  But almost no bonus:(

I was doing some research I feel I’m lowballed, also considering Oslo is one of the most expensive city in EU.

My background, 7 years of experience in 2 Fortune 500 companies. 

What I got from some threads is that, for example, in France someone has around 7-8 YOE can easily ask above 75k

17oews2,HR trying to lowball my market correction,"Hi, 

I am a non EU citizen currently working in Germany on EU Blue Card Visa. I was hired directly from my home country into Germany. 

During my hiring I was offered a not so great compensation in the sense that I was offered a compensation  equivalent to that of 5 years German experience while I already had 7 years of experience in total from working at my home country. I wasn't aware of how the German market works and what would be a fair compensating for my experience at my company since there is not much data on the internet about my company's salary. 

Anyhow I took the offer because I had nothing else at my disposal. After getting on boarded on to my company I came across all the shady tactics that the HR applied in my case to get me hired after discussing with fellow colleagues from my company and other companies as well. 

Now my concern is that I'm performing very good at my job and well above my job level as well. My manager knows about this and when I asked him to increase my salary because of the impact I'm making at my company he agrees but comes back with the response that HR is shooting down my salary increase request stating that I already earn more than average for my job level than majority of the people at my company for the similar job level. 

My manager told me unless I can provide him with some concrete data to support my case of increasing my pay above the average, he won't be able to build a case against the HR as he is not aware of current market rates for my experience and job level. 

Not to mention, the HR of my company is really famous for trying to lowball people and pay their employees peanuts compared to other competitors irrespective of the company's good profit.

I have been in the company for 2 years now and the compensation that I get is at least 10% below the market rate in general in Germany for the same job level at 9 years experience. I found some data to present to my manager and I could see that I'm lowballed very hard by my company. Nevertheless, I will be presenting this data to my manager so that he can build my case against the HR. 

The other option for a salary increase is to get a promotion for which I'm working on a development plan with my manager but this will take more time as my communication skills are not that good since I'm an introvert at nature but this is a story for another day of which I can't see any light at the end of the tunnel when this will get resolved and that my manager is satisfied with my development progress in terms of communication skills so I don't have much hope in the outcome of this method although I'm trying to excel at it since it's a personal win for myself as well. 

Anyhow, I would like to get fairy compensated for the impact that I'm currently making at my company given my experience level and not get sidelined with relevant German experience drama. 

How can I go about dealing this situation as my manager wants to but HR is not letting him?",2023-11-05 15:57:32

13ra4hd,"Stop asking ""Is --K€ a good salary?"".","I genuinely don't understand those posts.

Why do you care if it's under average, over average, or average? What will it change?

You could ask ""is 20K / 60K / 200K a good salary?"" - there are no good answers to this. There are no ""good"" salary. There is only ""the best salary you can get"".

Who cares if 60K is a shit salary if you can't get a better offer? Who cares if 60K is actually a huge salary, if you can get an even better offer? How is this an actionable information?

I feel like people are mostly using this information to feel good about their salaries, for ego purposes?

Or maybe that's the only offer you've seen, so you have absolutely no point of comparison. In that case, asking Reddit is a terrible idea, you should check out other similar jobs and just take the one who has the best salary + work conditions.

Instead, you're trusting random strangers on the internet who might have a completely different culture and perspective, and a lot of them on this sub aren't even CS engineers yet.

Ah, but if my salary is shit, then I should be hunting for other jobs then? - You should actually already be doing that. If you care about money, job hopping is the way to go.

Maastricht University in the Netherlands but there's a few concerns I have in regards to finding work after graduation. I plan on staying in the EU to work after uni however, as a US citizen, won't it be difficult to find a company willing to go out of their way to hire a non EU software engineer even though my degree is European?

15w0mol,Why I think US and other countries' salaries will even out soon.,"By soon I'm talking about a few years and when I say salaries I talk about hourly wages. In recent years we have witnessed big increase in IT salaries in most Europe (except ""Western Europe""). It's because US hire not so cheap labor there. Similar thing is not the case in South America or Asia to such degree (altough somehow still is). It's this region because of cultural similarity, small timezone difference (at least with East Coast) and reputation to be reliable employees. At the same time getting a job in the US has became very difficult and not just for juniors as there's less demand. Covid made a big step forward for remote work. 

When you analyze salaries per hour the difference is already not that big (especially when considering cost of living but even without that). I know you can get a chill job in the US, but the few friends I have there work longer hours and have of course less days off, not to mention less social safety (this one is difficult to measure). So when it comes to hourly wages (the objective metric) it's not that big for vast majority of jobs. Of course elite jobs still will make you much richer in the US, but those are a few and I don't think we should consider them much when comparing situation for most employees.

The main barrier for hiring in different countries are regulations. This is melting and that's the main reason why the wages will even out soon. Companies are finding more ways to hire in foreign countries and to handle regulations that come with that. You can't stop globalization. It might be not good for the US employees, but is quite good for the other countries. What is your take on that?",2023-08-20 03:50:55

142m4o5,West-EU employee vs. East-EU manager - career limiting situation?,"This is something keeps me thinking. I work for a multinational company and almost all my West-EU peers, including myself, have an East-EU manager. Needless to say there shall be huge differences in salaries and other benefits, that's just how it is.

However what I realized recently: there's not many promotions among the West-EU employee population, compared to the East-EU colleagues. Yeah, we usually have email announcements on such. Also I'm in touch with my local colleagues, and I can tell you: we are kind of stuck on our career levels, despite making contributions and a quite an impact on the team, we are just stuck.

I realize that the budget needed to promote a single West-EU employee might allow to promote like 5 East-EU employee. However being stuck on the same level is really demotivational in the long run, and because of salaries don't increase, basically promotion is the only way to get more money and fight inflation. But because it doesn't happen, that sucks.

Now you may say, well, quite and apply to another companies. However this particular company pays already so well (compared to the local market), that applications to any local (to the country) firm would be nonsensical. Surely there's an option to go for another big multi-national, however based on salary guides, it doesn't look like there's much wiggle room.

Question here to fellow redditors: whoever is in similar situation, like having a manager from a ""less fortunate"" country makes career progression slower, or am I just in an unlucky constellation?

Just to clarify: performance goals are met, even exceeded. Global impact is proven. Still no progression for multiple years. And while I can speak for myself, what I hear in the cafe from colleagues, that's pretty much the same for them,",2023-06-06 16:51:20

y5nbeg,Best countries for saving up money as an entry-level Software Engineer? (High salary + Low tax + Low cost of living + Easy to get work visa + English speaking)," 

I'm a danish guy about to start my software career and want to move for 1-2 years to a place to save up as much money as possible. Ideally a place with a high salary, low tax, low cost of living and where it's easy to get a work visa.

**High salary:**

I'm just done with my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, so I want a place where Software Engineers make a high salary for entry-level jobs.

**Low tax:**

I know many countries have 0% or very low taxes, which could help me save up even more money.

**Low cost of living:**

The cheaper I can live, the more money I can obviously save up.

I'm willing to live in the cheapest apartment/dorm, cook all my own food and use public transport if available, which means that living costs are less important than for the average person.

**Easy to get a work visa:**

I'm not considering the USA, as I've heard it can take many months to get a work visa and the probability of getting the work visa is really low.

Also, I only have $24.000 saved up, so I can't get a work visa by investing in real estate or similar.

**English speaking:**

I can talk a bit of Spanish, and can also learn other languages, but it would be most convenient if I can get away with mostly speaking English.

**Travel opportunities:**

I can always fly to other countries for traveling, but it would be a bonus if the place I'm using for saving up also is excellent for traveling with beautiful nature, ancient ruins to explore or other things.

**So far I'm considering these places because of the high after-tax income:**

* Qatar
* Singapore
* United Arab Emirates
* Luxembourg
* Australia
* Denmark (Where I already live)
* Norway
* Israel

**I'm considering these places because of the 0% tax on local income and/or on foreign-sourced income:**

* Hong Kong
* Kuwait
* Saudi Arabien
* Cyprus
* Malta
* Portugal
* Malaysia
* Mauritius
* The Philippines
* Georgia
* Thailand
* Nicaragua
* Panama
* Paraguay
* Costa Rica
* Brunei
* The British Virgin Islands
* Bermuda
* Monaco
* Bahamas
* Saint Kitts and Nevis
* Turks and Caicos
* Saint Barthélemy
* Wallis and Futuna
* Vanuatu
* Bahrain
* Cayman Islands
* Pitcairn
* Guatemala
* Macau

Any other places I should consider?

vmrx12,Fired from my first ever dev job... now what?,"Long story short, after a multi-year gap on my resume after graduating college, I got fired from my first dev job. It was a startup, and I was put on some critical projects that I kept missing deadlines for. 

I also made the mistake of making powerful enemies (including one of the VPs) because I expressed hesitation during a meeting once about working past 5pm on a Friday, and I guess he didn't like it. Looks like he held a grudge. I also didn't let the head of this one team bully me on Zoom; he snapped at me once like a child during a meeting, and I yelled back. 

You might be tempted to read between the lines and conclude that I'm a toxic person who lacks communication skills from all this, but I promise it isn't that. Most of the people I worked with at this company like me, including the head of engineering. But I missed one too many deadlines and these \*\*\*holes successfully lobbied the CEO for my head. I wasn't given any warnings, or put on a PIP. Just one day got a meeting put on my calendar where I was told I was being let go. 

It's a remote job (based in the US, sorry but I'm desperate for advice and cscareerquestions kept auto-removing my post for some reason); they caught wind of the fact that I was living and working from Europe, and that I had attended a music festival (on WEEKENDS, ffs). There was also an incident where a colleague called me on Zoom and insisted I video call her, because we had never met face-to-face; I happened to be in a hotel room with a girl (it was 9pm local time, and I had worked a full day before this). Nothing untoward appeared onscreen, but word got around I guess and made me something of a legend among the junior developers. Unfortunately, this was used to portray me as unserious and used to build a case for firing me on the spot. 

It literally wasn't that. I was given projects that were difficult and tight deadlines to do them in by the product team. This was all dumped on me because surprise surprise, they have trouble hiring and retaining staff. These projects were vital to the company and impacted many different teams, it wasn't just putting together stupid widgets in JS. So I guess I angered all the wrong people and was dismissed. 

What do I do now? Could I portray my firing as a layoff? Would another company notice I was being dishonest if I did? Is my career dead in the water? Or do I attempt to explain that my firing was the result of being put on super-hard, super-important projects within literally the first 100 days of my career, along with some bad luck?",2022-06-28 16:56:05

17j48vv,Should I move to UK or US?,"Hello, I'm a 28-year-old male, working as SWE. I'm originally from Ukraine, and my girlfriend is from the EU. My employer offers the option to relocate either to the Europe or the US. I'm leaning towards the UK or the US mainly due to language advantages. I lived before in Canada but have never been to the US, but I heard it's quite similar in terms of culture. I've never been to UK on the other hand. For US my employer can help me with L1A visa but I will need to wait for1 year. I really enjoy hiking and the great outdoors and weather and it's a substantial factor for me so I'm considering only West Coast, Seattle or SF. Below are the pros and cons I've identified for each location:

# US

Seattle or SF

# Good Stuff:

* More money and less tax
* Lots of high paying tech jobs for me and my girlfriend
* Nicer weather
* Cool national parks within an 8-10 hour drive, If you are living in Seattle it's 1h to very cool parks
* Easier to fit in because of more immigrants

## Bad Stuff:

* Seems like healthcare is a mess, but with insurance given by employer it's not that bad
* Homeless people, but UK has them too
* Schools are not great for future kids
* Expensive and not-so-great houses
* Bad public transport, need a car
* Visa and green card can be tricky, but maybe easier with L1A visa
* More Crime but it seems to be comparable to UK

## UK

Most likely I will be living in London or Manchester

## Good Stuff:

* Easy to travel to other parts of Europe
* Cities are easy to walk around
* Cheap flights to Eastern Europe for cheap services like dental and vacations
* Better houses if you look outside London in cities like Liverpool and Manchester
* Education seems to be on very high level

## Bad Stuff:

* Less money and more tax
* NHS healthcare is just okay, private insurance is better
* Living costs are about the same as US
* Bad weather
* It's not much too see in UK in terms nature. I need to fly Norway to go hiking
* Crime in London is still quite high but in smaller cities it's a little better

What would be your personal recommendation?

What things that I've mentioned are wrong or biased?

What disadvantages I didn't mention that could make a difference?

- My AD account had issues so it required some time to fix.
- The SSO required to connect to GitHub, AWS and other stuff was faulty with my account
- And now that the problems above were solved, I realized that I don’t have a developer’s profile on my computer, but rather a standard user’s one. So whenever I try to install homebrew, or npm install some package or any action that needs script files, my Antivirus is alarmed and blocks everything.

I'm an American engineer looking to move to London. I know salary scales are a little different in Europe compared to the US. Is 130k (GBP) considered a decent salary here? In the US this would be a little low for senior engineer pay.

wvc2a1,Why do so many people keep acting as if the US having higher salaries than everyone else is somehow surprising?,"The US is richer than everyone else, period (bar Switzerland, maybe).

They always had higher salaries and always will. This is not new and it shouldn't be something you found out on reddit after a century of the US being ""the land of opportunity"". It blows my mind that some people here make meaningless comparisons between Shitterdorf Deutschland and the Silicon Valley and are like ""OMG senior devs in SF are paid so much more that's incredible!!1!"". No it isn't. It's just the reality of the last 100+ years in the world. It's literally like being surprised that people make more money in NYC than in Ohio.

It's not about bureaucracy, or mentality, or the fact that people in Shitterdorf sleep more, or whatever. It's just that the US is richer and has larger companies because that's been the case since forever. Somehow the ""mentality"" and the ""bureaucracy"" things never come into play when referring to countries like Canada and Australia even though the US has massively higher salaries than those as well.

Outside the US, you're gonna get paid less unless you're in Switzerland or in other some very very niche exceptions. There is no competition on the money front. Other developed countries have other kinds of advantages that might offset the purely economic advantage the US has. That's about it. I wish more people would just accept it and move on.",2022-08-23 02:01:27
1as9wa3,"LinkedIn Easy Apply and ""Do you need Visa sponsorship?"" question as non-EU living in EU","Hello guys. Hallo Leute.

Sharing the same plight of being unemployed with a lot of people here, I have had to apply for hundreds of jobs and use Easy Apply a lot. I know Easy Apply has a bad rep (rightly so) because it's useless most of the times, but the majority of interviews I got were from using the button so I will keep using it.

But my question for the recruiter folks in here is, when you put the question ""Do you need Visa sponsorship"" in Easy Apply, do you mean Visa sponsorship to enter EU in general, or just the right to work in the country where the job is? Put it differently, if I am from a non-EU/EEA country but holding working visa in an European country, can I answer ""No"" to the question ""Do you need Visa sponsorship?"" or do I have to answer ""Yes"" to a job in, for example, Belgium?

I hope it was clear enough. Thank you in advance for answering.

I  am fairly new to the tech industry and have been working for a startup  for six months in the support team. My day-to-day tasks involve  identifying and fixing bugs in the company's products. However, I feel  like I am not making much progress in my career in this role and would  like to explore new fields where I can advance and become a senior professional in a few years as possible as I could.

109txjw,Can asking those questions blow the interview?,"Each company by defintion is greedy organization whose main and often only focus is to make money. How dare they feel righteous and arrogant enough to condescendingly lecture anyone that there are more important things than money. Rarely something annoys me as much hypocrisy backed by vicious intentions. 

&#x200B;

To quickly filter out employers I made some questions for them. Do you think these might be treated as too aggresive? I am not somebody aggresive, I just have strong and good self esteem and know how to talk to selfish people. And because not many people do that, they might think I'm too upfront.

&#x200B;

\- What is the reason for you organization's existence?

\- What are the values that are more important for your organization than making money?

\- If there is a conflict between customer satisfaction and making money which one would you choose?

\- If there is a conflict between good work environment and making money which one would you choose?

\- If your subordinate is not qualified enough how quickly would you report him to the boss? What steps would you take to help him before doing that?

\- What is the thing that require fixing the most? For how long do you know about it? Why do you think it hasn't been fixed yet?

\- Give me example of SAYING something that could cost you your job.

For too long interviews gave the impression that it's just interrogating one person. If they want to do that to you, they should also feel interrogated. It's like a date and you have the same right to not like them. I also want to give them impression that they're not lambs and have no right to lecture anybody about moral values. 

&#x200B;

Now, I know they may try to ask the same questions back as an act of pathetic revenge. That's why I want to ask those at the beginning to not give them any clues. This is my answer to importance of money.

I  currently work at an American company, I make around $170k usd as a Senior MLOps engineer. Great team, benefits, happy here and all, but unless I want to keep country hopping on Digital Nomad Visas, I'll have to say goodbye eventually. I want to permanently relocate to Europe. I'm sick of and done with the US.   


Anywho, any insights on how, where, to do this would be great, more specifically:  


* Which countries are the best and relative easiest to immigrate to for tech workers?
* Will finding a job be difficult? I'm a native english speaker (speak a little spanish, but nothing else and willing to learn), non-white, about 5 years experience, most of that in MLOps.  Like I'm experienced and good at my job, but I'm worried being an American, english only speaker, is going to prevent a lot of companies from even reading my resume.
* Do jobs offer relocation packages to Americans? (Not a necessity, but if it's common I'm going to seek opportunities like this)
* Will I be able to live a decent quality of life on an MLOps salary, especially if I'm still paying for things like student loans from the US? (About $1200 usd /mo)
* Are there countries I should avoid (really bad crime, political volatility, economic disenfranchisement)
* Racism, do I need to worry about it hindering my job search? This is a big problem in the US.

As the title suggests, I'm from London.

I'm almost finished with my second year at university (not prestigious, usually ranks anywhere from 60 to 120 depending on which site you look at). I have opted for a placement year before my final year, and managed to secure a Software Developer placement role at an international investment bank.

My mid-term goal is to get into a FAANG company (high preference towards Google or Meta/Facebook. Google because it's Google, and Meta because I'm very interested in the Metaverse as a concept). I wanted to know how many years of experience I will be needing in order to stand a reasonable chance? I have had a Data Science summer internship for 2 months at another company last year, and will have 1 year at this bank after I graduate. Will it be realistic to aim for Google / Meta as a new grad with this under my belt? Or should I try to spend more years in finance, maybe try out other finance companies like Goldman/JP Morgan first?

Also, regarding Google / Meta, is it helpful to study any particular tech stack? I will be studying leetcode and systems design to prepare as generally advised on the main cscareerquestions sub, but I was wondering if the UK side of things required anything different.

In the long-term, I'd like to get an internal transfer within Google / Meta and move to Silicon Valley (preferably) or NY. Again, how realistic a goal is this? If I'm aiming for a transfer, are there other companies that would be better?

I have bachelors and masters in a non-STEM field. Only have 2 years of work experience as a teaching assistant at university. 

I want to break into the tech industry through web development/ frontend engineering mainly with react. I am from Turkey and I will need visa to work in EU. My options are as follows: 

1. Go through the regular channels, study hard for university exams and get a degree at 34. But I will have no experience at that point, or very little assuming I can find work and have time to focus both on work and school (very big if)

2. Get a Phd in my field in EU and try to save up for a degree there, which will be easier and less stressful to get into than my country’s top schools. But saving money will be extremely difficult. Maybe I can find part-time jobs as I try to get a phd? But the phd itself is very demanding so this option is probably the worst. 

3. Try to get freelance work in Turkey as I become a burden on my family. Also try to finish an online degree.

4. Go all in on Turkish jobs and try to get some experience so MAYBE I can get a job in EU as well as a work visa in 2-4 years. This probably is my best bet. However, people without a degree rarely get work in Turkey (at least rarer than EU for web dev). Maybe I can get contracts for remote work, if that was possible, it would be ideal. Unfortunately I have no tech connections to network that through.

Im not expecting to get any internship this summer, most left are placement years and there just isnt a lot available unfortunately. 

I know some of you may read this and say I should just work somewhere else for a year get experience and apply then, that is my plan should I fail but I would like to know if there is anything more I can do (Within reason) to just get to that interview stage ?

This is another FAANG question and I'm sorry for that! It might not apply only to those companies, but my doubt came from reading about them.

To give some background, I have around seven years of experience and I work as a Senior Android Engineer in a Tier 2 company in Germany. It's a big company and not a bad place to work. But lately, I've been thinking about T1 companies and career paths, for the salary, type of work, environment, etc.

Enter my question. I've read plenty of threads and comments about people applying to FAANG-like companies and I've seen comments like (paraphrasing) ""These companies hire Software engineers, not XXX Engineer"". I don't think I fully grasp this concept.

What does it mean that they are looking for Software Engineers? That I should be more agnostic? How does that translate into interviews/day-to-day work? and for interviews?

So far I have followed mobile development since it's what I've been working on. I learned Java and then Kotlin since is the common tech stack in the field. I have worked in other languages a few times and I'm not lost when looking at different languages, but my knowledge of them doesn't go that deep. If I were asked to do something complex in say Go, I would have to spend some time searching before I could even start. Even more so if I had to pick a framework.

This also applies to interviews. When I apply to an Android role I more or less know what I'll be evaluated on, what kind of questions and/or what kind of take-home test I might get.

So all of this is to say, what kind of study and practice should I do for those kinds of roles? What skills are necessary to jump from Android Engineer to a Software engineer? What is the interview process for them look like on a technical-like question? What books should I read, languages to learn, frameworks, etc?

It's even more confusing since I know that there are Mobile/Frontend/Backend engineers working in those companies. Do they not apply to a job position that mentions their domain? 

I know some people here might say that since I'm asking this question it means I'm not prepared and how can I not know this stuff after seven years, but I'll appreciate any help, comment, suggestion or message of any kind!

Thanks a lot!",2023-06-17 16:20:54

Goal was basically to have a better idea of the standards in the market. I decided to go above and beyond and schedule demos with competitors so I can have more conclusive research to show. Most of them never got back to me - which I pretty much thought would be the case because I used my work email which contains my job title (Web Developer). But one got back to me. We had the demo call, and I got the info I needed. 

Problem is now I feel frazzled and guilty like that was the wrong/a stupid thing to do. Nothing has happened. I didn't tell any lies. I didn't mention any company specific data for the company I work for (all questions they asked me were on who the general decision makers are in the company - I said ""managers"" and if it's possible for me to refer them to the managers).

14qd17g,Am I in the wrong for being a bit bothered by the fact I'm managed by an intern ?,"Hi, sorry if the English is a bit odd sometimes, I used ChatGPT to translate it, I re-read it and it does convey the message quite well, so here goes:

After discussing with the CEO of a rapidly growing company (small team but significant contacts in various fields, a successful previous project, and currently working on revamping the initial project and developing a related application), I have agreed to transition from being a full-time remote freelancer to a full-time on-site employee. The team consisted of a ""senior"" developer serving as the tech lead and an intern in the final stages of their studies, with about 1.5 years of experience in the company, if I recall correctly. I have nearly 5 years of experience, working with WP, React, Angular, PHP, Symfony, in both large international corporations and small businesses. I have worked abroad and in France, and I have been involved, to varying degrees, in the development of numerous websites across different domains, each presenting unique challenges. I have been the sole developer on some projects and part of large teams. In short, over the course of 5 years, I have had the opportunity to experience various contexts.  
We hadn't discussed the specific details of the position, but the CEO initially contacted me because their tech lead had resigned. Therefore, I assumed implicitly that I would be taking over that role. I based my salary expectations, the negotiations, and my discussions with the CEO on the assumption that I would become the tech lead, with the intern leaving the company early next year.  
However, when I arrived, it turned out that the intern had become the technical lead, and I joined the team as a developer. The advantage is that I'm being paid €44k for the first few months and then €48k after 6 months, which is not bad considering I'm just a developer and not based in Paris. I had asked for €46k. But what bothers me is that an intern with barely 2 years of experience is now the technical lead and earning more than me. He has only worked on a single project in his entire career and is now the technical lead. I struggled with being ""managed"" by an intern, and now seeing it in writing and knowing that he will be paid more than me is somewhat unsettling. It's not that an intern can't be a technical lead, but there's a significant gap between 5 years of experience in various domains and 2 years focused on a single subject, isn't there?  
I don't know if it's just me or not. My girlfriend, her sister, and another person from the company agree with and/or understand my perspective, but they might be biased, so I don't entirely rely on their opinion.  
I think I probably should have been clearer from the start about my goals within the company and what I was looking for. I'm going from being an independent contractor, working remotely, with a few fewer working hours each day and a higher pay rate, and having plenty of free time, to being in an office every day from 9 to 5, managed by an intern who isn't much more experienced. I did mention to the CEO that my goal was to build something and have responsibilities, to have a hybrid role instead of just doing development all day.  
I'm not sure what to think. If everything goes well, I still have one month left in the probation period. I don't want to discuss it with the boss before the end of the probation period, but I find it difficult to act ""normal"" when I talk to the technical lead. But on the one hand, it's not his fault; he took the opportunity when it was presented to him, which is normal. On the other hand, the boss is really nice, professional, and fair. So, I also don't want to give the impression that I'm attacking him when I eventually talk to the boss about this.

104m8nr,Concerns about salary range,"Hi!

Today I had an interview with a recruiter in a company based in Portugal. It's a consulting company.

I'm concerned about something: Is it €1800.00 - €2100.00 EUR net per month a good salary to start working in the European Union? (this was a salary approximation a recruiter told me during an interview). They offer VISA sponsorship.

I know that Portugal is one of the PIGS countries (with a lot of economic problems), and I know that living in Lisbon/Oporto could be expensive (flat rents are becoming too expensive).

She didn't share with me more details about the compensation, benefits & perks (those details will be disclosed if I pass the technical interviews).

Another concern I have is that if I get the job, then it will be difficult for me to get something better later.

1b30ta6,Just realized that I will never work for a tech-first company,"I lack degree. I even lack bootcamp. I learned everything by myself: Courses, youtube videos, trial and error. Java, Spring Boot, C#, [](https://ASP.NET) Core, React for some frontend, SQL.

After working for a startup for 2 years I decided to interview with other companies. All I get are companies where software is a cost center: Insurance, advertisement agencies, moldy downtrodden offices with mandatory on-site for ""great culture"", etc. I also had a startup interview where the guy was just not interested the very first seconds, and I could tell. To no one's surprise he rejected me today.

And the worst part of all: It's not just me. People with 4+ year degrees have the same experience. It feels like caring about your code is the exception, not the rule. The startups push you to skip error checks because they want to hit the market first. The corporations are driven by some oldheads who lost their soul decades ago, and good coding practices are subjective, are allergic to code reviews and pair programming is basically them sharing the screen to do your work in front of you without explaining shit.

My only hope is to join a company where software isn't the cost center, but at the same time have an established product so there's no market rush. Problem is, they're only a handful, and they're very VERY picky. Not only will they screen for degree, they will also screen for age under the premise of ""informal culture, with ping pong tables"". They'll pour money to emulate university settings as much as possible - including performance reviews.

I'm so done. I just don't see why I shouldn't just become ""part of the problem"", stop caring about new technologies, code efficiency and best practices, and instead start rubbing shoulders to be ""pleasant ton work with"".

Some context: I have recently moved to Berlin from India. I have around 3 years of PM exp. 

The number of relevant job openings are quite low. At this point in time, I am getting desperate to find a PM role and I have just 2-3 more months left before we make the tough decision of having to move back to India.

I have three interviews in the last three months (abysmally low) and I got two final round rejects for reasons beyond my control (the other candidates knew german and another one was a referral)

I have now decided to make one final push and I plan to go all guns blazing to get any PM job anywhere in Germany (or Europe). I have decided to attend networking events and do LinkedIN outreach as well

Question: How do I network? both in person and on Linkedin? Do I directly come to the point of asking for a referral? I am scared it will sound desperate and that most people will not agree to refer and the conversation will turn awkward.

Considering the time pressure I am in; can you please share some detailed pointers on how to network? I feel like I dont care about their projects or their impact and they know it as well. They are aware that I will just end up asking for a referral.",2024-01-03 10:56:34

g77y0g,Disillusioned with companies during Corona,"Hi all, 

Throwaway, just in case.

I'm a non-EEA citizen working in a EU country. I am disappointed with how companies are treating people during the crisis.

Maybe I am naïve, but I expected more. Every work review I ever had was positive. I keep asking for tips for improvement and things I could do better, and all I ever hear is to just keep doing what I already am.

I get promoted to principal engineer in February. Why February? My company is 3 months late doing performance/salary reviews. So I lose 2 months of increased salaries and they just ignore it.

A week before we go into lockdown one of the execs travels to our offices and gives a speech about how were doing great financially (we can't be, and we weren't). First week of lockdown we get promotions/raises/bonuses frozen and told were working 80% work hours.

We keep getting communication from the company telling us all is under control, but people are leaving, and it all feels fake and untrue. I can't know the exact numbers, but the word is we're something like 60% down in revenue. I am looking at a 45% pay reduction from what was promised.

My boss and his boss surprise me with a meeting. They tell me how valued I am, and ask me how do I feel about it all. My issue is that I find it hard to lie when I'm unhappy. I tell them that it's a big difference between what was promised and what transpired. I say that by delaying the pay reviews, the company unfairly profited from its own disorganisation at my expense. I say that not all employers have financial difficulty and that it makes no financial sense for me to work so much bellow what we agreed was my market value.

They tell me that they took it up with upper management, but that the company cannot increase expenses right now (expenses after the work hours cut), no matter what, no exceptions. They keep dragging me into these meetings, trying to get me to be ok with this. They ask if there's anything else they could offer. I ask for stock, that's a no. I ask for a written guarantee of retroactively paying for everything after all of this is over. That's a no. They present everything as an axiom and box the conversation in around those walls, where I don't really agree that the company can't do anything, it's just that it doesn't want to.

I hate that the first thing they did is to cut wages. I hate that they were late with pay reviews. I hate that they broke their word on the pay raise. I hate that they lie to us. I hate that they are not giving ground on anything, but still insist to talk and talk and talk. Basically, they're not content with aggressively slashing my salary, they want me to like it too. Whatever I say, they shut down, and try to get me to say that under the circumstances there is nothing they can do. Of course there is something you can do, you can pay me fairly. I realise they are just middle management and scared of how my leaving will affect the project, I realise they are just following orders, but all of this is pretty frustrating.

I hate that if they slash my salary more, I might lose my visa, as it had a salary requirement attached. I hate that changing jobs now is a risk, as my potential new employer could give me a temp contract (standard practice) and fire me much easier than my current employer where I have an unlimited contract. In that case, I'd have to leave the country. I hate that fascists are in government and clamping down on immigrants.

Girlfriend works in the service industry. Boss claimed government aid when he didn't need to (he was ok in March, but he still took it). That means next month he doesn't get government aid, and he will need it. So he tells all staff that they are now working for the minimum hourly wage. Staff are helpless as nobody is hiring now. He didn't need to do this. But he can so he did.

I hear other stories as well. Most of them bad. I know companies are there to make a profit, but this is brutal. I feel helpless for the first time in my life. I feel frustrated at having done everything right, and still being in this situation.",2020-04-24 12:59:57

I do my job for the pay and benefits, but I don't enjoy frontend work and aim to transition to a Software Development role.

My fear is though: How hard is it to switch back after 2-3 years of ""management experience"" to a software engineering role without that people leadership aspect? What if I have the wish to switch back to the IC role? Does anyone have any experience with switching from engineering management back to IC?

  
My second question is: The company where I have an offer for is not very famous or known... assuming I want to switch companies after a few years is there less open positions for Engineering Managers in other companies than on the IC roles?

  
Any input or perspectives are much appreciated!

13qxe59,"Moving to a new country as a junior software engineer, is this a bad idea?","I am a software engineer(bachelor) and I have been working for around 7 months. I don't particularly like my current job is quite boring and I feel like I am not learning much.
This could be changing as they are put me mainly on my second project which focuses on backend programming using Symfony (is this a bad thing to start? I honestly enjoy it).
The people I work with are also very proud of me (the standard was set very low by my predecessor) and I am generally liked by both company and client. They don't ask me to do any overwork and the pay is nice.

Last month I had a mental breakdown and wrote my CV from the start and I applied to around 20 jobs and I have 5 interviews this week. 
All are from outside of my home country, which is Italy, as I want to move out to see the world 

I had an interview today and got an extremely positive feedback back from them, but I don't know if I'm rushing head first into a black hole.

Is moving out as a junior a bad idea? Should I wait a couple years? Should I still search for a new job if I feel like I am not improving a lot as a programmer even if the pay and the company are nice? Here I live with my parents and I am able to save more than 50% of my wage each month (which means I save around 800 euros) and the rest is just money I want to spend for stupid stuff (I don't pay rent, I help with the grocery with my tickets from work which add another extra 100 a month).

The offer I got today is for a job in Amsterdam and I don't know if it would be livable on a junior wage (I would have to go on site most days, so I can't really live in another city, but the company isn't in the city centre. I would obviously probably rent a room and not an apartment on my own) and when I was asked what my price range would be I said around 2.8 to 3k a month to which they didn't really bat an eye (did I shoot way too low? I don't think I'd be eligible for the 30% ruling like this)

Obviously it's not confirmed I'd be getting this job or any of the other ones, but I don't want to end up living in the worst part of a town because I wanted to move out when no one was rushing me.

Is there any EU countries you would avoid? I feel like Belgium is a bad one on a purely wage point of view (also had the worst interview experience of my life)",2023-05-24 20:54:19

136o9ve,How could i ease my future anxiety? (2.67 gpa Turkish student),"Hi, I am a sophomore computer science student in a pretty decent university (Bilkent Uni) with a gpa of 2.67 in Turkey. As with current dictatorship and low purchasing power for individuals in my country, my objective for the past couple of years was to escape this country. Sadly, after getting in this uni, my first two years were not good in academical sense. Thus i got a below 3 gpa. Although, i made 2 good projects and i feel like i am satisfactory in coding problems.

Coming to today, my days are gone by me having future anxiety all the time. Recently i am trying to land an intership but i cant get any answers at all after over 100 applications and that is not only it. I am a bit left behind in lectures this semester as well due to earthquake and other issues i had. But i cant study without thinking that i will allways be below those who have better gpa which study regularly. And i cant do projects or coding problems instead of studying without thinking i am doing something wrong and my gpa will be worse because of my actions. My biggest anxiety is that if i will be able to work in EU in the future.

My question is what should i need to be doing now? What will guarantee me to land a job in EU? What does it exactly need? I am awfully struggling for the past 2 years because i am lost. I was always a hardworking and curious individual but i am burning out. I am open to any suggestions or even a mentorship from one of you experienced people. Feel free to comment or PM me anything.

**About me.**

I worked for roughly six years as Python Engineer; I did web development, data engineering, and Machine Learning engineering.  I am working remotely as a Machine Learning Engineer in a US-based startup. The pay is well, but I am not growing as an Engineer since I am not working on challenging problems and I am the only developer in my team.

On top of my experience, I got a scholarship to complete a master's in the UK.  I did my master's in a low-tier university, let's say, the top 200. But I worked on an amazing project that helped me learn Natural Language Processing and Transformer models.  I am comfortable fine-tuning state-of-the-art language models such as Transformers to deliver results for any NLP task. The condition of this scholarship was to not apply for a graduate visa to stay in the UK. I need to go back home for at least one year.

yemt7u,recent graduate looking for advice,"bit of background: i am a 21 year old working in london who recently graduated with a 2:1 bachelors of computer science from a good university. 

i managed to find a entry job in a very small company that focuses on business intelligence software. i am currently a consultant working in support and i believe their plan is for me to transition into a full time consultant eventually once i become more familiar with the software so i can deliver training as well. 

my concern is that i am not sure that this is the right path for me and i am considering doing a bootcamp or a online course as a backup plan if i plan to move. i usually have a few hours of free time during work when support is quiet and i have been using this time for self study and browsing reddit. i consistently get advertised various bootcamps, online courses and certifications and i am considering dedicating at least a few hours a week towards one. cloud computing seems interesting and from my research it is a very strong field to pursue. i do enjoy certain aspects of coding but my ideal job would have maybe 30% of my time dedicated to it mixed with other tasks. 

it is recommended to stay at your first job for at least a year, i don’t mind the work i am doing and environment is pretty relaxed but i was hoping to be challenged a bit more while i am starting. the travel is okay and the pay is average for a starting role but these are minor nit-picks since i am so new. another small thing is that the next youngest person is 28 and i was hoping to meet more people through work, eg after work socials that you might get in a larger company

tldr: do i need to stay at my first job for the full year? have you done any online bootcamps or courses that you recommend ?",2022-10-27 08:53:13

I don't know a whole lot ab immigration but I can think of 2 possible routes:

1- apply for US jobs from Eng and get a company to sponsor me

2- get a job at a company here in London and after a year or 2 convince them to transfer me to their US main branch

vp5m7q,Perfect work life balance. How often does it come?,"Hi! Throwaway account cause I don’t want to be recognised. To start with: I’m an average developer (not bad, just lazy) with no crazy ambitions (I don’t care to get the best salary or be hired in the best company). 

I have a job in the UK with what I believe very good work life balance. I am a junior mobile developer with 1.5 YOE. I work around 1-3 hours per day during development  cycle and almost 0 (expect of short 1-2 meetings) when testing. There are times that I can spend few days in a row literally not opening IDE and doing something not work related. I work from home, so no one is checking on my hours. I don’t go extra mile. I do what I get assigned with. I work slower than my coworkers but not extremely slow. Task that is done by someone with similar YOE in 1 day, takes me 1.5-2 days. My company doesn’t complain and actually says that I do great job when we have performance reviews 🤷‍♂️ 

Now, the thing is that my salary is pretty low. Probably I earn what I deserve lol. However, I think to change company to boost my salary. I need more money for personal reasons. 

My question is: what are my chances to land a job that is so laidback, as my current, in the UK? Is it a matter of being junior in most companies? Is it natural that with mid level position this 1-3h work/day will end wherever I will go? Or I am just lucky to have such a WLB now, because it’s not common? 

Basically: what are my chances in the UK to do mediocre work, without going an extra mile on mid level position and going unnoticed doing so?

I can work very hard if I have to. I was previously know for being hard worker, but if someone gives me space to be lazy, I am lazy. I just like being lazy 😌

ulf7q5,[28F UK] Can I transition from self-employed long term project to regular work without a degree?,"So long story short, I've been programming since childhood and growing up I messed around in a lot of projects that ended up making me money. When I was 18, I hit upon something that ended up with a moderate following.

Starting as a hobby project, it made me enough money to live off of, but over time that gradually turned into me having to work the job of multiple people alone and it ended up consuming all of my time. Even with that, I enjoyed it and I was making enough money off of it (as such I didn't go to university etc, I have no degree).

Thing is, it's dying. Which isn't super surprising. I have enough money to last me maybe a year or two without it and even then it's still not dead, just not making as much as I originally did with it (despite still having to put in the same amount of work). But anyway, that's leading me to want to try and get a regular job for a while. I don't think I want to do the whole 12 hours a day including weekends anymore.

During this project, I had to write all of the code, create both 2d and 3d graphics (which I learned gradually over the past decade - got pretty good at it too), manage a team of 20-30 remote volunteers (it varied over the years, mostly USA based), handle all server administration etc alone, and just about anything else you can imagine. The scope of the things I had to do goes well beyond what you'd imagine for such a project. The project was a small online multiplayer game for a little context.

But the reason I'm concerned is obviously I have no degree and I've never had a ""normal"" job before. I've been making my own money since I was around 12 (although I probably shouldn't have been back then legally speaking), but I have never actually ""had a job"" doing anything as a result.

I don't think this is a super common situation but I guess I'm just asking does anyone have any advice? Should I enroll in a school or something? Like where do I go from here... I genuinely don't want to be self-employed anymore even if I could be (at least like I have been, it's been hell).

ok02im,Masters or go work full-time? Anxiety is crushing me,"Hey guys,

could really use your help on this one. My anxiety over this issue not letting me sleep well, I constantly think about it and haven't really eaten much in the past week.

In the fall of 2020 I moved to a smaller town in North Germany to study a master's degree in 50% entrepreneurship/50% CS. After a somewhat ""ok"" semester, I decided to drop out because it's not really what I want to pursue anymore (entrepreneurs don't need degrees and why would anyone studying entrepreneurship get hired at a company?).

Anyways here we are. I'm 25 with a very good BSc in Information Science/Business Informatics from an applied science uni in Munich. Not sure what the next step for me is.

On the one hand, I really like studying and learning new things, on the other hand, I feel like it's time to start working and make money. I would want to move anyway because my apartment is basically a stones' throw from a large and loud street.

Deciding between a Masters' degree in Applied CS and working as a software engineer.

The masters' degree would be 2 years with a year in Madrid (I always wanted to do an exchange year).

I also really want to work, but I feel like I lack the practical experience and wouldn't be able to get a job because while I have work experience, it's mostly in data analytics/business intelligence and strategic management – fields I wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole – I want to work in software engineering.

Honestly, I feel like my skills **are** sufficient to working a full-time position. But I have nothing to prove that.

I worked as a tutor for Java for first-year students, I have a couple of personal web app projects, but no professional experience. I'm a keen and fast learner and everything in the realm of computers I've taught myself. Even if the job requires Kotlin or Python, I think I could master it pretty quickly.

nnjsst,Remote work from third world countries (as a student),"I've been getting into game development (Unity/C#), and surprisingly, there's a really nice market for entry-level programmers. A lot of small studios can only pay 7\~15 dollars per hour, and thus have to hire people with very little experience. Or people from third world countries, who'd be more than willing to work remotely for those salaries.

These jobs can be extremely informal. You'll see job openings being advertised here on Reddit (check [r/GameDevClassifieds](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDevClassifieds/) and [r/INAT](https://www.reddit.com/r/INAT/)), and a good number of them don't even require you to sign a contract. For a junior programmer in a third world country, those are golden opportunities. Some offers go for as high as 20$/hour. With this salary, you can live like a sheikh. You land a ""sketchy, underpaid, informal job"" by American standards, and you're suddenly rich, earning 20x minimum wage.

I found a lot of these offers extremely approachable. Maybe I got lucky, but I got a nice opportunity with minimal experience. I'd get far into interviews without even being familiar with the tech. For how poorly the game dev scene is talked about, this seems way too good to be true.

And that brings me to my point: is this really just a gold mine for people in my position, or would the average SWE route be even better? Maybe that's just how computer science works in general, and if I were investing my time into learning, say, C# .NET backend, I'd be getting even more opportunities and way higher salaries. I'm sure this is the case for ""big boy jobs"", but once again, this is a ""cs student with 1 YOE"" kind of deal. The bar is veeeery low for these gamedev jobs, which is why I managed to get into it in the first place. Maybe it would be impossible to land such a job if I were in another field?

What do you guys think about this? Cause if I can get into a new field just as easily, and have even more of these intern-esque job opportunities, that'd be amazing. Or maybe I can aim straight for the more professional jobs. I don't think I wanna be a game dev after I graduate, so a more standard SWE job would work better in my CV. Please share your thoughts, and thanks a lot in advance!",2021-05-29 09:29:48

iiqap6,"[UK] Should I go to the Uni of Sussex, wait another year for a top 5-20, or skip Uni entirely?","I'm a 19 year old who spent a year retaking 2 A-Levels, learning programming and improving myself to be a better a worker, get better time management skills and so on. Covid made it so that I can't take those exams and go to Uni of Southampton this year which I had an offer for. I enjoy programming now and am at a decent level, and putting in any amount of work is not really a big issue to me, even on ""boring"" topics. I spent a lot of time meditating and working on myself to deal with previous issues of being unable to work hard without a lot of suffering and procrastination. I don't really mind hard work/uncomfortable situations now so I was wondering from a purely pragmatic point of view, what would be my best option in terms of building a high-earning career?

I have a place at Uni of Sussex (which is a top 30 or 40ish uni) for CompSci and AI through clearing but some have said the course is poor in some areas and the uni seems to be going down in rankings/quality and lowering entry requirements, so I'm not sure on the quality of it and the networking opportunities. However, I've heard a lot of the top Uk courses can be shoddy in areas too so I don't know how much this matters.

I could spend another year studying A-Levels which would take up barely any of my time and continue programming to potentially pick up some part time or full time dev work, and then go to a top 5-20 uni. Some people say going to these unis is important for getting a quality education and having better opportunities and some disagree, so I'm not sure on what to do.

Or I could go full time on self teaching and enter the field from there. I've heard people say they would have rather skipped uni and just tried to enter the field without a degree, so I'm not clear on if this is a viable option or not or just people talking in hindsight and not realising what the degree has done for them. I really don't mind putting in any of the work required to make the most of these choices and my main aim is to maximise my earnings for family reasons so let me know what you honestly think the best option would be, thanks.",2020-08-29 10:34:38

Where I stay good salary for seniors (normal jobs, not some elite jobs) net is about 79k. To get the same in Germany I would have to get 133k (lol) and in the UK 103k, those would be few elite jobs.

110o6vy,My boss asked me to build a metaverse,"In the end of 2019, I was working as an operations engineer, but when the pandemic hit early 2020, I saw an opportunity to learn something new. I was always interested in AI, networking, and building apps, so I took advantage of my free time and enrolled in a few online courses, including Udemy and Harvard's CS50, to learn the basics of programming.

By early 2022, my hard work paid off as I landed multiple job interviews, and I was offered a position as a junior developer at a company. My job was to maintain a web app, add new features, fix bugs, and help with the development of a yet-to-be-released mobile app.

A few weeks into the job, I learned that the senior developer was quitting, and I was scared because I had never worked as a software developer before. But I threw myself into the work, reading the codebase and learning as much as I could about Laravel and PHP. To my surprise, I was able to implement new features and impress my boss.

Recently, my boss approached me about working on a metaverse project, but I'm not sure if that's something I want to take on. I'm still a junior developer and I don't want to take on more than I can handle. I'm not sure what to do, should I quit my job or try to find a way to explain my concerns to my boss?",2023-02-12 19:37:24

Those countries seem to pay better than Europe (not much tho), and with much lower taxes

I met a person who moved from Amsterdam to Singapore sometime ago, but I lost contact so I have no clue how it goes

Does anyone have any experience with those countries? Is it easier to make money and build wealth than in Europe? How about social life and settling in (this is to expats in Europe)?

I know that Dubai has this bad reputation of being soulless, which tbh, sounds like a vague nonsense criticism (what does it even mean lol?)

Hong Kong might be unstable politically right now, not sure how much and how it affects the daily life

Singapore seems to be the most English-speaking one, and so far is the one that I'm most interested

The pay difference between America and Europe is HUGE  , and i cannot believe why is that explain me please.

It is like 2,5 k a month and let me say that i would be a king  with that wage in my country lol, like not king but  my life would be quite comfortable.Whats more the 30K wage is only for seniors most of the time in Europe ,how is that possible??  


On the other side, we got the US citizens making 60k  at lowest  STARTING salary with being a junior ,  
Why is that?? Is there like something that  their  rent and their all in all living is way much higher in those areas that's why they  have that much of a bigger salary?    (i am sure in the sillicon valley it is but other then that idk..)  


Would you say that getting a US remote job   would be a perfect idea if you want to make good money and also living in europe??

My wife and I are web developers from Morocco. Given our aspirations, we're considering relocating to Europe and are keen on understanding the intricacies and real-life experiences associated with such a move.  
  
Here are a few specific topics I'm curious about:  
  
1. Job Search and Visa Process: How was your experience searching for a job in Europe from a non-EU country? Was it challenging to secure a visa? Were companies willing to sponsor you?  
  
2. Junior Developers:  I understand that many companies hire senior developers from abroad, but are there any junior developers here who've successfully found jobs in the EU?  
  
3. Remote Work: Once in Europe, were you able to work remotely? We'd love to settle in a small town.   
4. Tax: Were there any legal or tax challenges with this setup?  
  
5. Language Barriers: How crucial was it for you to know the native language of the country you moved to? Were there any challenges in daily life or at work due to language?  
  
I'd love to hear about your experiences, the good and the bad. It would help provide some clarity and guidance as my spouse and I consider this significant move. Thank you in advance!

158hyfj,How are remote crypto devs outside the US greeting paid obscene amounts ?,"I am from a third world country. I was researching the web3 space and found out my country's crypto Bros only hype that up because the space offers remote jobs and developers get paid $$ in USDC tokens. The pay is also very good as they are getting US salaries in my country(which amounts to a lot) 

I am aware that Web3, Blockchain etc are just overhyped tech having no real use right now. NFTs are a straightup scam. But these things do get you paid.(and paid very good according to my country's standards)

So, is there a catch to these salaries because no serious developer wants to get into these ? Why is everyone chasing FAANG when you can make a quick buck here ? Why don't serious developers want to get into these ?

Also, the only way they are getting devs for US salaries is because there is a shortage of developers in USA who want to get into this space. Why ? Why don't USA devs want to get into Web3 stuff ? 

I am posting it here because I wanted to know what European devs think about salaries in crypto space. Apparently they pay US salaries worldwide and pay quiet well. Why are developers in general not getting into it despite the pay being good ?",2023-07-24 17:59:20

I am Sicilian born, American raised. I am 28 years old and contemplating my big move next year to either the UK or Italy (yes I speak both Italian and English (along with other languages) and have the right to live and work). I am a front end dev and college student working towards full stack.

  
I have read every post and forum possible of people saying do not go to Italy to work as a software engineer. The pay sucks, the work hours suck, the job market sucks, etc. BUT the people and food are good. This I know. While the UK has a better job market but the weather is worse. I think what is conflicting me is where I belong and what the better life may be. I am not entirely sure anyone here can give me the ""right"" answer but in hopes someone might say something that might lead me in the right direction to find my answer.

  
Italy to me is...romantic. I have spent a lot of time in both places but nothing is sweeter to me than the culture of my Sicilian and Italian people. From the music to the food to the language, our catholic church, landscape, and so much more.  
The reason I like the UK or even contemplating it is because I know I will make more money, I can go wild camping in Scotland and England, I am more guaranteed to find work after Uni, and life just seems to be more stable in many ways.

  
I am torn. Do I follow my heart or do I flow with the world and live better in the UK? They both have best qualities but as my mother always said, life in Sicily and Italy is VERY hard. I am seeking happiness but to which I will choose only seems to be more difficult because when weighing my options, it is a fully balanced scale. All my family is deceased and I have no friends so nothing is tying me down to one place or another.

During the 2 years,

- I trained for a challenge but I failed it as the pandemic ruined my training plan
- I represented my country in a world championship for a sport, however I didn't return with an outstanding result there
- I got another job in my desired industry, but I couldn't pass probation
- I started my company but my business didn't take off
- I made a few market-first websites which demonstrate my skills, and they are listed as a separate section in my CV. However, none of them have a revenue model. They are also in a niche which has a very small market - the reason that my products are market-first.

Now I want a job. I have submitted dozens of applications, and recruiters are giving me calls as my CV has the appropriate skills, however I am having a hard time explaining my current gap as my plan to make some CV-worthy achievements in my gap didn't work out.

Only for a very few roles my CV has been selected by the agent for submission to the client and I haven't even got an interview yet for half a month already since I started looking for jobs.

x29onq,[UK] How to accelerate my career progression?,"(This is not meant to be a humblebrag post or anything like that, just an honest description of my current situation, so please don't take it the wrong way)

Here is my situation. I graduated from university with a mathematics degree at the beginning of this year, and I started my first junior developer position around 6 months ago.

The thing is, I have already been programming as a hobby for 10 years and I have a portfolio of projects going back to 2015, so I already know a lot of stuff that myself and my coworkers are not expected to have any knowledge of ().

I often hear my coworkers asking really basic questions (e.g. what does ""scope of a variable"" mean, what is an abstract class, what does ""git branch"" do, etc.) and see them writing messy, untested code (think 1000 line classes with dozens of functions relating to lots of different things that should all be separated), and I cannot help but feel that I should not really be in a junior position.

So I guess my question is pretty broad. What should I be doing in this situation in order to get a job that is appropriate for my actual skill level? How should I try and get potential employers to recognise that I am not a ""beginner"" developer?",2022-08-31 10:05:50

I've been into webdev for the past 6ish years, I'm mostly into React/JS/Node and was mostly working in frontend. Although been wearing multiple hats when the need arises. Recently, I've been thinking of finding job in EU. Honestly, I have no idea what should I do. I've been seeing job listings in Stackoverflow and applying to a couple of jobs. What I need help in is,

&#x200B;

1. Will EU companies provide visa sponsorship and help relocate someone from India?
2. What would be their expectations skill wise?
3. what will the general interview process will be?
4. In India, mostly the notice is 2 to 3 months. Although we can, to some extent get relieved in a week or two based on our relationship with our reporting manager. So, would EU companies be tolerant enough to wait for, say a month or 45 days?
5. I care for work life balance. so will it be optimal to get into a startup vs mid/big companies?
6. Finally, In India there is a huge difference between Service based(consultancy style) companies vs Product (SaaS) companies. The main difference is the latter pays more and the work/life balance is good compared to former where its ""always on standby"" kind of life. Does such difference exist in EU?

phvgc7,How easy to relocate & get a job with 15+ yrs of experience profile from outside EU,"Hello everyone

I feel I am asking the question pretty late from career-years point of view. So, let me start from the beginning to give an idea how the thought triggered.

About me: With 15+ yrs of experience currently I am working in Bangalore, India as data architect in one of the worlds biggest Commodity trading organization. In all these years, I have extensively travelled across continents & interacted with clients/customers of different cultures. However, thoughts never crossed my mind to relocate outside of my country.

In late 2019, a discussion started regarding a position in Netherlands & I was asked if I would be interested. I discussed the same with my wife & we both started exploring the idea of relocating. But, before this could take off, Covid situation hit. Understandably, the whole idea was kept on hold from the organization side. We waited patiently the whole of last year & this year too for the management to come back on the offer. But, as of now there is no news and now it looks like that the position may have been closed.

However in the meantime, we both started to feel kind of interested & intrigued to see how the life could be settling in an EU country. So rather than waiting for my employer to give the opportunity, we are thinking why not try to find a job by ourselves?

And this is where I need your help to understand & assess how much feasible it is with my current condition.

About my wife & we as people: My wife works in software dev for telecom/networking products like 4G, 5G stacks etc. Her employer is okay for her to work remotely. We both are financially sound, no kid. We are not very outgoing people but enjoy travelling to remote places & have a small circle of friends.

So please go ahead & shower some advice, some idea. Any criticism is also welcome!!

Edit1: Some updates regarding my job profile, to give better idea

1. I am involved in designing/developing products/solutions related to big data applications in the market of Commodity trading, e-sourcing with focus on data-architecting the product
2. Have experience in consulting  customers in the similar domain, managing teams across globes to achieve the goals. Quite comfortable with cross-functional activities involving techo-functional discussions. 

Edit2 : About my wife's position. Thanks for pointing out the cumbersome tax issue. Our plan is that initially she can move with current job working as remote & then look for a job there, which we feel will be easier than finding a fresh one from India.

Thanks!!",2021-09-04 17:09:32

I have 3 offers at hand and need help choosing between the same. There are several factors to consider and I have limited knowledge about long term impacts.

1) **Company**: Market Maker / Prop Trading (HQ in Amsterdam)

**Role**: Quant Researcher

**Location**: Amsterdam, Netherlands

**Compensation**: $91k base + 30k signing + 60k performance based bonus

&#x200B;

2) **Company**: Cloud Data Management startup (HQ in Palo Alto)

**Role**: Software Engineer

**Location**: Bangalore, India

**Compensation**: $39k base (+10% target bonus) + 4k signing + 37k stock over 4 years (current pre-IPO valuation, expected to increase)

&#x200B;

3) **Company**: Search FAANG

**Role**: Software Engineer

**Location**: Bangalore, India

**Compensation**: $23k base (+15% target bonus) + 2k signing + 50k stock over 4 years

&#x200B;

I need help comparing based on these factors:-

1. **Career Path:** What does an ideal trajectory look like in both roles? Is it a good idea to get into a quant role straight from uni? Does it restrict my options compared to a SWE role? Can I go back to a SWE role after a quant role? Does a quant role open up other directions like trader?
2. **Location:** I would ideally want to work abroad for some 7-8 years, save up, and return back to India. Would I better off joining the FAANG/startup in India and trying to move to the US (internally or otherwise)?
3. **Compensation:** How does FAANG SWE (say in the US) compare against the quant role in terms of compensation over 7-8 years? Also, the tax rate in Amsterdam is around 50%, though I was told there is currently a rule for expats which brings the rate down to around 36% (does anyone know about this?). Comparatively, it's about 31% in India.
4. **Work Life Balance.** Possibility of undertaking side activities.

Other Points about the quant role: There is a non-compete agreement that might come into effect if I try to move to a direct competitor. Also, there are restrictions on  Personal Investment Transactions.",2020-12-16 19:10:03

18zww2s,Advice needed: How to make a career switch in Germany (35 artist/educator w. family),"Hey there! 

Just thought to get some input and advice because I'm wondering how I can switch careers and get into a good IT position in Germany (moving from Berlin to Jena this summer).

&#x200B;

Background: 

35y/o, married, 3 kids (10,6,3)

Art Degree from a states university in Germany (painting, Sculpting),

Freelanced for 2 years as an illustrator and webdesigner (html/css).

3 Years work at a school and earning a degree as an educator. ;-)

I had a job after that in the social field where in the course of one month I became the right hand of the manager.  My job was to create excel sheets for investments, data management and so on. I left the company because I did the managers job but they were not willing to pay me for that. ( I was hired as an educator there ...lol!)

Since 01-2023 I'm working at a small company for social work. And again I'm being respected for my management talents but they don't have a specific role for that in the company.

&#x200B;

Self-assesment:

I have strong social skills, superficial technical knowledge of some tools and infrastructure and am able to create workflows and process guidelines to increase productivity. I'm a fast and passionate learner.

Often times people gave me a leading role even if I didn't seek it. If I accepted that role I performed really well.

I really am an artist/tech guy and always worked on scripts to make my life easier on mac as well as on windows, created workflows that could be used in production (Illustration, 3D), did some very minor stuff in python (small scripts in blender, some bugfixes), I'm quite proficient in html and css but didn't code anything else really...except some game logic with visual scripting tools.   
From a computer science standpoint that all might sound very laughable...

I never really got into programming and don't think I will ever be outstanding at it. But I can absolutely imagine to manage processes related to that and coordinate people and tasks while understanding the important technical aspects. I love IT and almost all of my friends ended up in this field (doc. computer science, physicist, nixos developer, sysadmin, electrical engineering..). I never felt left behind by them in terms of analytical and logical capabilities and stay up to date with these topics because of them.

&#x200B;

Advice needed:

Anyone having suggestions on how to get into a job where I can play to my strenghts, possibly start without getting another degree first and which is paid better then in the social field?... because I'm tired of it!

&#x200B;

My plan right now:

I thought to apply for a dual studies in business informatics because that seems to be fitting and I can earn money while studying.

Maybe someone knows a better way for me to proceed? Any feedback and tips are appreciated.

ybwp3l,What kind of job in these fields are almost paid-to-do-nothing ?,"I currently work as nightshift receptionnist in a Hotel, best job I ever did in my life.

No stress, no heavy lifting, (almost) no customers, 3 or 4 days off depending on the week, paid to do nothing at least 50% of the shift, and my pay is between 1600€ and 2000€ per month (in France minimum wage is around 1300€)

I know that this is a job I can't do forever because nightshift is bad for the health so I'm looking to find what I could do next.

I know that office jobs where people don't really have much work to do exists, that even some that are on work from home jobs have the luxury to do other stuff instead of having to pretend to work. Some people have the audacity to complain about not having mucj to do when people like me that worked slave wage jobs would just DREAM to have such privilege.

So basically, my question is this : What kind of jobs like that exists ?

I'm trying to find some names but considering how most of these offices jobs have bullshit names that makes it impossible to know what they're really doing, it's a bit hard to know where I should head myself to for my apprenticeship.",2022-10-23 23:54:52

Has anybody gone through a similar situation? What would you feel would be a reasonable figure in terms of hourly rate -> hourly wage conversion?

1atuqpg,Is my manager right about the conditions for my promotion?,"Hi,

I am a non EU citizen, currently working as a mid level software engineer at a German company on EU Blue card work permit.

I want to transition to a senior developer from my mid level developer position and discussed this with my manager to which we came up with a development plan to put this into process and achieve it with progressive feedback.

So far, all the requirements of the development are pretty standard when it comes to being a senior developer and I have been fulfilling them upto 80%. The remaining 20% seems to be the problem, at least to me when my manager states his scope of the requirement that he wants me to fullfill.

I have been working alone on a product, handling cross team dependencies, writing concepts, developing and testing code, managing operations, planning releases, making architectural decisions. So far, the 80% of our agreed upon development plan to senior developer is being fulfilled here.

Now comes the interesting part where my manager told me that I need to work simultaneously on another product where I would work in a team to deliver features in addition to the one main product that I am already working on. Ok, good, not a problem I can do that as well if it means getting a promotion.

But here comes the catch. My manager said that working in a team for me is also a checkpoint to reach my senior developer role to demonstrate that I can work in a team. I would have been okay with this as well but it irks me because there is a guy in our team who has always been working alone on a single product from the very beginning and he had transition from a mid level developer to a senior developer by working alone.

My manager says he is a special case but never really explains why. Moreover, I am confused why the metrics of me being able to work in a team should count as an important checkpoint to being a senior developer when there is clearly an exception existing in his team in spite of handling an entire new product by myself as well. Though this happened before I joined this team, but nonetheless it still stands and everyone is ware of it.

Am I wrong to think that my manager is being negatively biased towards me or is it something normal to expect?

Should I continue to fulfil my manager's whimsicles irrespective of its validity?",2024-02-18 14:01:18
1ao6ve8,Should I resign before being laid off ?,"I live and work in an EU country, I haven't graduated yet but only 2 classes left for my CS degree.  
  
My first experience lasted 9 months, I quit it few months ago. I was a junior but almost led a big brand's app, boss was toxic so I resigned, as did other coworkers.  
  
Since money wasn't a problem for me, I didn't want to work for a few months. I started applying for jobs 2 months ago and found this remote job, brand is big but technical team is small. The first month was great, they had major performance issues in the app and that piqued my interest, so I gave it 100%, I worked directly with the boss of the company, he was a former tech guy and a good leader, I solved many many problems of the project.  
  
My salary was set for 2023 and HR promised me we will adjust it by the end of 2024's first month. I reminded them last week and we had a decent talk, this week I saw my new salary in my bank account and mailed them back about I am glad with the company but not glad with the salary since it's almost same and the company adjusts salaries only once a year. My performance shows I am good enough and I have shown some metrics. HR didn't respond to my mail for 5 days and her assistant called me 3 days ago and asked for the code of the monitor they gave me, saying that they had lost the paper and they don't wanna give the wrong code to someone else etc. I think this is an excuse.  
  
On the other hand, the company merges with another company, expands projects etc. The new team doesn't know our tech stack but got access to the codes this week and I gave them a good training 2 days ago even tho I am new at project. After this, boss had a 1:1 meeting with me, it was actually meant to review my algorithm for a task he gave me; 450 lines of messy code function to fix, I worked on it for 6 hours and only finished 3/4 of it. So, boss told me he thinks my performance is slow. I was in shock, then I also gave a feedback as I am new at project and the tasks confuses me since I am given tasks by him before finishing others. He isn't toxic, he said he cares my career so he gave me these tasks, he will leave the tech part of project soon so he wants me to understand the code when merging with the new team. It was an okay talking, we didn't review the code because of no time, next day I finished the task and communicated him about details, he replied me hours later.  
  
So my motivation dropped after my performance not being appreciated, hr not responding my salary expectation etc. I think I will be laid off soon, there will be no notice as companies in my country have trial sessions for 2 months but the exit code of my insurance by this company will show that I have been laid off if a recruiter checks my background in the future, so I'm worried, should I leave tomorrow ( Monday ) ?",2024-02-11 12:28:05

Do they ask for official documents to check whether you worked in those companies for a period stated on your cv or do they just ask you to give a contact name in those companies and ask that person? Also do they ask for your copy of your diploma? 

I am asking these questions because I was contacted by a recruiter from Netherlands and he works for a staffing and recruiting company. They provide talent for their customers. If they hire me, in the first year my salary will be paid by the recruting company. He said after the first year, the company I work for will offer me a permanent contract. He also said that if I change the dates of education and employement history on my cv, I will have a higher chance of finding a job. I attended a master's degree but didn't complete. After that I had to spend almost a year to find a job. I have 3.5 yoe. He is suggesting adding those years to my previous employement so that I will have 5+ yoe.

So, if I do this what are the chances of being caught? Who is gonna do background check? The recruting company or the company I will be working for?

Based on my initial findings, salaries for senior developers in Poland seem to hover around 5,000 euros per month. Similarly, countries such as Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine appear to offer salary ranges in proximity.  
  
However, I've encountered challenges in gathering accurate salary information for countries like Greece, Serbia, and Turkey. My aim is to gain a better understanding of potential salary differences within Europe. Despite the general notion of Western vs. Eastern salaries, it seems to me that there might not be substantial variance among Eastern European countries.

Your expertise will undoubtedly contribute to a more comprehensive overview, aiding both myself and fellow researchers in making informed decisions.

wrjmuy,UK vs Germany,"Hello redditors, 

I want to start by aplogising for asking the same question, but I do need some perspective and have been unable to come with a proper conclusion on this question.

I am a 22M, Indian, with a bachelors degree in electrical engineering and 1 year experience in embedded systems.

 I will be going for my masters and then move to work in these countries.  I had some questions about the software developer opportunities and the market for junior devs or devs in general: 

1. Is one country better than the other in terms of software development and jobs in that field?   
2. Is the language barrier a big factor to consider for Germany,  even in the field of software development? 
3. Are all the good jobs concentrated in London for the UK? In that same tone, for Germany, is it all concentrated in Berlin?  
4. Is it hard to find sponsors in the UK, especially in the case off junior devs?
5. Is the pay significantly better in one place over the other? 

In my mind, the pros for the UK are: 

1. 1 year for masters, so that means I enter into the job market asap, so the savings I would make on free tuition are countered by this. 
2. No language barrier as I do speak fluent english.
3. Quite a large Indian community
4. taxes are lower apparently?

Cons are: 

1. Fees are relatively exp
2. I would need sponsorship
3. NHS is a mess? 
4. London has good jobs but is super exp
5. Junior dev jobs are hard to find? 

For Germany, the pros in my mind are: 

1. Lower tuition
2. healthcare is good
3. EU access
4. Slightly lower CoL

Cons are: 

1. Language barrier
2. People  are apparently cold and rude? 
3. Not a big indian community
4. Higher taxes.

Since COVID the number of people I've seen whom say they prefer working form home seems quite large. I'm not one of them, so this has piqued my interest. But there's also the (hidden?) cost of WfH. 
A good WfH setup incurs extra costs like a room (increased mortgage/rent), furniture, heating, amenities like coffee etc. and maybe even buying your own devices.

I'd like to poll the following question:

*Do you prefer to work from home, and if so do you factor in additional costs?*

edit: Please regard partial WfH as WfH as well. I think that in terms of motivation, accounting for the cost factor would not really be impacted all that much in either case.

Also, a little clarification on the option: ""I don't factor in extra costs associated with this"" means that you haven't considered the extra cost at all.

I've seen €80k offers per year gross. €100-€120k for the most senior position.That's ridiculously low.

Is that why these countries are so backwards with technologies, mostly relying on (outdated ?) car industry ? Because anyone will simply for in the West, where they pay better ?

1bsuypv,How is Work-Life Balance in Germany?,"Hi everyone,  
I'm an international computer science student in Texas, graduating in 2027. Here in the USA, we have the OPT program for STEM majors that allows us to work 3 years after graduation. I'm planning to work those 3 years, move to Germany to study for my master's degree, work whilst pursuing my degree, and even immigrate after. I've heard that Germany has very good work-life balance, especially compared to the USA. It's very possible to work 9-3 (from 9 to 15) and have plenty of free time later in the day, and I'm very into that, I don't like the hustle the US has. I used to learn German 2 years ago having an A1.2 - A2.1 level. It's probably so much less now, but I believe I can get it back real quick. So, what do you think about my situation? Is the work-life balance as good as they say? Deutschen, what do you think about foreign colleagues, neighbors, and friends with kein deutsch? Is it even worth it? Dankeschon :D",2024-04-01 04:51:24

uifwsn,I hate corporate world.,"Im in the last year of a subcollege 2 years degree where we basically going to a company and do internship. Ive been in several ones and always switched after a couple months (for some reason I survived and my school dealt with this psyco behavior of mine pretty well) because I just felt either extreme anxious or depressed.

I just cannot focus at an office. Constant undirect interruptions by people doing random shit so my brain has to focus on it always break my flow state. What I most like of programming is the deep theoretical almost mystical mental state that sucks any chance of having negative thoughts out of you. I become what I do and I like that, because I dont have to deal with the abstract idea of my existence (and my many problems).

But I cannot find any company that suits me. All of them want to enslave me and force me to work at their miserable offices. I hate that. We have to save the planet guys and whats the point on losing 2 hours a day on transit? Fuck them all. They are just irrational fascist scum. Their failure at quantifiying my input on the job is not my problem.

What can I do to be happy? I know my fate is to be a programmer since I saw it on a shrooms experience (also had  very nice dream showing my future as a digital nomad) but the universe keeps mocking me. Where are those cool companies accepting the way you are so you can give your best? Its so tiring to see how the world wants to tie and standarize your soul, I want them to just die and leave me alone.",2022-05-04 20:34:23

19anwcc,IMC vs Palantir,"Heyo!

I poked a similar question on r/csMajors, but thought I’d ask here as well, as I’m EU based.

So as part of my degree, I’m expected to do a six month placement over the spring and summer. I’ve secured (and already signed) a placement offer with Palantir in London, and secured an internship offer (and in the process of enquiring to whether a placement is possible) with IMC.

There are pros and cons to each, and I’m trying to think about what to decide.

The argument for Palantir is it’s in London, and I prefer London. The WLB is much more chill, the company is very keen on having me, I’ve been assigned a good team and I would be in the same city as my currently long-distance girlfriend who would be interning at another HFT in London for the summer. Otherwise I would have to continue being long-distance otherwise as she’d come to London while I’d leave London for Amsterdam.

The argument for IMC is the pay for the internship is better, and the new grad offer as well as compensation potential is significantly better than Palantir. I also prefer working on trading systems than data engineering work.

All in all, an interesting experience. If anybody has any advice, I’d really appreciate it, as I’d appreciate another set of eyes over this decision while I’m still coming down from the high of getting these offers (never make an important decision if you’re very sad or very happy!).",2024-01-19 17:03:45

16gp2ei,Career path for money,"I've started working at a company. I have access to a lot of learning resources and I think it's to moment to choose what my future in tech will be. What excites me the most is the process of learning new thing (so I don't have a particular passion beyond that, I just like pretty much everything) but my main purpose is earning money and FIRE (15/20years) or at least FI in 10 years. I write this post to ask you about what field should I get in (or what technologies I should focus on the most in order to achieve what I want)
My questions are:

1) Which field do you recommend to get the high salaries in EU/UK (I thought about HFT or quant, but I don't know any company that hires in EU in the second one, if you do and think it's a valuable information for me, let me know)
2) Which technologies do you suggest working on? rn I have access to lots of resources and I'm practically a blank paper to write on in the way I need for my future purposes. Actually I'm mainly working with Spring and Cloud technologies. Thought about getting AWS cloud practitioner certification but to be honest I'm very open to your suggestions about that.
3) After BS I can move from my birthplace and work while pursuing a MS. Is there any particular university in EU which is prestiguous in this field or could help me land a high-paying job (beyond, hopefully, the 2+ years of experience I will gain with cloud technologies)
4) I will be grateful to any European that went to US if he shares his story (you can DM me if you want)
5) Any other suggestion will be accepted open-hearteadly. But consider that, as I mentioned before, my purpose it's just money. Money to enjoy what really matters for me in life. I'm really open to whatever you suggest me, share stories, give me tips. I'm very young and I value a lot what more experienced people (most of this sub) say.

Was in interview with Google and Aws in summer 2022, got rejected after 1 month of waiting.
Wonder if they just rejected me due to the ""bad times"" ?


Hello fellow CSes 👋
Year ago, summer 2022 I was doing few interviews with Amazon AWS and Google Germany.

At first, I was approached by Google recruiter and thought it's a joke, but ended up in live codding interview (July 2022).
It wasn't bad, it took me some time to get a track though - I was very excited and anxious, could not concentrate.
After I got a groove I've solved 3 tasks, didn't finished codding for the 3rd one due to lack of the time.
Interviewer seemed pretty happy.
I was waiting for some time, longer than usually (recruiter confirmed that).

Meanwhile I decided to try AWS, passed codding assignments went into the live codding.
On interview I was better than the first time with Google, identified that we need a DFS algorithm and coded it. Final stage was a little bit messy, I got confused with backtracking part and it set me off a bit.
I wasn't happy with the outcome, but task was solved.

In about a month after the interview Google sent me ""sorry, not this time"" email.
In September I got the same email from AWS.

I was upset and angry. My friends in both Google Germany and aws Germany told me not to worry muxh and to try again next year, they've seen such cases before .

In approx. a month after my rejections news stared to surfacing that Amazon and Google frozen the hire.
Later, as all we know, both companies laid off tens of thousands of people. Including few of my friends.
At the moment - none of them are hiring in Germany, so - so second chance for me.

Something cracked inside me after rejections and I was very depressed for over 6 months.

Since then I can't let it go: was I rejected because I wasn't worthy or I was trying in wrong and bad times?

Maybe you guys have some insides to share, will be much appreciated 🙏",2023-09-06 12:08:55

**Little about myself-**

I come from a decent background. Childhood was very very tough financially. Saw very bad days. Doing good nowadays as a software engineer in MNC.

I am a 2020 CS graduate. I did no coding throughout college(Wanted to join the army). Covid happened. Dad got into an accident a day before lockdown. We got the surgery done somehow during the lockdown. We all got stuck into enormous debt. I gave up my dream of the army, joined a company, and gave my whole salary since July 2020 to my family(I am really proud of it, but I do feel bad and left out when my friends are buying new stuff, enjoy and all. I can't even spend 1$ without thinking twice.).   
**Conclusion** \- Time was tough but part of life. learned a lot. No complaints.

&#x200B;

Present day - I am working as a full-stack developer.  Happy with job. A few months back I started learning about DSA(Leetcode) and all. Struggling with time management. Started **Grind75** 2 weeks back. I want to shift abroad(USA, Canada, or the UK). Moving forward I have 2 options-

* Grind DSA get a job and shift. Basically VISA sponsorship.
* Apply for masters(USA, Canada, or the UK). Grind DSA while doing a part-time job. Get an internship in FAANG/startup. Get a PPO.

I am more inclined towards the master's option because I'll get time to study, work on fundamentals, and maybe enjoy college life this time since I have some money saved and I can work part-time. I am confident that I'll get a scholarship in USA/Canada. Other than that I'll take a loan which I can pay off once I am working full time.

But on the other hand, getting a job directly will make everything so much easy. But I am not confident about that I can do that(Maybe I should STFU and start grinding).

I am legit confused!!!! One way or another I am traveling abroad next year. I want to earn enough to be able to sleep without worrying about money. I am just 23 and was not ready for debt.

v0boc6,(MS in US and then job in US) vs (job in an international company in Europe and then internal transfer to US),"Hey everyone, Need some advice on this 🙏🏼

# Background

I am a software developer from India. I have around 3 years of experience. I earn around Rs 50L(64,356 $) per year. 40L is base + 5L (min yearly bonus) + 5L stock(Public company)

# What I want to do

Make a huge impact on the world. Work with the finest people of the industry. And at the same time explore and enjoy life. I believe I can reach this goal by working in US/Europe. The higher preference is for the US though. Because of the fast-paced, thrilling and cosmopolitan culture.

# Approaches for reaching my goal

**Do MS in the US and get a job there then:**  
Pros:

* Will get a job in US. 99% Sure.
* Extremely High Salary.
* Will surely have a huge impact on the world. The quality of the work would be amazing. People around me would be super smart.

Cons:

* None of the streams in MS excites me. I am not interested in ML/Data Science like most. What I really enjoy is quality Software Development. Doing MS in general Computer Science seems kind of stupid. Because I would be effectively doing MS just for the sake of it. And not really learning something that I want to. (I don't want to learn any thing from MS branches)
* Effort in getting VISA and maintaining VISA and all.
* Doing MS just to get entry into US seems very stupid. I don't think it has any other benefits for progression in Software Development Career. Are there?
* As MS will be 2 years long. There would be opportunity cost loss. Also, I need to pay shit loads of money for MS colleges 🤑 Taking a loan and paying back and shit.

**Job in an international company in Europe and then internal transfer to the US:**  
Pros:

* Will get to make a huge impact on the world. Maybe not as big as in the US.
* Will get to explore the amazing and diverse culture of Europe 😍
* They have amazing respect for work-life balance.

Cons:

* The pay in Europe wouldn't be that high. Even from the Indian standards (Correct me if I am wrong here) Though, I don't care that much about money. Just need sufficient money.
* Significant effort. I would need to find an internal company that wants to hire me in Europe by sponsoring my VISA. And which also has internal tranfer to US procedure. Like Google, Spotify, Apple, Uber. Also, I need to ensure the quality of work is also great.
* Not a sure shot approach to get into US: What if even after getting into international companies. Things don't work out. I am not able to get an internal transfer to US.

I know I have made a lot of assumptions here. Please correct me if you find anything off. Btw Are there any career counsellors for these types of dilemmas?",2022-05-29 13:54:34

1. Going to a top Uni in the UK in 2023, aged 24, graduating 27. (Oxbridge, Imperial, UCL, Kings. I prefer to live in London so it will probably be one of the London ones) and doing the normal stuff of getting my degree, doing internships and grinding leetcode.
2. Theres also a minor chance I could go to a less popular Russell group uni in 2022, graduating at 26.
3. Just sitting down right now and learning independently, maybe doing a bootcamp. Trying to get my first job. 

**What do you think is the better option for me?**

I'm currently leaning towards the top uni route, but the time it takes is a slight concern. So I have some further questions.

Would I generally be a better dev coming out of uni in 2026 with internships, or self teaching, getting employment within the next 2 years, and having 2YOE in 2026?

Am I limiting my career in any way further down the line by not getting a degree?

While I do believe that this can be reached in poland, I think it would take a few years of experience, maybe 3 and a gross salary of about 20k pln (or 4.2k eur). I dont mind about increasing my standard of life, but I would like at least to increase my saving per month as I want to be able to retire early. 

Considering all of that, do you have any advice? Do you think I would reach my goals faster by moving to a different country or by staying in poland? My first ideas are Germany (probably Berlin) or Netherlands, but I am open to ideas",2022-11-03 20:18:24

u5l2hh,Is it viable to go to imperial for a 3 year BEng on loan?,"I'll be paying for my own education so as to not reduce my parents retirement savings, and i figure I'll need a loan for around £150k.
Is it possible to pay this off in around 7-8 years, considering the cost of living in London, and the salaries available?
From what i can tell this seems unlikely, but perhaps there is more insight to be gained on here.
My other option is Purdue in the US, which seems more viable as the col of Indiana is lower, and salaries higher.
any response is appreciated, thanks!

e20h7z,What is your employment status when working remotely for an international company?,"If you are hired remotely by an international company, do you need to register as self-employed for tax purposes? That was my experience when I worked for an American company while living in Spain. I needed to register as self-employed in Spain in order to pay my taxes here, where I am a tax resident (I live more than 183 days of the year).   


In fact, if the company that hires you contracts an employer of record, they can co-employ you. This means that you have an employee status and benefit from local employment laws. Providing paid holidays, maternity pay, local bank holidays and the security of being an employee should something happen, like, you get sick or lose your job.   


This doesn't seem to be discussed when working remotely, so we wrote an article about it: [https://euremotejobs.com/remote-working-are-you-an-employee-or-self-employed/](https://euremotejobs.com/remote-working-are-you-an-employee-or-self-employed/)

1b0w3wm,Universities that mislabel their department names? for future employers,"tl;dr; How do i explain to a future employer that my studies were 100% CS but titled as Informatics?

Hello, i've seen many universities in my country and, in general, some around Europe, name their computer science deparments as informatics and vice versa. My studies there were heavily math  (for cs at least) and theoretical cs focused, also with low level courses like computer architecture or compilers. (i can write a list of courses in comments if anyone needs it).  
Anyway the title on my degree is School of Sciences - Informatics (+ down on the page Informatics and Telecommunications on a smaller font because when i graduated it changed. Ive never been taught any relevant course).  
To the point: Im still a junior-mid level trying to change from a swe job to a more specialized one (graphics related) and some, not many, employers ask for certifications, degrees etc.  The thing is i'm afraid of others seeing Informatics in the title and judge it quickly (as people seem to do) compared to a Computer Science title therefore -> deny of application. How do i approach this matter? Do i not care at all? I dont think id like to try to explain that ""well the name is like this but my studies are like this.. etc. "", people dont like it i think. Do i sent the analytical version of my studies with all courses listed?

Claimer: i do not have insecurity about a title,  i am self confident about my skills/knowledge  
sorry if long post, first time,

Thank you in advance.

Edit: I googled older results of the department of when i got in, and it was still labeled as Department of Computer Science, i dont know why they changed it later without changing the curriculum.",2024-02-26 23:16:26

I'd greatly appreciate any advice or insights here.I left my current job as a software developer so my partner could move closer to their family in Northern Scandinavia. The plan was that I was going to work remotely and they would pickup a local job. Fast forward two years, now I am struggling to find a remote job with my (5 years of) experience.

Clearly my main mistake was not checking the job market again before executing my plans, but the plan is in motion now. Where should I go from here?

&#x200B;

* My tech stack is broad, I have been employed in R&D where I was expected to play a lot of roles. My CV includes technologies in embedded to machine vision, and all the way to full-stack web development. I'm not sure HR or recruiters know what to do with me, or maybe they think I'm BS and padding my CV. **Should I narrow down my CV to be just web-development since that is what is hiring remote at the moment?**
* My web development experience, appears to be irrelevant now, somewhat last decade. I know Python/Flask/jQuery, but everyone is asking for node.js/React. **Maybe there is a cert I can pickup, but I am also not sure how relevant these bootcamps are any more? Would this be an effective use of time before applying for more jobs?**
* I could a try a lateral career move, and try to market myself as a remote Application Engineer, or Support Engineer. **What other roles do you think a former software dev might be able to do?**
* I could learn the local language fast (\~600 hours) and get a job locally as a laborer. Personally I am not opposed to this, work is work. **How difficult do you think this transition would be? Would I be looked down on for being a former office worker?**

As we all know, it’s not exactly easy to get into the US for work. After doing my research for a couple of hours, I have filtered my options of being able to work in the US down to this.

1. Simply apply to jobs where the company sponsors for a H1B- visa.

2. Apply to, preferably, any of the FAANG companies in Ireland for example, work for some time, and then try to get a transfer to the US.

Google, for example, lets people with a finished degree, apply to internships as long as it’s within 12 month of graduating.

3. The US embassy states that they dedicate a certain number of work (or permanent, not sure) visas for each country, for those with a advanced degree (masters or Phd for example)

(BONUS! I know some of you will probably say this one, but it is not so viable for me, as I will already have a masters at that point)

4. Studying a masters in the US. Not sure why people recommend this one. As this means you have a F1 visa and that only applies to studies. After your studies are finished, you have to leave the US, as I understand it.

I guess I just want to get some opinions on this. Are they reasonable? Is it likely to get a transfer for example?

What are your thoughts? Maybe you have had similar thoughts and came up with other options? Or you are a EU- citizen currently working in the US, and can tell about your experience?


Figured it would be more relevant to post this here as most of us are EU- citizens I would assume.",2022-08-27 17:12:23

w7xm18,Tips for getting a Frontend Dev job [4 YOE] in Munich from Oslo.,"Hi, I am a frontend developer working with all things React, TS, Node, etc. I have decided to move to Munich after working a while in Oslo. However I am struggling to get responses from online job applications (mostly go to LinkedIn, search for openings there, and then directly apply on the company site). Any tips to increase my chances of landing an interview? If it helps - I am male, have a Non-European name, and am a person of color (all visible in my CV picture). Also I have a few questions:

\- Is it common in Germany for companies to ask for Gross salary on the application form? I put 80K in most cases. Is it low/high?

\- Cover letters a thing in Munich for tech jobs? Also, upload referrals while applying or only when the company asks?

\- What are some mid to large size companies in Munich that are known to hire a lot of people?

\- I will have to apply for the EU blue card if I get an offer, but I don't need sponsorship for it. How do I best navigate this question in applications and interviews without hurting my chances?

\- Does anyone here want to do a referral? I can do an interview with you if you want to assess my skills before providing a referral. Just DM me or ask me to DM you on this post.",2022-07-25 19:18:32

vkza0u,The best way to negotiate salary,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Long explanation, TL;DR basically: do I ask for compound “raise” (maybe around 50%) when wanting a raise and the company also wants to promote me and really really likes me, or just a “single raise” since promotion?

Have been working as a senior software engineer for almost two years as a full-time freelancer for a company. Doing things above senior’s plate and performing better than most team members and it is acknowledged. Feeling like a “raise” would be in order due to that, and also inflation. 

Reviews have been glowing and managers etc directly say they don’t want to let go and hint that they’d “do anything.” Partially also because it is almost impossible to hire senior level people (or at least keep them) due to stack and project. Management, people, etc are not a problem - people just don’t want to work with “old stuff.”

The company would now like to take me in as a salaried employee instead of freelancer and move to principal software engineer role since that’s more in line of what I already do. They didn’t give any hints about salary, they said I should tell them what would make me comfortable to change, and that they understand the differences freelancing and employee have. The principal role isn’t available unless employed, which is understandable - rarely do companies take higher level people “from outside.”

Now the question is about the compensation. Obviously “ask more than you’d like to get” etc, but I of course don’t want to seem entirely unreasonable or “so you want to keep me, then pay a lot” kind of a gal (even if they already know me from this time period). But since it would be transition to employee, promotion, etc all at once, and since I feel my current compensation (while it is not low by any means) would need adjustment, do I just calculate compound adjustment and give them quite a high number?

So if I feel like I would deserve a 20% “adjustment” even if I keep my current position, do I then go for “well if you want me as a principal and you really like me that means I’d like 40-50% raise”?

More background: the company is European daughter of a USA company, so they aren’t unfamiliar with higher salaries obviously. People from Europe and USA work together in projects and teams so it’s not in any way clear cut salary-wise per team or project. They can’t hire seniors since uninteresting project/stack, as mentioned. 

All this would hint strongly that I can lay down quite a high number and see what they say. They can always counter and I don’t think they’d be taking it as rude or extortion, but I don’t know how the higher-ups who actually decide would think.

The salary would be very high locally, but not in USA terms. This would be a problem for a junior/mid, but we are talking about principal and 20 years of experience with glowing reviews from each team member and managers etc. I don’t know what others get in these positions, or even higher, and current compensation already is high for what I know compared to Scandinavia, Germany etc so they aren’t going for the “let’s do things cheap in cheapest corner of Europe and pay just local salaries” things. 

So just go with basically 50% raise if transitioning and being promoted? Or even more? And if they say no and counter with lower, rather go with “I’ll take a raise for performance and keep working as a freelancer as senior”? There’s not really any benefits in being an employee, the opposite usually here.",2022-06-26 07:34:15

I graduated with a Masters in Computer Science (from a prestigious uni) with a focus on Computer Vision & Deep Learning.

I wanted to ask how important the size or image of a company is for future employers. Because there are some lesser known/unknown companies with open positions that fit my skills. I'm just unsure whether this would be disadvantageous when changing the job in 2-3 years to a more prestigious company. Or should I not worry because it's hard enough to land a job in this area?  
And what about consulting companies? Would tech companies avoid me when I apply to them in the future because of the prejudice of consultants not being that development focused.

v5pzex,4 years university in my CV,"After a lot of thinking I am really not a fan of University. I don’t know much about university in other countries but in austrian universities we have to pick courses pass them and we basically can set up our plans the way we want.

So I am really interested in studying and working part time. First as an intern and then get a job in a small austrian company(I don’t think it will boom nor is it a new company so I can’t really call this a startup).

I have quite a lot of job offers because of my past internship where I made a lot of contacts.But I am scared this might be problematic if my employer sees that I finished my degree in 4 years?

rnj6sj,Salary expectation - Berlin - Software Engineer,"Hello everyone,

So I had a couple interviews with a company in Berlin for a position as Software Engineer; for the next step we will be discussing salary expectations but I am rather confused about what could be my expectations as I never worked in Germany.

Let me give you some context:

- 3.5 years experience as a consultant, developing backend applications with Java 8/11 + Spring (mostly)

- no CS degree, although I have studied Computer Engineering for 1 year, then I have done a Bootcamp. I have recently resumed my studies

- As a consultant, I have specialized in Java + Spring but I have been exposed to a lot (really a lot) of different frameworks depending on the clients' projects, as well as some Front End but mostly for small enhancements and using legacy frameworks

Since I got to the point where I have to discuss what would eventually be my salary, I have done some research on Glassdoor and sites as such but they do show very different results (some say 40k€ others 70k€ for the same experience).

Do you have any insight on what Software Engineers with the same experience earn in Berlin?  Personally I would do that even only for the experience of living/working abroad but I wouldn't want to be paid much below the average.

P.s.: the job posting said 45k€+",2021-12-24 09:59:23

As the title says, I'm thinking of dropping out of the Master's program I am currently enrolled in, which is in Software Engineering.

The reason is that I did not graduate with a CS Bachelor's, but in Economics, which you might have guessed that it does not have much in common with CS. About a month ago, reality hit, and I realized that I cannot keep up the pace.

I took a look at the curriculum of the Business Information Systems program and it seems a lot more manageable.

I already work as a developer, **and my goal long-term is to move abroad to Germany** (I currently live in Eastern Europe), to work as a developer.

ktunyg,Reconversion to software engineering in my early 30’s,"Hello r/cscareerquestionsEU !

I plan to start a professional reconversion towards software engineering. I am french, have a bachelor's degree in web development and 5 years of experience in digital marketing, but I'm not thriving in this field. I was supposed to go to a engineering school but life decided otherwise back then and I ended up in digital marketing.

The idea would be to do a master's degree in software engineering in the fall of 2022, which would allow me to graduate in 2024 at the age of 29. Upfront, I plan to prepare myself for one year with MOOCs, books and personal projects that would allow me to be both up to speed to enter the master's program and to confirm that I like the field.

So far, I looked at the [Software Engineering Master](https://elite-se.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/) by the Technical University Munich (TUM).

Salary wise, I know it’s a bit of a gamble. My current field salaries are correct, and would definitely be higher if I just continue this path, as I’d be around 10y of experience by the time I’d be a junior software developer.

Do you have any advice or inputs regarding my goals and planning ?",2021-01-09 17:05:28
kn7h4d,Which Fachhochschulen are good for an ML Masters?,"**About me:**

I am finishing my Computer Science BS from a public American University in February. I have a research paper published and another in review in the field of object detection, one in the next year in Reinforcement Learning and one in supervised audio classification. I have plenty of research experience. I am working remotely as a research assistant at a German Fachhochschule and simultaneously studying hard to get a C1 certificate to get my Masters in Informatik (focusing on ML) at a German FH.

**My Question:**

I am confident that I have secured a spot at the Uni I am remotely working with but it is perhaps not the best FH for ML. I would ideally apply to multiple. The problem is there are so many damn FHs (I have narrowed it down to FH as opposed to Uni or Hochschule because I believe I will like the more practical approach). Can anyone point me in the right direction of narrowing my search down?

I would like FHs with a good CS program in German and a heavy focus on ML. Also preferably in a fun city (but somewhere I will be able to speak German a lot i.e. not Berlin).

i5txz1,How should I plan for my move when I have a strong preference in a particular city?,"I'm a web developer with 3 years of experience in backend. I'm planning to move to the UK next year. I am thinking that I should rent an apartment first or finding a job first, and [people all think that I should find a job first](https://www.quora.com/Should-I-first-get-a-job-then-look-for-an-apartment-near-my-job-or-should-I-first-get-an-apartment-then-look-for-a-job-near-my-apartment).

However, I have questions on how I can find a job first without a fixed accommodation. I think that means I will need to stay in a hostel / Airbnb first until I get a job offer and that will cost money, and it will mean I take more time to settle into my desired lifestyle. On my LinkedIn now I haven't received any interest from the recruiters in UK despite that I have entered my preference. I'm only receiving interest from the APAC region which I have 0 interest in.

I'll probably apply for a visa (which doesn't require job sponsorship) in January and move in March or April. I have a very strong preference on Bournemouth (or Dover) for my initial half a year (until September), but I'm more open to other coastal cities (such as Edinburgh) afterwards. I want to avoid London because the cost of living is too high (a single-flat apartment rent is £2k per month in the city centre).

1. Should I rent a flat in my preferred city first contrary to popular advice?
2. Is it easy to find a job in Bournemouth?
3. Will my career growth be limited if I only stay in Bournemouth (or other small cities)? Which coastal city in the UK has the greatest chance to grow my career?
4. If my desire is just to stay in Bournemouth for half a year then move away (e.g. to Edinburgh), how should I find a job there to make a living temporarily?",2020-08-08 05:47:18

Recently they contacted me again to know if I was still available because they want count with me to start next 01/06/2020.

But **if this COVID situation gets worse and my country enters in quarantine/shutdown (idk the term in english sorry) i will not start** and stay in the same position that i was 2 months ago.


# Opportunity B

- Is a new opportunity that **let's me start even remotely so I am sure I will start.** 
- It offers +50 Eur monthly than the Opportunity A.
- It has more career pogression and is more stable, they are looking to stay with me in the long term.
- It's nearer to my home.

dx4ngs,Should I negotiate an already amazing graduate offer?,"# Background

I'm a fresh graduate. I got a bunch of offers in Switzerland. Most of them are already above average market rate for my position and experience level.

&#x200B;

I also got one other offer which is:

* 30% higher salary than all the other ones 
* Amazing career growth and learning opportunity
* I would really love to work in that company (compared to other companies)
* All the other benefits are amazing as well

***

# Why I want more money

I would like a higher salary to **pay back my student loans as quickly as possible** (\~40.000 EUR).

&#x200B;

Otherwise the offer is already pretty perfect.

* I could argue that I want to pay back my loans or I could say that I would like relocation support.
* In this company, the salary is most likely constrained by pay bands.
* I can't really leverage with any other offer, because other offers are way below this one.

&#x200B;

***

# I'm not sure if I should take the risk and ask for more money

**I'm afraid that they will rescind my offer if I try to ask for more.**

This was a very competitive programme to get into. Only a handful of candidates were chosen. During the last interview stage, there were multiple other candidates who would be next in line and would gladly take my spot.

I've read the advice: [https://haseebq.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation/](https://haseebq.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation/) and other similar articles. Not sure if that advice applies to Switzerland and fresh graduates.

&#x200B;

***

# Summary and questions

I got an already very high salary offer. It's amazing in every regard. I just want more money if possible to pay back my loans quicker.

**I really want to work in this job. I definitely don't want to lose this opportunity.**

&#x200B;

1. Is it worth asking for more and risk offer getting withdrawn?
2. What should I ask for: signing bonus, higher salary, bonus, stock, more vacation, etc?

You're about to go to university in a remote, tiny town in Denmark to take a BSc in SWE and graduate at the age of 31. What do you do after that?","I feel like I have absolutely no clue what I want to do long-term. I'm single, no kids, family ties pretty weak. I speak English, Swedish, Russian, Polish, Serbian. I feel like I want to live in Canada/US because I want to live in a fully English-speaking country and raise a family there. Sweden and Denmark on the other hand are really good for doing that.

Europe isn't so great for salaries, though. In Denmark, the taxes are crazy and it's really hard to build wealth other than flipping one's homestead but that, of course, locks me into Denmark for many, many years. After university, I could go back to Sweden where the standards of living are good and the capital gains tax is close to nothing; I could essentially keep all of my assets in liquids so that I remain portable. But if I stayed here and worked for a few years, suddenly I'm 35+ and moving isn't so easy. Or starting a family.

I'm considering taking a master's in Canada right after my bachelor's and settling there. Then eventually looking for work in the US after a few years. The thing is that I'll just be wasting years on education, it'll suck to be a fresh masters graduate at 34 and looking for entry level roles.

At the moment i am doing my bachelors in CS at a german university (a TU9 uni). Like many of my peers i am very interested in getting a job at a FAANG in the US (or Swiss). 

One way to get such a job is to go to a reputable uni (ivy league or eth for example) which helps getting into the junior pipeline for FAANG. However i do not think that i am able to go to such a university for my masters because my performance is not good enough...

I think a good path for me would be to take a FAANG job in germany and then to transfer to another office (preferably in the US) but I heard that is not easy.

At the moment i am studying leetcode, sytem design and do side projects which leads to my question: How can I enhance my chances of getting a job at a FAANG (during and after my studies) without a very reputable uni on my CV?

TLDR: How to get a FAANG job without a very reputable uni or extremely good grades as a junior

The job requirements really matched my profile, and guess what, I applied and got to the next round. The most surprising thing was that the company didn't believe in leetcode style challenges and they rather gave a practical backend API project in Go for me to implement.

I was pumped, I wrote the cleanest code I've ever written, I justified my usage of libraries, I documented things neatly with a README, I really loved that I made a few smart decisions, tested it well including unit testing as well as load testing.

I submitted the project last Friday. In the meanwhile, I spoke to the employee there on Linkedin who reviewed my code and sent it to his boss who was the head who made the decisions. The employee really liked my code and told he gave really positive comments to his boss about it and we both started to build a rapport on a personal level which was really cool since he was also a Non EU immigrant.

Today, I got the response from the founder that they aren't going to be proceeding with me. I thought I almost made it, because this was the only round that they had, and the site mentioned that crossing this round almost confirms my role.

I realize that this has been discussed on this subreddit before but I am an American software developer with about 2 years of experience exploring the possibility of moving to Europe for work (preference for Germany). I do not speak any language that would be relevant to working in the EU. I am single, 24 and do not have any dependents. I am also fully aware that I would be taking a significant paycut if I were to go from the US to Europe.

I work across the full stack, with two prior roles at startups. However, I would say I am primarily front-end focused (React and Typescript) but also have decent experience with Node.js and working with databases. I am currently unemployed after leaving a role last month and am actively on the job hunt here in the US.

I have visited Berlin twice and have spent a total of a month there between the two visits and really enjoy the city. In general, I think my preference would be for Germany though I am definitely not set on that. I have visited Munich, Vienna and Amsterdam too and also enjoyed those cities. I have lived in a couple different countries over the course of my life so I am not terribly concerned or intimidated by the thought of moving and integrating as I have done similar things before (I do know it can be difficult and am excited about experiencing/learning a new culture/language).

I am also slightly concerned about my bachelor’s degree. It is from a very good university here in the US but it is in “human computer interaction” and not in CS or engineering. I did do a lot of programming during my degree and have a minor in CS. Is my degree something that might hinder my chances of getting a job?If anyone has any tips, similar stories or advice about my situation I would love to hear them!

166avno,"Where to apply for a master's degree if I'm a Software Engineer? UK, Czech Republic or maybe Austria?","First I would like to tell about me in 2-3 words  
About me:  
\- Age: 20  
\- Current occupation: Software Engineer with 2 years of experience.  
\- Education: Spent 4 years pursuing a bachelor's degree in my home country.  
I'm considering moving to Europe for further studies. I recently discovered a language school that prepares students to study in Czech Republic, Austria, or Slovakia. A key advantage is that education in Czech Republic and Slovakia becomes free if you know their languages, whereas this isn't the case in Austria. Additionally, I've heard that universities in Czech Republic assist students in finding jobs during their studies in IT, which is a significant benefit.  
If I lean towards UK, I'd likely try to move there within a year. However, for Austria, Czech Republic, or Slovakia, the timeline is longer. I'd first have to spend a year in my country, then move there and learn their language for one year, and only then would I enroll in a university. So I will basically get my Masters degree in 4 years.  
Lifestyle & Cultural Fit:  
It's very important to me that the country I choose to study in aligns with my values and offers a comfortable environment. I've heard concerning reports about racism in UK, making me question if it's the right place for me. Moreover, even if I were to get a Master's degree in UK, relocating to a country like Czech Republic afterward might be challenging due to the language barrier.  
Connections & Networking:  
I'm curious about the strength of connections in each country. While I believe UK offers stronger networking opportunities, I'm weighing the risks and rewards of pursuing education there versus Czech Republic. It's worth noting that Czech Republic is becoming increasingly international, attracting many students from across Europe.  
My family recommends UK. However, I have reservations:  
\- My English proficiency is at a B2 level, and I'm not confident about getting into top-tier universities.  
\- UK education seems costly, and I'm uncertain about my chances of being accepted as an international student.  
The language school claims that the Czech Republic excels in IT education. But, there's external pressure from friends and relatives advocating for the UK. Historically and culturally, I feel closer to countries that had associations with the USSR, like the Czech Republic or Slovakia. My desire is to live and build a future in whichever country I ultimately choose for my education, as it's important to me to deeply integrate and connect with the place I'm studying.  
I've heard of people who studied in France and Germany and faced challenges beyond just academics. Many struggled to integrate due to language barriers, local attitudes towards newcomers, and even difficulty in finding jobs. The inability to establish a strong social circle or make new friends compounded these issues. This lack of social connection can be particularly tough when trying to adapt to a new environment, where stepping out, socializing, and building relationships are crucial for mental and emotional well-being.  
About my Interests:  
 I want to tell you more about myself. I like playing video games, reading books, and listening to music. By profession, I'm a Software Engineer (programmer), and I truly love what I do. One of my hobbies is creating new things: I make video games, telegram bots, and tools. I also do research. Programming is more than just a job for me; it's something that I'm interested in, just like my work in programming.  
While I'm usually an introverted person, I've been enjoying hanging out with new friends lately. This is why it's so important to me to be in a place with kind and welcoming people. I want to make friends, spend time with them, and feel connected, socialized. I don’t want to feel left out or different just because I come from another country. I hope to find a place where I can connect with others and truly feel at home.  


What I need:  
\- Insight into the pros and cons of studying and living in these countries.  
\- Feedback on current perceptions of UK. I've always admired its history and culture, especially from the 19th and 20th centuries, but recent news gives me pause.  
For me, a welcoming and friendly environment is very important. While I value high-quality education, I'm willing to consider universities that may not be top-tier if they are in places where I'd feel more at home. Notably, Czech Republic has shown promising statistics in IT and software engineering education, which aligns with my field of interest.

161xqe1,How hard is it to get hired?,"Im going to be applying to jobs in Germany in the next 3 or so years, just looking at what to expect so i can somewhat prepare beforehand. I will have around 3-4 years experience, speak german fluently and as my primary language, and have german citizenship. I do not have a degree that is recognized in germany (its from a 2 year program from community college in america).

So my question is how hard should it be for me to get interviews, assuming the market isnt completely trash by then. Also how are interviews conducted? In the US they focus heavily on leetcode. I hear that leetcode isnt really used in germany. I am also ok with applying to jobs i am over qualified for if possible, but i might just get overlooked due to being over qualified. I am not picky about pay as long as it pays rent, i have side income too. Any advice is welcome!",2023-08-26 15:10:07
161as5l,Midlife career crisis in EU immigrant,"An immigrant in an EU country. (sorry, can't be more specific)

I have a 2-decade career long development experience: C++, C#, Objective C, Java, Swift, NodeJS. I am working as mobile dev. Employed in a fintech firm - pay is quite less for my age, but work-life balance is great.

I feel underpaid and undervalued. I am truly looking for a transformational change in the career, but not really sure where to go.

The areas I am considering are: Product Management/Ownership, Cloud (I have AWS cert with some hobby project experience), or anything else where I get to try my communication skills  (written ones, especially)

I am not much of a heavy meeting/collaboration guy but I make up for it in research, requirement analysis and critical thinking. However, in my current role, they seem to be undervalued + ignored.

I am not a management guy. Newer Programming languages no longer excite me. I have enough cloud skills to deploy simple web/backend applications. I know I can grow in it to be able to deliver it anywhere.

But at this combination of mid-life age and primary level skills, no company will hire me for newer programming language or cloud - at least in the current demographic. It's a saturation point - I am sure about that.

Meanwhile, I just got this LinkedIn 1-month free trial and I want to maximise my learning towards something that will truly help me - via a potential job/role switch. 

Could someone suggest something that is best bang for the buck (ahem, free trial :))? 

But the bigger question is, is such a career transition truly feasible? What areas/factors am I missing?",2023-08-25 20:49:51
15i4nc4,Bachelor necessary?,"Hello, im currently a non-eu citizen studying a useless degree called International Relations in CZ, as to how i got into it, well u i was a naive 18 yr old, but now i have decided to shift my career into Data Science, but the thing is, i have two options 

Its either i continue here in CZ but i will just transfer to prague, or i continue to Spain, which is less uncertain. That is if i want to pursue and shift my bachelor.

Im really stressed because, i dont know if i want to break into this field if i would just go with this bachelor and self study and hopefully gain an internship which is hard, or just shift again, some people say its much better to do bachelors in computer science than being from nothing.

part of my issue is also funding, i dont want to burden my parents more (though i work part time at a good american IT company) by extending my university studies.

Cost-wise spain is the best option for me but given im a total flunk at math i dont know if i will pass the entrance examination, (university of valencia) so the university of life sciences in prague is a much safwr option for me, but wtf the accomodation prices in cz are insane.

Ultimately in the end, i plan to go to Spain as a pathway for a shortcut to eu citizenship (my country is a former colony).

But all in all i need to make the decision by this december or next march, because i will have to apply for the spanish visa from here in CZ.

Should i just finish my bachelor of IR ans get internships in data science or just pursue CS?

13pjuce,Cant decide between two job offers,"Hi there, first time posting here but badly need advice on two software engineering offers I was recently given. For context i currently live in Manchester (UK) as a software engineer and have about 9 months experience 

Job 1: Software Engineer at CERN (Switzerland), this is a 2 year contract possibly extended to 3 years based in Geneva. I would have to relocate but they offer a generous relocation package and good salary for the area (~5500 chf /month which is the median salary in Switzerland). I’d be working in a similar field as I do now with chances to seek out training in other areas while I’m there

Job 2: company in Manchester, offering more training opportunities as a trainee software engineer before promotion to mid-level. After initial training I would rotate around different teams focused on varying areas for several months until choosing which I wanted to join. The salary is ~20% above what I make now and I would be able to remain living where I am.

Obviously they are quite different offers, and although the training opportunities are exciting, I’m not sure if the chance to live abroad working for a few years while also gaining experience is more worthwhile?

- occasionally going out to eat/drink, but not often, I do like to cook. Perhaps once a week. I figure about 100CHF per outing?

- increase in cost of groceries, if any, compared to the Netherlands. Like, if I spend 100€ per week in AH, how much will it be in Migros?

- health insurance, with GP and accident cover. I figure about 400-500?

Im currently 2 months into my current job... However I'm not happy since my current company initially recruited me as a software developer, but at the moment I'm working as an infrastructure engineer. Most of my days I'm just dealing with Kubernetes, terraform and Azure. 

I understand that having kubernetes and terraform knowledge is very beneficial, especially for software developers as software developers with a bit of DevOps experience are very desired. 
But my passion is to code, and I do next to no coding in my job. 

I recently received a job offer for a company. My only concern is that this new company is VERY Microsoft solutions focused. They mostly only use in C#, .net and Azure. 
Infact they are so dependant on .net that their tech lead basically admitted to me during the interview that the company is currently in a bit of a panic since their main product is written in .net Framework and currently they are all just migrating their large monolithic product to .net core. 

They did assure me that if I take their job, I'll be spending nearly 80% of my time dealing with .net 

Is this a red flag? For a company to be so heavily dependent on just Microsoft solutions? 
Will taking this job limit my future prospects?",2022-12-09 11:37:12

I would like to discuss it with whoever is interested in learning more. Super scalable, super interesting space.

* Who we are? Two private equity professionals currently based in Milan, Italy. One has a background in real estate, the other in corporate private equity. We have left high-paying jobs in order to develop this product. The company I am leaving will also participate in the pre-seed. We each have 15+ years of experience in this space with exposure across fundraising, investing, regulatory, etc. More important, we both participated in building our current companies from scratch, so very comfortable with early stage operations.
* Where we stand? We are adding finishing touches to the deck and have developed a roadmap for the pre-seed stage. We've built a financial model for the business and unit economics look promising. We are interviewing potential product leads who we want to be part of the team from Day 1. He/she will have fintech experience which will complement our lack of product building experience.
* MVP? We have a plan for the MVP and for traction and we are trying to find a strong candidate to lead the engineering team as a co-founder. The challenge is our product is highly-regulated so we cannot just build it. I can elaborate more on this if needed.
* Funding? We plan to close a pre-seed round in October. We have already gotten the attention of VCs but we don't want to aggressively raise before we finalize the team composition.

So I had the ""genius"" idea of eliminating a 3 month job from my CV and Linkedin, and adding it to the next company.

Is this a bad idea?

Which countries do background checks? And do they do it in all companies, or some small companies do not bother?

*BONUS question*

Here is my full CV:

3 months -> 2 years -> 5 months (Current company)

But I got a new offer that allows me to be a Digital nomad, and raises my salary by 30%.

I am afraid if I accept it, it will cause irreversible damage to my career. Should I accept the offer, or strategically decline it, in order not to destroy my CV? Maybe wait 6 more months at least.

Or even, in the future, omit those 5 monts, and add it to the next company?",2022-07-19 23:26:16

v63xme,"Had 2 offers, made a wrong decision?","Hi everyone,

I'm a software engineer with < 3yoe and recently I was lucky enough to get two job offers:

1. a fairly well-known multinational in my home country (in the south of europe, where the tech scene is limited and not well paying)
2. an industry-leader multinational (not FAANG though) in Ireland, with a much more compelling tech scene

Factoring in the cost of living, the compensation was similar (just slightly higher in offer 2).

I'm still a junior engineer and at this stage I believe that the best course of action should be to make my CV as attractive as possible and to make diverse experiences, in order to put myself in a better position for the future; hence, offer #2 should have been the way to go.

However, I was very undecided and in the end I chickened out and I chose offer #1 to stay on the safe side. It has also to do with the fact that the Ireland is going through a severe housing crisis and because of this it would have been difficult to stay there on the long term.

Despite this, I still think that I should have chosen offer #2 instead and now I'm regretting my actions and I'm feeling like an idiot. 

I don't know if it could make sense to contact company #2 again and ask if they could extend again the offer, and if so then renege on company #1, but it seems to me a desperate plan and also quite unprofessional with regards to company #1... probably is better to stick with my decision, what to do you think?",2022-06-06 13:47:50

I'm a full-time employee in Berlin, who also has a freelancing side business (Kleinunternehmer, nebenberuflichen Tätigkeit als Freiberufler).

What risks would I be facing if I work more than that? Can it be circumvented?

I seek your advices !

I am 23 years old,  graduated with a Masters degree in finance, and I have around 3 years experience as Project coordinator (totally non related to development).

I currently earn around 15k euros per year after taxes, (Expat, living in Poland), and I just can't see any career path in front of me (working for a belgian customer, doing the same job as my belgian colleagues but getting paid half their salary since I work from Poland).

I have always loved being around computers,  and recently I have found an interest in development field (especially blockchain, smart contracts, etc,...) , but a lot of other stuff interests me aswell

I would love to radically change my working field, and I would like to learn to code, and be able to work more in the tech field.

Of course I would like to get a better salary, but I dont have any expectations, as I already earn a quite low salary, and it couldnt really be worse than now.

Now I dont have any development related diplomas, and I dont have any portfolio or experience with coding, and I would like to know if :

\-It is doable ? I have quite a lot of free time to learn

\-Do I need diplomas ? Should I quit my job and find a school ?

\-Where to start ? Any recommandations around specific websites to learn, MOOC to have, developing language that are/will be the most interesting to learn to be hired later ?

p85ecl,Tech consulting vs Software engineering,"I graduated from the university with Computer Science BSc last year, and I joined a big 4 company as a technology consultant. Most of my work is due diligence and writing reports about IT when someone wants to buy a given company. Analysing the architecture, product roadmap, technology stack, etc.

At first I was really excited about the opportunity because it combined technology and some strategy/management aspects. So I thought it would position me very well to become an IT manager/director after a few years. However, the work started to get boring after a few months and in practice I don't learn much except for learning how each company operates. Also, it's the management who conduct most meetings with the clients, so the exposure is not so significant either. The work is really high level, so no technical skills I could work on.

Moreover, it turns out the salary is good, but not spectacular, and usually I need to bill some overtime to get better money than software engineers with comparable experience. Except for directors' level and above, consulting's salaries in my company don't seem to be more than 10% higher than what you can get as an ordinary SWE at a similar level. And when I look at a mid-to-higher end of mid/senior developers salaries in the industry, it seems you could earn more developing code.

I hope you’re doing good. I’m an Asian working professional in Ireland working as a Research Assistant in the field of computer vision. I’m on a contract role here, so I’ve started to look around for jobs and am really exploring the scene in the EU.

To my assistance, it is pretty good with some amazing startups and local companies having their bases well set up in the countries like Germany, Netherlands or Spain. I’m kind of dozed about living in Ireland, and would prefer a country switch alongside a job one as well. To kickstart the whole thing, I’d prefer telling you guys a bit about myself. So I’ve done my masters from Cork, Ireland in Data Science and since completion I’ve been working as an RA at INSIGHT (Public Research Centre). I’ve worked as a Data Analyst for over an year back home and almost an year now as well. I’ve been mainly working in MLOps, Computer Vision and ML. 

Since you guys have a rough idea about the profile (I can send you my CV too), let’s focus on the job applications. I’ve been applying for similar roles in the Data Science field but haven’t had any luck with the same. Its either the company is unwilling to sponsor the visa or the profile which despite being a perfect match gets rejected. I know the companies face a hard time sponsoring someone over a national, but I am comfortable covering the cost of the process and I mention this too in my application, so I think this shouldn’t be an issue for the rejection. I really can’t wrap my head around it as to why my profile is getting constant rejections. I mostly apply in the Uk and Germany, but also apply in Denmark, Netherlands and Sweden. Do you guys have any suggestions or ideas that I might be missing? Something I should do otherwise? I really hope to secure a job before the year ends and shift soon. 

Please do assist me.

lneoe7,Should I drop out of high school?,"Some context:

I’m 18 years old and live in Denmark. I’m currently in high school and have 1.5 years left till I finish. I’m a self-taught software developer in my 3rd IT job. The one I have now is the first full-time one.

I am considering dropping out of high school. It’s not because it’s hard, I do alright and have decent grades. I just think I can teach myself more on my own. This is a fairly new thing I have been contemplating. The reason being that I just got my dream job at a startup. I work with extremely talented people and I am learning so much. I got the job based on the personal projects I have made. The job is full-time and remote, so I work around 7 hours every day after school, and some on weekends. I love that job and I feel extremely lucky for getting it. I am pretty good at time management, so I am able to balance school and work. I just don’t know if I want to. When I had part-time jobs, I had time to also advance my programming knowledge without it being related to work. I read books, went through online courses, and made projects with the sole purpose of learning. I am still learning a lot at my current job, but not deeper learning like I used to do, more just quick Google searches.

I imagine myself dropping out and spending all the time I am currently spending in high school learning on my own. I would be able to gather an insane amount of IT-related knowledge. I believe I have the self-motivation to make myself do that, and I really want to. The job I have now would definitely be able to support me financially.

But would I be foolish for throwing away a good high school education? Am I being impatient and should just wait the 1.5 years? What would future employers think if I don’t even have a high school education?

If I should choose solely based on what would make me a better software developer, I would drop out. If I should choose solely based on what would be the safest, I would stay in school.

What do I do?",2021-02-19 12:26:06

These jobs are typically hired by firms via headhunters. The best way to get noticed is with a good profile on LinkedIn. Usually, the recruiters reach you out if you hit certain keywords related to the job such as C++, Linux, Multithreading, Trading Systems Development, previous work experience in tech/quant finance roles, etc. You may also reach recruiters via LinkedIn InMails. Another way to get interviews is by applying to jobs on efinancial careers, LinkedIn Jobs, dice, etc. which are posted by the head hunters.

Most firms have no problem hiring software developers from junior to senior levels with no previous work experience in tech/quant finance roles as long as they have a strong relevant technical background. Tech Lead/Engineering Management roles are typically for people with a background in developing similar systems.

There are a variety of firms operating in this space such as — Hedge Funds, Quant Trading firms, Algo Trading firms, Prop Trading firms, Exchanges, Market Makers, Investment Banks, Brokerages, Trading Software/Analytics providers, etc. While the work for the software developer varies based on what the firm is doing, the underlying technical skills are very similar.

In addition to my question above, I keep trying to focus on one location, but I find it hard to choose one country. So, If you can help me learn more about the countries, that would be helpful 

Thanks in advance🙌🏻🙌🏻",2023-10-21 14:51:17
r271qk,Interview guaranteed as Oxbridge student?,"I am an early stage PhD in Machine Learning at Oxbridge and applied to several companies as SWE, ML engineer, ML researcher or quant researcher, e.g. Google, Microsoft, Hudson River Trading, Citadel etc.

I always assumed that being a PhD at Oxbridge would guarantee me at least an interview for an internship. However, I did not get a single positive response.

pcq8h6,"Finding work in EU by moving in first, finding job later","Hello all. I am a software developer based in Southeast Asia, and I'm contemplating furthering my career by finding work in Europe.

I have actually tried applying for jobs based in Europe even before the pandemic started, but sadly to no avail. And during the course of the pandemic, it seems the hiring criteria of most companies have been much more stringent such that no one would seem to entertain applications from outside the EU due to our current situation.

I still really want to move and work in Europe, particularly in UK/Norway/Switzerland/Sweden, etc you name it. Even prior to the pandemic, I've been considering this absurd idea of moving *temporarily* (maybe for a month or two) to an EU country of my preference and from there maybe start applying. Maybe I can do a part-time/freelance job in the meantime to make ends meet until a job opportunity comes my way.

Given our current pandemic situation and EU's economic climate (?), what do you think of the risks? Is it worth taking? Will it make much difference to the recruiters if I'm based in the EU already?

I do know it will be **very risky and costly** (because I will be shouldering all visa and ticket-related costs, not to mention the disparity of the cost of living in EU), but I wanna hear your thoughts if there are less-risky alternatives to my idea (aside from continuing to apply for jobs that have relocation packages).

nlb3w4,Berlin Or Barcelona?,"I'm an Indian Software Developer (React and JavaScript, 5+ YOE) working at Bangalore startup. I want to move to Europe and I was thinking to applying to startups at Berlin or Barcelona?

Weather, Quality of Life, Clubbing scene, Racism and Salary are the issues I look for in a city. I'm single.

Berlin-  has very good clubbing scene but I'm bit skeptical about this as I'm Indian and bouncers there may not let me in most of the times. I was in Berlin one time and I was not let in one time and other time they let me in. Also looks like people in Germany are  colder than Spaniards. Weather is cold for winter. Bonus point for Berlin is it is closer to Prague, one of my favorite cities of Europe.

Barcelona- It ticks off every thing I look for but getting a high salary like 60k euros there is very tough if not impossible for an Indian applying from India. I was in Barcelona and I enjoyed the city way better than Berlin. But I know visiting a city is different than living in a city.

I also speak Portuguese which is neither Spanish or German. Learning a language is not an issue for me.

 I don't want to settle in either cities for long term, so no future worries about citizenship.

So the options for me are:

1. Take up a  decent paying job in Berlin see if I like it for one year if not move to Barcelona.
2. Take up a low paying job in Barcelona and if I don't feel satisfied with the job in one year move to Berlin.

I thought of sharing something cool and fun with my fellow coders. A few years ago I created a speech-to-text bot for Discord,, initially designed to control my own music bot (at the time), but then people started using it to communicate better with their deaf gaming friends in real-time.This is the project: [https://github.com/inevolin/DiscordEarsBot](https://github.com/inevolin/DiscordEarsBot) (the music bot is in another repo which needs a big update).

The STT methods include offline and online techniques, so you get to choose the quality/performance you want. But with the raise in AI and ML jobs, this can serve as a great framework to build projects to stand out in your interviews:

\- Use this technology in another tool (Slack, Zoom, phone, browser, ...)  
\- Use this technology to build voice-based games (maybe for handicapped kids)  
\- Improve the STT results by adding another ML model to correct the text  
\- Create a fun bot that ""talks back"" or tells jokes based on the conversation

fc7wy2,MS in CS from NYU Tandon vs a mediocre job in London?,"Hi,

**My Background**

I'm a software developer from India (25 years) with about 2.5 years of experience. I was a CS major from a good university in India. I have worked in some really good asian startups over the years (think something like GRAB etc). Also for me personally, getting interviews at the top tier tech companies is easy. I'm in process with Facebook right now. I just need to practice more leetcode etc.

**My Situation**

I always wanted to move out of India for personal reasons. I am gay and wanted to experience a better life abroad, not sure if this is a good idea / dream to have ... but this is what I have always longed for since I was a teenager.

So to do this, I had applied for graduate schools last year. Since my application was not a strong one (mediocre GPA, no research experience, and no strong academic letters of recommendations) I received all rejects from the top 30 CS programs last year. I applied again this year with little hope to some average CS programs, and simultaneously began my job hunt abroad.

***The result of this was*** : I got an offer from NYU Tandon for MS CS (I am waiting for UIUC MCS, Boston U MS CS, Wisconsin PMP). I also got an offer from a mid sized London startup who are offering me 60k pounds / year. I had said yes to the London gig 2 weeks ago (back then I did not have the NYU offer, I just received it last week).

**Cons of Both Options**

**1) London**

\> Only 60k pounds /year. People are saying I have been lowballed a lot

\> Another startup (I dont want another startup experience), not well received on glassdoor

\> The hiring manager explicitly said that the job will be kind of boring (API integrations)

\> The title is \`Ruby Developer\`

**1) NYU Tandon**

\> Mediocore CS program

\> I am from a prestigious CS program in India, but when I look at the admits group at NYU Tandon, I dont see my potential peers to be \`exceptional\`. I know this is kind of harsh, but I feel peers do matter a lot in graduate school

\> I have to take loans to finance my education. I will be using up ALL my life savings till now, borrow some money from my parents AND take a loan of approx 40k USD. (I do have some scholarship from the school (8k per year))

\> My dream is to work in companies like Netflix, Facebook, Google in the silicon valley, have a resume which I am proud of, live happily without fearing for my future etc. I have not seen many Tandon people going to many top tier companies. But I may be wrong as most Tandon people dont write ""Tandon"" on LinkedIN and hide behind ""NYU""

I feel that both my options currently arent very strong. I know I am desperate to get out of India because I am gay, but should I end up sacrificing my entire career over it? Or do you think I am overthinking to much?

To sum up, my questions are :

1. Is the investment in a Master's degree from NYU Tandon worth it?
2. Is it a better option to just move to London, and work in a mediocre startup and grind my way to the top (or switch to some other company)
3. NYU Tandon, offers a deferral policy. So I can work in London for a year and then go to NYU. The drawback for this is I will be too old when I graduate.

I know I have some companies like Facebook in the pipeline, I will be preparing hard for them as well. But I have to reply to that London firm soon hence the confusion.",2020-03-02 06:24:55

1b0qeqs,Today I used chatGPT to help me decide how to move forward with my carrer as SoftDev,"And, spoiler alert, it sucked. I feel like chatGPT is getting dumber by the day and I would have made a much better job just a few months ago. So I decided to come here and appeal to your wisdom, guys. Hope you can help me figure some things out. For those interested though, I explain and the end of the post how I used chatGPT.  


So, for context, I'm a 37 years old man with a CS degree. I've been working as a software developer for 14 years now (damn, time flies), mostly as a full stack, working on .NET as SQL, taking care of the full development process of a project, managing small teams from time to time, you guys know the drill.  


A coupe of years ago I decided to start studying machine learning on my own, and try to change paths. After finishing some Coursera's courses and competing a bit in Kaggle, I decided to test the waters and try and apply to some ML related jobs, mostly in Madrid (where I live now). However I had no luck and was rejected or ghosted on all of them.  


I figured I still need to keep learning and finish some more courses. And here's the dillema: What should I focus on improving? Should I forget about ML and focus on my full stack skills? It seems to be a lot of demand for that. Start studying linear algebra and calculus? Is is really worth it? Going the data analyst route? I think I would enjoy that; data has always been one of the parts I enjoy the most in my projects.  


Now, to help me with the decission, I thought I could use some chatGPT and see what it thinks. So I searched for several job offers for jobs I would really like to aspire in a couple of years. I copied the job  descriptions on chatGPT and asked it give me a short list of the skills generally required for these jobs, and to suggest me a roadmap to achieve these goals (I also told chatGPT my background, so that it wouldn't assume I start from scratch).  


Anyway, the anwers are as blunt as you might expect from chatGPT these days. Just general uninspired bullet lists. I'll paste them now in case you guys are curious:  


Here's the list of skills generally required in the jobs I'm interested at:

Anyway, sorry for the long post. If any of you made it this far, I just wanted to know what any of you guys think I should do. Right now I'm really leaning towards specializing in data analisys, since I think I would really enjoy it, it is really on demand, and it already has lots of things in common with my current knowledge. But also willing to change my mind if somebody thinks of someething better.  


Ok, end of blabla now. Thanks again to anobody making it this far. Hope to hear from you guys.

I'm an Italian front-end developer with 1 year of experience in React. I'm currently working for a small IT consultancy company in Italy. I've been working on a good project in the fintech sector this year where i learnt a lot about building a ui from scratch and also set up automated testing with jest, react testing library and cypress. At my company they also gave me a salary increase because they liked the way i worked: although I'm a junior i gave some small valuable contribution to the project.

I would like to move to Münich because i feel that the IT sector in Germany is stronger than in Italy (higher salaries and more career opportunities) and also my girlfriend have a friend there (i would move with gf actually). I also wouldn't mind to work hybrid rather than full remote.

Which advice would you give me? Consider I don't know a word of German and I don't really know if my cv is well written for german market. Also if you have some resurces to share it will be very appreciated

146v0tt,IT Opportunities in Europe,"Hey, I am a computer science student in Turkey, and I will be graduating in 2024. I will be doing my second internship this summer in a game development studio(I did my first internship as a backend web developer). 

Although I will be an intern, the evaluation test they sent to me was titled Junior Game Developer Assignment, which required me to develop an idle game in 3 days. 

They said they really liked the project I developed even though it had some flaws such as the MVC architecture not being applied perfectly and some optimization problems, but every required gameplay feature was successfully delivered.

They specifically said a couple times that they didn't just want an intern, but a potential future employee, so there's a really high chance that this will be my first actual job in a couple months. 

Now, with all this info about me, here's my question: What are the top EU countries that are currently known for a relatively open market, and has a decent quality of life? And could I migrate with a Junior Game Developer title? Keep in mind that I have no EU citizenship, though I do have a Special Passport which lets me enter EU countries as I like, which will be valid until I'm 25.(I'm now 22, so 3~ years).

Generally, life here is well-organized and structured but I find people here too uptight. I don't know why but I can't connect to Germans. Younger generation is a bit friendly and open-minded but still... There is two side of the coin. One is I am not making enough effort to integrate like learning the language and culture. The other side is I don't think Germany is not ready to be multicultural.

Except that, I am very curious about tech startup culture where people gather up teams to solve engineering problems. And, when I look at successful startups, it seems like Europe is falling behind compared to US. And, when I talk to people here about it, people generally dream of a comfortable and easy going life in Germany. On the other hand, I am searching for something challenging and don't care about the work-life balance at this stage of my life since I like my job. Therefore, I have difficulty finding like-minded people...

I am confident that I can find a job in Germany for a year or so. In the meanwhile, I would be probably chasing job opportunities in the US. However, I sometimes feel like I am too obsessed with my thoughts that I will miss great opportunities around me in Germany or in Europe...

**Q1: I have to get fluent in German, if I want to build a company or be a competitive engineer. This is by itself not enough to motivate me... My question is do you think will Germany ever get multicultural? Or will they adapt their strict mindset to startup culture in business and be more innovative?** 

**Q2: Berlin is the most appealing place for me at the moment. However, I don't see many hardcore engineering startups. All I see mostly IT, Marketing, Fintech stuff... I see several quite good engineering startups in Munich but the lifestyle again seems typical conservative German mindset. Am I wrong/right about this observations?**

15skbub,Finding entry remote positions in EU.,"Hello.

I am a bit lost.
I have graduated with MA in History and Philosophy.
Some of my colleagues switched to it but I have a problem with the business side of it. I love programming and problem-solving in general and my favorite class was in Propositional Logic.

The main problem outside nepotism and/or a fair bit of luck is I can't get a job related to my degree in my country. My grades are meaningless. I have zero inside connections. I only have this as a choice of a career.

But if you are not formally educated it is hard to do anything outside of webdev. Even CS graduates end up in webdev.

I really tried but I can't stand webdev it is just not for me. There is an option of pursuing data analytics but it is mostly for marketing and consulting purposes. I like logical thinking, things that matter, things that bring value and prosperity first and revenue after.

I am an idealist. I am trying therapy to change that but I just can't manage.

I am looking at nonprofits and I hope some would give a chance to a resident in Croatia. 
My country is rife with corruption but the people are great sadly we just have greedy power structures since most of the country does not use their electoral rights.

I have no problem being exploited if it is for a cause and I'll gladly work myself to the bone. 

I thrive in such environments and that is why I succeed academically but I wither in life.

I looked for postings on idealist.org and similar but I struggle posting since I feel like it is a far cry.

Please let's keep this civil. I did get a lot of backlash when I ask this question on my native message boards.

I hoped as I acquired data analysis experience I could pivot to data science and machine learning in a few years and then do bioinformatics as I would self study it from mit ocw, ossu and various scientific papers over the years.

I previously resided and worked on the US, my mom lives there as well. But I didn’t really liked the lifestyle and culture of the country. So I’m seeking options on how to move to Europe from Latin America. As my best friend moved to Vienna 4 years ago and has been telling to move. So after a lot of tough I decided to give it a shot. 

I have over 6 years experience in IT, Helpdesk, Development, and Deployment. Experience with HTML, CSS, JS, ReactNative, Next.Js, and a little of Node and Express. I also know a little of Python for scripting. As well as leading teams and experience in customer facing-roles. Nothing too outstanding

I currently work for a pharmaceutical company, they have operations in Basel but I’m based on Costa Rica. The internal transfer to other countries or the EU are not that common, and they barely open internal applications for these positions. 

So I tough on start applying to other EU based companies from Costa Rica directly. I know there’s a law in Europe where recruiters should prioritize hiring Europeans. But has someone from Latin America had luck with moving to any country in Europe with work permit visa or sponsorship? I have the means to move and stay a couple months for myself. My issue resides in the work permit, would I be able to work in other areas such  as retail or customer service while I get a work permit to work in my area? 

Or should just start applying to companies on Glassdoor and LinkedIn and wait for a sponsorship offer? 

I would appreciate comments or suggestions from Latinos that have successfully migrated to Europe. My preference would be be Barcelona but any other European country will work me as well as I’m just aspiring for a better life quality.

14zpy56,Seeking advice for breaking into tech as a migrant worker?,"Hello everyone,

  
Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude for this opportunity to seek advice from the knowledgeable members of this forum. I am currently in the process of completing my visa application for the UK, where I will be working as a carer on a worker visa. However, I have a strong interest in transitioning into the tech industry within the next 6 to 12 months. I am here to seek guidance on the feasibility of this transition and to gather advice on the necessary steps to achieve my goal.

  
To provide some background, I hold a BSc in Finance and Accounting, graduating with honors and a GPA of 3.7 out of 4.0. While pursuing my degree, I independently taught myself programming skills through various online platforms. Currently, I am working on MERN stack projects and planning to create mobile apps using Flutter and Dart to enhance my portfolio.

  
During my undergraduate gap year, I worked as a product manager where I had the opportunity to lead a scrum team. Additionally, I engaged in some development work and discovered a knack for UI/UX design. My career aspirations lie in securing a senior developer or product management role within the fintech or banking industry in the UK within the next 5 to 8 years. Eventually, I hope to venture into starting my own fintech endeavor.

  
Initially, I am currently a migrant care worker, but I had planned to work in the care sector for approximately one year whilst searching for a company to sponsor my visa as a tech worker. However, given my limited direct tech experience and primarily freelance and personal projects, I understand that this may be a challenging path to pursue.

  
Considering this, I am seeking advice on programming language skills, recommended activities, actionable steps, and potential college opportunities that could help me transition into the tech industry. I recently came across some master's programs in computer science in the UK designed specifically for individuals aiming to break into tech. If I do not secure a job within the next 6 to 12 months, I am considering pursuing such a program while continuing to work in the care sector to support myself financially. I plan to finance the master's program through a student loan from a bank in my home country in Africa.

  
Another option I have considered is pursuing a university education in Canada. However, due to limited work hours and financial constraints, supporting myself in Canada would be challenging. Nevertheless, I am attracted to Canada's proximity to the USA and the potential for future opportunities in big tech, although I understand that this may be a long-term goal.  
Currently, I am freelancing and still working towards consistent earnings that would allow me to support myself in a developed country. I am also aiming to join Toptal, where I can potentially earn more and explore full-time opportunities while studying.

  
I have been contemplating the possibility of a part-time internship, even if unpaid, while residing in the UK. My intention is to gain practical experience that would bolster my resume and facilitate a smoother transition into the tech industry. However, I would appreciate your insights on the feasibility of such an arrangement and the overall value of such an experience.  
In conclusion, I kindly request your valuable advice, recommended resources, or any additional comments you may have regarding my situation. Thank you for taking the time to read my post, and I look forward to the wisdom and guidance you can provide.

  
Best regards,",2023-07-14 19:40:01
14toug7,Getting rejected for entry(student)-level Data Science jobs [Austria],"Hello everyone,

I’m currently applying for data science jobs. I do have some level of experience since I do/did a lot of projects in my master’s and bachelor’s studies and also at my current workplace. At my current workplace I did a data science project as part of an internship but since they don’t have any place for data science right now I’m doing mostly Front-End ReactJS, but my interest remains DS.

I should add that I’m a non-EU citizen with an Austrian student residence permit which means no working permit, apart for the company I’m currently employed at. If another company wants to hire me, they’d have to go through the hassle of filling out the application for my working permit which I think puts me at a huge disadvantage.

That said, I’d still like feedback for my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VISYZVxaMH7h984BkEfEhZqHx5eXtXd_/view?usp=drivesdk)

14ktfjv,"Why do all companies seem to only care about the periods of time where you've been employed, and not care at all about anything else?","Everything that I've read and experienced suggests that when companies are hiring, they only care about the time you spent in other employment, and completely disregard everything else you have ever done, even if that's where all of your most relevant or significant work is. When given the choice between a self-taught developer who has great technical knowledge, can design and build complex projects, can write high quality code, but doesn't have any full time work experience, and an incompetent developer who has no skills other than copying basic projects from tutorials and who has one internship, my experience is that companies will choose the incompetent developer with an internship. Why?

Another thing is that people on here always say that nobody looks at your github profile. Again, why? If I was hiring for a junior-level SWE job, the github profile would be the first thing I would look at and probably the thing I would value the most, because it's the perfect demonstration of the skill that they need in order to be able to do the job.

The hard nature of our current market, following the trend of remote working in the past 2 years, definitely justifies crashing competitiveness towards any remote friendly tech role, as we're now competing with engineers from all the world, regardless how low their demanded salaries are and how chaotic or extensive their experience is.

Slowly we started to see job posts for the same positions as before but with lower salaries, and indeed more responsibilities.

It became the absolute norm, to have proven Devops experience for any dev role, wether it is Frontend, Backend or even Mobile. However, I find the following qualifications, from a job post that I saw today on [angel.co](https://angel.co) to be absolutely ridiculous that I cannot believe such candidates even exist.

10qwwt1,"Finished my Msc in Ecology, cannot find a job, consider switching to a CS career","Hi,

I am considering trying to get a career in CS/ programming, IT development. I finished my Msc degree in Ecology and have a hard time finding a job as a consultant, full time field ecologist, or academic position and I think I want to broaden my changes of finding a job in another field. I have done 1 year of a Bsc Computer Science, and decided I wanted to swap to biology, as I felt more passionate towards this topic, and whilst I was always strong in the maths, I was struggling keeping up with my peers in my programming skills, and barely past or didn't pass my courses. But still, because of trying this for a year, I already have the basics of programming, know a few OO languages and SQL and have some ideas of IT engineering. 

During my Ecology studies I also kept my focus on maths and modelling quite a bit, so I am pretty confident in working with R and Python at the moment, and definitely kept developing some of my programming skills over the past few years.However I wouldnt call myself an expert in the IT field, and I will also need to sell myself to potential employers (I am looking for jobs in the area of preferably NL, but otherwise, GER, Denmark or Southern Sweden).

Would you think this is a feasible direction for me, how would you approach it. I know I quite CS at the time, because I had a hard time keeping up, but I am older now and feel like I can learn and work on stuff more efficiently than at the time.I am currently just applying to Junior positions requiring a Bachelors degree (as I think I can catch up to speed quite fast), but I am not sure how to approach this. Potentially I was thinking of trainee-ships for 2 months that lead into being detached? (not sure if it is the right term) into a job. Anyone ever did this? You think this is a career path I should be considering? How competitive can you be in the market if you are committed to trying hard, but not have the starting experience I assume most people in the field have (by being heavily self-taught in programming or doing a degree), or am I probably just being eaten alive?

zo8rnk,Which is the most easlily (quickest) certificate to archieve as a beginner?,"Hey there,

I know a question like this is always kind of suspicious and not well-liked, but let me explain the reason why:

I already work in security, but cyber security has been an interest for some time. Now a health issue has come up, and I am negotiating with my employer about another role in the company. 

My contract basicly forces my employer to find a new place for me, if I have a doctors report. Which I have. Twice. But my employer does not react and just offers me the same job on a different location far away. I have a lawyer, and I would win a lawsuit for sure, but I neither have the nerve nor the money to fight for multiple years.

Right now, the salary and benefits are good and I do not want to switch companys right now. I have a failry old contract, dating 20 years now. So it is kind of hard to get rid of me ;)

So the idea is to offer my employer a bit more substance so he might change his mind and offer another job, maybe in IT, mabye in security, maybe in changing printer cartridges. Would all be a major upgrade to selling the house and move.

So, I have started to gather some certificates, but no major ones. More or less just certificates that I did a course / training in Web-Scraping, CS50 Introduction, Boot Camp in Python, MySQL / PorstgreSQL Bootcamp. Thats all just a hobby, not job related, so never aimed for something more official.

Now I would like to be able to present sth. in the Cyber-Security field. It can be the most ordinary thing, it´s just for beeing able to proof to the ""way-higher-ups"" that I am willing to learn more on the matter and dive deeper, given the time and opportunity.

It would be great to gather some input from here, or constructive criticism!

My gastritis has put me in a state of anhedonia. However I am now in a position where I have some sort of focus returning back to me, Im getting better. But not sure where to even begin man I just need a helping hand. 

Do I start leetcoding? Do I start brushing up my programming knowledge? Should I start working on projects? Do I learn any other technologies?

I messaged my manager and told him that since I hadn't been paid for 2 months, I will cease all work until I get paid. I did so, I haven't opened anything, including slack.

During those months, I received an email from a recruiter for FAANG (I found it in my junk folder, thanks apple/icloud), fast forward a couple of weeks, and I received an offer.

---

The company I was hired at and didn't pay me doesn't have proper processes, they sent a person my way to ""help me"", and I ended up needing even more time because I had to review his code as well. The code was untested, didn't even pass the interpreter let alone proper unit testing.

One of my ""bosses"" even asked why I didn't commit directly and I wanted the person to open a PR before I merged things. 

I want to scream. Regardless, I seized the opportunity at that job and that gave me things to talk about at the interviews, so I made the best of it.

---

tl:dr; Don't settle, keep interviewing, keep your interview skills fresh, and you should be careful who you get in bed with.

ps: would anyone be interested in seeing the CV(s) that the FAANG companies saw?",2022-08-08 10:06:16

vun7rk,Any Good CS universities in the west of Europe?,"Hello, I’m a 16 year old girl that’s from Morocco and lately I’ve been really interested in both CS and universities in Europe as well. 
Academically I’m a very lazy student but when it comes to exercises or exams, that’s when I actually put the most amount of effort.

My goal was to get into TUM at first but, now I have gotten a 16.15/20 (our grading system is out of 20) in our national exam that counts as 25% of the total grade of the IB (in this exam we got evaluated in literary subjects such as french, history...). I still have a year of high school left and at the end of it I will pass another exam that counts as 75% of the IB.
So, Potentially I’ll be graduating at the age of 17.

I’m a bit worried because I was aiming to get a higher grade which would maybe possibly make it easier for me in the future to get into a CS uni in Europe. 

However, I’ve started learning german 2 years ago, but only managed to officially finish A1 and I’m about to start learning A2 this summer. Due to covid and school, I had to postpone learning German.

Actually, I was also keen on learning how to code this summer as well as I have a lot of free time.

In the end, I’m aiming to get a total grade of 18/20 which is equivalent to an A or a GPA of 4 or 90% I have no idea.

I’ve already seen that the admission rate at TUM is 8% which is insanely low, then I found out about ETH Zurich, while learning the german language isn’t really much of an issue, I’m still worried I’m not going to get in.
 
What are some good CS universities in Europe apart from the 2 listed previously? 
I would prefer if it wasn’t that far away from Germany and if it didn’t require me to speak any other language.",2022-07-08 22:55:08

I am currently in Asia working as an SWE at one of the top tier banks, but seriously considering moving to London, mostly for the sake of kids' education. Visa is not an issue here, I will have the right to work and do business (i.e. contract) in the UK.

1. How difficult is it to find a job for an experienced C++ developer if I decide to move without securing an offer first? Is it a bad idea in general?
2. How's the market for contractors? Is finding a contract faster/easier than a perm role? Is it a good idea for a new immigrant?

usx814,What are my chances of passing the interview?,"I just finished last behavioral round at a company. But it went a bit messy.

He asked me to talk about a project and what are my motivations for doing it. I then presented my screen to talk about the architecture of my project. Then he said he was actually asking for the motivation why I did it instead of the technical side. Then I said the reason I did it. The situation was a bit awkward for me.

Then he asked about an example where I stepped out of my comfort zone. AND HE EVEN EXPLAINED TO ME WHAT COMFORT ZONE IS IN CASE I DONT UNDERSTAND IT…I just feel like how stupid he thinks I must be for him to explain this kind of stuff to me?

But later I asked several questions which he all said was good question and the situation kind of became better.

p4lsqu,Competency based computer science degree,"hello could you please list the most interesting competency based computer science degrees worldwide? Mainly interested in the most affordable options. Also interested in bachelor degrees using the English language. 

&#x200B;

What is competency-based education? Simply put, it measures skills and learning rather than time spent in a classroom. Students progress through courses as soon as they can prove they’ve mastered the material, rather than advancing only when the semester or term ends.

&#x200B;

This means you can acquire the knowledge to pass all the exams required to earn the degree through self-study and work experience before registering at the University. Then you show up at the University  and complete all the exams and coursework in 1 or 2 semesters. This method saves money by paying 2 semesters instead of 6-8. This method also saves time because the degrees acquired in 2 semesters (one year or less) instead of 3 or 4 years.

&#x200B;

Below is an example. The Western Governors University online computer science degree. Accredited by the highest possible accreditation. 

[https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html)

Please Help me out !

I am from a non-EU country and I had received an offer from a Berlin based company early December. I was low balled and downgraded at that moment . Since, my current company was toxic , and wanted to leave asap, I accepted the offer and signed the contract. They started with the visa process , which was long & got delayed due to multiple factors.

Since i had already left my last company , i interviewed in a few places and luckily ended up with an offer from an much better company based in London (Almost 2x TC). The tech stack is good,team is amazing, and i m not low balled.  I feel this is much better fit for me !

Unfortunately my visa approval just got in and i am days away from joining the Berlin based company. I am worried about the consequences (legal case, monetary demands and blacklisting) since they waited for around 4 months. Also are there any consequences ? What can they possibly do ?

What should i do now ?

My initial intention was to move to London and participate in networking events for finance and fintech jobs, since it is probably the strongest field in Europe, and unfortunately I could not get any interviews from those kinds of companies and ended up accepting something else in the meanwhile. But due to the government restrictions, and the constant and continuous threat of new ones, London has become a ghost city where nothing is happening and business seems completely frozen.

Therefore, since Sweden is probably the European country that better reacted to the covid so far, what is the professional and cultural life there currently like? Is the tech scene getting traction by the fact people and businesses can work and live there almost normally, or is it as disappointing as most of Europe so far? Would it be a good investment trying to move there for the foreseeable future, or is it better to suffer for some more months/years in the UK hoping for a restart as soon as possible?

10wxhbz,"Leave a remote job USD 100k to be hired in Amsterdam, does it make any sense?","Hey guys 👋

I am a brazilian mobile software engineer with more than 10 years of experience. Currently, I am living in São Paulo.

I am working remotely for an american startup from home. I am making a good amount of money for the brazilian standards. I can live really well with spending only 1/4 of my salary.

Recently, I got a job offer from Amsterdam (EUR 70k) company. It seems to be fun and interesting but I am not sure if this is a good deal. Since the cost of living in Amsterdam would be higher than in Brazil. 

However, I always dreamed of living abroad for a while. I just don't know if this is a good offer for someone like me.

Last year. I turned down a job offer from a delivery company based in Berlin paying 100k + 25k bonus yearly. I got afraid of the war 😢

I am saying that because I want to show my capabilities. 

In conclusion, should I accept that job offer or should I keep trying to get something better?",2023-02-08 14:03:29

xpvgnh,European targets for CS,"Hi,

I’m a polish-german student currently in my last year of high school in Germany with pretty good grades. Soon, I’ll need to decide what university to attend for my bachelors in Computer Science. I’ve narrowed down the choice to 4 universities: ETHZ, TUM, TU Delft and University of Warsaw. I’ve thoroughly analysed all options and compiled a list of pros and cons for each one. Unfortunately, without experience in quant, big tech, consulting or US grad schools myself, I can’t really prove the validity or real-world weight of said points. These are my main long-, mid- and short term goals:

&#x200B;

* (Long: After Masters) Get into quant prop shops (SWE or Trader) and/or FAANGM (PM or SWE)

&#x200B;

* (Long: After Masters) If that doesn’t work out, short stint with MBB consulting in CH or DE as plan B to help with the FAANG PM path

&#x200B;

* (Mid: After B.Sc) Preferably doing masters at top US grad school (1st: seems like the best move for all 3 career paths / 2nd: childhood dream of mine was to study in the states. If not bachelor, why not masters?)

&#x200B;

* (Short: During B.Sc) Preferably many internships / visiting researcher roles around the world during my studies. If not possible at the uni with the best prospects described in previous points, that’s too bad. It’s not a deal braker.

To not trash the post, I’ve included the pros & cons list in the comment. Any help / insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time!",2022-09-27 22:56:28
xf774d,How to find good job postings?,"I'm close to finishing my PhD in CS (hopefully in the next 2-3 months). I am in the luxurious position that my contract is a full position with two years left (unless I quit early), so I'm not forced to find a job ASAP but can look for one that really interests me. I applied to Apple last month, but they didn't respond to me, so I guess I'll have to take that as a no. 

My problem is that the job postings mostly seem very generic. They have titles like ""Software Engineer III"", ""Sr. Software Engineer - Embedded Software"", or ""Software Engineer - Site Reliability"". Even when looking at the preferred qualifications you often see things like ""SCM systems (Git, SVN)"", ""Experience with networking technologies"", or ""Ability to deliver high-quality software"". And the description texts are not helping either (""You'll work on important projects that will allow you to grow professionally."").

sbr81j,Looking to move to EU - I have 5 YoE in React / React Native; 9 YoE of total JS experience. What are my options?,"As the title says, I am a front-end developer looking to move to the EU, preferably Germany, Sweden, or Netherlands (but other places are also fine I guess).

I'd like to preface this whole thing first to say that I am not from an EU country and would therefore require visa sponsorship if I were to move.

# Background on me

A bit of background on my skills. I have been working with React and React Native since 2017 but started my career using JS around 2013.

I have done a few freelance + personal projects on the side where I have dabbled in NodeJS, Typescript, and GraphQL. I do also have a good knowledge on your basic devops stuff but nothing on a professional level that I feel confident enough to put on my resume.

I don't have a CS background and was mainly self-taught just through my own interest in the field. I love tech but never had the grades to get accepted into a CS program in university. So I opted to get a Bachelor's degree in another unrelated field as I thought I might go into journalism or something related to media.

# My burning questions :)

I was hoping this sub could help me answer these uncertainties for me:

1. What kind of a salary should I expect to ask for in a place like Germany, Sweden, or Netherlands?
2. Is not having a CS degree a bad thing? I know that a lot of companies don't care but how hard would it make getting an interview or a work visa?
3. I suck at LeetCode due to my lack of a proper CS background and I never felt obliged to learn algorithms and stuff as it wasn't part of my job scope ever. Would this be a problem?
4. Follow up to the previous question, do most companies do on the spot type tests during the interview because I tend to freeze up when having to write code immediately in front of someone else who is probably judging every semi-colon.
5. Less of a question and more of asking for guidance, apart from LinkedIn, what are some other places to look for open positions?

Thanks in advance for answering any of my questions!",2022-01-24 17:19:24

kokdb6,What does it take to be considered above average and receive offers from top companies?,"This might sound like a humble brag but I really need your help to assess my level for the tech market and adjust my expectations. This is my 2nd year of the master's degree in CompSci I'm doing at one that can be considered the best university for studying CS in Italy. 

My current weighed average mark is 29.5/30. I would describe myself as a hustler and really passionate about this field, surely I haven't chosen it just for the well-paid jobs like many others do. When I have time, I often study new topics on my own. I've been leading in all the group projects until now and I'm quite confident on my soft and hard skills, even though the more  I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know. Before finishing my bachelor's, I've done an internship with the same university and developed an application that is currently in use by the secretariat. Side projects aren't missing as well.

Sometimes I feel optimistic about my future job(s), other times instead I think that all of the above are not enough to make me become ""above average "" once I get out of school. I would like to move to Zurich after graduation but after reading some posts here and the other subreddit I feel like I'm still not enough and even with a good gpa, the competition is still very high.

**I knew that it is not a job offer yet.**

So on Wednesday, I wrote a comment on a headhunter's post that I look for a Software Engineer job explaining about my tech stacks/background. 

The HR manager viewed my LinkedIn profile, and maybe she would see my comment (that I seek for a tech job).

I think she saw my profile since I have 1st connection with the Hiring manager of the company..

1ainlok,How to deal with client developers telling that I don't have arguments?,"I remember some time ago there was code review process. Maybe I was suggesting something, or maybe I defended my opinion to the comment, and I got comment from client developer something like ""do things without having arguments"". When I clearly had arguments, I can't remember if I stated them or not but I clearly could have.

Recently again - another clieant tech lead during a meeting  after I said something, he said soemthing like ""you need to have arguments"". Wtf. I have arguments. I then asked - maybe I do not know how to know what is an argument. Then he gave some examples of what is, what is not an argument. Like coding withtout framework (I cant remember exact words) is not an argument.

Wtf I think. I still ended up not understanding what is and what is not an argument after the meeting because I felt dumb, as if everyone knows what is argument but I don't.

Ok then I decided I need to research. I found various examples agreeing with me that what I thought is argument - it is argument. Even book by professor where in 1.1, 1.2 chapters exaplain very clearly what is an argument.



[https://human.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Philosophy/Introduction\_to\_Logic\_and\_Critical\_Thinking\_2e\_(van\_Cleave)/01:\_Reconstructing\_and\_Analyzing\_Arguments/1.01:\_What\_is\_an\_Argument](https://human.libretexts.org/bookshelves/philosophy/introduction_to_logic_and_critical_thinking_2e_(van_cleave)/01:_reconstructing_and_analyzing_arguments/1.01:_what_is_an_argument)

For example quote:

>Is there a statement that someone is trying to establish as true or explain why it is true by basing it on some other statement? If so, then there is an argument present.

I always can find a statement if needed. I just sometimes do not always tell it because sometimes I do not feel a need to provide statement explaining why something is tro to not spend time if I think there is a chance people agree anyway. If will not agree, I can find a statement why I think something is true.

So after I have done research, I am angry for injustice. People blame me for not having arguments when I do.

Talked with project manager about this, and she said phylosophical terms do not have one truth. She suggested tryign to watch what people take as argument.

But I believe this suggestion will not work reliably and I will be randomly blamed that I do not have arguments I believe just because they do not agree or they have stronger counterarguments.

I am thinking only about talking less when not needed, so less chance that I will be blamed. It is not interesting especially in the meeting when nobody is talking when one asks for opinions. But I see some devs are silent and do good. I assume the people who talk more, reach more.

And it is not only about client developers but I am interested also how should I deal with this in case colleague developers start blaming for not having arguments. Haven't happened yet but it is possible.

Any suggestions how to deal with that?

**Update**

More examples of what client tech lead said what is not an argument:

>because other do that

again I do not agree at all. It is an argument and even by the book.

>because java book author does that

I cant remember if he said this example is an argument or not but there is a chance that he said it is not an argumebnt but again - by the book it is an argument and I also think it is an argument.",2024-02-04 13:13:05

She has 3 YOE (1 YOE as Web Designer, 1YOE as UI/UX, and 1YOE as UX Researcher) currently working at a telco company, and I have 6 YOE as Full-Stack Developer (Java/Node.js and Angular,), currently working in R&D department, where all my previous projects were part of related to EU funds and projects.   
Both of us have Bachelor CS degrees, she in Informatics, and I as Software Engineer.

  
Both she and I speak fluent English (plan is to gain a TOEFL certificate), and I have an A2 German certificate, which I got 6 years ago, and honestly, knowledge vanished.  


Even though we are earning a lot more than average, and have our own apartments in the capital city, we would like to relocate because of the future of our children we are planning to have, their future education, and in general more chances if they are born and live in some EU country.  


Based on the research that we did, the easiest way to get a job and visa is in Germany, but reading here, it seems that currently there are no jobs, and people are not satisfied with their salaries.  


Which country/cities would you recommend, and based on our background, what would be suitable salaries?

16x82qg,Career change advice -,"Hi,

I am seriously contemplating a career restart in a CS role. I've always been interested in a CS career but for various reasons never ended up directly pursuing it. I'm now early 30s and at the point where I feel if I don't make the change now, I probably never will. Unfortunately, I realise I've timed this poorly with the market, and so was hoping to get some advice from everyone here as to whether a switch is sensible, or even possible, please!

State of affairs:

* Undergrad Masters in Physics (nearly a decade ago now, but a strong degree from a reputable UK uni).
* Currently in an investing role which primarily involves investments in tech companies (think early stage startups). Through this I get to interact with a lot of technical people but always on a very superficial level. I really enjoy these interactions and really respect these people and the solutions they are building.From the outside looking in my investing role is quite desirable (well paid, varied work etc), however I am becoming increasingly unsatisfied with the industry as a whole (there is a lot of hot air) and yearning to move into a position of actually building something. I find my current role is essentially calls / meetings all day, forever context switching, and only developing a superficial level of understanding of a large number of disparate areas. Furthermore, real success in this role requires being quite extroverted and ""salesy"" which is not my skillset. What I feel I really want to be doing is getting stuck into hard technical problems.
* Because of this, I've been pursuing [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) for a while now, managing to finish 4 modules alongside work (10 modules are required for the masters). I have thoroughly enjoyed taking these modules and achieved top marks in the ones I have done so far. I intend for the majority of the remaining modules I take to be either AI/ML focused, or systems focused. I like the maths behind AI/ML (ties in with my undergrad well) but I also really like the low level understanding from the ground up in the operating systems courses.

I am contemplating leaving my job, taking on the masters full time and getting the remaining 6 modules done within a year, then looking for a job in the UK (where I am based).

Questions / concerns:

* Realistically, how bad is the job market now? I know the market for juniors is tough, would someone with my background, in their early 30s, stand any chance against freshly minted CS undergrads or those who've got a couple of YOE under their belt but recently been laid off?
* Can anyone advise as to the pros / cons of either pursuing AI/ML modules vs systems modules. I feel AI/ML is obviously a very important sector that's not going to go away, but also has a lot of people trying to get roles in that space, whereas systems work is potentially less hot but less competitive?
* My main concern is that I'm going to take a huge financial hit from this move. At the moment I'm looking at this with the mindset of I'll be working for the next 30 years anyway, so better to be doing a job I enjoy even if I earn less - but the sensible part of me is saying I'd be stupid to turn away from what is really quite a fortunate salary to be currently on (low 6 figures £). I'd love to talk to anyone who changed career to a CS role and took a large hit to their paycheck in the process if they happen to be reading this!

Cheers.

16ev9f0,"As someone working in a CS related field, is English knowledge enough to get you started in most EU countries? (explained more in depth below)","So I currently have 3 more semesters left until I get my CS degree in Budapest, Hungary. After I'm done with university and maybe worked full-time for a year to save up (I'm currently working as an intern) I'd like to move away from here permanently, possibly somewhere in Western-Europe. 

The only thing I'm 100% sure about is that I'd like to move but I don't know which country yet, as it is too early to set a specific goal now and there are many countries that I like (a few examples: Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, maybe Spain). For this reason I'm not very motivated to put serious effort into learning any of these languages as of now because I don't know which one I'll need exactly. 

So my exact questions is: Is it possible (and realistic) to get a CS related job in these countries if you only speak English and then just start learning the language once you moved there? Also, do I have to compromise a lot salary-wise?

165bu6q,Should I change jobs?,"
Hi, I’ve been at the company I work at for a year now and I’m thinking about moving on but I’m not sure. 
I’m a self taught dev and back when they hired me I didn’t know much apart from pure Python on an intermediate level and I was just looking for any programming job to kickstart my career. This past year I’ve had to learn a lot about Django and obviously some basic understanding of other technologies like Git, Docker or web in general…
The position was definitely for someone more skilled but they hired me anyway with much lower pay than the position stated. I was and still am grateful for the experience but I can’t live on this low pay forever, but that’s not the issue honestly. 
Since I’m self taught and don’t have friends in IT, I don’t have anyone to compare the experiences with but from what I’ve read online I think that for an entry level junior, my tasks are often way above my position. From my understanding, juniors usually fix smaller bugs, write tests and their code is always checked by a senior before it’s put into production. At this job, I’m mostly working on new features and (to me) complex endpoints, have been assigned to start a new Django project, in which I’ve done most of the database design, I’ve been deploying the app by trial and error several times and often I feel like when I want some tutoring, I’m just bothering the seniors and don’t get any explanations. Mostly they send me a link to the docs to study it or they say they’ll do it themselves. When I do get them to explain something to me it’s never been longer than 5 minutes. Often I reach a point that my overlooked mistake bites me in the ass and it’s too late to make changes to the older code, so I struggle and hope for the best. 
Now I know one year is really soon to jump the ship but I’m just not sure if this is normal or Id have it better elsewhere. Maybe it’s because the company has under 100 people and that’s how things usually are.

Culture, Visa and most importantly language problems are confusing to me. My german is alright. I have a C2 Certificate and I have little trouble talking with people, but with all the dialect I am not sure if I would be able to communicate effectively without practice.

I still meet with them during the holidays, but I want to be have a better connection with them eventually. So I am considering moving after 2 to 3 years after my bachelors.

I looked at the tasks and it’s seems like basic react and JavaScript stuff so would only take me a couple hours, but it’s not so much the time that I care about (I have nothing to do but leetcode), but whether employers would actually care about it since it’s “virtual”.

I started learning python, got to day 20 of 100days of python course on udemy and started building django project with veryyy basic limited knowledge, understanding of OOP concepts. However, after 3 months, in dire need of a job, I found an internship which said 3 months training for html css js and then 6 months experience required on shopify and then we will take you to ROR. I had seen the The Odin Project so I thought that yes this path seems interesting / leading to future prospects and I accepted.

I completed my internship with flying colors, learned html css Js Liquid (shopify template language) api ajax calls, callbacks etc in 2 months and was appointed on live projects. However the actual promotion happened 2 months after this. It's been 4 months since I've been promoted to Jr shopify developer position and I feel like they want me to somehow learn ROR or advanced concepts by myself. Why was the time during internship not allowed to me to learn more rather than working(this is just my rant for this week i know it's stupid).

However, my company is now laying off people working on Vue, React projects without any issues in their work or behavior and I'm scared. Although they don't have anyone else for shopify these days but how would they allow me to move forward if they don't have any suitable replacement for me? I am learning React on my own but my pace is very slow now. I'm learning from direct reactdocs and it's time taking as well as mind boggling most of the times. I am unable to give proper time to learning with this job and the pressure to perform exceptionally good to not get laid off.

I have started upwork account but in the past 2 months I've pnly been able to get clients worth 250 and they're happy from my work. But it's just doubts after doubts and unclear future. Am I moving in the right direction? Should I switch jobs? If I switch I will certainly be taken as a shopify developer which I do not ideally want.

11rryej,Will there be less need for ML engineers in the future than today due to Artificial General Intelligence?," Hi,

I think the common conception is that the demand for ML engineers will rise due to the use of ML in more and more industries and use cases.

I am wondering if the opposite may happen due to generally intelligent models? For example, if I want to use an ML model in a specific NLP context, in the past, I would have trained custom models for my dataset. Nowadays, I would first try to use a GPT-3-like API and just do prompt engineering instead of designing and training models, and likely get better results. As more and more multi-modal generally intelligent models arise, the same may happen for vision and other domains.

Do you think that in the future, most ML cases only require prompt engineering and we will need only a few very good ML engineers that train the generally intelligent models, instead of large amounts of ML engineers today?",2023-03-15 10:02:19

16bewe6,We need regulations that force companies to give valid reason for not hiring in case you score the interview. Right now there are many fake job listings that are there only to make the companies look good and waste the time of candidates.,"I recently got an offer, but honestly there were a few interviews in which I answered all questions correctly and in details, yet didn't get an offer. I've checked there's more engineers in similar situation. In topics like this few reasons why they don't move forward are mentioned but one of the reasons is disturbing. 

Some companies just act like they're hiring while they're not. For me an interview is a mutual contract because everyone involved invests their time and it must be respected. Interview is a test and if you get a full score you must be hired. In case you're not it must be justified. And if you're not satisfied you should have a right to sue the company. Interviews are recorded so the outside observers can judge themselves if the reason is justified for example candidate didn't have enough soft skills (despite answering technical questions) or somebody else got hired. Regulations like this would make sure (at least to a degree) that fake reasons for not hiring are not used. Additionaly they woild make sure candidates are not ignored for reasons like racism / sexism.

In 2024 I will be graduating with a bachelors in Psychology, only issue is I do not envision a career in this field... I would like to go back into IT (did a digital technician course at college but have always been intrigued by coding) possibly web development to be specific. My end goal would be to transfer to work and live in the US, ideally through a L1b visa as it seems much more realistic than the H1 alternative. 

I have an idea of the resources to go ahead and get the knowledge required to enter this field (online courses, bootcamps etc) and I know that my L1 routes would be to either work for a US company with a UK office, or work remotely for a US company more than likely as a contractor for ease purposes. 

My biggest stumbling block however is how to find these companies... for people that have done this themselves, or just have the knowledge, what websites or search prompts should I be using to find these companies once I have the knowledge to begin my career? I feel like im just not finding anything when I google something like ""US based web dev companies with UK offices"" nor when i search ""us web dev companies remote hire UK"". 

Furthermore, I know that the main requirement for the L1b visa is to have at least worked at the company for 1 year, with specialised knowledge. Is there anything else that's not mentioned? Due to covid and a busy uni schedule I dont exactly have much of a CV at the moment, but I'm looking to finally build on my work experience in the new year, because I cant imagine they would be likely to accept someone who just meets that minimum requirement with no prior experience working.

18fbzmd,Can I make enough after a Conversion Master's Course in Computer Science in the UK with no prior experience to be eligible for a Worker's visa and also secure a sponsored job to pay off my student loan and continue working there?,"As an international student from a non-STEM background with no prior experience, I will have to get a sponsored job by the end of the PSW(Post Study Work Visa/Permit) of 2 years duration after finishing the degree in the UK to continue staying and working there. Since I will be taking up a loan that would be another concern of mine.

  
Also, the UK government is hell-bent on decreasing the number of immigrants entering, working, and staying in the UK, they have increased the minimum salary to be eligible for a worker's visa from about 26k GBP to 38k GBP.

  
It's rumored that they are going to cancel the PSW as well...(fingers crossed)  
So as an international student who is taking up a loan to study in a foreign country, he expects at the very least to make enough money to pay off his loan and hopefully secure a sponsored job by the end of the Graduate Visa/PSW period(2 years). 

  
In the end, I am left with 3 choices :   
1. Drop the idea of studying in the UK, even though I already have an offer from Newcastle/Kent/Sussex and waiting for a few more...

  
2. Pick a slightly low / above average ranked University that provides an option of a Placement year/Sandwich year to increase the number of years from 2 years(Graduate Visa/PSW) to 2+1(PSW + Placement year) during which I will be expected to look for and secure a sponsored job and even if it's not a sponsored job, to make enough money to pay off my student debt and try to not take that burden back home to India. 

  
3. Complete my degree without needing a placement/Sandwich year and secure a sponsored job along with fulfilling all the other criteria before the end of my Graduate Visa/PSW (2 years) and continue working without any stress as I will be able to comfortably pay off my education loan without any hassle.

  
These recent updates from the UK Govt. have me confused and forced me to look at Ireland or maybe some other European countries offering such conversion courses in Computer Science.

  
Any opinion or input would be highly appreciated and welcomed. Please feel free to talk about your experiences.

  
Also, it's said that the pay scale in tech is generally higher than the usual salaries in other domains hence it is futile to worry about not earning enough to pay off one's loans or maybe fulfilling the minimum eligibility criteria of 38k GBP for securing the Worker's Visa along with a sponsored job.

17oga0w,Is it worthwhile to do an Msc in Computer Science/Advanced Computing etc from a job perspective?,"My background: Bachelors in CS from India, though not a top-tier university

Experience: 3 YOE, ranging from an Indian startup to a US based MNC. No FAANG experience

&#x200B;

My motivation for doing masters is to get a better theoretical grounding in ML, Distributed systems etc. I would like to have a job where I can delve into ML along with software engineering I know such jobs are not common but I have a lot of interest in the field and have taken plenty of math courses to know what Im signing up for when it comes to diving deep in ML. I have done a fair amount of ML during my bachelors and am proficient enough with Python and the relevant frameworks. The problem is that recruiters in India are especially biased towards previous experience and I only have an internship in data science from 2020 .  
Also, at the current time I feel that if I dont do a masters now I wont be able to do one in the future. I have found so far in my experience that after a year or so at both my jobs, the amount of learning really becomes negligible . I feel that with a bachelors in CS and some dedicated experience, I would be able to really improve myself technically if I were to spend time doing a masters.

&#x200B;

Whats holding me back is the job market and another thing is that I just dont know that many people who do an Msc from UK. I just wanted to know if there are people here (non-Europeans ideally as that would be closer to my situation) who have done an Msc in CS type programs and built a career in Europe after that?",2023-11-05 17:01:00

156kzm0,Getting a remote job as a Master's student,"I (22y.o.) just graduated in Computer Science (bachelor) in Brazil, from the #1 university in Latin America (USP). Since we don't have the bologna system, I had to study 5 years to earn a Bachelor's degree, and many of my subjects were on par with Master level courses. Fine.

I want to work with either robotics, neuroscience/neuroinformatics or computational biology, and this fall I will be starting a Master's degree in Robotics at the University of Turku (UTU, Finland). I know that these three areas usually require a Master's degree, so I am on it.

The problem: my currency is worth nothing. Basically Europe (specially Finland) is 3x more expensive for me, than just staying in Brazil. I do not have to pay the tuition fee (luckily), but still the living costs are expensive. My family is kind of able of supporting me there, but still I don't want to be a burden.

So, I am looking for a job. Ideally it would be SW development, remote, with flexible hours, in either backend, data science/ML engineering, or some correlated area. I know this is hard, specially because I am still ""only a Bachelor"" so I am asking for *votre* opinions.

p.s. I have tried freelancing websites, but most of them (upwork, freelance) are super weird, only random ppl asking for crypto trading bots, or telegram bots to do ilegitmate stuff; and others like braintrust and expertlead did not offer me anything.

tl;dr: How to get a remote job in sw development as a Master's student in Finland.

I am M25 from Switzerland. I have an Bachelor's degree in Health Science and Technology and I am currently studying Biomedical Engineering in my Master's. I was very unsatisfied with my Bachelor's because it was very broad and my Math background is very weak (just basic calculus and linear algebra and a bit mechanics). It consisted of a wide variety of subjects including cell biology, anatomy and physiology and (bone-) mechanics. So you see very specific and very broad at the same time. The consecutive Master was out of the question so I tried to get into the Master Biomedical Engineering, where I am now specializing in Machine Learning and Signal Analysis. I had to apply for this Master because normally, my Bachelor does not qualify for it but I had very good grades so I got in (a bit unexpected to be honest).

Now I am very much struggling with the courses because they are normally for people who studied CS or Electrical Engineering but I think I am getting the hang of it eventually.

Now my problem is that I have NO idea what kind of jobs in the tech field I could land. Can I get a job as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer without a background in CS? At this point I should mention that the CS program at my uni is one of the best in the world (The uni is ETH Zürich) and the uni is one of the best in Europe. On the other hand, my background is very weak and I don't think I can profit from the reputation.

What could you suggest what I should focus on during my studies? My plan is to form a good GitHub profile with own projects (maybe Kaggle) and go from there. I really want a goal that I can work towards because now I fell a bit lost as it was not my initial dream to go into this direction in my studies.

I really like Programming and I want to have an opportunity to work in the field. That´s the reason I´m considering to take formal education, even if I´m ""a litle old"" for this. Currently I´m learning B2 german and I´m trying to realize what is better for me. I´m between applying for an Ausbildung or taking the Studienkolleg to be qualified to study in the university.

I have done research and I´m aware about the differences between the educations, for example, that in the university you don´t learn very practical things, but in the other hand I have learned programming languages and technologies on my own.

I just would like to ask the comunity and more experienced people here. What do you think it would be the best choice for the future? I don´t care about having ""an important position in a company"", I just want to work in somehing that makes me feel proud of myself.

Thank you so much!

I'm an experienced full-stack developer from Asia, armed with a decade of expertise in the field. However, I lack a college degree and proficiency in the German language. Despite these challenges, I'm eager to explore software job opportunities in Germany.

1. Can I find software job opportunities in Germany without a college degree and not knowing the German language?

2. Are there English-speaking tech companies in Germany that consider non-degree, non-German-speaking developers?

3. What steps can I take to make myself more marketable to German tech employers in this situation?

4. Are there specific industries or roles in Germany where language may be lower for non-German-speaking applicants?

157lopb,Swiss guy living in colombia. Reentry in IT after 10 years.,"Hey guys. I am 36 years old and originally from switzerland. I live since 4 years in colombia. I am looking for a career change. I studied 2 years computer science(application development) for career changers, 10 years ago and made one year of internship in a web company(typo 3) but then i never followed this  career and made something completly different.  


Now times have changed again and i am looking for a alternative career path and obviously first thing that came to my mind is programming. I was always one of the best in my classes despite not puting much attention to the classes, smoking weed and having adhd. So i am pretty sure with enough effort and discipline i will find my way back in. I also did found it interesting.  


My objective is to stay in colombia, long-term. So the best case scenario would be to work as a freelancer or maybee remote for a swiss company. I tought about self learning the material and then maybee in 1-2 years to get some entry level job or work as a freelancer and get me at least like 25$/h. I really want to stay in colombia, but if it needed to be i could go back to switzerland for 1-2 years to get my foot into a door of a company and then come back.  


What do you guys think, is that realistic?! And where should i start. I am taking now a course online that shows me ""how to learn"". After that i didnt decide how to approach that. Which language, which course etc is recommended?

14w2eb6,"Expat considering bootcamp to move to UK, is it a smart move?","Been lurking this amazing r/ and am looking for some advice!

I’m currently working in TV development in the US, and it’s been hard to find a job abroad in anything related to my experience, even more difficult to find one with good pay (I’d have to go from a $150k+ salary to a £15k-£20k which isn’t doable due to massive student debt).

Been considering a career change, and coding bootcamps seems to be a solid option. Europe, especially Scotland, has been a life long dream, and recent events in the US are pushing me to make the move as soon as possible. In order to not bore you with US politics, I’ll summarize by saying that I’m on a ticking clock to make a decision because some recent events here will gravely affect my finances depending on how swiftly I can move.

Does anyone have any insight on how open minded is the market for a recent bootcamp grad, that would also be open to sponsor a foreigner? 

I was also wondering if there are any expats here who’ve taken that approach  that could give me some guidance.

14ao004,I got a potential job offer as a junior front-end web-developer. Should I take it in todays climate regarding AI?,"I'm sure my questions been asked in a million different variants, but here it goes again lol...

I got a job offer as a junior front end web developer. It would be a life changing job, almost twice my current pay, and an entry into the tech sector. I currently work in a call center for hospital bills. I really want to get into tech. I've been programming and doing web-dev as a hobby with some free-lance here and there for about 8-9 years now.

&#x200B;

I like the job's vibe, the people I interviewed with seem nice, but I have two pretty big concerns lol.

&#x200B;

1, Will I potentially end up loosing my job to AI, since I'd be a new junior front end web developer?

&#x200B;

2, The job requires angular. My preferred stack is MySQL, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS. I kinda lied in the interview and told them I've worked a little bit with angular in the past, but not recently. Truth was I never worked with angular at all. After the interview I looked at like a 2-3 hour long video to learn the basics, and I could probably make a simple SPA website, or app with angular. I would definitely not be a pro or master at it. I get its a junior role, and they'd probably not expect me to be perfect at it, but I don't wish to disappoint them you know?

I also get my A.S. Degree in Cyber-Security this fall, as well as my A+ Cert, and Sec+ Cert. So I'm also thinking of maybe just getting into IT, Networking, or Cyber-Security, but I'd love to say yes to this job, I just don't want to be out of a job in 3-6 months you know?

&#x200B;

Please any advise at all would really help me out.

I have already secured another job starting May 23, however my current company wants to ""non-consensually"" redeploy me to a different team rather than laying me off and paying a severance package.

Technically they are legally allowed to do this, since my new position will be the same in almost all ways.

How would you suggest maneuvering this situation so that they lay me off instead me having to resign?

A lawyer suggested one strategy of telling HR that ""I'm looking for other jobs and will probably be leaving the company in a few months anyway"". This is hoping that they would lay me off rather than waste the time and money of onboarding me to another team.

I think all job posts receive 200 applicants withing hours so it's not much time to like comment and network with someone then ask for referral 5 days later when job posting is removed. Also most of the people rarely have any activities on LinkedIn.

16c9qai,Taking a Bet on my career,"I'm a backend developer with a decade of experience and a decent salary in India (Non MANG/FANG). I've been feeling unsatisfied at my current job due to micromanagement and a lack of growth opportunities because of office politics. I've lost motivation over the past three months and have started interviewing. Recently, I received a job offer from Europe with a similar salary (Even have option to work remotely from india) have few more offers for India and fully Remote . I'm torn between moving there or joining another organization in India. I've worked with European companies in the past and enjoyed their culture and competitive environment.

Reasons for considering a move to Europe and leaving India:

1. **Lifestyle**: Europe offers a different and potentially improved quality of life.
2. **Work Culture**: European work culture is appealing, with a focus on work-life balance.
3. **Pollution/Traffic**: Europe typically has better air quality and less traffic congestion.
4. **Value for Taxes**: I feel I don't get adequate value for the taxes I pay in India.
5. **Better Opportunities for My Child**: Europe may provide better educational and growth opportunities for my child.
6. **Toxic Relatives/Family Drama**: Distance from toxic relationships can improve my mental well-being.
7. **Work-Life Balance**: A chance to escape the bad work-life balance I experience in India.
8. **Office Politics**: A desire to avoid office politics.
9. **Personal Health**: I experienced a significant boost in my personal health following a rejuvenating vacation away from Delhi.

Reasons for staying in India:

1. **Saving**: I currently save around 70% of my salary in India.
2. **Affordability and Low Cost of Living**: India offers a more affordable cost of living.
3. **Growth in the Indian Market**: Potential for career growth in India.
4. **Familiarity**: I understand the Indian culture and environment.

I come from a lower middle-class background and have faced significant challenges during my college and early career. I know I won't have the same luxuries in Europe as I do in India, but that's not my priority. I'm willing to adjust my lifestyle, such as using public transport and giving up my car. I'd like to hear from fellow developers or expats who have experience working in Europe and their thoughts on this dilemma.

PS: Money is no longer motivation. I am already making more money in india than europe offer.

I was previously working on strategy at a regional NGO that helped North American indigenous people receive healthcare.

11e5my2,Recruiter providing Salaray range higher than what's on glassdoor. Is he trying to bait me?,"I'm looking for a DevOps role and have around 2 years of experience. Currently, I'm pretty happy with my remote job as it offers great learning opportunities. However, I've been casually browsing on LinkedIn and got contacted by a recruiter for a new role at a big retail company's IT department. The work would be similar to what I'm currently doing - deployments, migration, analytics - but with one day per month in the office. The catch is that the salary they're offering is way above my current and expected salary (around 30% more). I'm wondering if the recruiter is trying to trick me.

While I'm content with my current position, I'm open to switching companies for this type of salary. However, I'm afraid I won't be able to work up to their expectations despite the recruiter telling me it's fine. They are looking for a recent-grad with some working exp.  Now, before I start switching companies or even try to send them my full cv, I want to know if it's a bait because the recruiter seemed legit. The company also definitely is, but the salary is just what makes me suspicious. Usually, in Germany I would expect 58-65k. 75k is quite rare I guess. What's your opinion? Something seems off and I believe it's on the recruiters side...",2023-02-28 13:08:12

That being said I haven't worked as an ML engineer or professionally shipping ML products.

I'm currently having a tough time, mainly getting rejections because companies seem unwilling to sponsor my visa. A visa sponsorship would be great due to the Dutch 30% tax ruling, so it's more ideal than a partner visa. I have been looking since early November.

185ht7d,Advise me how to transition to IT,"**TLDR:** I love coding and want to get into tech. The opportunities seem far greater than my current field and I have some coding skills to make the transition happen, but I'd like some advice on how to transition ""optimally"".

**My current role and skills:** I (25|M) have been a a Groundwater Modeller for the past year and a half in small team of a multi-national company. In our field, we use a Fortran software with no GUI to simulate the groundwater flow. Due to the complexity of the models, we use/write a lot of Python or Fortran scripts to process data (with a geospatial component), and edit/visualise inputs/outputs. I learned PYthon in Uni and it's my main tool. I really enjoy coding and it has given me recognition among my team as I'm one of the best people at creating new tools for the team and I got promoted one year after starting an entry level position.

**Frustrations in my current role:** Our field struggles to employ enough people because the job is more complicated than regular environmental work and doesn't pay much better. The people who can develop coding skills tend to leave for tech roles because of the many benefits. Although I'm good at learning new things on my own, I lack support, the work it too much and not organised well enough, we're going through a rough IT transition and I'm also starting to teach new graduates. This has been a huge opportunity for growth, but I think it's not worth all the struggle anymore. The field has the same problems, so I'm switching to a similar role doesn't really make sense to me.

**For those reasons, I want to try my hand at a more tech role.** Worst case scenario I won't enjoy the work as much, but get paid better (entry level tech jobs tend to pay a bit more than my current role). But the sky is the limit.

**I'm wondering how to best utilise my skills and where to start.** I've been following the DS path on DataQuest for the past year. I'm at 50%, which covers the most common DS stach with the exception of ML (and statistics, but my math is good from uni - Civil Engineering). I also have some projects that I've put on my resume: 1 more DS based, 1 where I developped a scientific calculation code and 1 that's a modelling data visualisation tool.

**Some of my thoughts so far:**

1. **DS/DA** are fields that where my skills cover most of the needs. But DS seems to be saturated and most DA jobs won't have enough coding for my liking.
2. **SWE - Python dev** is another option, which seems to be less saturated, sounds as fun, but I may need to add some skills to my resume.
3. **DE/ Geospatial DE** may be another alternative.
4. I currently live in the UK, not in London and I'm currently on a skilled worker visa. I'm an EU citizen, which gives me more options. Switzerland is a country where I think I'd like to live.
5. I think I'm **ready** to apply for **entry level** jobs. I may need more practice on interviewing.
6. Working in a **start-up** may fit me best, especially if it's for a good cause. But that's not a mandatory.
7. I think trying to get some **freelance work** and participating in **hackathlons** would do me good.
8. I'm aiming to get to 80% of the **DS course** I've been doing, during the holidays.
9. I don't have the luxury of stopping my job to focus more on coding, but I think I don't need to anyway.

Here is my CV. I'm planning to change it a bit for each role I'm applying to.

I also work in industry, so I am not desperate about internships, since I will already have some experience and till the end of Bachelor will have even more. To complete the profile, I also speak German (obviously) and don't speak French (yet). 

So, for my, the pros and cons list looks something like this, but, again, feel free to correct me and tell me where I am wrong, since it's really an important decision. Many pros have consecutive cons as well:)

|Zurich is a really big city (I lived there for 2 years) so there will be a lot of companies and opportunities. Also, it's quite in the center of Switzerland so, if I have found some part-time job in Zug, I can easily reach it.|It will be most likely not very comfortable to get from home to University, since accommodation is quite expensive and most students live in small villages around the city.|Lausanne is more like Basel, where I can just go out and reach everything in 15 minutes by walking, with bicycle it's even faster, also the accommodation is much cheaper and you will get something good.|Since Lausanne (and french part) is not that big and it-developed, there probably will be less opportunities and less jobs, also because of location it will be hard to look for something in zug/sg/basel/zurich, since the time to getting there will be too big.|
|Sliiiiiightly better reputation and rankings, but I don't believe it matters something in Switzerland nor in the world|Terrible work-life balance. I don't think that studying will be easy and I will chill all the time and spend 2 days in August to prepare to exams, but it's still worse than what I have heard about uzh or epfl. But I am not sure it is same on Master, since most people have trauma about bachelor.|Better work-life balance, probably better atmosphere, possibility (and need, since it is mandatory) to do summer internships and/or internships instead or studying one semester.|\-|
|People speak English and German - I know both languages.|\-|On master people will probably speak mostly English.|Some people will speak French, which I don't know, also, I will be treated different when I will try to find a job, since I don't speak French (it affects not all the companies, but some of them for sure)|

Disclaimer: I don't really care about some things, that can be considered as pro or cons - amongst them type of people (fr vs de), city size in terms of activities/food (I can always reach Geneva from epfl) and let's assume I won't get any fellowship/stipendium.

I am a mobile dev working with a native stack, and I can’t help but feel that using cross platform frameworks to create apps will only become more and more common, reducing the opportunities for native development. 

I know that for many scenarios native development is the only way (see games) and I understand that native solutions can be more performant and also not be limited in their access to device hardware capabilities/features. BUT look at flutter/react native and their rise in popularity over a short timespan. It’s not ridiculous to say that mobile development as a whole could end up being much more comprised of cross platform solutions than native ones. Of course the market grows and thus so does the talent pool, but it seems to me that cross platform apps could take up a much larger portion of the market than they do at present.

First Job:

i started working as a working student for a company of 2 people and was running projects on my own and then i have quit in the middle of the project because i was clearly underpaid and worked 60+ hours a week in a toxic environment. After i quit and started a new job the old employer sent an Email to me with a CC to my new company saying that i didn't work as a software engineer but rather as a social media something and was trying his best in the email to make me look bad. I called them on the phone saying what is wrong with you, they answered that it's because i have quit in the middle of the project.

second job:

it was after that 2 people job, this company is a little bigger, around 15 people, but even with 15 people i had my first experience with office politics. on my first day, one coworker accused me of stealing his expensive mouse because he left it right beside me and it's gone, the boss had to search my bag and i felt so embarrassed and humiliated. i worked there for 2 years just because i needed money to continue financing my college education and i had developed a romantic relationship to a girl there, one time i was walking beside her talking about tango dancing and my boss walking in front of us trying to hear the conversation, i said hey to him, and suddenly he pushed me away and kept talking with her after that i have quit again. 

i was without a job for 4 months until i found something

third job( first job out of college)

i have worked hard to build a project in a newly founded team, i thought i will get promoted or something because i was very underpaid, my manager changed and my new boss is someone who didn't like me from day one, so he brought his friend as a lead on the team and project. there was no promotion in sight so i changed to another company.

fourth job:

this was at a famous company in Berlin. I have passed the probation period and by then it's very hard to fire me. i had a very good manager at the beginning, he was supportive, empathetic and a good human being. after that he changed with a new one, the new guy stayed under the radar for his probation period and after that the bullying began. I always had a normal 1:1 meetings with him until one day he started screaming saying that i was passive aggressive, all my colleagues hate me, i will never get promoted and this is shortly after announcing the Mass layoffs and he wanted me to change companies, i have made a meeting with all my colleagues to ask them if i was really passive aggressive, they have all denied it and one of them told me that the manager was persuading him to testify falsely against me. I talked to the diversity team and they assured me that they can help me with that. the problem was, he was the head of engineering so my career is basically over at that company, although i could have gone to the police or lawyered up to fight back. i have decided to leave.

fifth job:

i worked my ass off and was a good boy, only for the manager to humiliate me at the end saying bullshit excuses like i don't work hard and so on. the real reason to fire me was because he wanted to bring his best friend from Iran to Europe and replace me by him.",2023-09-02 15:21:45

I can solve at least 1 problem on a weekday and 8 problems in a weekend. This means that I can solve at least 13 problem per week. (Of course I can solve more if I see mostly easy problems in a week).

4 * 7 = 28 weeks, 28 * 15 = 364. So, I can solve **at least** 364 problems in a 4-months period.

Leetcode has 2 lists of problems - [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) and [Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/). If I choose 75, I can repeat the 75 problems 4.8 times. If I choose 150, I can repeat them 2.4 times.

I'm a believer of learning something through repetition. If I go for 75, I'd have a good understanding on the problem solving patterns for these 75 problems by repeating them nearly 5 times (or more). However, I don't feel that 75 is large enough. If I choose 150, I could repeat all the problems only 2 to 3 times, which I don't feel is good enough either.

I'm a software engineer who's working in the industry for 5+ years with a fairly traditional BSc+MSc in engineering/Computer Science, so I'm not sure what advise to give actually on how to best transition into software engineering these days. I'd love to get some help from the community.

A few facts about my friend:
* 25 years
* based in Germany, but could also stay in London for a few months due to some of his family/friends living in London
* Started his bachelors (social sciences) but might not want to finish it, unless there's a strong reason why that makes the transition to SWE easier
* Not really much software experience yet, but started to learn python recently. Therefore he doesn't have an area yet that he wants to target, he's probably open to whatever is most feasible.

Some advise/options I've been thinking of (just to throw something out there that you can criticise/expand on):
* Learn the basics via self-study resources ([https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [https://www.codecademy.com/catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog), ..., coursera classes)
* Once they know a programming language (probably python in his case) search for github projects that have a nice community and welcome external contributions: to get experience with real world projects, and get his code reviewed.
* Search for software apprenticeships positions
* Finish the bachelor's, then apply for a 1-2 years MSc in Computer Science that don't require a BSc in Computer Science

Obviously there are also 'bootcamps' but I don't know much about them ...

147723x,Seeking Salary Negotiation Tips for Junior Software Engineer in the Netherlands,"Hey there, fellow Redditors!

I'm a Junior Software Engineer based in the Netherlands and could really use some advice on salary negotiation. With around 1 year of experience and graduating with honors and Cum laude from TU Delft, I want to ensure I'm fairly compensated and have room for growth. Here are my specific questions:

  1)  What is the average yearly raise for junior software engineers in the Netherlands?
    I'd love to know the typical salary progression for junior software engineers in the Netherlands. Any industry standards or general guidelines I should be aware of when it comes to salary increases over time?

   2) Should I ask for a raise at least matching the inflation rate this year?
    Considering the high inflation rates recently, is it reasonable to request a salary increase that keeps up with inflation? I want to make sure my purchasing power remains stable. Any thoughts on factoring in inflation during salary negotiations?

   3) Am I underpaid? Currently earning 3000 euros per month with 1 year of experience.
    Given my current situation, I'm curious to know if my salary aligns with the average for a junior software engineer in the Netherlands. Considering my academic achievements and work experience, should I be aiming for a higher salary? I'd appreciate any insights you may have.

Thanks for taking the time to read my post and share your thoughts.",2023-06-11 22:12:24

It bothers me so much that I am thinking about writing the recruiter and explaining myself. Expressing that I really liked the conversation and be open about my mistakes and how it bothers me.

16cbj5w,Trying to relocate to Europe from India,"Hello

I am an Indian working as Mulesoft Developer in Bangalore (7+ years of exp total and relevant) with an annual salary of 3.3 Million INR (37K Euro), if you factor in PPP it is very good for living here. I want to relocate to EU due to better QoL, Work Life Balance, better value for taxes, even Less Traffic/Pollution. Also, I love traveling and it's my dream to travel within Europe and would prefer living there and traveling to neighboring countries than taking expensive flights to spend 1-2 week once a year in the EU.

Last month, I was contacted by a Polish company and they quoted TC of \~65K Euro gross but then for some reason they didn't proceed further. Anyway, the TC they were giving wouldn't have made much difference in savings after accounting for taxes and high CoL there which I am fine with.  As long as I am not living miserably there and can live a decent lifestyle I am OK.

&#x200B;

I don't have any dream company or country as such but would prefer to move to Poland/Belgium/Netherlands/Germany/Denmark. In last 2 months I have applied to maybe about 100 jobs but faced rejection, they don't even consider interviewing just outright rejection which is probably due to sponsorship reasons and would be a headache for them.

Any tips would be welcomed on how to approach this.

&#x200B;

Our plan is for me to move first, settle and then my wife would join me or vice versa. She is full-stack developer with the same years of experience.

Should I make the switch to another company?

However, this is also benefiting the company, as my boss is very happy with my work, same with the customers. I was able to fix a lot of stuff.

17n53f9,How difficult is it to get a job in Paris from another EU country and what salary could I expect with a CS masters + no experience?,"I will finish my masters next semester and I´ve been contemplating the possibility of moving to Paris when im done. I already know French (good enough to read books, still need to sharpen my conversation skills) and spent a semester abroad in Lisbon. I am an EU citizen.

Since my standards are already low as a student there should be no better moment to move to Paris and continue to live in a shoebox.


What salary can i expect with a masters in CS and no previous work experience? Will companies take me seriously if i havent yet moved to France when applying for a position?


Looking at Glasdoor there is a pay range of €41K to €54K for 0-1 years of experience. With a masters I probably wouldnt get the lowest pay or below average.


Using the government [net income after taxes tool](https://code.travail.gouv.fr/outils/simulateur-embauche), a salary of €41K would leave me with €2405 after taxes. The rule in Paris/France is that you can spend at most 1/3 of your income after taxes on rent otherwise you wont be given a contract. That would leave me with around €800 for an apartment, which is not enough for an apartment in Paris as I understand. I would have to commute from the cheaper suburbs (or would even they be too expensive?) with this pay.

The [cost of living](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Paris) implies €50k (€950 for rent) would be needed to be able to get an apartment outside the city centre,  but i dont know how likely such an offer would be.",2023-11-03 21:06:23

I do not have computer science or a STEM degree and managed to get the current job after completing the bootcamp, doing some personal projects and passing the interview.

When I was applying to junior positions I was levering my personal projects and the bootcamp experience. But now I am not completely sure how to maneuver.

Should when applying to newer positions I mainly leverage my 8 month experience that I have or should I create some more impressive personal project together with leveraging my work experience ? Do personal projects even matter after gaining some experience ? Or should I mainly just talk about the 8 month experience that I got after working at my current company ?

Some companies are asking for skills and technologies that I am not currently using at my job ? Would it give me boost if I did some personal projects and took some courses related to these technologies or would that not be relevant and only be relevant if I had this experience from work?",2023-11-02 11:18:38

131mc2m,"Bad career path, need advice","Hello,

I am very anxious about my career. I am located in Poland. My track seems to look extremely bad and I don't know how to fix it. It looks like that: - 3 months summer internship

\- (studies on top country's university)

\- 9 months of first work after BSc graduation; at the end I started to have poor performance and got kicked out (by agreement of the parties but the decision was on their end); It was suggested I can try going back if I gain back my performance

\- 4 months break

\- 4 months in consulting where they basically said that I am not enthusiastic enough to sell me to foreign customers and kicked me (by agreement of the parties but I had no say other than going to court)

\- 11 months in an awesome product company, where at the end I had a mental breakdown and got fired for missing days of work without informing about it; it was the biggest screwup in my career

\- 13 months break where my mental state was extremely bad (I lost my friends and had no contact with anyone) and only at the end of this period I gained a bit of motivation and confidence to resume my career; the upside of this is that it was during COVID so it is easier to explain : P

\- currently 16 months in WITCH company (I took what was available for me after such unemployment period)

So currently I gained back some more confidence lost during my biggest mental breakdown period. I learned a lot of things during my stay here but besides self-driven trainings, it was all sitting on a bench and developing an internal application. It is fine for a while but this app is nothing like a serious project. Recently I was also almost (it didn't happen because the client pulled back) assigned to a project demanding 60% time in travel (with no additional compensation and unpaid 12h of travel time per week) - when I was joining it was not supposed to happen, it was said that travel will be voluntary. During those 16 months, I had no interview for a project, I am nowhere near to promotion (I am still at the lowest level) as it requires time spent on client projects, salary upgrades are almost nonexistent even for assigned people, and I feel mistreated for this (described above) proposal as similar obligatory-to-take offers might happen anytime with no without regards of my needs.

Now I wonder if I should endure and stay in the current company, gaining (a bit empty but still) YoE there or hop. I was planning to stay at this company for a long time but I was not aware that it treats its employees so poorly and that bench time can be so long.

It is an especially uncomfortable situation as I want to fix my career track : | If it was my 1st-2nd company I would hop, but with such a bad track it might be not recommended long-term

A month ago I started to look for a new job in product companies that seemed interesting to me. I passed the initial screening and am at various stages of recruitment in:

\- US ad tech company with a branch in my country

\- US video entertainment company with a branch in my country

\- US networking company remotely

\- US cloud unicorn start-up remotely

I know that I won't get a final offer from most of them - even one offer would be great - but after some research (turnover rate, reviews, getting to know their products, seeing interesting challenges in their work) they all seem like a much better place to work than a current company (grass always greener, I know, but I work at WITCH :P)

**Would you recommend me stay in my current company or to switch it if I receive an offer from one of those companies? Also, any additional suggestions how to fix my career path would be much appreciated**",2023-04-28 09:09:15

I am working the recent years as Python developer, mostly as freelancer and I also worked on a couple of contracting roles. Now I am at freelancing, sometimes I have work sometimes I have less.

I know that many guys are building games, websites, startups, apps, mobile apps, SaaS, from scratch, but all these projects have a huge level of uncertainty. Is there any safer way to invest some time writing code and have a secured income, even if it's lower that the common freelancing rates?

190x9j1,Need career advice: Switching to Frontend Developer in NL without a tech degree or experience,"Hi Redditors,  
I'm seeking guidance on my career path as I'm feeling lost and unsure of which direction to take. I recently relocated to the Netherlands as a dependent and hold a highly skilled work permit. Currently, I'm working remotely for a non-EU company in a role that frustratingly doesn't align with industry standards and pathetic work culture. With my MBA background and limited experience (around 2 years), I'm struggling to find suitable opportunities in international companies in the Netherlands due to language barriers (Dutch proficiency required) and high experience expectations (3-5 YOE minimum). This leaves me with limited options and intense competition.  
While considering learning Dutch, I'm hesitant due to my short-term (max. 3 years) stay in the EU and the significant effort required to achieve fluency. My partner suggested transitioning into a Frontend Developer role, as there are more English-speaking openings. I'm willing to invest wholeheartedly in this transition but unsure of whether I can be considered a viable candidate without a tech degree or relevant experience in the Netherlands.

17togjv,Data Science Salary Increase Negotiations,"Hi all, I'll be re-negotiating my salary with my team lead and department head soon and would love to get some outside feedback on expectations and demands for that.  
  
short version: I'm currently making 115k(+5k bonus) as data scientist (2 yoe) in the Zurich area and lately taking on a lot more ML engineering type work together with more responsibility. What salary range should I aim for/expect? What salary jumps did you have/see in the first years of your careers in similar roles?  
  
long version: I started my career with my current company as part of a rotation program a bit more than two years ago after finishing a data science degree at ETH Zürich in the top 2.5%. I did my first rotation in 2021, where I took a department's first data science project from idea to production (nothing sophisticated but running stably since). I did two rotations in other business areas before rejoining the department of my first rotation (only software/data engineering roles before that).  
  
I was brought back as a data scientist primarily for computer vision (aside from some courses, never did this before) for a project that they only had an intern doing exploratory work on at the time. Together with him (now junior data scientist), we brought two deep learning models to production in the last months and have received very positive customer feedback. I also made a big effort to establish better practices (code reviews, mlops, dev/test/prod infra with terraform) in our team while trying to keep up our velocity of delivering. At the beginning of next year, another data scientist will join our team.  
  
Our team manager has limited DS background and works primarily as PO for a different application. Hence, I took over most of our client contacts and organizational topics - luckily limited for a team of two. I'm not too keen on these tasks and would like to stay more technical, but there is no one else willing to do them besides me.  
  
We are not an R&D company and there is a lot of excitement from IT management about data science but also some shying away from the complexity and difficult to foresee outcomes and their business value.",2023-11-12 17:01:47

165lmvq,Seeking Advice: Reasons for switching jobs after one month,"Hey everyone,

I recently graduated with a degree in computer science and have been working as a web developer at a small company (10 devs) for the past month.   
Prior to this, my experience in web development was limited, though I had a few personal projects under my belt and research experience in other areas.Overall, I enjoy the work environment. The company offers a lot of freedom, but there's an expectation to be available for emergencies outside of working hours. 

The main issue I have is with the salary, which is below average for my role and the city I'm in.Given these concerns, I started looking for other opportunities and have been invited for an interview at another company. They've provided a salary range, and even the lower end is 20% higher than what I'm currently earning. 

I'm wondering why they invited me, given my limited experience as a web developer. Perhaps they're interested in my research background?Here's where I need advice: I'm certain the topic of why I'm looking to switch jobs so soon will come up during the interview. 

I'm worried they might think I'd leave them just as quickly. The honest reasons for my job search are the salary and the desire for more home office.  
The new company is very small (5 devs).

Is it okay to be upfront about these reasons? What should I avoid mentioning, and where should I place the emphasis?Thanks in advance for your insights!",2023-08-30 17:51:33

I’ve been applying for roles near him in for six months at this point, but I’m still a bit of a junior dev and haven’t gotten any hits (just a single interview). 

We’re both getting tired of living like this, apart for so long and facing endless uncertainty of when a job could get me over there.  

Recently, we started talking and I’m thinking in six more months (if I haven’t landed a UK job yet) I might just start a civil partnership with him and move me over with that. The only problem is I wouldn’t have a job or be able to work for a time during that process. 

Would employers care if I’m currently unemployed/ there’s a gap on my resume due to a move like that? Is the market still so bad that a hit like that might leave me unemployed for months? Would it be safer to just ride out my current job a while longer? 

This would be my second software dev job so I’m just trying to gauge what I should expect with this route if it comes down to it. 

I assume I’d be more appealing if I was eligible to work in the UK, but I just worry that at my current level a gap in my resume would be a big hit.

But then I search for English-only remote jobs in Germany or the Netherlands and there are very few. Apparently German companies expect you to work remotely in German while living in Germany. This looks ridiculous to me. They could save a lot of money hiring remotely, paying salaries below German levels.

Am I correct that English-only remote jobs are almost non-existant? Take the EURES site for example: there are like tens of thousands of openings in Germany at any moment, but if you filter for vacancy language: English they become like 3 openings.

192ogu5,Life Decision - Germany: Java Software Engineer vs Low Code Analyst,"Hi everyone,

I am have been working with Java,Spring Boot, SQL, Google Cloud for 2+ years. Before that, I did IoT and Frontend. In total 3y of experience. While doing Java, I did job hopping several times and currently making 62k€ brutto, I know its not too much.

I find coding hard and challeging. I stress myself out when I pick a task at Jira and get nervous when I stuck with developing the feature. Agile meetings like daily, secret story point giving game(refinement), retrospective etc. there is always a push for talking, being creative, being loud and when you are silent, they think you are stupid. Its not easy at all to become a senior dev.

Mainly because I don't enjoy so much coding, I was thinking to switch other directions. 
Cloud? DevOps? Requirements gathering? Business Analyst? Data Analyst/Engineer?

I dont know which one would fit me. Currently, I have the ""Engineer"" title in my position but if I switch to an Analyst position it will be gone. Does it impact something?

I also have this challange: shortest time-maximum money because I actually want to become a commercial pilot since my chilhood and before I get too old for it, I need to save enough money for my pilot licence (140k €). 

What do you suggest? Bite your teeth and continue to do Java, be done with money saving in 4 years, go to a flight school and become a pilot?

Or switch to another job in IT, which you don't know if you will like or not, decrease your chances to increase your salary by job hopping, maybe save the money in 5-6 years, but dont bother with implementing features?

If I get a Business Analyst position contract now and if I try out but don't like, would I find a job again as a dev or would HRs judge why have I done so?


Sorry for lots of questions. I sometimes have headaches while implementing sth and looking for another way to save good money with my computer engineering degree and experience.

Thanks a lot!",2024-01-09 20:20:19

18jqp6t,[rant] Urge to give client some criticism before exiting,"Longish story short, I've been working as a consult for a large organization for a while, and they recently terminated my contract due to me underperfoming. The organization lauded themselves in a lot of positive adjectives, but I saw none of that; on the contrary.  
I had serious motivational issues prior to stepping into this organization, basically burnt out already, but hearing those good things from them firstly made me to give it a go.  
I thought I had cleared the air about my frustrations when I had a discussion with the manager about the reasons of me underperforming. It really felt more constructive than I expected. I thought my side had been heard and understood. That discussion made me a bit more optimistic and I dedicated myself more to my work. And I thought I was doing an ok job with it.  
Nevertheless, a month later, as they renegotiated their contracts for externals (as mandated by law), mine was terminated. Asking around, I got an explanation – given by the same manager I had the discussion earlier – that they were still not happy about my performance. This hit me hard as I felt I had pretty much drawn my last bits of energy to do my work, and made me to question my professional skills.   
The way it was communicated struck to me as very unprofessional too, via chat, worded as bluntly and informally as possible, with the intention that each two word reply would be the manager's last words on the subject. I'm not sure why this is the case, I can only guess they're covering themselves from possible blowback.   
I guess it can be argued that they're free to communicate it any way they like to, or not at all, as picking up and discarding consults (though mainly for economic reasons) regardless of circumstances, is par for the course.   
But it is rather ironic from an organization that self-congratulates for being friendly and transparent. I saw no displays of that in my time there. There's obviously a disconnect between the higher ups, who believe in their own dreams, and the reality of those who do the gruntwork.  
After all this, as I'm exiting the organization – which is rather psychologically taxing I gotta say, as I'm working with the same people that rejected me behind my back – I feel the urge to voice these frustrations. I don't know whether this results in trouble later on. I'll never work in this organization again, but the circles are rather small. Better just to swallow the bitter pill and move on?  
My motivation for this is that I feel that giving this a pass is making things too easy for them, as well as me meekly accepting the way things are handled, even if the ground reasoning are truthful, though harsh.

*EDIT: Thanks for the advice (so far). 
I already typed a mail to be sent to them, but maybe I'll end up trashing it, based on your feedback.
The big silver lining in all this is that I was going to leave anyway, and they removed all the friction from it.*",2023-12-16 12:58:41

18elmv9,Advice on which courses I should take for cybersecurity/SWE?,"Hey everyone! As the title suggests, I have finally settled on 2-3 topics in CS I would be happy pursuing a career in once Im out of school. The third unmentioned topic is AI/ML, but I’ll mention later why I didnt include it. 

Essentially, I have researched and concluded the math and statistics courses I can take that can benefit me and prepare me better for work in these areas, but now I have to learn which computer science topics I can research and learn about to help become more knowledgeable in these studies. 

For example, for cybersecurity I am taking cybersecurity courses of course, but I am also taking cryptography and considering data mining. For software engineering, I am just taking the software engineering classes as I am not entirely sure which would be best for SWE. I disregarded AI/ML because some of the results in my Cybersecurity research suggested that AI/ML could assist in the area of cybersecurity, so I was thinking I could incorporate just ML or AI to help deepen my understanding and applicative skills for cybersecurity.

I mainly need assistance tracking down what I should prioritize to increase my knowledge and best prep me for SWE, as well as suggestions for cybersecurity. Any advice is super appreciated!

Hey fellow coders,

I recently took my midterm for CSC 211, and I went in feeling confident about my coding skills. However, the exam turned out to be written, and I found myself stuck, struggling to translate my understanding into code. It left me questioning my coding abilities and feeling a bit disheartened.

Has anyone else faced a similar situation in their programming journey? How did you overcome such challenges, especially when it comes to coding under exam conditions? I'm eager to hear your stories and gather some insights on how to improve my coding skills, especially in written exam formats.

Do you have any tips, resources, or strategies that helped you become more comfortable with coding in written exams? I'm open to any advice or experiences you're willing to share.

1. What will my job opportunities be in Germany after I complete my bachelors of computer science in German Language. I watched a few youtube videos and the guy said that you have a high chance of getting a low cgpa as the program will be in German and high cgpa means less job opportunities. So I'm a bit confused about if I'm making the right move.

2. Can I get a job if I have a low cgpa but I have studied in a german taught program and know C1 German? 

3. Is it true that only German companies will hire me in Germany if I do my bachelors in CS in german? Can I work in an english company in Germany? (Like in an english speaking environment)

4. Are there any disadvantages of doing my bachelors in a german taught CS program? Can I do my masters in english afterwards? Can I work in different countries such as USA and Australia (Main goal is to work in Germany though)

5. Will I have any difficulty working in a German Speaking Company?

In my team I have 2 really good developers who are expats, but most devs (70 devs or so) are just putting in their hours and going home, which is fine. It's the company culture. I'm learning a lot from these 2 guys, but my project will end soon so we'll be dispersed. I'm studying and coding a lot in my free time and having a lot of fun. But it would be nice to have this at work. 

I am considering switching to a company where the dev teams are really passionate about their work, in my case something with Java, because I miss the excitement to learn, improve and get better where I am at. I know that it's most likely about finding a team that works this way, and doesn't have to be the whole org, but you get the gist of what I'm asking hopefully.

BTW i'm an extrovert, very social and fluent in Dutch, so language isn't an issue either.

1) In general, are companies going to skip over my CV, because they see 2+ years of experience and therefore consider me too ""experienced"" for an intern?



2) I am planning to terminate my contract with the company in February 2024. I am also preparing to start applying for Summer 2024 internships in the next few weeks. Is it an issue for companies if they see that I'm still employed at the time of the interviews. Should I try to end my contract ASAP and then begin applying for internships?

16xr7a0,Do you think my career plan is realistic/achievable?,"Hi. I'm a Canadian resident, graduating next year with a bachelor's degree in computer science from an American university. I'm looking towards the EU job market for a number of reasons. Unfortunately I will not have any internships due to studying over the summers to graduate faster(20 months total), so it will just be my education and projects on my CV.

Ideally I would like to find a fully/mostly remote SWE(or similar) and live in a more affordable country, many offer digital nomad visas now. I understand there can be tax complications with cross-border work, but many people here have said that you can just have a B2B arrangement and officially work as a freelancer, and just do all your own taxes.

Unfortunately some things are too good to be true, so I have a few concerns/doubts about this.

\- **Would companies be open to a B2B arrangement, especially for junior roles?** I don't expect to be actually treated like a freelancer, it would just be for tax purposes. Would companies save a significant amount of money on taxes/benefits with B2B vs. employee? I've also read about your stronger employee protection laws, is it significantly easier to fire contractors?

\- **VAT.** Not sure how it works in the EU, the EU website does say that the seller generally doesn't have to charge/pay VAT for clients that are businesses in another EU country.

\- **Language.** Some people here have said that English is often the primary work language for SWE jobs in much of the EU, how true is this?

\- **Pay.** Do you think it's realistic to find a company willing to pay 50k/60k B2B, no benefits, in such a situation? I understand a salary of 50/60k for a junior is considered high in the EU, generally only for big cities in wealthier countries, but this is taking into account the cost of taxes/benefits of a contractor vs an employee

\- **Remote work availability.** How common is it in the EU? Unfortunately a lot of companies are forcing RTO in Canada and the US. And what about for juniors specifically, I've heard some people say that junior roles are less likely to be remote whereas others say it's usually based on team/company. I would be okay with commuting to the office like once a month or something.

\- **Degree.** I see a lot of people here talking about master's degrees, in Canada and the US that's really pretty uncommon for CS jobs unless they're switching careers. Will not having one put me at a significant disadvantage?

**In my head this all sounds like a good plan but I don't want to have unrealistic expectations so I'm asking here, and I would appreciate your insight! I don't expect anyone here to have answers to all my questions but if you know anything related to what I'm asking, please do share. Thanks!**

16x5bqx,Data Engineering vs Software Engineering,"Hi,

I'm a graduate with a pretty unique background (scientific computing). Lots of programming experience but nicher applications like supercomputing/parallel computing. I think due to this most recruiters see this as non-related to CS which puts me at a slight disadvantage.

Anyway, I've been applying tons and hearing nothing back despite decent CV. I'm wondering how the market for Data Engineering is and if I have a better chance of landing a job as a DE. As I understand it DE and SWE are quite similar in some respects so I'm curious if DE tends to hire from CS or non-CS grads more.

Interestingly, I'm seeing a lot of training schemes that train you up as a DE for 4 months and connect you with an employer (for free). I interviewed with them and didn't get a place but asked questions and they said they switched from training SWE to DE as they identified it as being more viable for non-CS graduates.

What do you guys think? Anyone has experience being a DE/applying to be one?",2023-10-01 16:15:56
16wyl4o,Seeking delusional WLB: Can freelancing be the answer?,"Hi guys,

I recently finished my computer science studies and am now embarking on the job search. However, I've come to realize something crucial about my priorities: I don't want to dedicate the majority of my life to work, especially when life has so much more to offer.

From a financial standpoint, earning around 45 to 50% of a typical annual salary would suffice for me. Living in Switzerland, this would be around 3.5k - which I understand is a full-time salary in many countries. For me, beyond that point, free time becomes more valuable than additional money.

Here's my (delusional) dream job scenario:
- Working at around 60-70% for 30 to 40 weeks a year, with a portion of that being remote from abroad.
- Taking 12 to 20 weeks off, scattered throughout the year in 2 to 4-week blocks.

I know most employers might laugh at such a proposition. The more realistic alternatives might be to work continuously for 7-9 months and then quit, or seek unpaid leave, although that wouldn't distribute my free time as I'd like. This brings me to the thought that freelancing might be the most feasible option. This way, I could pick month-long projects or longer ones with gaps in between.

Another avenue I'm considering is developing a SaaS that provides me with a passive monthly income.

Don't get me wrong, I love software development. I invest personal time into it, especially when something excites me. But there are many other things in life that fascinate me. Once I reach a certain financial comfort, it seems unnecessary to work more just because that's the norm.

I believe I'm reasonably talented in general, and now I'm trying to figure out the path forward. Do you think freelancing aligns best with my goals? Maybe work some time at a small company, get essential for them and then change the contract type to freelance?

Additionally, as a more realistic compromise, which types of companies tend to offer more opportunities for extended unpaid leaves? Larger companies that can more easily find replacements or smaller ones that value trust and may rely more on individual contributions?

I appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have!",2023-10-01 11:21:27

16rf9yp,Is studying data science a good idea?,"So first off I'm not from a European country(mainly Germany if I can), the reason I'm posting this here is that I plan to come here after I finish my studies (I can't afford bachelors in the eu so I'm gonna have to do it here), also my knowledge is very limited so please correct me if I say something incorrect, also English isn't my first language so please bear with me.

I wished to study CS or SE in my city but unfortunately the only available options for me are: 
Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
Cyber Security (which I'm staying away from for work-life balance)
Intelligent Systems

I'm going to start college next week and I've already selected data science (I can still switch to a different program but the deadline is this week)

There are some CS subjects in all of them (I don't currently have the exact names of the subjects but I'll try to get them and edit the post).

Now to the reason I made this post:
Will I be able to find work with just bachelors? (Because I heard it's hard to find Data Science or Cyber Security jobs without a Masters or PhD degree), Can I work in jobs that SE or CS grads work or it'll be hard as my degree will say I studied Data Science (aside from having to study what I need for that job myself, not sure if that's possible because at least where I'm from they look at the degree before anything).

TLDR; Is it possible to work in fields that CS/SE grads work with a Data Science degree?

I just graduated in May and started looking for jobs in July. It's been two months and I haven't had much luck at all, so I've been thinking about branching outside of North America for jobs. As of now I know almost nothing about the industry in Europe, and I'm open to everywhere but am especially interested in Germany. I had a few questions if anyone doesn't mind giving me some perspective, I would really apppreciate it :)   


1) Is the job market for entry level developers also really bad in Europe right now? It seems like it's pretty tough right now especially in Toronto.  
2) I graduated from the University of Waterloo here, which across the big tech hubs in North America is known as a top-tier school. Does it also hold any weight in Europe, or less so?  
3) Is knowing the language essential for applying to jobs? I am fluent in English and sort of speak French, but nothing else.  
4) What are the major tech hubs in Europe? Are there any places in particular that stand out as good options? I'm an asian guy so I would prefer somewhere that has some asian people, or at the very least is very welcoming for foreigners. A big food scene is a very big plus too.  
5) What are typical TCs like compared to bigger NA cities (Toronto, SF, NYC, etc.)?

15qdiy8,Moving to a different country for first job,"I just graduated with a BSc that was half computer science half electrical engineering from a good university, per the standards of my country (maybe mid rank in Europe - the university is Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon if that matters). I'm from Portugal.

I have a very strong GPA, but no outside projects or internships and honestly feel like I didn't learn and don't know that much. I decided against doing a Master's because it seems not too relevant for the industry and right now I don't feel like going for a PhD anyway.

To try to make up for my lack of CV, I currently got a low level internship at my University, developing software for integrating cryptographic systems for the military. The work is fun and challenging enough, but the pay is too low for me to stay, and I can't publish the code because it is classified.

Apart from that, I'm working on doing [pwn.college](https://pwn.college) and learning reverse engineering by myself.

I want to move from Portugal to literally anywhere else inside the Schengen area where I can earn more by getting a job as a developer there. I have a strong preference for jobs in embedded systems, regular computer systems software, security, C or C++ programming and/or multithreaded development. As my degree was half EE, I'm comfortable (for a new grad with experience outside of college) with hardware as well.

How can I best make this switch and land a job at a country where the net income including cost of living is decent? I'm thinking Ireland/Switzerland/Nordic Countries/Germany/France/Netherlands/Luxembourg. However, I'm willing to move to literally anywhere inside the Schengen Area.

I recently accepted an offer from a consulting company and im set to start there soon. I have been on the phone with the recruiter/hr person as they are trying to find a suitable project and arrange an interview with the customer, so that when I start I could start working on a project straight away and be productive. Makes sense

They had couple of projects that could be suitable, but neither of them ended up working out, because the customer wanted experience on certain techs that I had no experience with.

Currently I am bit worried that if there is no project for me when I start that my visit there might be shortlived as it is basically very easy for them to end the contract within the 6 months trial time after new person starts.

So, I was thinking of calling the recruiter to ask about possible projects and if there is something I can do on my part to help them finding a suitable project for me. E.g learning a new tech.   
Is this a good idea?   
I think its generally good idea to show iniative and if it actually comes down to learning something, I have bit short of 2 months of time to practice, but at the same time I find that by doing this I could come across overly eager or something.

I’ve applied to multiple positions in which some I’m still waiting for a response and in other cases I was rejected, I don’t know the reason why, maybe my profile didn’t match with the job, maybe it was the reason I don’t live in the EU? I’m not sure. 

Do you have any advice? I’d appreciate it.",2023-05-12 14:41:14

12ksuyi,Is IT Consultant a good entry into tech?,"Hey everyone!
I am currently teaching myself how to code and enjoying it immensely. However, my background is in  finance (specifically external auditor) and working in a big 4 consulting firm. My firm currently has an opening for IT Consultant with finance background so technically, an ERP consultant (Azure, Microsoft 365, etc). I applied and got an offer to transfer.
I know it is totally different from programmer but would this be a good entry into the industry?
The only reason I’m thinking of keeping my current job as an auditor is for the global mobility opportunities. I am based in Malta and if I stay as an auditor for another year or so, I can relocate to a bigger country with better opportunities (I am an immigrant from Asia so it’s a bit hard for me to move countries)

12jhchz,CV Review (UK): a few queries,"Hi — I'm career switching, and I've put together a CV to apply for a first role (UK), front end. I'm self-taught, rather than bootcamp or similar. There's loads of great advice already on threads like mine that I've benefitted from, but I'd appreciate any comments. I also have a few queries/concerns that it would be good to get set straight on:

* Should Projects come beneath Education (i.e Experience at the top)? N.B Rationale for the way it is right now is that the Projects section is the most relevant to SWE.
* Is the Experience 'too commercial'? I probably have examples of some more technical things done, but these are far, far more trivial (think 'wrote a script to do X'). What should the balance be between more 'major', non-technical responsibilities/achievements vs any 'minor' technical/SWE-adjacent stuff for someone who is career-switching (i.e 0 YOE in programming)?
* Are the Experience bullet points too long — i.e  should be one line?
* Would this pass ATS?

* Certified as a DevOps Leader (From DevOps Institute) & Azure Fundamentals.
* Doing a part-time MSc (ETA 2024)
* Salary £38k, perm position will bring it up to around £47k although I think this is less than going market rate.

I want to be hitting a large salary and I understand that requires a large amount of dedication. I an keen to say that I am for now money focused. I have had many interferences throughout my life of people trying to steer me in a certain way and me having to battle my way around these issues. I am now 28 years old and still have nothing to my name.

My wife works in a healthcare related role where she can pick up shifts and earn almost £500 a day (after tax/deduction etc). If that was me in her boots I would be milking as many of those shifts as possible and build up enough income to start investing and look to have that level of financial stability.

I struggle sometimes, I am working more or less 9am to 5pm monday to friday and even with the long weekend we have just had in the UK I am bored and would like to still be making some sort of income.   


The current economic situation looks bleak for IT contracting and I am hesitant on transitioning to that and even with other roles I am hesitant on switching for now. I probably will like to tranisition in the next year or two but before I begin that what can I possibly do in preparation for that?

120i76s,What to do? Need advice,"Hi! 

I'm currently working in a role as a Data Engineer, I have already 1 year of experience at the same company.

The thing is, I'm still working as an intern, began as an intern for 5 months since I'm still finishing my degree (expected 2024) in Computer Engineering. And after finishing that, I got another internship in the same project and same team until June.

I mean, anything is better than nothing, right? But recently like 2 weeks ago had already 2 interviews with different companies, they offered me full-time job and really flexible with me finishing my degree, both 100% remote and not by time but by finishing my tasks every week so I wouldn't have any problem studying my subjects and taking exams.

Still waiting for a final call, but even though maybe they'll not call me again, I feel a little taken advantage of at my current company, because I didn't get any offer at the moment. 

I can get that it's because I'm still studying but:

- The things I work with, mostly Pyspark and Azure tech, I've learnt them at the job and through courses 
- I don't find the appeal in having on my CV in the future that I've been an intern until I finish my degree which will be putting it at more than 2 years of internship
- I'm in my late 20's so I'm not really a kid and I'm looking to upper my technical knowledge and well, get a better pay since I'm perfectly capable of learning fast. So I find it a bit odd to use with me just the degree reason.
- With one year of experience even though it's an internship, I think I could fit a lot of Data Engineering roles right now. There are a lot of students that have full-time dev jobs out there.


Currently I was looking at sites like ai-jobs.net and lurking through LinkedIn. I could ask past recruiters that offered me interviews in the past too. I was looking mostly for remote jobs or hybrid with the lesser office days. So, I could use that commute time every day to keep up with my studies, and be updated so I won't need to hyperstudy a subject within a week.

And now that it has been some weeks that the project is not advancing much, I'm not doing that much, and that doesn't help honestly, it feels a bit unfulfilling.

Maybe I'm exaggerating? I don't know, but at this stage in my life I would like to finish my degree and be able to help my family if needed, have my own car and in general to be able to travel a bit since I can't do that much now with what I'm being paid because I'm saving up mostly. I want to be a functional adult.

Anyone been through something similar? I've even heard of people being in an internship for 3 years and that it's crazy!

From Europe obviously, I wouldn't find much help asking the US subreddit.

13xjbt5,"Career advice please, where do I belong? : BSc in CS > Game Dev > Software Dev (C++) > Move to Germany > MSc in ML > AR/VR Dev in research > Data science masters thesis > Fresh Grad","**Context:** I still remember the moment that led me to computer science. I was 13-14 and I was playing the game 'Need For Speed: Most Wanted'. I was blown away. I wanted to make something like that. That eventually led me to study my bachelor's degree in computer science.

During my bachelor's, I taught myself game programming. Me and my friends participated in and won competitions as well.

But for religious reasons, I had to quit game programming (I was very religious back then). I know it sounds silly/stupid maybe but it is the truth. (funny I lost my faith a few years ago).

I worked as a C++ Software dev (C++) for 2 years. Then I came to Germany for master's degree. Here I have worked with AR/VR at a research institute. The idea of AR/VR I got during game dev I think. And I could use the same tools (i.e. Unity game engine) for AR/VR as well. My master's degree is AI related. It was and is the hype and I was curious. I tried it, and I think its fun. I did my master's thesis (my most recent project) as an internship in a reputable company.

**Now I am here.**

**Question:** I do not know where 'should' I go from here. I do know what I want. I do not know what is 'good' for me. I really liked game development but I feel like, I have killed that passion. I have killed that part of me. I also like AI-related topics like Machine learning or Reinforcement learning. My most recent project was in Data Science. I have found, that I like research but not too theoretical, which basically means Applied Research. I am scattered experiences all over the place. That can be a good thing but also can be a negative thing. Since I do not have professional experience in ML, I am not getting any call back from my job applications. Recently I got call back from some C++, because I have experience in it I am guessing. I am curious in different things and I am willing and can pick things up. Which is a good quality. But then why I am not getting any call backs? I think one of my main problems is, I am having trouble picking a direction. Game Dev? Machine Learning? C++? Research? I am always second-guessing myself. I do not know what I want. Is there any discipline that combines these different positions? Like data science in Game Dev. Or machine learning with C++. Simulation which is basically very realistic games. Maybe a combination can be a good idea. Maybe not.

Maybe I am too close to this problem. Maybe in my writing something shows up that others will be able to spot. I am putting myself in a desperate position now. Finding a job as a new grad is as hard as it is, this confusion or lack of direction is making it even more difficult. I wish someone could just tell me what to do. But this decision has to come from me.

Can you please help me? Maybe suggest me something? Or maybe ask me something that will help me give myself the insights that I need?

PS: When I was developing games, I was confident. I was grounded. I knew I do not know anything but I can figure it out. It was amazing. I had drive. I got good at it. I am not sure if I miss game development or being confident at something.

PS 2: A lot has happened recently. I lost my religion. I distanced myself from my family. I moved to Germany which was culturally really disorienting for me. I am confused on so many things.

PS 3: I know I am all over the place and I know I am asking a lot here. This confusion has been hurting me for a while now. If you could guide me I would be really grateful.

I wish you a very nice day.",2023-06-01 14:40:39

Hello, I'm close to 30, and need a career change. IT has been on my mind because of the flexibility of location, international demand that allow for emigration, and decent office hours.

My problem is, like many, I'm confused about the job prospect of this career with the rapid changes in automation technology.

Wanted to self study for quick job access compared to an hard degree lasting 3 years but figured out a degree offers better security long term , especially with job market getting more complicated as more easy things will be automated and programmer will have a more architect role.

Do you still think IT is a safe bet for a career lasting decade, I just wouldn't want to have to find somethng else to do within a decade after such hard study, because the amount of jobs will decrease significantly, Also I'm from a country where IT market isn't great, not well developed and paying like in USA but it offers jobs still

What kind of sector should one focus on in term of specialties? Is still good to focus on learning traditional currently in demand language such a java? Thanks",2023-03-31 15:38:56
11ki33v,Would you travel 8h for an interview?,"Here is the plan: 3 hours to go to the airport, 2 hours of waiting/check-in, 2 hour flight + 1 hour from the airport to the hotel. Sleep there 1 night, visit the city 1 day, have a 1 day interview from morning to night, go out, have dinner, sleep, visit the city another day and then come back. The costs covered are just the travel and maybe 1 night at the hotel (not sure).

Only 1/3 of candidates will be hired and in case I am hired the position will start in October (right now I am unemployed.. so that means I'll have no job till October).

The company is a very good one for me and my CV and I'd love to work there, salary good for the place but not amazing in comparison to other eu countries, e.g. the one where I am located now.

Would you do it? I am pretty new to all of this.. I would appreciate any kind of help from your side.. idk whether I should take such a risk just to give a 1/3 shot.. and in case I'm hired then I should wait so much time?

169tdul,Feels like I don't belong in this field,"Thing is, I always was the nerdy kid that would use his lunch money to buy computer magazines, and fawn over everything - pictures of computers, screenshots of video games, etc. but, not only I was too poor to afford one, my father also had other plans for my career and only saw the computer as a very expensive toy.

Fast forward today, after tons of failed attempts over the years to make programming my career, I somehow managed to get AND hold a front-end job for 1.5 years while I'm 42 years old. And now that I'm back to interviewing I get weird questions of ""why should we choose you over a younger candidate?"", ""how do you see yourself in 5 years from now"" (hopefully alive), etc.

So, whenever I sit down to work on my personal projects or to study a framework I'm curious about my brain keeps insulting me ""you missed your shot"", ""you're literally too late"", ""you're wasting everyone's time including your own"". It also doesn't help that any content tailored for junior developers naturally uses phrasing like ""I advice YOUNG people..."" - it makes sense since the vast majority of junior developers are young. I'm an anomaly and I don't belong here.

I've spend my whole life trying to unfuck myself from the hand life dealt to me and now I realize that it took too long. ggez Clap I guess. I don't even know why I'm posting this, I don't think you can change my mind because it's an objective fact that most HR people would laugh at me or go ""ewww this balding delusional idiot thinks he can answer our CALL FOR TALENTS, hahaha"".

Sucks that every time I try to follow my heart and put some honest work for the day I always, ALWAYS have to play tennis with the reality of the situation. God, if I feel like that then I can't even begin to imagine how women or minorities may feel like pursuing a career they like and facing all sorts of shit.

I'm a dev who graduated last year from India.I want to immigrate to europe, part of my childhood I grew up in the carribeans. This makes me want to explore the world. I'm currently working for a very large european based engineering company doing IT work( It will take too long to immigrate via them).  Initially, after I joined, I was unallocated as there weren't any projects. But I was given a choice as soon as few came as I was the best coder during the training phase( Java FullStack). I started of with a fullstack project( Java, React and Oracle). I didn't know any React, so I learnt and solved a ticket within a few days. My team member was surpirised as to how fast I could do it. I've been a very fast learner in STEM since childhood( used to read advanced physics in my mid teens ) . Then they changed me to another team for god knows what reason. Here, it's '.Net' and some Niche Tech. It's new, but I've taught myself and am fairly up to speed. Basically, considering how random the tech stack I have to work on is; I want to use another channel where I can prove my programming knack and competence. I've heard contributing to Open Source Projects is a good way. Also, my current goal is to basically move here as fast as possible, If possible with a Job. I will learn anything if it will help me. If I can't do that I'm planning on studying, but I want to work first and then study. How and where can I network online to get access to people who can help me? Where can I apply?

TL;DR: What is the most effective way to land a job? Is it easier with any specific stack? How can I showcase competence other than my work? Where can I network and apply?

115b9j4,Best way to work remotely from Croatia for a client in Luxembourg," Hi everyone,

First post here.

I am a EU resident from Belgium (where I'm living) and working as a cross-border for Luxembourg.In the next year, I would like to move to Split, Croatia with my wife and kid. My employer is fine with me doing so as a consultant (and basically send invoice every month). The only question I'm unsure about is how I do it. The only requirement I have, is that I need an address in Croatia (for school, long term residency, ...) and thus, I need to pay my taxes there.

So, I narrowed it down to 3 ways:

1. I open my own company in Luxembourg ---> However, it is apparently a no go, as in Luxembourg, there is a law against ""mailbox company"" (and basically I would be the only employee of my company and there would be nothing produced on Luxembourg soil).
2. I open a company in Croatia. --> The only issue I see is that I know nothing about the legal side in the country (I guess professionals could help me there though). My main concern is that I would need an address there to open a company, and I won't be able to set up everything beforehand
3. A friend of mine opened a company in Estonia to work remotely in the EU via [https://www.e-resident.gov.ee/become-an-e-resident/](https://www.e-resident.gov.ee/become-an-e-resident/). But I admit I know very little about the legal side of it. She told me she was only paying taxes in her country of residence + a fee on the platform (which goes to Estonia). But when I asked tax professionals in Luxembourg, they have never heard of it and can't seem to know if it is legal or not.

Do not hesitate if you see any other way.

Sorry for the long post,

Thanks.",2023-02-18 09:10:34

138u237,"Unconclusive first jobs, should I get back to uni ?","TL;DR : I have had a hard time graduating in CS(West Europe), and I failed a few first positions. This is hard mentally. I don't know if I should keep pushing on the same offers or getting back to university.

Hi.
I am going to talk a lot about concrete technologies here, but I am aware that those are only tools.

I was able to join a good graduate school without having decent math or CS prequisites. My poor rank didn't allow me to follow the AR/VR track.
I had OS-related and theoretical courses instead.

My first position as a software developer did not end well. I have a tough time learning completely on my own.

I am responsible for this, because I didn't know OOP concepts and Java well enough, let alone Maven, or Swing. My team-leader had no time to look around me so I was switched to another position in the same company, and I did not touch code at work for 3 years.

 This winter I had enough of it and I took a C++ programming position but it only lasted a 3 months, there was a mismatch between my fragile skills and client's tough requirements.

I have seen people with no CS background succeed in developer positions, but it seems like I never end up in junior-friendly position. 

Also, I do not know how to deal with job offers who are about modern stuff (React, .NET, Angular,...). There are more and more of them.

Should I continue trying this way or should I get another master degree in interactive system(in September) ?

Thank you guys",2023-05-05 16:36:31

I speak English, French (spent my formative in the Walloon part of Belgium) at a Native like Level. German fluency would be B2 but I’m positive I could improve very rapidly.

Zurich is the main tech hub of the country, but Swiss German (to me at least) sounds like a language that has the intonation of the Bavarian Dialect with Klingon and Dothraki sprinkled into it. (no offense to any Swiss German).

Are Zurich InfoSec\\Tech engineer positions requiring Swiss German proficiency? Or is Hochdeutsch sufficient?!

Does the Canton of Geneva possess somewhat the same number of Infosec Eng positions or are the opportunities in Zurich that much more available?

Any Tech presence in Lausanne?

187jr5b,"Choosing between 2 Job Offers (London): Ocado Technologies Software Engineer offer advice, experience, salary/compensation?","Hey guys,

So I managed to secure a Software Engineering Graduate offer with Ocado technologies (Hatfield/London) but I was told the starting salary is £40k no bonus, no negotiation. But I also have a higher grad offer from another company in London for £47k + 5K bonus (bonus is almost guaranteed, I know people who have done the bare minimum and gotten it) = £52K with arguably more benefits. However I believe I'll learn more at Ocado as they provide rotations and seem to be working with more advanced tech. 

The other company I've already done an internship in and it was very chill, laidback, mostly Java Spring Boot Backend dev. The culture was friendly and extremely laidback (It's a European company so makes sense lmao) but my team was mainly seniors who were a lot older than me so I didn't feel like I fully fit in. And the grad scheme is also static, where I'll be in the same team for 1.5 years, unlike Ocado's 2 year grad scheme which is in rotations with different teams and offices and even opportunities to visit partners abroad! The second company is also less known in the UK but actually much bigger especially in Europe. Both are good software engineering companies in my eyes.

I feel like I would enjoy the work more at Ocado (never worked there tho so I may be wrong) but I don't know if the difference in compensation is something that I should be thinking about at this stage in my career. If anyone could give an insight either from working at Ocado or just having experience in this field that would help with my decision.

Also if you have worked at Ocado Technologies, could you tell me more about compensation later on down the line, the working culture, technologies, and if u think it's worth the lower comp.

179n0in,Torn on returning as a math major vs switching to Computer Science.,"I got through my junior year as a mathematics major but had to drop out because of financial difficulties.

Now I'm in a position to reenter university but I'm wondering if I should switch to Computer Science.

I haven't gone to school in over 5 years so I'm worried about how rusty I would be returning to Math. . besides that, I'm under the impression that Computer Science is easier and has better job prospects?

I've heard people say a Computer Science degree is just really advanced Discrete mathematics at the most difficult level. Well I took Discrete 1 and 2 and they were both the easiest math courses that I took in college by far. Numerical Analysis was actually quite difficult for me, it seemed to require the most rote memorization of all the math's courses I had taken. . . it was a bit more difficult than Real Analysis.

I am a little worried however because I'm pretty creative and an abstract thinker.  I'm not great at rote memorization, in fact I'm quite bad at it.

I've heard from some people that Computer Science involves a lot more rote memorization than mathematics does.

I really relied heavy on my creative abilities, hard work, and abstract reasoning in college as my IQ isn't very high. It's only 120.

Right now I'm an unemployed carpet salesman, so I really have nothing to lose.

Any advice? Thanks.",2023-10-17 01:48:57

i am applying currently for a working student position (it‘s like a part-time position) in Germany, and it has been really difficult.

I received this offer today and i am not sure what to think about it.

When i had the interview with this startup, the CTO told me that they are only looking for interns or people who write their thesis with them, and then continue as a working student, maybe. There i ready thought „ok, they want to safe money“. As the minimum wage is otherwise 12€/h. Nevertheless, i told him that i am willng to do an internship for two months and then start as a working student, because i got pretty desperate by now. 

But now, i have a bad feeling about it.

In the Mail with the offer, the CTO told me, that it‘s difficult to prove myself in 2 months but they will find a project i can finish in this time period. That already sounds a little bit, like they don’t really plan to hire me after that period. 

Also, he asked if i could use my own laptop for work. Isnt that kind of a redflag? 

I have the feeling that they only look for cheap workers and that after the 2 months, i need to leave because „i didnt prove myself enough“. I really dont know if i should risk it, as i also need to prepare for an exam in these two months. 


What do you think?

Or is it better to wait and look for an internship that could turn into a full-time job after I graduate?

I'm up for roles in software engineering, data science, or research. Still figuring out which one to go for, but I'll decide in the next few months.

I'd really appreciate any tips or stories you guys have about how to go about this, especially about the best time to apply to big tech companies when you're about to finish school.

Thanks a bunch for any help you can give!",2024-01-16 00:33:57
197lnz2,Some questions about freelancing (ZZP) in the Netherlands,"Hi,I'm a software engineer working in the Netherlands for the last 7 years. Have a mixed experience of embedded, client-side C++ and Android. I've been thinking about going the ZZP route and had some questions. Apologies if they have been asked before and I couldn't find them:

1. I keep on reading about the DBA act which prevents ZZP-ers from being almost like employees, but is ok with them being ""consultants"". Then how can someone be a software engineer in a company, being part of a team say a manager? I can understand a solution architect position is more autonomous, but a developer in a team?
2. What kind of companies in NL employ ZZP-ers in software? From what I see, it seems more legacy places like banks, government and some companies like ASML. Do startups or software-focused companies also employ them?
3. Is it normal or easy to work for US or other EU companies being a ZZP, like many do in places like Poland and Czechia? If yes, financially do they pay better or worse than local companies? Is there a catch I need to be aware of?
4. Is your career growth affected if you do ZZP-work instead of being a fulltime employee? I understand a ZZP probably cannot grow into say a tech lead/manager position within the same company, but I'm thinking more a big picture view of an IC career, with an eventual goal towards some leadership functions
5. As mentioned, I have a mixed experience. Will it be harder to get a position as a ZZP-er without deep knowledge in one area, compared to a full-time position? And is it normal to expect \~100/hr or more at the start?
6. Is there a point where it makes sense to have a B.V. instead of a ZZP arrangement?

Thanks!",2024-01-15 22:13:11
195hldm,Internships as a Canadian,"Hi there,

I am a Canadian citizen currently studying in university. Im in the latter half of my degree in computer science at a rather well known school in Canada (not necessarily for computer science though, but it is internationally well-recognized.) I am fortunate enough that, through a parent, I am a holder of a Belgian passport.

I am currently looking for internship opportunities in Canada, but out of curiosity: with a passport from an EU country, how doable would it be to find a software engineering/developer internship in an EU country? It would be great if this would be possible for me, since I can (a) travel more, as I haven't done any large trips in a while, (b) gain relevant experience in my field, and (c) visit/stay with family in the EU which I rarely get to see in-person.

18wr7zq,Seeking Advice on screening and interviews in France/ EU,"Hey there,  
I'm a self-taught Android engineer from East Asia with four years of experience. I've got a legal work permit for France and I'm currently learning French, although I'm not quite conversational yet.  
I've been actively seeking positions in France where English is the primary language for communication during interviews. In the past two months, I've sent out around 70 resumes, had about 8 interviews, including 2 in Germany. Unfortunately, I got rejected after the HR screening in both German opportunities. Even when I made it to the technical discussions (twice), and I had prepared extensively, practicing responses to almost 90% of the anticipated questions, it still resulted in rejection.  
So, I'm reaching out for advice:  
1. How can I better prepare for phone interviews? I've asked for feedback in response to rejection emails, but no one seems to respond.  
2. It appears that nailing technical questions might not be the main focus. Some interviewers seem to lean towards French communication. Is language a potential factor, or could there be other aspects taking precedence? Perhaps they lean towards candidates with a CS background rather than those who are self-taught?  
3. I'm thinking about networking and exploring referral opportunities. Any tips on effective networking?

18np6zz,Austrian Job Hunt Around Tyrol,"Hey, guys! After exhausting my LinkedIn job search, I felt like it might be worth it to ask around here for some advice.

Basically, a 3-day-long mental breakdown from a month ago has convinced me to ditch my current surroundings for greener pastures. With my s/o's mother living in Tyrol and my past certificate of B2 in german, we felt like Austria would be a good bet for a 5-50 year long stay.

I have a bachelor's degree from June of this year, a couple of internships and a full year of teaching computer science to kids and teens & partial freelancing under my belt. With my xp out of the way, my questions are as follows:

1. Is there a healthy IT industry in Tyrol? Information online makes it nigh-impossible for me to give a clear answer to this, as ot varies from ""don't bother"" to ""you won't be looking back"".

2. What kind of yearly pre-tax income should I be expecting, considering my limited experience would place me in a junior role (I assume that would be the case for at the very least a year or two)?

3. How hard is it to get an entry-level position? I've applied to a bunch of companies and, once again, I have acquired very little conclusive information.

4. Is working remotely for someone in Germany/Switzerland viable? I like München and Basel but the ""softer landing"" that I have access to through my MIL is kind of unbeatable at this point. 

Basically, I am worried I'll end up chopping wood for Binderholz and not actually developing the skills I've been working on this past decade of study and I need some reassurance that it's going to be fine and some real-world experience from people wiser and more knowledgeable than me (I.E. you).

I've been at my current company for a while and I am looking for a change, I only have 3.5YEO but I want to apply for senior positions, would you think I am a 'senior' by looking at my CV?     

I feel like it's too much text, don't know what should I delete or rephrase, I am applying for full stack positions so idk if I should let the bullet points about nlp/recommendation engine/ci cd.   

I am also currently following a masters degree (still have to finish my dissertation thesis) and I am a lab assistant on a course about startups, don't know if I should let this in or not, maybe companies won't like that I am still writing my thesis?     

English is not my first language so if you find mistakes or think I should rephrase some bullet points that would be really helpful as well, for example idk how to explain clearly that I designed and developed x by myself, I kept writing ""designed"" or ""redesigned"" but idk if I should write it as 'designed and developed', most of the work I did it alone by myself.

180inwq,Take offer or wait for better one?,"Currently working in consultancy earning £65k (London, just over 2YOE). I've received an offer from another company offering £85k. The tech actually seems interesting and the culture seems cool BUT the company just doesn't excite me and the product sounds really bad on a CV - it's basically a glorified survey company. Not to mention I've only been at my current company since May so it'd mean I was leaving with only 8 months tenure (not a great look) albeit 1 year 10 months at my previous gig (really big consulting company)  
I'm not too sure how to navigate this. I'm confident if I bided my time and kept interviewing over the next few months I'd probably be able to get a similar offer for a much more appealing company and at least do 1 year in my current company that does look better from the outside.  
But equally, is it worth rejecting the extra \~£700ish a month extra money - I don't come from money so it really hurts to do that. But it does feel like in my gut that making the move now could hinder my long term earning capacity, but not sure if I'm just being ignorant.

This summer I did a research internship at UniPd and my paper has accepted for an international IEEE conference. I want to share it, because I am curious about whether paper can compensate low CGPA.

 I had an experience total \~1 year as a part time data scientist and swe while I studied. I want to apply data science and cs master in EU- particularly Germany and Italy because of fees and scholarships, my country's currency is not valuable. Because of that i want to apply right universities and maximize my chance to be admitted. Do you have any suggestion programs for me?

I applied PoliMi Comp. Sci. and Eng. but with that cgpa I think I have low chance. 

I am thinking about apply;

1) LMU - Data Science

2) PoliTo - CS and Data Sci.

3) Tu berlin - CS

4) Tu Darmstadt - CS

5) Tu Dortmund - Data Science

6) Freie Universität - Data Science

17jvtj1,"[Germany] CV review and career advice for junior full-stack dev, bootcamp grad","Hi! Yet another frustrated junior dev here. I know the market sucks, but I don't want to give up.

I've recently graduated from a full-stack web dev 3 months bootcamp, I've had already experience working as a software developer -albeit not for long, and many years ago-.

I've sent about 150+ applications with no success. At first I was placing my bootcamp projects under professional experience, and at least I was getting interviews, but only once passed the first stage.

I didn't feel comfortable with this method, so I started calling things by their name. Projects under projects, experience under experience. I've also removed some skills that I've barely used, and I left the ones that I feel I know well.

But after those changes, even though I stopped applying to mid-senior and started focused on junior/entry level jobs, I'm not even getting interviews. Nothing.

&#x200B;

The biggest problem is that a lot of the value I have to offer, come from incomplete studies or projects, reading, watching videos, etc. Nothing that looks very impressive on a CV. I'm not mentioning those. I've only left my incomplete university career, because otherwise it looks like I have absolutely no clue of what software is.

And I've been unemployed for 2 years already, except for a short minijob as an office manager/assistant, that I don't think is even worth the CV space.

&#x200B;

The unsuccessful job search and long unemployment is being devastating to my confidence and mental health, so I'm also open to general career advice. Now I'm even considering abandoning SE altogether, accepting defeat, switching to a less saturated profession, getting a ServiceNow certification, getting into gamedev, or moving out of Germany because of the language issues, in combination with some of the other options.

It's a shame because I can't stay constantly motivated to grind and learn on my own, but I'd strive on a team. I believe I'm very capable, I have good work ethics, I'm easy to work with and I'm likeable. I know I'm not an expert superstar unicorn, but I think I'm still worth having a job. And I'm failing to understand how to be more appealing to companies.

I really appreciate your time and your input!

- How can I lure recruiters from better companies? This includes foreign, a good chunk of recruiters that contact me are local. I don't mind relocating if I'm gonna learn a lot.

- Do recruiters from big names even contact you unless you are at another top company? I guess that the lack of funding is affecting this, but I apply at their websites and I barely get answered back. This does not happen with small companies

First of all, the reason why  I wanna move to Europe is that my girlfriend who is from Europe wants to come back.

I googled a bit about moving in to Europe and found out that Germany issues work visas including EU blue card the most, so I'm planning to get a job in Germany.

What I'm doing right now is this: developing front side of AI system service (package) using React, and sometimes I use Python for BE (not machine learning, just API).

As I described on the title, I wanna know the tips of getting a job and move in to Germany.

(Of course, I'll use Linkedin or some other SNS or job search sites to help me find a job.)

1bsv0wl,Staying on my current company + move to Sweden to get a MSc VS accepting a FAANG offer,"Hello all!

I'm facing this dilemma and honestly I don't know what to do.

Currently I'm working in a big tech company (+200k employees all over the globe) and I'm starting to feel comfortable on my current role (Software Engineer ll / Senior Software Engineer and I have been the  Release Engineer of the organization during the last 5 months).
The managers and all the other senior engineers are happy with my work and my direct manager has been always open to support me when it comes to my next steps on my academic path. My goal is to get a relocation to Sweden next year to get a MSc in KTH and although not 100% certain it has been officially on the table during the last 3 months (the relocation would happen by the end of the year) and my manager always asks about the status of my academic paperwork. 
Even I asked my manager and my mentor for recommendation letters for my applications and they were happy to help.

3 weeks ago I was contacted by a FAANG recruiter. Long-short story I have an offer from them. The interview was fun and the interviewer was a really nice guy. I wasn't expecting to get this kind of offer at this point of my career, but now that is happening I don't know what to do.

Taking the FAANG path would imply to postpone my swedish goal for at least other 18 months untill I could start to look any relocation possibilities into the company, and rejecting this offer is something that is not seen quite often (?). 

I'm from Mexico, single, almost 26, no children.
Money isn't my main goal; with this offer I would make more pennies but it's not a big jump.
I do like the fact that on my current role I have a very good work-life balance and I'm fully remote. I learn a lot from my senior teammates and I'm expected to be the next generation of engineers when they retire (the average labor seniority on my team is 26 years and there are at least three 30-year-seniority teammates, so the generational change is knocking the door).
On the other hand the interviewer said that they have a nice work culture (again, nice work-life balance, floating days, flexible shift, etc) but I would need to go to the office twice/thrice a week.

What do you think? What would you do?

1btdk53,I'm stuck at deciding an European country. Please help me.,"I want to study in Europe. I'm learning German but as the days go on I find it impossible to go there as I need to do 1 year UG in India. I'm from India. Most universities don't allow students to transfer or won't give certificates back unless I pay the full 4 year amount. So, I can't trust any university. I just want to have a very high quality education in computer science. I always wanted to do startups and other activities compared to normal job. So, job is just to support for my survival that's it. So, I want to have a lot of free time in University and also a good work culture ( like Germany one) here in my country freshers work 9-12hrs which I absolutely can't. I know Europe is more racist than USA but I want to go to a country that is less racist in terms of European scale and also Immigration friendly country, not any biases towards Indians. I'm okay with learning a language but I don't want it to be too tough like Japanese and take my whole life to learn it. I don't want it to be too expensive like USA or UK, I would like it if it's as affordable as Germany.

So the key points are, I'm searching for a country that has:

* Stable Job market
* Free Time or Better work culture i.e., less  working hours
* Good Education and less education hours
* I don't care about salary but need enough to survive and to afford good items like a good PC , laptop , house , food, some video games, streaming services, clothes. That's it.
* Friendly people
* Visa friendly country
* Must be European country
* Start up culture
* Quality education
* Less racism based on European scale
* Good weather is always appreciated but is optional (don't want it to be too hot)
* Down to learning a language but shouldn't be too hard. English speaking Unis are best for me though
* A good Indian community will also be great but is optional as I'm not outdoors anyway
* Not too expensive like US and UK
* Education should be affordable

These points are in random order and every point means a lot to me.

If there is no country that meets all please suggest me some country that meets the most of them you think.

The other reason I can't go to Germany is that there is something called Studienkollege ( I probably butchered the word ) to complete it I need to get enrolled first which means I get to at least b2 which will probably take a year to me and also completing that course takes another year. So it's like two gap years which I absolutely can't take and waste my time at. 

I will still learn the German as it will be a future-proof to me so if some other country won't work out to me I will try to move to Germany. I don't know if it's possible to work without a German degree though. 

This might be the longest post I ever uploaded and this is just a throwaway account. It's two o'clock AM here and I can't sleep as I don't know what to do. As I said I feel stuck. I don't want to do MS. And complete my study by  UG. And yes I will take CS. Of course.

Thank you for reading. I will probably sleep now as I hate waking up too late at mornings. I hope I will get some sort of advice by the time I wake up.

I'm eyeing Germany for better career opportunities, possibly alongside pursuing a master's in a related field. However, my job applications across the EU via LinkedIn haven't landed any leads. Here’s what I’m curious about:  
  
Learning German: Thinking of hitting B2 in German while still in Jordan. Is that practical? Do tech jobs really need German?

1bt1xjk,I accidentally applied for a job instead of an internship and got an interview. WHAT DO I DO???,"**TLDR**: Student in last year of Software Engineering and the job market in Macedonia is brutal. After facing endless rejections in web development, I decided to switch lanes to iOS Development and Machine Learning (since I have a better chance and I'm more competitive there). Sounds good, right? 
In a plot twist I didn't see coming, I accidentally applied full-time position (thinking it was an internship spot) at this fancy Swiss fintech company that's basically the Google of my city. Realized my mistake only after getting an interview call and now, I'm on the verge of a panic attack. If I mess this up, I'm not just rejected; I'm practically blacklisted. Plus, I need an internship to graduate, and my university's about to make that mission impossible with their new partnership rules. Could use some serious advice on how to handle this without obliterating my future. Thoughts?
---

Hi guys, hope the job market is treating you alright and isn't absolutely hellish like it is in Macedonia.   

### Backstory
---

To give you a little backstory, I'm a 4th year Software Engineering student in North Macedonia, and I've been applying to a lot of places for internships in my city (the capital it has the most jobs etc.). I've been rejected from all of them *(some have been right away; some have been in the 2nd or 3rd interview round)*. All of these positions were for web development internships...
After a lot of frustration and lack of communication and honest feedback from companies I decided to look elsewhere in terms of a career path *(since I'm still young and haven't really set roots anywhere, also my CV is not competitive in web dev compared to my colleagues and competition in the job market)*. The paths I've chosen to pursue are **IOS Development** *(bought a course on UDEMY for that and learning that atm. also there is a lot less competition in my city, but also a lot less open job positions let alone internships for IOS; I think it's a really cool platform to program and I was also able to set up XCODE on a QEMU VM so I don't need a mac)* and **Machine Learning** because I'm working on a research paper in the field which is to be published in May. I have hands on experience with supervised learning and I really think the whole field is awesome and extremely vast so you can work on a lot of cool engineering problems with it.
Also, I'd like to add that it's become so bad here that during a job fair at my collage a company had to close their stand after 3 days because they had 250 applications for a QA position, and they couldn't take any more applicants... I love you QA guys, you make software good but usually no one wanted these jobs, and they would always stay vacant.

### The Mix-Up
---

What happened was because of my frustration I started mass applying to any open position for an internship regardless of if it was for something that interested me or not. I applied to what is basically a tier FAANG company in my city *(a Swiss fintech company with its biggest branch in my city; it's a prestige to work in that company and also, it's really desirable because the best talent from the city is there. It's really major for your career imo)*. I got a call two days later and scheduled an interview for this Wednesday. Now all was dandy until I got to talk with a senior dev at that company, which holds interviews for web dev positions (he was the bf of my friend, which was a coincidence and we got to talk about my interview).
**Finally, after my wall of text comes my point/dilemma**. 
I applied for a job position and NOT an internship position. Meaning that the interview will be completely different (different level and expectations). Now to top that off the senior dev guy told me that they give candidates a grade based on the interview. If you get a low grade, they essentially black list you, next time if you apply, they will probably see that you had a bad grade and not even call you. They are also one of a few companies in my city that offer an IOS dev. internship.

### What the heck do I do?
---

I'm super stressed out and have absolutely no idea on what to do. As seen from the wall of thoughts that have been coming from my head above. I have no idea what I should do or say. And how I should act or communicate this to my interviewers on Wednesday. 
This is what ChatGPT told me:

> Early in the interview, clarify the misunderstanding. You might say something like, ""I want to be upfront about a mix-up on my part. I applied to this position under the impression it was an internship, which aligns with my current career stage. However, I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to [company/project], and I'm open to discussing how we might tailor a role that benefits us both.""


Which is cool and all but still doesn't make me less stressed and anxious about messing up this opportunity.
Any advice is welcomed, also any criticism as well. :))



P.S. In order for me to get my diploma from my university I have to have completed at least a 3-month long internship in an IT company *(related to the field of study of my major)*.

P.P.S Starting from October 2024 the university will pass a new ""law"" where the only internships they will recognize will be in companies that are official partners with the university. To become a partner, you have to pay the university on a yearly basis. Meaning that only big companies will be able to do so and that means that all students will compete for these positions *(The IT/CS collage is the biggest in the country and has the most students compared to any other college or university in the country)*.

I've got some chances in technical rounds where in some I failed miserably and others I performed kinda good (me being humble) either in solving DS and Algo problems or the take home tasks.

But still I get the email of **""it is often small details that make the difference in this decision"".**

Is it only me who is *weak* or not very well prepared or people with my profile should just try harder as we still are ""not senior enough"" ?

1b3hp83,I made a website which centralises technology career information for the UK,"When I was applying for internships and graduate jobs, a big issue I found was information was scattered all over the place.

Random reddit forums, youtube videos and just random articles here and there. Absolute fragmentation.

And an additional problem I found was resources were tailored towards the US, and not the UK.

Even things like how to create a CV tailored to the tech industry require nuance, but the information was honestly quite pathetic.

I did manage to secure a role as a **Software Engineer at a Top Firm in Finance**, but it wasn't easy at all.

So I created **Tech Academia, a platform to help young students secure top roles in tech** by educating them with career modules such as ""How to write your first Tech CV"" to ""Securing your first internship / graduate job""

It's completely free so definitely check it out.

I am genuinely looking for feedback on things I can improve or modules to add because I've built it, but I haven't spent much time asking people if it's fulfilling their needs.

Hello everybody, I’m a third year CS student who has recently started a 3 month internship in the domain of cloud computing, particularly as a “solutions architect/enterprise architect” kind of role, which I know sounds unreasonable because it’s usually a role which requires a lot of knowledge and experiences, but it makes sense since most of the work I do is prepare excel documents and double check architectural diagrams.

Unfortunately, I have realized that this is not the domain I want to focus on in my future. Instead, I have realized that I want to have a more technical role, particularly in software engineering.

1b2wqq9,Getting a CS Degree while already having a SWE job,"Hi everbody!

My name is Tobi and I am 22 years old. 

In the last year I had a major career change, where I went from working at a bank to becoming a SWE at a local IT firm making software for banking institutions. 

I didn't exactly start from 0. I attended a high school focused on computer science, where I'd learned the very basics. While working at the bank after high school, I realized I wanted to change careers and continued studying and gaining knowledge in my free time.

I did Harvard's CS50x as a introduction / refresher for my knowledge, and afterwards completed The Odin Project with a focus on Web Development, building a portfolio of small projects.  
After that I applied for my current job, where I work as a full stack dev with React.js / Typescript / Redux and Spring Boot / Java.

You can read more of my story here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/12zyhai/i\_need\_some\_advice\_first\_job/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/12zyhai/i_need_some_advice_first_job/)

I really enjoy my current job, and there is much room to grow for me here. While I can definitely see myself staying here for the near future, I want to always move forward and expand my knowledge, possibly be doing more data science / AI type / other niche jobs or also be working at a big company / startup or in a major city at some point.

Now here comes my current situation:  
I always thought that getting your foot in the door in SWE is the hardest part, and that after that having experience can be almost equivalent to having a degree. 

However, as I had so much fun doing CS50 and am also currently doing CS50AI, I've been thinking of getting a degree as well while continuing working at my job.

In the same city as my job's firm is a decent university which offers a degree in CS. I am in Italy but the course is taught in English, German and Italian. It would be possible to study completely online.  
My workweek is 37.5 hours and I have a pretty long commute I could use to study next to studying at home or elsewhere.

My question is now: Do you think I should pursue this opportunity and it would benefit me a lot (and how hard is it to complete a BS degree while working) or would you say in my case it won't be as beneficial? How many hours a week should I prepare to have to study?

Money is not an issue as the universities here don't cost a ton and we tend to get decent tuition grants here.

Also, how much of my experience working as a dev would aid me in college? I am guessing not that much besides the pure programming aspect.

I very much appreciate your inputs and recommendations.

Also, other general recommendations and guidance for me are always welcome.  
Thank you.",2024-02-29 09:55:50

How often do ML people start their own AI companies? What cool startups do you know that people with this background started? I've spent most of my short career in the consumer product org (unicorn) and I've worked in Strategy and ML.

  
Neither of these interests me too much to become super specialized in them (think of Principal IC), and I can't bother pushing a few more years to get the managerial role. However, I still lack good ideas to start a startup. 

What ideas were you thinking of when starting a company? I've personally been looking into the hardware ML applications, as I think that will be the next thing to be disrupted (I'm including defense tech in there). I see lots of these ideas being mentioned in the [Y Combinator RFS](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs), and a16z recently organised the [defense tech party](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-20/andreessen-horowitz-ups-its-game-in-dc-pursues-american-dynamism).

Btw, I have four years of industry experience in Vietnam, though I'm uncertain about its value in the eyes of Europe recruiters.

I tried my best to find the closest match positions and the positions I applied across a wide spectrum of companies, from large corporations and scale-ups to startups with fewer than ten employees.

I wonder about the feasibility of securing a position as an average PhD background. Is it advisable to apply for every available position, even those that are a less perfect fit? I have been working on control, automation and robotics in my previous industry role and during my Phd.

I've been applying since January to companies all over Europe, and I managed to get an interview for a small-medium sized UK company. It's my first time interviewing for a non-internship position but I managed to pass the behavioural interview and the coding round. The recruiter sent me an email inviting me to the last stage of the interview process, (which should've been face-to-face, but considering I'm applying from abroad they were considerate enough to let me interview via zoom, do you think I will have a smaller impact compared to other candidates that will interview face-to-face?), which should last 90 minutes.

I truly don't know what to expect. The job post wasn't labeled as a junior position, and they didn't specify any precise amount of experience. So, my guess is they are recruiting for a range of seniority levels through the same job posting. The thing is: having 1YOE, I read online that system design is often the kind of interview for more senior positions. They are aware that I'm a Junior, at most stretching it, a Mid.

1azmjbd,Is it worth to pursue a degree at 25?,"Hello guys,

I have a couple of questions about a potential career in CS.

I did the self-taught route and even landed a job for 6 months, but I was unlucky, because I did it in 2023 and now I stand 0 chance of finding employment because I have no higher education.  


I was working with C and Python in a niche environment (ASML). I got laid off and as a reason I was told that the economy is not good. Problem is any junior job with C requires way more experience and also a bachelor's degree. Same with Python, 80% of Python jobs are AI/Statistics, the remaining 20% are django, but they also require previous webdev experience.  


I thought long and hard at this and it seems like the industry will continue to be very miserable for at least 3 more years (which is how long it will take me to get a bachelor if I start now).

  
1. Considering the current and near-future economic situation, is it still worth it to start a CS related degree at 25 years old? Ideal graduation would be at 28 and I am not entirely sure how being a junior at 28 is perceived by hiring staff.

  
I found 2 degree options which are flexible enough right now. One is at [Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk/) \- BCs Computer Science, the other one is at [IU](https://www.iu.org/) \- BCs of Applied Artificial Intelligence.

2. Is it worth going for the AI degree?  Currently there is a lot of AI hype, however most senior developers say its an empty hype and will pass away. Transitioning to AI from a conventional CS degree is also relatively easy, should the need arise.

1aznt4q,Concerns about taking offer from a tech company (DevOps Engineer role),"Hello!

I am a DevOps Engineer candidate currently residing in South Germany with a **Blue Card visa.**  
**At the end of last year, I unfortunately experienced a layoff from my previous employer, compelling me to seek new opportunities. Fortunately, I recently received an offer for a DevOps Engineer role from a manufacturing company a few days ago.**

The primary technologies in use for this DevOps Engineering role are Docker, Python, Bash Shell, and Virtual Machines (Linux). The prospective technical responsibilities entail constructing CI/CD pipelines, containerizing applications (for Embedded Systems), monitoring, and managing Linux Virtual Machines. However, I have come to realize that these technologies are somewhat outdated compared to those I have previously worked with.

Allow me to outline my professional journey thus far:  
**6 months** of Software Development internship focusing on JavaScript, Java, and Node.js.  
**1 year and 7 months** of DevOps Engineering experience, comprising 1 year and 3 months of AWS (AWS CloudFormation, Bash Shell) and 4 months of Private Cloud (RHEL and CentOS Linux Virtual Machine, OpenShift, and Kubernetes) in Korea.  
Transitioned to a different subsidiary (Consulting division) in Germany, where I spent **6.5 months** in Platform Engineering (DevOps) utilizing Kubernetes (EKS), AWS, Terraform, Prometheus/Grafana under a GitOps pipeline.  
Subsequently, I moved to the largest consulting company in Europe, where I spent **5 months** as a Solutions Architect (DevOps Engineer), working on AWS CodePipeline, CI/CD pipeline Architecture, and Automation scripts in Python, as well as Code Refactoring using Pylint.

The majority of my professional expertise lies in Public Cloud (AWS) and Cloud-Native tech stacks (Kubernetes, Prometheus/Grafana, and Terraform). **During my job search, I had hoped to join a product-oriented company with large-scale services, allowing me to work with the latest DevOps Engineer (Cloud-Native) technologies such as Kubernetes, GitOps, ArgoCD, Public Clouds, and Terraform.**

**Do you think that working with On-Premise devices, Virtual Machines, and Docker in that manufacturing company (Machinery) would not provide adequate career development of DevOps/Site Reliability Engineering?**

Realistically, I wonder if I would be able to transition to a startup with newer DevOps Engineer and Cloud-Native tech stacks after gaining a few years of experience in that manufacturing company.  
While I am grateful to have left the project-based consulting company and received an offer from a company with its own products and services, **I am seeking insights into whether this opportunity will serve as a stepping stone for long-term career development in DevOps or Cloud Engineering.**",2024-02-25 13:22:42

I just know basic C, Python, Shell, Java, MySQL, Lex (Flex), YACC (Bison). And I'm really confused with what should I focus on, like Web development, App dev (like Android studio), CyberSecurity, ML, Networking, Data Analyst, .....

Please take time to read and guide me accordingly. I'm just scared for what's to come.

So, the thing is, I have only seen what Android app development and Web development (HTML, CSS, Python, Django) looks like.  I have no clue what the others look like or the kind of coding/skills I need to learn/develop for it. I'm really stuck and been googling stuff with no positive results.

**1.Web development:**

As far as I know, I'm finding the front end (HTML, CSS) to very be dull. Do devs really learn them and code it line by line with 'divs' and all    OR    use UI making/designing tools to make the front end quicker ? And yes, the backend requires manual coding.

This is what comes to my mind about Web development as a whole.

Front end, CSS - [https://imgur.com/a/KHiEhXF](https://imgur.com/a/KHiEhXF)

Front end, HTML - [https://imgur.com/a/igezKlh](https://imgur.com/a/igezKlh)

Backend - manage.py, views.py, urls.py, models.py

**2.App dev (like Android studio):**

Also, here what I know is, its similar to Web Development. We have backend with Kotlin/Java (like Python/Django in Web).... Then we have front end XML (like HTML in Web). So somewhat similar, but I'm expecting the backend to be broader here with more complex stuff.

This is what comes to my mind about Android/App development as a whole.

Front end - All those XMLs, RAW files, Drawables etc.

Back end - [https://imgur.com/a/ppJWlXJ](https://imgur.com/a/ppJWlXJ) , all those Java, Kotlin files.

**3.CyberSecurity, ML, Networking, Data Analyst and other fields:**

Zero clues. Doesn't know anything about what languages are used, what the coding looks like (compared to the above pics), the tools, code structure. The internet tells me that I need lots of patience and have to develop lots of knowledge which is really time consuming and would take years to catch up with the others and get a job. I don't even know if math skills are required here (which the above ones doesn't require as far as I know). Please provide me with the relevant info. And set of codes from files, the structure etc...

I saw this from one of the reddits *""I'm a cs engineer and I've been working as a data scientist for almost 3 years now. Currently, my job is around 60% of creating ppts, interacting with business stakeholders, meetings , 20% of creating power BI dashboards, and 20% of working with python and sql to analyze data or (rarely) build ml models."".* Don't know how complete this is about a Data Scientist. And not sure if you guys actually get what I'm looking for. Please bear with me for this.

I find the Backend to be my thing with the 1st two. But really would like to know if anything else exists that's even better for me. I also enjoy making simple C programs on my own that solves problems based on the concept in my mind, like for eg: finding FIRST, FOLLOW, searching, sorting, etc...

To conclude, I would like to say I really have no info about it and doesn't know which one to pick. And if anyone manages to help, please tell from where I should be self learning about these?

Both places are known for having great engineering teams, and I'm keen on the idea of working alongside some sharp minds. But here's the rub: Java developers are in high demand in my area, but Ruby? Not so much. This means sticking with Java could mean more money in my pocket. Offers to switch tech stacks are likely not going to bump up my salary, and I'm worried about getting stuck in a niche with less demand down the road.

So, I'm tossing up whether making this switch is a smart move for growing my skills and career, or if I'm better off sticking with the sure thing. Would love to get your take on this.",2024-02-24 22:38:30
1az6gcj,What is best for my career?,"For context:

I am a student currently doing a CS master's degree in germany and i have either 1 or 2 semesters left to graduate.

To elaborate on that, i can directly do my thesis amd graduate in a semester, or do something else next semester and then thesis in the last semester.

I have been applying for summer internships for the past 6 months and i am always ghosted or rejected without being given an interview or even an OA. This translated into me fearing I'd get the same treatment as a new grad. 

So i thought i would also apply for thesis topics in companies since these positions are less competitive and it's a good way to prove myself amd eventually convert it into a fulltime position after graduation. This too proved difficult as i kept getting ghosted, not a single human interaction happened.

I worked hard on my CV as i asked for reviews and implemented feedback from friends, colleagues, coworkers, uni career services, and even reddit.

Now for the question:
I am confused on what to do next.

1. I can pursue a thesis topic from uni, graduate earlier, and hopefully find a new grad job.

2. I can do research next semester. With this on my CV, i can try again to get a good thesis topic from uni/a company. Hopefully if everything goes according to plan, adding two research experiences to my CV would eventually increase my chances to be seen as a new grad.

The second plan seems optimistic and it will delay graduation by 6 months, while the first one will result in weaker credentials.

Clarification: I am currently working part time next to my studies to pay the bills. That's part of the reason why doing my thesis at company is attractive to me. Otherwise I'll have to keep working and do my thesis simultaneously.",2024-02-24 21:50:06

For a year, I have been working for a company in Munich Germany, currently earning 41k.

I asked for a raise, but it got denied because some of the company's projects aren't doing so well.

On top of that, i now have to take over more tasks, as one of our team members is leaving the team.
No replacement is being searched yet, at least not for this quarter. 

The replacement search and raise were declined by the CEO himself.

It's quite a cool job and I like the people I work with. They also offer me a flexible hybrid working model which I don't wanna give up. But the fact that I now have to take extra tasks in an area I dont have so much experience with, while being paid the same wage isnt exactly appealing.

I'm currently employed as a backend developer in Italy, working full remote with a mediocre salary (26k). I've recently been considering the idea of re-enrolling in university, partly because I would like to explore opportunities abroad (salaries in italy are very low) and also because I pretty much missed out on that part of life.

**To give a little more context:**  
When I started out, for the first 6 months (when COVID wasn't a thing) I kinda enjoyed the university life but once the pandemic hit,I struggled to maintain any motivation and began neglecting deadlines.

To avoid wasting time, I created a portfolio showcasing my projects and managed to secure a full remote job. I was extremely happy at first, but as time passed, I began to experience a sense of boredom and dissatisfaction with both my career and social life.

So, ***tl;dr*** since my daily tasks take 2 hours at most, I've been thinking about using my spare time to pursue a bachelor's degree.

**I have done some research and gathered some candidates:**

[Candidates' Table](https://imgur.com/a/29GmjjB)  
*the values under the columns* ***OPPORTUNITY*** *and* ***SOCIAL LIFE*** *are probably inaccurate and partially subjective. For the* ***former*** *I have considered the overall market, salaries as well as companies connected to that given uni and for the* ***latter*** *I have considered language (since I can speak in ENG/IT) and stereotypes.* ***RANKING*** *is based on* [this](https://www.topuniversities.com/europe-university-rankings) *website.*

My top choices are sweden and poland. I've read that english is widely spoken in sweden, and the Polish IT market may be on the raise (fact check me on that), I've seen pretty decent salaries among mid-senior positions. I've also been in Poland and it's not a bad country to live in, cost is decent and people are friendly.  
As backup plan I'd have genoa, I have a friend there that might offer a place to stay.

I haven't considered Germany because I haven't found a computer science course taught in english and I don't know if I'd enjoy the social life there. Switzerland and UK are just too expensive.

I'd like to note that I haven't still tried to apply for a foreign company mainly because with just 2.5y of experience, no degree and the current market I don't think I would be selected no matter how much I try. But who knows, maybe I'm understimating my CV.

Tell me if all this makes sense or I'm just being delusional.  
The thing is I can't really take it anymore, the job is incredibly repetitive, lacks any real challenge and being stuck at my parents' home in a small town has essentially erased my social life. Hope you can help me out!",2024-02-22 13:07:31

In an ideal world I'd like to work in creative stuff (I'm a photographer and I've been making money with that kinda effortlestly lately, not too much, but I think if I actually put time into it I could make a living out of it).

I keep seeing testimonies of people taking sabbaticals and it sounds tempting. Mind you, I don't plan to take a whole year off, I think with my current savings I could easily take off 4/6 months and then have some more savings to look for another job, and it sounds attractive, I feel like I need to take time off from software completely and do stuff I actually care about. I would just change careers if it was that easy, but we all know how well software pays compared to other jobs, specially taking into account I haven't even gone to uni for it. Sure I could just get a job as a bartender or something but that would be for half my paycheck + limited holidays + next to no benefits of course, so although I know career changes are an option they also sound like shooting myself in the foot.

My main concern, and idk if anyone here has any experience on this, is finding a job after not working for like 4/6 months? Is that a big issue when applying for jobs? Tbh I keep going back to the idea that if I do so and then lie on interviews and say I've been freelancing for the past half year they could never know if it's true or not lol or if I just don't say that I left my last company, would they actually have any way of knowing? Idk how much access to your info companies have before hiring you? Specially in another country although it's part of the EU?

Sorry ik the post is scrambled all over the place, but I think given my current CV/my age/the money I have saved it's not an insane idea to take this time off? I'm aware that blowing my savings on this ain't the best idea either, that's one of the things holding me back, but I literally feel dead inside on my current job lately even though I'm not required to work hard? Like I've tried so many things lately and I just can't get myself to not feel like shit working this job.

I'm also aware that maybe it's just this job since I've been at it for the past 3 years and maybe a new job would be a breath of fresh air, but even if I do I would like to take time off in the middle to properly disconnect for a bit. 

&#x200B;

Does it sound insane? Have you done it? Do you know people who have done it? How was it? Would love to have a chat either here or privately lol",2024-02-22 10:36:14

And because the HR filter only cares about experience years, I'm stuck as a solo developer in a project. It's this weird mixture of ""my company treats me as a mid but the industry treats me as a junior"". 

On top of that, I literally have no idea if what I'm doing is good practice or not. The one person responsible for telling me if what I did was good can only respond to my questions once a day, twice if I'm very lucky.

But at least it's a remote position, so when I'm done with what they assigned me and he actively ignores my messages on Slack I can watch a Udemy course and do some leetcode.

1awd4nc,"Corporate academies in Europe, are they a thing?","In Italy it's been common for a while for big tech companies to offer internal learning programs for junior figures, generically called ""academies"". They are essentially like a bootcamp, a classroom where people learn the tech stack the company wants you to know.

When interviewing people without or with minimal IT experience (like people who did a bootcamp, but I've heard of people with a STEM degree as well), if the company feel the candidate is promising but not trained enough, a lot of companies can offer the chance to attend their academy.

These courses typically span from 1 to 6 months, are either offered for free or people get paid to attend, and will cover specifically the tech stack the company is using.

In some cases participants are hired prior to beginning the course, so they will be assigned to teams and start working immediately after, while in other cases the company will offer a position to the top attendees.

1awbq72,Looking for advice on career progression,"Hello guys!

I'm a software engineer student (I will gradute this summer) with almost 2 years of experience working for a european company remotely in IT, as I started working there in the 3rd & 4th year at university.

I mainly work on web scraping with Python using scrapy framework and some other stuff (scraping full websites with complex structure), unfortunately no companies require such tech stack so I'm starting to look into doing some side projects to find a job in another company with better tech stack (i'm mostly interested in backend development).

&#x200B;

I have good programming knowledge and have used lots of languages throughout the last 4 years, but mostly used python in a professional environment, I recently learned Node.js and did a full project for an e-commerce website backend in a short period and i loved it.

however now that i'm looking at the required tech stacks by companies, most of the job postings for Node.js require some knowledge in a front-end technology like react etc, i dont like working on any frontend technology so i'm not going through that route (fullstack).

&#x200B;

I realized this mistake a bit too late and thought maybe with my current good knowledge of python i should've done the project in a python backend framework instead of going for Node.js, I'm not sure if i should stick with node.js (if i dont want to work on the frontend or become fullstack).

I also would be open for other alternatives to python or javascript for backend, I'm not currently living in the EU so I would also like to get an idea of how the job market is for the adviced technologies.

1awfjf8,Navigating the EU Job Market: Seeking Advice for a Experienced Professional Making the Transition,"Hi, everyone,  


  
I want to thank you beforehand for your support.

  
A summary of my professional history: I am from Mexico (also have an EU passport), graduating in mining and metallurgical engineering in 2020. Just like many of us who graduated around that time, I faced the market freeze due to the COVID-19 virus. Unable to find another job, I landed in a software company (I also have a two-year engineering technician degree in software engineering from vocational school).  


  
It was a good job, and I started growing there. Soon, another company required me, and then this company merged with a bigger one. Eventually, I ended up as the Project Team Lead of the only international team in the company. Things were going well until December 2022 when the tech crisis hit. I was required to work on a freelance basis as they downsized the team almost entirely, only contacting me for some small projects to fix existing code.

  
I thought with three years of experience as a full-stack software developer, finding my next position would be easy, especially since many companies had contacted me before all this happened. However, for three months, I applied and applied, but most positions were frozen, or my resume wasn't even considered. I only managed to land three interviews, and despite my best efforts, I wasn't contacted for the next stage. Feeling desperate and frustrated, I turned to Upwork and landed some jobs, but nothing provided a continuous source of work.  


  
In June, I decided I had enough. The market wasn't working, the global economy was down, so I decided to take some time for a more fulfilling pursuit (a spiritual retreat). Now, I'm eager to get back to my career. I need to be productive again; I can't stay stagnant any longer. But it seems the economy hasn't improved much since I left. More conflicts have emerged worldwide, and the economy is still in a downturn. I'm not sure what the best decision is right now.  


  
I want to believe that the EU market is better than the American one right now, and I have the advantage of not requiring a visa sponsor. However, I've never been to Europe, and I'm unfamiliar with how people find jobs there. I'm willing to move wherever I can be productive again. I know that many of you have far more experience than me (actually, I have none) in navigating the EU job market. I appreciate any insights, ideas, advice, or whatever you could provide. I really don't want to be in this state for another year.  


  
Thank you so much, and have a nice day.",2024-02-21 15:57:51
1avs1gu,How do you deal with unprofessionalism in software engineering?,"On StackOverflow and Reddit, people like to fight for the most elegant solution. Technical books such as Clean Code promote Test First and other paradigms, and the Agile Manifesto describes a self-image of professional teamwork. Young software developers are often told during their studies that the world out there has much higher standards than anything the university will ever ask.

  
And then they encounter the harsh reality of being confronted with uncommented and untested spaghetti code that is riddled with hard-coded values and magic numbers. If you ask their developers (assuming you can reach them at all) what they mean, you won't get a sensible answer. During further development, the wage-dumped outsourced colleagues either don't respond at all or give the most absurd excuses why they couldn't work, such as that they haven't had time to commit their work results all week. The code is held back until it is absolutely unavoidable to hand it over after escalations to their managers. If code does end up in the repo, it contains the API key in plain text and has the commit message ""Updateed Codes 2"".

  
Hence my question to the community: How can a software developer or architect navigate through the minefield of completely unprofessional software engineering without losing their own sanity?",2024-02-20 20:34:13

1avuuwo,Best path for future: stay as a developer or move into leadership,"Hi!  


I need some advice regarding what would be the most beneficial career move long term. I am trying to figure out what makes the most sense financially as well as ""life comfort"" wise.

The options:

1. Stay as a software developer (4 yoe as full stack .NET/React web dev)
   1. build some more experience during the slump in the market at the current company
   2. when market starts to become better and that I have achieved 5+ yoe stop employment and try to get a contract instead for better future financials 
2. Try to move into a team manager position and climb the career ladder as an employee within a company instead

&#x200B;

Pros of option 1:

* If I manage to land a contract then I will have a great financial position compared to being an employee
* Better control of my own time and having no direct boss
* Will be able to work less and still make more money than I do today

Cons of option 1:

* I will just work with web dev => might get tired of it after a while as it does become quite repetitive, if you have built a 1 e commerce then you have pretty much built them all
* Risk if the market takes longer to recover or the industry will have a job deficit due to too many engineers graduating vs open positions
* Harder to find a contract

&#x200B;

Pros of option 2:

* More varied work
* Opens up the possibility of climbing even higher in the corporate ladder
* I get to work more with planing, analyzing and creating change which I enjoy
* More future safe(?)

Cons of option 2:

* Theoretically less earning potentials if I don't climb higher
* More responsibility
* Less relaxed life

Just to introduce myself, I'm soon 25, 0 degree relevant in IT, landed a backend engineer(Symfony) job for the government in Strasbourg, I work here since 2,5 years\~, other than that I contribute somewhat regurlarly to some open source projects (nothing incredible but I always received positive comments about it in job interviews) and I always try to have some non trivial personal project to show, I also passed some AWS associates certs recently and planning to get cka certified in the future.

  
I have enough of my job(too much bureaucracy, full of boomers and I feel like I won't learn much more there plus we're working with monkeys that wants 6479 features every month so no time to skill up in other tech, all my improvement in good tech like Kubernetes or AWS comes from me working these skills in my free time) so I'm looking to switch to another one, I don't know if it's me but the salary proposed to me here are fucking trash, I am making about 35k\~ right now and your usual consultancy body-shipping will not go above 40k, anytime I asked for 45k I  was told ""could you please lower that?"" I'm still on the look for a better job in this city or a remote one but I didn't have a good offer yet, but I did started looking seriously for another job like 2 weeks ago.

So to get back on topic Just got a job offer to work as a DevOps Engineer for a young insurance company they proposed me 45k and hybrid work (2 days remote) but I can certainly negotiate to raise it to 50k I think, other than that they use a lot of in demand tech (AWS, Terraform, Burp suite Enterprise...) and there is no leetcode no nothing all I need to do is say yes or no before the end of this week.

The thing is I'm not sure if I actually want to accept that offer because it would mean go to Paris, struggle hard to get good flat plus the commute time that will be most likely higher than what I have here, my quality of life in Strasbourg is 100% better than in paris (commute to work is only like 20mn via public transport and pay is decent to get a flat near downtown) and I actually like Strasbourg a lot it's just that my dayjob  albeit very chill and stress free doesn't improve me and won't in the next 2-3 years.

I got other job interviews coming up but nothing really amazing, another body shipping in paris where i asked 50k will come up soon and some guy that I contacted for a remote job no news yet.

**TL;DR**: Should i go get that DevOps job in Paris for 45-50k? or wait it out in Strasbourg for a an even better opportunity remote or not.",2024-02-20 21:24:35

- AI Engineer - Generative AI (LLMs, RAG, …)
- hybrid working (3 remote + 2 in office per week)
- 40K gross + 1K for training courses and certifications
- Many social events

The startup compensation package is very tempting, but
- the team would be spread across several cities, so very few opportunities of working side-by-side with the collegues 
- I like computer vision, but I do prefer working with LLMs and RAG and I also believe this would be a major tech trend in the next years 

By now, my priorities are: decent salary + working with cool technologies + spend some time in office, so I’m leaning more towards the second and third options, but perhaps I am underestimating the significant difference with the first option in economic terms and the marketability of computer vision skills.

1avkxd9,Offers discussion: Product Owner or continue as (mid level) SWE in Germany,"Hi everyone, 
after +200 applications and 2 months of job searching, I am between the salarywise top 3 offers and need to make a decision. As I don't have a network or somebody to ask personally, I will rely on Reddit and my gut feeling :)

My experience;
Java, Spring Boot, SQL, GCP/AWS, DevOps
Microservice, RestAPI implementation for 2 years.
IoT, Javascript for 1 year.
Currently, unemployed.

I am * kind of * considered as a mid level developer, trying SOLID principles, TDD, supporting juniors, documenting etc.

Nevertheless, I am struggling too. Before implementing a feature I mostly need to consult a Senior in the team, tell my plan and confirm it, when I face with a challenge I ask them to take a look, require a code review etc.

Besides, during the technical/architectural discussions I am so silent and can only be a good listener. Feel like I can barely give an idea that would impress other devs and I am so shy to open myself up. 

One more thing, coding itself is fun if the task is trivial or something I used to do. More creative tasks are giving me a headache until I find a solution and I panic until its done. If I couldnt solve it til EOD, all night I am like ""wtf i will say in the daily tomorrow"", ""what if i can not solve it tomorrow either"", ""what will X think about me if i ask him to pair with me and take a look"", ""maybe i should do overtime now and be done with it, tomorrow i can work less"", ""PO will complain for sure"" etc. 

Due to these situations, I have applied to different positions. My offers:

1- Java Developer, in a consultant company, 67k€ yearly including bonuses. Same tech stack.

2- 80% Visual Basic - 20% Java-SQL developer, for in house applications, needs often stakeholder contact, 69k€ yearly including bonuses. (greatest total income)

3- Product Owner, in a very big company, mostly in contact with stakeholders not with devs, no coding, 67k€ yearly no bonus (greatest monthly income)

I couldn't find any position in English unfortunately, for all of them I need to communicate in German and I am currently B1/B2 = intermediate :) 

The question is, should i push myself into software engineering more? 
Try to break my walls again, try to get better in programming etc.

OR

give up as I have tried my best earlier and try something else in IT, which means Product Owner. If I dont like it either, I could come back to Java again right, I am 26 years old.

Additionally, what are your ideas about switching from Java to VB? Normally I wouldnt consider, but the offer is slightly higher.

Looking forward to hear your suggestions!

1avi7j7,Careers with highest career potential? (inside or outside CS field),"Hi all, curious to hear your take on **careers with the highest income potential outside the US, that are possible to switch into** with a very strong early/mid-career resume, and possibly with some extra studies on top

Does anyone in Europe break 200+ kEUR? In what industries?  
And are they possible to move into ""from scratch""? How would one do it? (Finagle my way into a masters at Oxbridge/TUM/ETH? Bootcamp and emphasize general resume / soft skills?)



>MY BACKGROUND:  
Bachelors+Masters degrees from Ivy/Oxbridge with top grades, current MBB consultant in EU, \~5 YOE mainly in top consulting. Quantitatively very talented but dropped math, missed the tech hype train, and studied something completely different for fun (not math, eng, or CS).

I realize similar questions gets asked a lot - but with some heavy-hitting names on the resume, one might hope more opportunities are open than usual (although that hypothesis is very much yet to be confirmed...)

Considering the switching costs, what options are available to avoid spending the next 10 years of my life aligning PPT boxes and still not being able to afford a house in a major European city? Or has that train passed (interest rate and hiring wise)?

1avnjxw,Switch from Classic Computer vision to Deep Learning,"I develop classic Computer Vision algorithms on C++ and want to switch to Deep Learning area.  
For now, I see these options:  
**Plan #1:**

1. Join a small HW/mobile startup
2. Integrate/optimize neural networks (this usually requires C++)
3. Gradually move to NN finetuning.   
This may be possible if NN training and integration is made by the same team. That's why the company should be small.

**Plan #2:**

1. Learn leetcode
2. Apply to FAANG-like companies for SE in test role to support AI/scientific infrastructure
3. Try to switch from testing utils to NN finetuning. 

**Plan #3:**

1. Learn DL theory on excellent level
2. Join intern/junior position in bigtech
3. Hope to get a better offer for middle position from them

  
**My skills:**

* **C++**: 5 YoE as a main programming language
* **Python**: 2 YoE for auxiliary utils
* **DL**: 1 year of **commercial** experience, utilized a few networks as black boxes
* **DL theoty**: few online courses
* **Math**: good level
* **Extra**: 5 YoE in Classic Computer Vision

&#x200B;

So, I have a couple of questions:

1.  What do you think about these plans?
2. Maybe, you can share some relevant experience?
3. Do you have other ideas how to switch to DL with my experience?
4. Should I do pet projects to tell about them on job interview when the interviewer asks me about my DL experience?

&#x200B;

I would also be happy to hear your stories if you did similar transfers.

Thanks in advance!",2024-02-20 17:36:45

1avcqe1,Data engineer or Java developer?,"So to give a little context.I worked as an RPA developer for past 2+ years. It involves low to no code as we used tools to make automatiions for clients. It worked well but I wasn't enjoying it much. I had an opportunity to take a break and I started coding in Java, solved couple of problems, got good fundamentals and I'm in advanced concepts now. And I do solve questions regularly in Java as I'm learning those topics. Concurrently I have a ML based project so I'm learning ML too and how to apply models, clean data and then use it further. Also I got an opportunity to learn python and use it in open source RPA tool to make automations with pure code this time(no RPA tool). 

What I realised is I like coding, I'm not great but I do like it. 

And right now I'm at a certain point in my career where I really have to focus on one thing so that I can secure a good job. I'm not sure if I should go for data engineering because I know python and SQL and I'm learning ML anyways because of my project or should I go with Java developer because I'm learning that too and plan to learn spring boot later when I am done with more advanced topics in Java and solve more topic based problems.

And if someone really wants to take a look I'll attach my GitHub profile. Although I haven't uploaded any Java based project there but you can say I have solid understanding of the language. And I will definitely upload one sooner, probably a short game developed in Java.

My GitHub: https://github.com/swapneilbasutkar

Need some advice from my fellow engineers. It would be really helpful if you could give me a direction on what I currently know. I really wanna focus on something singular and go deep with it. I do like to code so I don't wanna go back as being and low/no code RPA developer again!!",2024-02-20 08:24:52
1avgzya,Career dilema: Self taught JS or Java bootcamp,"Career dilema (Javascript self taught or Java bootcamp)

Context:  
- Electrical engineer graduate 2023 (with AI programming in python)

- Did a data science bootcamp to deepen programming knowledge but realised I prefer building stuff (I always loved to do websites in wix and build stuff), rather than being a data analyst (which is all the entry level jobs there are)

The dilema:  
I decided I was going to learn full stack javascript on my own as that is the language that most new companies and startups use and is more in demand.

But I now have the opportunity to do a part time bootcamp with income shared agreement on backend development with guaranteed employment (they work with a small set of companies to provide specific talent, they give you the money of the bootcamp back if they dont find you a backend role within 6 months). CATCH: Its in Java, not javascript, so probably its in an IT consulting firm working with big enterprises.

My long term goal is to be a good software engineer but to work in dynamic startups and scale ups, not big ol´banks or insurance firms. I also prefer to develop in JavaScript as I think its easier to use, its used by more modern companies and its user base/demand is growing, so I'm a bit turned off by course being in Java.

SO: Should I keep going the self taught route in javascript full stack (I´ve got an intermediate level on python) and then apply for jobs (in 3 months time), OR should I complete the backend Java bootcamp (I would try to learn javascript on the side), get one of the jobs they offer in Java (they say September-November) for a year and then (once I have a year of experience) try to move into more Javascript development role in a smaller more innovative company where I get to do more of everything?

1av0bhk,Unsure SAP and my plan for the future,"Hi,

I'm currently a CS Bachelor Student in my 7th Semester employed as a working student (SAP App-Development). This is my first ever job in the IT industry and I've never have had any experience with SAP before this job. Currently I'm doing SAPUI5 frontend development and the plan for the future would be to start learning ABAP for backend.  I've been working for almost 7 months now.

My contract is expiring in a few months and most likely will be extended. The thing is I don't really like the SAP environment.  As far as I understand a career in SAP Development offers you a stable career but the skills you gather are exclusive to it. It limits you to only SAP if you want to find a new job. This really bugs me out. Maintaining and improving software for company's business processes doesn't excite me.

I really need the money to finance myself.  I'll finish my Bachelor soon and I'm planning to work for one more year (or two) after I graduate and in my free time I'll learn full stack development  (yet to decide on the frameworks etc.) eventually applying for jobs that will help me grow and offer more opportunities than SAP would.

Do you think that would be a good plan? I would really appreciate your feedback because I feel like my head is gonna explode. Thanks in advance",2024-02-19 22:10:05
1auqrks,"Promoted to senior role within team, unsure about salary raise?","Hi,

So I'm still at my first job after what will soon be 3 years and in a few months I will be promoted to a role that's basically our version of senior developer. I work in fintech and with this promotion I will get access to our production environment and also have the option of working releases and also being 'on-call'. I will also officially be responsible for a big part of our system, the one with final say about changes and so on. The biggest issue I'm having is that I moved to Sweden 6 months ago and everyone else in my team is paid in EURO while I switched to our Swedish office and get paid in SEK. I don't know anyone else on the Swedish side of things so no clue about what's a reasonable salary. I know the salary of 2 people with same role as I will have and they make 3700e(4 yoe) and 4100(5 yoe) but they work with Java while I'm on IBM.
I also know the salary of our system architect who has worked in the company for more than 10 years and he only makes 4600e. Right now I'm at 40 000 SEK/3500e and I'm thinking of asking for 20% raise.  My reasoning is:

I work 40h weeks while the rest of my team works 37.5h, due to Swedish contract. Salary wasn't adjusted enough to compensate this.

I'm mentoring two people in our team and didn't see any raises for this. Basically teaching them to code in this language.

We work with IBM's midrange computers, so code in RPGLE, CL and such. Stuff that a lot of people aren't interested in nor educated in. I'm very interested and one of our best coders while being on average 20 years younger than the other people in the company working with the same stuff.

I've been told 'jokingly' by 4 people in my team that I'm not allowed to leave the team or work somewhere else because then we would collapse. This was after they found out that I hate our team manager/HR.

So I feel like I have a lot of leverage but I also don't want to ruin my reputation by being greedy, especially when everyone else is so poorly compensated.",2024-02-19 16:01:45
1aus7r0,UK to EU Job Hunt - Front-end Web Dev [3 Years exp],"Hey all. I am looking for some advice and have some questions regarding applying and job seeking in primarily Austria and Germany.

To give some context. In 2-3 months I will hit my 3 year experience mark as a FE Developer, I have a BSc in Computer Science and I am about to undertake my German A1 course. Without stating the obvious I am also a native English speaker.

I am looking mainly at Southern Germany or anywhere in Austria primarily. I have worked previously in Austria for 3 months back in 2019 (not related to CS) but I'd imagine that holds no credit now.

I wanted to ask:

\- What is the current Job market like for roles around FE development roles at the moment?  
\- Germany is about to launch the Chancenkarte (opportunity visa) in May and it looks like I would qualify, is it worth looking at instead of the EU Blue Card?  
\- Is my experience level enough to draw enough interest from employers?  
\- In terms of CVs, I am familiar with how the UK does it. Will a CV in English be okay and is the format largely different in Europe?  
\- Might be a silly question, as a native speaker of English, will I require a proof of English competency? Or will me being English prove enough :D

If anyone else has done a similar journey UK -> EU post Brexit, would love if you shared how your experience was getting into the EU.

1aul5e0,I don't know where I've to go with my career,"Hello, I'm (36M) an experienced Italian developer, some years ago I decided to change my life starting to teaching CS in public school and becoming an IT consultant too (specialized in industrial computer vision). I appreciate my free-time and the fact I can use it to stay with my daughter (4yo) and I don't need baby care (my wife works full time), but my earning aren't very high, Italian school pay me \~25K for \~26 hour week September-June (\~July) and my consultant activity isn't very requested (I don't know how to search for customers), let add another 9K (another perk is that I work very near home and it's the same for my wife and the school of my daughter, then I don't really need a car).

Now, in Italy \~34K aren't a bad pay for a not full time work (it's more than half time), and I've the advantage that I can stay with my family and I can choose if I want or not to work in summer time. The problem is that I started to have many doubts about my financial security in my country, for example I starting to notice that we (mean Italian citizen) can't afford some imported things because the world changed their wages with the inflation , [Italy didn't it](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/15x2hzw/percentage_change_between_1990_and_2020_average/).  Another problem is the fertility rate of my country, I started to think that  when I'll retire the sanity system and retirement system could be collapsed.

What is my best option:

1. Do nothing, the problems are only in my head;
2. Intensify my consultant activities (maybe selling myself as generic .NET developer);
3. The same of point 2 but leaving the school or asking to reduce my working hours;
4. Leave Italy and search another job in Europe? But where (I speak only Italian and written English)? It could be convenient to me to search a part time job because I feel very good with my work/life balance.

1atuba5,Leaving FAANG to go to Cambridge?,"First of all, I realise that I am in a very privileged position. It doesn't make the choice any easier though.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in CS & AI about two years ago and joined a FAANG company as a software engineer right after graduating (both in the UK). Been there ever since. I had a bit of a difficult start since I wasn't sure if I wanted to go into the industry right away and since I had always enjoyed studying. I honestly felt a bit inferior due to ""only"" having a Bachelor's degree. Some changes were made in my team a couple of months ago and since then I've been thoroughly enjoying my job. I feel like I am growing as a person, taking on more responsibility, and am finally a valuable member of the team. I enjoy analytical tasks the most and have been getting to do a lot of those recently. 

I applied to Master's programs before this happened since I wanted to move more into the machine learning side of things. I ended up getting accepted at Cambridge and I will be interviewing at Oxford next week. Cambridge costs about £35000 and if I don't get a scholarship I would have to take out a loan. The course at Cambridge is centered around machine learning so it would be exactly what I am interested in. 

Right now I am trying to decide on what to do. On the one hand, it seems insane to turn down an offer from Cambridge. I also worry that my references (i.e. professors from the uni where I did my Bachelor's) wouldn't be willing/ able to provide references for me in the future. On the other hand, it also seems insane to leave a well-paid job at a big-name company just to take out a loan and maybe not find an equally good job at an equally good company after finishing the degree. I also looked at machine learning internships and a) there are not many out there and b) perhaps half of them require you to be enrolled in a PhD. 

I worry about regretting not taking the opportunity to study at Cambridge. On the other hand, I worry about quitting my job that I actually started to enjoy to potentially struggle to find a good job after. I know I would likely find SOME job, but I really don't want to end up at a small company after the investment of doing a Master's.

1atlf6o,Moving to Germany in 1-1.5 years (tech stack to focus),"Hey there,

I am a non-EU and non-Canadian citizen looking to move to Germany to be close with my parent who recently married a German living in Berlin. Sadly, I'm not eligible for any of the family based pathway so I would have to move to Germany through a job.

I am currently under work visa in Canada that's due to expire in 2025. The plan is to work outside of Canada for 1 year to clear the point for permanent residency (the points are inflated right now). This could be done anywhere in the world so I figured Germany might be a good place since I have a family (but my home country works as well).

I have a CS bachelor degree from a Canadian university and I'm currently working as a mid level dev in Canada (current stack .NET C# and VBA) but had prior experience in Java based position as well. Total experience is 4 years (1.5 years in Java, 2 years in .NET and 8 months of internships at AAA gaming company, not sure if this matters at this point in my career).

I'm not aiming for FAANG, Zalando, N26 or anything like that. Normal paying company is okay.

How's my odd of landing a job in Germany, particularly Berlin (but other cities are okay too) ?

Which tech stack should I focus on ?I heard interview in germany is quite heavy on tech stack and less leetcodey like Canada.

For now I do have the courses I did under education and I have my portfolio link but I think maybe some recruiters don't even get to the portfolio but just throw it out when they see no experience and no formal education

Hello everyone,

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology (BIT) and I'm looking for some guidance on my career path. Throughout my studies, I've gained experience with Java, object-oriented programming (OOP), and worked on servers using Java. I've also developed a web app and dabbled in Python during an AI course at university.

In addition to technical skills, I've completed project management courses and have experience in business analysis, requirement elicitation, human-computer interaction (including prototyping), and I've interned at a software company.

Now, I'm considering pursuing a Master's degree in either Data Science or Software Engineering in Amsterdam. I'm seeking advice on which path might be the best fit for me and what steps I can take to prepare for it. Specifically, I'm wondering what kind of personal projects I should work on to enhance my portfolio, and I'd love insights on how to effectively search for entry-level job opportunities in the Netherlands.

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!

I've been working 6+ years as a Frontend dev. I'm in Frankfurt, Germany right now. I was struggling to get a job and acceptes the only company that finally gave me an offer of 41000 per year. I honestly thought that's what I should be a pretty good salary as I am from a low cost of living nation.

Over the months I've realized I've been severely underpaid. Talking to a few co-workers who I trust of mentioned that too.

I've got a kid on the way an as it is right now, its getting tougher with the inflation. I've been thinking if I should get a minijob or a nebenjob to save up.

The job itself is really stressful with tight deadlines and sometimes need to something off hours. Looking at a few openings I always see that other devs with similar job like mine are paid around 50 - 55K (Frankfurt am main)

Going from 41k to 55k is really sharp increase. Are companies willing to increase that far or is my only option to jump ship.

1asjfsv,"In what kind of coding related job I would benefit from the skills I have? (UX, visuals, 3D, research etc.)","So, I'm working as a UX designer. But I hate it. The profession has changed for worse during the past maybe 6 years or so (it is nowadays more like being an internal salesman and secretary for product and dev teams, more than anything else). And there are layoffs going on in the company I work for, and they will quite likely hit the product I work in within the next 6 months.

  
I know, most people will say I could just start learn frontend. Which I actually have some skills in, but they are total legacy. Vanilla HTML and CSS mostly, also some Wordpress and Bootstrap. Everything is nowadays done with React, and I don't like React, I have studied it a bit and it's very uninteresting to me. I don't want to become a React coder.

  
So, what other skills do I have:

* Good 3D skills, both in polygon modeling as well as CAD/ nurbs modeling ( I'm an industrial designer by education)
* Research skills: very good skills in qualitative; good skills but rusty in quantitative ( before the design degree I studied in an academic master's programme which included several courses on proper quant research)
* Programming: have been scripting (for fun) in Python in Blender, done some C# tutorials in Unity, gmail imaplib stuff in Python, practicing visualizing stuff in Python Matplotlib, and prototyping in work related things for example some CSS stuff, Highcharts visualization, Android Studio XML and Kotlin UI elements.

  
I'm by no means a programmer, for example I have nearly zero skills in GIT and CI/CD and all other production stuff I don't even have names for.

  
So, does anybody have any suggestion what direction I could try to go with this kind of interests and background?

  
I have myself thought it would be something along the lines of data visualization, digital twins, maybe some geoinformatics thing or something. But the problem is that I don't know where to even start, what direction to take, what to learn, how to form some kind of curricular for myself.

Netherlands - Around 60K Euros  
Spain - Around 50K Euros  
Germany - Around 60K Euros  
Sweden - Around 50K SEK.

I have been working for 6 years in a computing center for public research in Germany. I would sum up my experience in the following way:

* Coding skills in Python for data-related project (Pandas, TensorFlow, Spark, ...)
* Managing several  [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) instances for data publication for several research projects (Flask-based)
* Managing several GitLab and GitLab Runner instances for our users
* Administrating all the servers for the above mentioned projects by taking care of OS updates, certificate renewals. I started recently to use Ansible Playbooks to set up and manage VMs.
* Managing Postgres Databases, in particular for research metadata (through this I gained a general knowledge of SQL)
* For a while I helped our users using our machine learning frameworks installed in our HPC cluster, but this was just for a few months and it was my first approach to machine learning.
* I set up a monitoring infrastructure using Prometheus and Grafana. I introduced at our computing center a centralized Grafana instance where colleagues can manage their own dashboards and data sources
* I have been playing a bit with Kubernetes without ever having a productive project related to it. I still could learn the basics
* I use Docker containers very often.

I am looking for a new challenge in the industry, and I was until now motivated to become a data engineer.  I am aiming at a GCP Certification but there is more work for me to do at the moment, although I have been working hard for it these past months.

The question is: Is it reasonable for me to pursue this project to become a data engineer in the industry, given my experience? Should I rather try to apply to DevOps, SRE, or system administration positions? My problem is that I never actually worked full time on just DevOps, or just system administration, and I lack the confidence to apply to such positions. When I look at the list of requirements, I see too often technologies that I don't know about, and feel that someone who already has experience in the industry will always have an advantage.

1arnnbk,CV review: 2+ years experience across various roles.,"Hi all.  I have  1.5 years experience in IT support (in CRE) and 7 months experience Software Engineering (Python) for the same company (based in London). I also did a basic python machine learning project at uni. However I am in the process of being made redundant (I got about 1 month of pay left (including notice period and redundancy pay)). I am applying to Python positions at the moment but no luck (not even an interview). I also mass applied to data analyst roles on websites such as total jobs and linkedin. Despite the fact that they have much easier requirements and I pretty much match most if not all the requirements (despite the fact that people state that it's not necessary to meet all of them) I still only get rejections. I also created cover letters for a lot of them (using chatgpt but did made a few minor changes). Maybe its because so many people apply for these positions. Other than maybe my lack of experience I feel like my CV might not be as good as it could be (at least its presentation being more eye catching to employers). What sort of tools should I use to potentially recreate my CV? If you could provide some feedback of my CV that would be great!

It feels to me that the only time the candidate can come up with something that separates them from the other candidates is when discussing database technologies and finding the best suitor for the specific product. Obviously, there can also be an interesting caching technique to speed up different use cases, but relying on coming up with them seems kind of an overkill from the employers side.  
  
This type of interview also feels like YAGNI all the way through, unless the interviewer clearly states that the system needs to be cost efficient/reliable/\*insert any other metric here\*, which I never experienced, most of them just leave the questions open ended.

Is such move even possible if I currently have a Polish working visa?

* I speak Korean, English, a little bit of Polish, and veery basic German.
* I want to earn at least as much as I do now (let's say around 65k EUR net per year), especially considering it's probably gonna be more expensive in places like Amsterdam or Hamburg. I can currently save around 2.5k - 3.5k EUR monthly, sometimes more if I don't have any unexpected expenses.

1ar10wp,Seeking career advice,"Hi there!  
  
I'm a 20M from the EU, and I'd be grateful for some advice or another perspective on my career trajectory in the tech industry.  
  
I graduated from secondary school with a specialization in Informatics in 2022. During secondary school, I managed to complete an internship related to software development, and right after graduation, I landed a part-time SWE role in my town. I then decided to try out university and eventually left the role after 5 months to pursue a CS degree. I performed quite well, but about 6 months ago, I had to drop out due to mental health and family issues, and since then, I've been working in another part-time SWE role. I don't really enjoy the day-to-day tasks and find the work extremely boring, much like my first part-time role before attempting the university. Almost daily, I ponder whether I should continue pursuing this career.  
  
I've always enjoyed programming — I started at 15, exploring every technology that caught my interest. Heck, I even enjoy solving LeetCode problems in my spare time just for fun. I fully understand that no job is perfect and that work is simply work; however, I can't envision myself doing this type of work for the next 20+ years. I'm not really invested in the outcomes of the projects I work on, the value they add to the company, or the fact that I actually built something; instead, I'm more interested in the process of thinking through problems and coming up with efficient, organized solutions and I also like working with the databases as well. Currently, I have about 1.5 years of internship/part-time experience working with Java, TypeScript, Scala, Angular, React, SQL, and have touched some system design topics as well. I'd like to leverage this experience as best I can, but I'm unsure about my next steps.  
  
I'm split between returning to university for a second attempt, or finding a full-time role in a field I would actually enjoy. The problem is, I have no clear idea what that field might be, and I've been thinking about this for a long time.  
  
I would be really grateful for some advice on how to determine whether SWE is the right path for me and I'm just an idiot, or if I should consider a completely different direction. If so, what could possibly be a better fit?",2024-02-14 23:24:43

I've come to opportunity of changing my job. Better pay, better tech stack, better deals to continue my masters, no oncalls, but on-site (close to my masters)

1aqteir,Master in Distributed Systems/Parallel Computing/Cloud Computing,"Hi all, 

I'm really looking forward the possibility to get enrolled in a masters program on (mainly) Distributed Systems. Currently, my main option is [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/software-engineering-distributed-systems); I have read very good reviews about the program but I'm curious about how hard it is and if it's possible to work while studying. For starters: is it really hard to be accepted? 

I consider (I will say this without meaning to sound pretentious or conceited) that I have a strong knowledge on distributed/parallel computing theory (even I have taught -as a teacher assistant- Distributed Computing three times in previous semesters on my faculty (UNAM-Faculty of Sciences)), so I don't know it this is a plus or it would make this program a little bit easier from a background/basic knowledge perspective (at least at the beginning). 

The company I work for is open to provide me support: the relocation from the Mexico -yes, I'm Mexican :)- offices to the Nordic ones (even to other offices in Europe). Currently I'm a Sr. Software Engineer/Release Engineer and I'm familiar with the work+study routine (I started to work during the last semesters of my CS major as a research assistant, teacher assistant and as SWE) but maybe this program is too hard to maintain that lifestyle (I don't know and I don't wanna die trying haha). 

My main concern is my job; I would like to keep working and my manager is open to helping me with my masters journey. I know that the KTH is said to be full-time, but is there a possibility to make an exception on this just in case and take an extra semester if needed -this would be my last option-? 

Besides this, which other masters degrees on these fields should I consider? I have heard that ETH has a good program, but I'm not sure. 

Any advice for me?

1aq4oec,"(UK) Where to move to, and working in London - am I missing something?","Hi, bit of a long one, reposting this from the UK subreddit.

Dev with nearly 3 years experience here, stuck at the same company as a junior in the southeast (Kent) as there's nowhere much better to hop to in my area, the tech job market is dead here compared to less economically deprived areas like Surrey and Berkshire. Currently making £25k (I know it's bad). This is after a few months stint at a crappy place using Classic ASP.

I'm looking to move to a city with actual good tech jobs. However I can't really decide which one to move to.

I've heard Bristol, Manchester, Leeds, Nottingham, Newcastle, Glasgow, Edinburgh and London can be good, obviously there's Cambridge as well but that's more embedded stuff etc., and parts of Berkshire like Reading, but they're more towns than cities. Have also heard Birmingham might be decent but it does have a bit of a reputation lol.

I've been trying to work out where would be good to move to for ages now, but it's quite hard. Ideally I'd want to live and work in the city I move to, rather than living in a commuter area, as I'm in my 20s.

London seems to have by far the most jobs that look like good places to work at, and they do seem to pay better - maybe I could get around £60 - £65k with my experience doing .NET, Azure etc.? Although, most of the places seem to only pay enough to cover the extra cost of rent, assuming student loans (e.g. Manchester might pay £40k for a mid level, so I take home £2400, vs London paying £60k which means I take home around £3200). And the difference for a city centre flat is around £800 or £900 (maybe £1000 - £1100 in Manchester, or £1800 - £2000 for a cool area in Zone 2). So you aren't actually making more money, apart from your pension.

Now I know that career progression is meant to happen much faster in London for whatever reason, but what's the point of working there when you could probably buy your own 2 bed city centre flat in somewhere like Manchester on a mid-level salary, while it would be a struggle to even do that in London when you're earning £100k?

So you put in all that effort, having to house share for ages to have any decent savings, all so you end up having to buy a flat way out in the suburbs or a house in a boring commuter town, probably living far away from all your friends that have also had to move out to whatever other part of the UK, because it's so expensive?

Every post around UK careers in tech seem to be focused around London being the default, best place to work, I feel like I'm missing something? I feel like the only benefit is being able to afford to live in London (although only being able to rent your own place once you're a senior) and that there are more + more interesting jobs.

Obviously this changes if you have a partner and are looking to buy, although I'm not sure what I want to do relationships-wise, and you do have the issue of the other person not necessarily being in a career that gets a large London weighting, so you might still not be that well off. And I really don't want to get a partner just to buy a house obviously.

The main problems I've found when looking at other cities, apart from them having fewer jobs in general, is that they tend to have much smaller companies, as well as a lot of agencies / consultancies which may be worse to work for. So you have more choice in places to work at in London, and are more likely to work at a 'better' company, apart from the pay vs cost of living.

Can anyone offer some suggestions around where would be good to move to, if those places have decent jobs, and some suggestions for what I should be doing in my career? I've been thinking about this stuff for months and I can't figure out what to do, and generally am in a state of analysis paralysis. I know this type of thread will probably bring the London haters and 'I work remotely from some random town for a London company for £70k' people, but I'd appreciate a more balanced response if possible.

I appreciate I've posted/commented a lot about this kind of stuff before, but my 20s are rapidly disappearing, and I want to move somewhere more interesting with more opportunity, but the prospect of moving somewhere like London seems a bit depressing if I'm eventually gonna have to leave anyway, but I don't want to move somewhere where my opportunities are like 5 different large companies in the city, or working at a crappy agency, for my whole career.

The thought of house sharing until I become a senior also sounds depressing, I know a lot of people have to do that though, but having your own place doesn't seem like much to ask for in a career that's supposed to be well paid in the UK... there's so many things about it that worry me, like struggling to find time to cook in the Kitchen, scheduling showers, cleaning, getting bad flatmates, even things like getting good internet and being allowed to run an Ethernet cable to the router (I play fighting games so that's kind of essential).

I'd imagine a lot of people just see the big salary in London and want to live there so they take it, but feel like a lot of the problems of London have been revealed to me before I've even moved there, so the prospect doesn't seem that exciting :D It seems like a cool place to live obviously if you're earning a shitload or are okay with compromising on accommodation.",2024-02-13 21:11:20

From this job I have experience with C# .NET, but we pretty much only use .NET framework and WinForms, so I have very little exposure to anything modern or the kind of wide range tech stacks most companies use now, and I’m worried staying too long will have my skills stagnating and make it harder to leave the longer I stay.

I have some other experience in Python, SQL, and basic HTML/CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript and PHP for website project I did before for university. I know I don’t want to work with PHP again, but I am open to learning anything else.

I feel stuck as I don’t think my current experience will be enough for any other job, as I don’t have experience with most of the common job requirements I see, and companies don’t seem willing to train people much nowadays given the market. I could learn something like ASP.NET or Blazor and some cloud technology, as I have C# experience already and frequently see these in job posts as well, or I could learn Django for Python, or go with something like React/JS/NodeJS/TS etc.

I don’t have a huge amount of time and energy outside of work though (alongside also trying to practice some leetcode) so I’d like to take the path of having the least to learn and preferably what would open the most doors for me.

In this economy is it worth doing data structures and algorithms along with system design? I was also thinking of pivoting into cloud is that a good choice? 

Im confused on how I should spend my time. In future if CS jobs decrease due to AI then at-least i will have Cloud computing career to fall back on. What do you guys think should i focus on interview prep or focus on learning cloud?

1apafj5,Exchange paycut for RSUs in new job,"Hi,

Looking to get some advice on a potential job move.

Have a new job offer and current job; they are about equivalent except compensation related.

Current job
140k salary
400k equity (private and over 3 years)
20k bonus


New Job
110k salary
200k equity (public and over 4 years)
20k bonus


The current company isn't looking too good and I think the equity could be worthless.

As you can see the cash comes out more as I could sell the stock in the new place.  I'd have to take a paycut though.

I'm an EU student in the first year of a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence. I graduated from a technical institute of Computer Science and I have on my resume a 6-month swe internship + other working experiences.  
I would like to do internships n AI field before i graduate, but it seems that AI internships are very few compared to those for swe (and almost all of them are in the U.S., and as a non-U.S. citizen it is almost impossible to get picked up).  
Some senior students have told me that the best thing to do is to get internships for swe and then migrate into AI when you are no longer considered a junior.  
I don't know how to devote myself to machine learning or devote to data structures and algorithms for internships, both options due by summer 2025.  
Of course I can do both, but I would like to know which one should take priority, or if you have other options that I have not considered/suggestions various.

1aozgou,Am I as much underpaid as I think?,"Hey everyone!

Last year I started a new job as an It-Consultant at a ECM company in Germany. My company is one of the market leaders und ist currently spreading its business outside of the DACH area.

My profile is the following: I have a bachelor's degree in CS from the RWTH Aachenband worked as a full stack developer for 1 1/2 years before it joining my current company with a salary of 51k per year and up to 12k bonus. The bonus is possible for everyone in my department and depending on how much you work for a customer or on something internal that benefits the company. But you have to work on customer project at least 70% of your time.

Besides my usual work, I am also leading a Community of Practice with the goal to improve the work on cloud project in our specific environment. I started this idea on my own and quickly got backing from my team lead as well as our regional director. This position also lead me to meetings with people way higher up where we are talking on improvement regarding the cloud. I also support people when they develop in Java and colleagues working longer with our products come toe for advice in regard to them. Additionally, some senior colleagues specifically ask my team lead if I can work in their projects and I am currently part of one of the 2 biggest deals we managed to secure last year. In one I am leading a sub project regarding data migration.

Some time ago, I got to know, what colleagues who were working students and joined us directly after uni, earn 1k less per year than I am. Of course I am happy for them and probably should have negotiated a better deal for myself, but I feel that due to my additional work and the general satisfaction in my projects, I should be paid more. I talked toy Team lead about this and he said, that we will talk in February about it, when we have our annual meeting for this year's targets.

For how much should I ask in this meeting? I honestly do not expect much, since I have heard of colleagues who had to fight almost a year to get 200 gross a month.",2024-02-12 13:00:04

The nice thing is that it sends a notification when it finds new jobs so you don't have to look for them manually.

1aovtvf,Chaotic organization in my current data science job in a Hospital in Spain.,"I am writing this post, to discuss with people with more experience in data scientist positions in hospital or medical fields or any other field, what were the motivations in their first professional years and to tell the doubts that I currently have in my current job.  
  
After having worked in a project during my master and later having collaborated in a research project in a university for more than 1 year, I finally got a job as a data scientist in an important hospital in Spain (My current motivation is a biomedical context of applying AI techniques, even the two previous experiences I have mentioned were also in the medical field). The projects they have to carry out are very motivating but I have encountered issues that make me doubt whether it is worth to stay longer here, considering that these are the first years of professional experience. The projects as I say are very motivating, but are weighed by non-technical profiles, absolutely nothing technical and in this time I am realizing the great difficulty sometimes to communicate the difficulties that have such projects in addition to many times I think that in these early years would be ideal to work in a larger team (currently working alone), with people with more experience and knowledge and even with a project manager with some knowledge in the technical part.  
  
After six months, and seeing that the organization is being very chaotic and that the learning and professional development is being completely self-taught, makes me wonder if a position like this is the best position for a profile like mine. Currently what interests me the most is to try to get two projects I am working on, doing the best I can, in fact, I try to apply state of the art techniques that I read about daily, in order to be able to publish those projects or at least to be able to make a complete description of those projects for the CV, for example. However, I constantly ask myself if I am doing well or how much time I am willing to give for the latter to be fulfilled and give another chance elsewhere.

1aoylbt,Shifting from Dev to PM,"I’ve been working as a developer for the past 3 years, but my background is actually in communications. Recently, I’ve been offered an opportunity to shift towards project management. While this is an exciting prospect, I’m grappling with concerns about long-term career progression. My apprehension stems from the observation that there are generally more developers than project managers, which might imply more competition and potentially a tougher climb in the project management track.

I’m at a crossroads and could really use some diverse perspectives on this. Here are a few specific points I’m pondering:

	•	Career Growth: How does the career trajectory for a project manager compare to that of a developer in terms of opportunities for advancement and skill development?
	•	Job Market Dynamics: Considering the larger number of developers compared to project managers, is my concern about the potential for an “evolutionary dead-end” in project management valid?
	•	Personal Development: Given my background in communications, does transitioning to project management make more sense, or should I continue honing my skills as a developer?

I’m eager to hear both the pros and cons based on your experiences or observations. Any advice, insights, or anecdotes would be immensely appreciated to help me make a more informed decision.

1aoxv3g,Need Advice: help me pick a SWE offer,"Hi everyone!

I find myself in a bit of a dilemma and could use some insights from fellow software engineers or anyone with experience in the tech industry. 

I've been fortunate enough to receive offers for two different positions, but I'm having a hard time deciding between them. Both opportunities seem promising, and I'm torn between which path to take. The first one is a three-months internship while the second is a regular hire with a decent pay.

I am a CS student who's about to graduate in Italy and both these offers are from Italian companies and in the banking field.

&#x200B;

Here's a brief overview of each position:

First offer:

* Big Company (50k employees), the division I would work in is relatively small and new (10/20pp).
* Role: Application Maintenance on Low Code projects.
* Pros
   * Established company with a strong reputation in the industry.
   * Would look good on my resume.
   * Fully remote.
* Cons
   * I am not sure about working with low code, maybe it could be difficult to switch to more ""tecnhical"" positions.
   *  the salary would be approx 1/3 of the other option for the duration of the internship. After this, I am sure they will hire me but I don't know the GAP for the role. 

Second offer:

* Small company / startup (10 employees).
* Role: Java SWE for backend, occasionally working with Angular.
* Pros
   * The position/role itself seems more challanging/interesting to me.
   * I liked the people I talked to during the interview process.
   * I would like to be part of a startup.
   * Decent salary (30k) plus Stock option.
* Cons
   * Small company, I am not sure if it could impact the way a recruiter looks at my CV.
   * Not fully remote.

1ao7b03,Should I negotiate for more?,"Hey guys, I finally received a written contract for a job I interviewed for a few months ago. Although I received positive feedback not long after the interview, I had to wait a few months maybe because it is a multinational corporation, and partly because they were figuring out where would be best to relocate me as none of their plants is based in my homeland and maybe some other reason I am not aware of. Anyway, after several phone calls and discussions about where I would relocate to (I was pretty much open to a few countries in the EU), we came to an agreement that I would work as a contractor. So the company can save money since I will have a contract with the Swiss department. I have received an offer for 40.000 EUR per year (of course I have to pay my taxes from this amount). I will work fully remotely from the Czech Republic.

Question should I try to negotiate for more, since I won't have some benefits? At the same time just getting the job would be a good step up I think, gaining more experinces.

If you've done it, what's your story?",2024-02-09 19:29:24
1amj2il,"What to do next, complete personal projects, or learn JUnit and other generic skills?","For context, I'm a student in a college-like program, we're 3 months into our course, and we've barely touched any code in Java or Javascript. But I had learned the basics of Java on my own and started digging into Spring 4 months ago. I love Java/Spring/Hibernate and want to find an internship position in this stack in the next month (the curriculum includes the help from the institution to help you land two 3 months internships, the finding phase of the first is about to start next week, and the lessons of the first year end in 2 months)

I already know the basics of Rest API and Spring Boot. I've created two very simple (one entity) CRUD apps, just CRUD methods + endpoints, nothing fancy, similar to the 1h 2h tutorials on youtube (actually I just followed two of such guides)

and now I'm trying to create a third project of mine, with multiple entities, create mappings between them with hibernate, and then finally use join queries to create more complex query methods and rest points.

For this purpose, I watched lots of YouTube videos, and succeded in establishing some relationships. Now I'm trying to learn SQL as well, as it's needed to implement the queries inside Hibernate. Later, I plan to add login page, spring security, and so on to the project..

However, I do start to doubt myself...Am I really doing the right thing? I desperately need a job and I love coding in Spring. I live in Italy and it does look like most dev jobs are in Java, and they typically ask for Spring. However, some ads ask for Java EE ( I suppose it's just like pure Java without Spring?) But you know, until you've landed the first internship/job, it's really uncertain if you can push the door into the room. So I'm becoming more anxious day by day that I won't be able to land an internship in Java/Spring, and that all the efforts would've been wasted.

Also, from the eyes of an experienced dev, what would you love to see on the resume of candidates for inter positions? I'm thinking about putting the three projects on my resume, maybe after changing some names of the first two (generic names because I had followed tutorials). And then put some keywords such as Hibernate, SQL, Rest API, Spring Boot, and so on on my resume. Do you think it would help me land an internship position in this stack?

Between SQL and completing the third project; and more generic skills like JUnit testing, Docker, microservices, github, and so on. Which one would you say I should spend more time on?

Thanks for reading... Any suggestion will be extremely appreciated!",2024-02-09 07:54:57
1amm8gv,Inquiry Regarding Permissibility of Part-Time Work with UK-Based Company While Under Apprenticeship Contract in Italy,"I am an expat currently residing in Italy. I initially came to Italy as a student, completed my master's degree, and subsequently began working in the country. Presently, I am under an Apprendistato contract with my current employer in Italy. Recently, I have been offered an opportunity to work as a freelancer, either on a full-time or part-time basis, for a company based in the UK. While they are particularly interested in a full-time commitment, the choice ultimately rests with me.  
I am seeking clarification on whether it is permissible under my current apprenticeship contract to engage in part-time work with a UK-based company while fulfilling my obligations here in Italy.  
Specifically, I am wondering if I can allocate 8 hours to my current role and dedicate an additional 4 hours to the UK-based company.

1am2ryl,Unsure whether I should pursue the path of a software engineer or switch to a different career,"I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science.

  
I have been working for 3 months as a software engineer at a small company.

The team consists of 8 developers. Together we develop a C# web application which forms the base for other products. The work environment is good. I have a mentor and 10 days budget for off-the-job training. But I'm unsure whether I like the job.

What frustrates me is the social isolation. Staring at the screen not knowing what to do with the error message feels draining. I feel distracted working at home. I cannot concentrate for even one hour without losing focus. 

I know the perfect job doesn't exist but I want to enjoy the work without too much stress and frustration. 

  
I don't like to sit in front of a computer all day. Also working alone without collaboration 80% of the time makes me bored. I prefer to interact with people.

I'll continue to work at my current job to get experience. I work in Germany. 

  
What alternatives can you suggest to me?

  
How can I determine the correct path for me without doing internships in each industry?

I've just heard back today that I passed the interviews for both companies and I'm getting an offer, but I'm not sure which one to choose. It's a SWE Internship (and it will be my last) over the summer. I tried moving any to before summer but it's not an option, so I have to choose. 

It's an internship based in EMEA (Spain) and Microsoft pays a bit less than MongoDB (300€ gross per month). I would be working in an interesting team for Microsoft and for an internal tool in MongoDB. 

Both seem like a great option and I'd love my time in both of them, but what worries me the most is the conversion rate to FTE.

Especially those who have work experience in software development, programming, etc., within the European Union.

A series of unfortunate events, including an economic crisis in my home country and serious financial problems, have led me to consider a deviation from my current career path and explore opportunities in computer science-related fields such as programming and software development.

I am contemplating studying computer science in Europe, but I only speak English. Therefore, I have restricted my search to English-taught Bachelor's programs.

Despite their scarcity, I have managed to find some English-taught Bachelor's programs in subjects such as Applied Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, which although not strictly Computer Science programs, are akin to a CS degree.

I understand that most individuals pursue a computer science degree and then either specialize in AI during their final year or pursue a master's later on for specialization in AI (which I believe is probably the ideal path). Unfortunately, given my circumstances, choices are limited. There aren't many English-taught programs, and those available are predominantly AI-focused.

On one hand, I contemplate whether an employer would seek someone who has studied solely artificial intelligence and lacks a general computer science background. On the other hand, I recall acquaintances who secured good jobs in the EU despite lacking a CS degree but possessing a few bootcamp certificates and some work experience.

Has anyone here pursued a Bachelor's degree in AI-related fields and successfully found employment as a software developer or programmer?Thank you very much in advance. Kind regards.",2024-02-08 05:28:20

I'm a last year CS Master degree student in Switzerland and next semester, I have to do a 6-month long internship.

I now have two different offers, and I am having a hard time to decide which one to accept.

1. A more interesting project, research oriented, but the salary is lower (1k5/month). The job is in Paris and as I'm finishing my exam session quite late, I'll have only 3 weeks to find a housing which is a bit stressful and seems quite tricky. However, the project aligns better with my career goal.
2. A slightly less interesting project in the private sector, but higher salary (3k/month). The job is closer to where I live, in Switzerland, so I won't need to relocate. The project is not boring, but does not align as well as the other one with my career goal. Also there is no supervisor skilled in the project specific field (ML) but as my long term goal is to work in Switzerland, I feel like it would benefit better my networking.

1akb3wv,Deciding between 2 offers: Anyone has recent experience from ASOS?,"Been offered engineer role at ASOS, tried to negotiate based on another offer I received from one of the largest food/snack US companies. The overall package is around 10% higher than offer from ASOS.

ASOS is not offering any increase at all and require 2 days (must be specific week days) in the office (for 'team meetings').

&#x200B;

All other things I considered:

&#x200B;

||**ASOS**|**Food/Snack Conglomerate**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Department**|FinTech|Mfg/Ops/R&D|
|**Learning**|Azure - great (discounts for certs, etc.)|Not 100%, need to check with HR|
|**Team/People - Ambitions**|People younger, more ambitious?|People older (not old!), been in their roles for a very long time|
|**Advertised Tech Stack**|All in Azure|Mostly Azure|
|**Company Performance**|Poor|Great|
|**Growth**|Poor (reviews from finance analysts)|Great growth because of new division|
|**WFH**|2 days (not flexible)|Mostly WFH (rarely office)|
|**Salary**|Acceptable (minimum for me)|Acceptable + 10%|
|**Glassdoor**|3.4|over 4|
|**General Reviews on Glassdoor**|'Good People But Sinking Culture With No Growth'Poor outlook, savings:'water, instant coffee and tea. Everything else is out of your own pockets, although subsidised.';|More positive reviews, no poor feedback consensus|
|**Exit value (what company has higher 'prestige')**|Higher|Lower|

&#x200B;

So, in quick summary, the main reason why I'd want ASOS is because of steeper learning curve, ambitions and better exit value. Is it worth sacrificing higher salary, WFH, etc? Or any other considerations should I take?

If anyone is working for ASOS in IT (or in general) - any feedback? Is it quite grim because of performance?

&#x200B;

Our situation - got a 1y/o toddler, so WFH would help for sure, but also want to learn new things and progress in career. It seems like a very difficult decision...

1ajeosf,Getting the first job,"Hey, I worked 7 years in a non-tech industry and in the last year have decided to transition to a career in CS. I completed a six month professional training course in AI development and then did a smaller course in Django. I feel like I have the skills to be an intern or entry-level data scientist or Python developer but I'm having a hard time getting interviews. I'm thinking if I offer myself to a start-up to work for free that could be a good way to price myself into the market at the beginning, but I have no idea where to find start-ups or if that's a viable plan. For context I live in Brussels where there isn't all that much so I'm thinking remote could be an option. I'd even work for a company in Latin America or Africa but I have no means of finding, contacting them!

Anyway, any advice is more than welcome! Thanks :)",2024-02-05 11:50:28

1aiwn1a,Should I go for senior roles only?,"Hi, I‘m a Product Manager with 5 YOE and looking for a new job. I’ve mostly been applying for senior pm positions, but had an interview for a Technical PM position, where the title doesn’t contain senior (but it would be a 20% pay increase). The recruiter said they only hire seniors, and there’s only „normal“ PM titles and then Group PMs in their company, nothing else/in between. 
Do titles matter? It’s the only reason why I’m considering cancelling the next interviews, even though the job seems great.

I’m a bit concerned that in the future HR will look at my resume and see three PM positions in a row, with seemingly no promotion or title change. ",2024-02-04 19:48:52

1ai30ft,Software Development or Electronic Engineering ?,"I am 20 and stuck between two course choices for university.   
1. Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computing in Software Development   
2. Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Software and Electronic Engineering

  
For the first one it focuses on purely software development and incorporating computer science theory using languages java and c#. Employment opportunities in all tech and development industries. This course also has a 90% employment.

  
The second one you learn about software using c and c++, computers, electronics, the Internet, and the cloud, from the basic transistor to the Internet of Things. You also get an 8 month work placement. main employment opportunities in companies like cisco,intel,HP. 

  
Im based in Ireland and am interested in both but dont know which one will have a brighter future. I think its easier to get a job after the software dev course and dont really know were the electronic engineering sector is at or were it is going. ",2024-02-03 18:43:52

1agj5nu,Need advice on getting hired in Netherlands,"Hello, have 2 questions. I moved to the Netherlands from Ukraine last summer. And due the the previous fact also possess a work permit until spring 2025. Later will need HSM visa. Speak English, don't speak Dutch. Have a Bachelor degree in cs. Looking for a job for the last 4 months. Got 2 interviews, but both ended in rejection.

Soo now the question: How should I position my experience? A little bit of a context: I have two years of experience as a full-stack software engineer in an **outsource company**, though not quite...

* Initially, I spent nearly a year on a shitty **internal project**, working primarily with junior developers. Our tech stack included Java/Spring/Angular/MongoDB.
* Following this, I contributed 4 months to another **internal project**, slightly better, using Java/Spring/PostgreSQL/GitLab CI/CD/Redis.
* Lastly, I spent 5-6 months on a real project though in a ""shadow mode"", though with a completely different stack (Ruby/Rails/PostgreSQL), and then spent three months benching, learning AWS and React.

Given this background, I'm uncertain how to classify my level of expertise. I don't feel confident enough to consider myself mid-level, yet it seems offers requiring 1-2 years of experience are QUITE rare here. Usually it's 3+.

So, now, the full question sounds like ""Regarding what I've written above, **is it feasible trying to land on a mid-level position**, or should I be doing something else: ""serious"" pet-project/internship/etc.""?

If you are positive with the previous. Could you please take a glance at my CV. https://imgur.com/a/6pL2AzV

* Are my bullet points sound ok, Or maybe too pretentious, Or maybe too weak?
* Any other concerns?

Thank you for your attention/time.

1agr2ww,Seeking advice,"Hello everyone, I am writing here to see if I can get some advice from the community, I am a web developer, at least that's what I have written on my resume, I use javascript majorly, so(react.js, express.js, next.js....) which sounds good but I find myself struggling to keep up and focus on improving my skills.
when I got into software development, my desire was not to just build websites for a living, my desire was to write code as per needed, which I currently actually do, so today I might find myself coding a trading robot using mql language, and tomorrow working a self management  app using javascript, automating my web browser using python the next,  dabling with raspberry pi e.t.c,

Basically I use code according to my needs, so it gets quite difficult and overwhelming when I working for a company with their constantly shifting project requirements demanding constant learning of new libraries and frameworks.
Coding is something I derive great joy in doing and I feeling having to fit the expectations of a recruiter somewhere in order to earn a living ruins that experience for me in a way.

I have about 4-5 year of working experience currently and I am open to work.
I am interested interested in blockchain technology and 3d-web developement, and I am looking to incorporate these two into my work as i feel there is alot to come from these in the future.

I hope I can get some good advice, some clearity and probably mentor who can guide my path from you all, thanks. I am looking forward to all the responses",2024-02-02 01:01:12

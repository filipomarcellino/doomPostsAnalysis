m7rtm4,About data leaks from Fastway Couriers,"Good day!My name is Alex Gor and I am a security researcher.On the 20th of February 2021, I discovered an open access database ElasticSearch / Kibana server [http://34.244.144.236:8080](http://34.244.144.236:8080/) (via the specialized search service [shodan.io](http://shodan.io/)), which, as I later found out, belonged to Fastway Couriers.The server was accessible from the Internet without entering a password, and anyone could enter freely.I downloaded some data for analysis and to identify the server ownership. After I identified the owner of the server (Fastway Couriers), I immediately contacted him using the contact information found inside the database. It was on February 24, 2021 (I am attaching a screenshot of the letter)

Only on March 2, an employee of Fastway Couriers Martin Doyle contacted me and thanked me for the vulnerability found.

The data was immediately deleted.

However, on March 11, the company issued a [press release](https://fastway.ie/why-fastway/media-releases/399-statement-from-fastway-couriers-regarding-data-breach) claiming that the company was the victim of a ""malicious cyber attack."" This is a lie.The company simply did not take proper measures to ensure data security and left the server with critical data in the public domain.

It should be noted that even now this server is exposed to 23 actual vulnerabilities and the company has not yet taken any measures to eliminate it. - [https://www.shodan.io/host/34.244.144.236](https://www.shodan.io/host/34.244.144.236)

I plan to publish a more detailed report on this incident in the coming days and can share with you if you are interested.

UPD. **I would like to be contacted by journalists who spread the news about the ""hacker attack""**

1b24ap3,"How to stop colleagues just messaging ""Hi John"" and waiting for your reply before asking you the actual question.","This is very annoying. I don't know why, it's a minor thing. But it's annoying. 

Just ask me the feckin question. 

I am starting to leave these people hanging for hours, waiting for them to actually ask the question. But they never do.

Just a message sitting there for hours ""Hi John"" or ""GM how are u John"".

They only ask the actual question if I respond: ""Hi I'm fine how are you?""

Otherwise they're happy to suffer for hours with whatever technical problems they're having.

If you are one of these people, why do you do it? Just ask the feckin question.

For those of you who are annoyed by this, did you tell your colleagues to just ask the feckin question? How did you do this in a non-arsehole way?",2024-02-28 11:54:32

mh8qh8,Data breach in Fastway Couriers. Detailed report,"On February 17, 2021, I discovered an ElasticSearch (Kibana) server in the public domain (this is when there is access without entering a password) with an IP address [34.244.144.236:8080](https://34.244.144.236:8080) ([ec2-34-244-144-236.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com](https://ec2-34-244-144-236.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com)) as I later found out, owned by Fastway Couriers.

As follows from the data of the specialized search engine [https://leakix.net/](https://leakix.net/), the [server](https://leakix.net/host/34.244.144.236) first appeared in the public domain on **October 6, 2020**

https://preview.redd.it/bggi6hh8qdq61.png?width=1887&format=png&auto=webp&s=6124872a83c139698fed6f6a2f17ee6d9683b0ef

And the server got into the search in [Zoomeye](https://www.zoomeye.org/searchResult?q=34.244.144.236) on February 7, 2021

https://preview.redd.it/m01ybg5oqdq61.png?width=1747&format=png&auto=webp&s=351255cb10b696cab2a96e48dd90a140b470acc5

At the time of detection by the search engine, the server had 9 critical vulnerabilities

https://preview.redd.it/mj7k69r8rdq61.png?width=1417&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c576e67d5827218a3223f0c6e3335298d1fc4c4

And the search engine [Shodan.io](https://Shodan.io), which discovered the server only on February 20, 2021 (now the data has been deleted, at the time of discovery, the information was available) found even 23 vulnerabilities of varying severity

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fa7y9oygrdq61.png?width=1899&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc5807c07e037b247ed6bc4b4393ea4624b2d4b

To determine the owner of the server, I downloaded a certain amount of data (all data was available for download) and on February 24, 2021, when I found out the owner of the server, I contacted Fastway Couriers using the contact information found in the logs.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pavpf2vqrdq61.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=6325219c4a36094b336084aade208363953e806b

A few days later, the Elastic server was removed from public access, and on March 2, Fastway Couriers employee Martin Doyle contacted me and thanked me for the vulnerability discovered.

However, on March 11, the company issued a press release claiming that the company was the victim of a ""malicious cyberattack.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m4talnt7sdq61.png?width=1909&format=png&auto=webp&s=51b2e5a86520c33bf03413f03a34aeb2a332dfee

This press release has now been [removed](https://fastway.ie/why-fastway/media-releases/399-statement-from-fastway-couriers-regarding-data-breach), as has any mention of a ""malicious cyber attack."" I suppose that the company decided to take such a step after my publication on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/m7rtm4/about_data_leaks_from_fastway_couriers/)

Because almost all of the information in their press release is false. Starting with a ""malicious cyberattack"", ending with a statement by their director that allegedly ""financial information was not harmed"", as if they had it protected. The message that they were allegedly ""attacked while technical work was underway on the server"" is also a lie. As you can see, since October 6, 2020 (or maybe earlier), their server has been in the public domain.

And Danny Hughes made a mistake with the number of affected users by an order of magnitude - look at the logs from Elastic, the number of documents is indicated in brackets. They are, of course, not unique and may be repeated, but most are unique. By the name of the indexes, you can roughly understand what kind of information is stored in them. I downloaded information from the *merger\_db\_events* index. But there is no guarantee that someone else did not use the open server earlier

After the publication on Reddit, journalists contacted me

Niall O'Connor from [TheJournal.ie](https://TheJournal.ie) and Simon Carswell from [irishtimes.com](https://irishtimes.com), but they did not answer my reply email to send questions. I have no opportunity to talk on the phone. I still expect you to refute the previously published information on the websites of your publications, especially after the company itself removed its press release from its website.

&#x200B;

A about my research.

I have been looking for vulnerabilities for a little over a year. During this time, I have notified hundreds of companies about vulnerabilities, including the largest in the world - [Dell](https://bugcrowd.com/AlexGor), Unilever, [Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert/hall-of-thanks.html), etc.

Nothing has changed. The statement still stands.  
The statement was removed by mistake. A tech person in Fastway was taking down the banner and removed the statement by mistake. It will go back up.  
As mentioned last week, there’s a criminal investigation on-going.

I had a bit of an epiphany after getting some of the usual unsolicited emails from recruiters that I could, in a small way, help ensure the status quo can be maintained and push back against the companies that want to enforce attendance in the office. 

Now every time I get an email from a recruiter I've no interest in, I ask about it being fully remote and if it's not, I use that as the reasoning for not wanting to proceed any further. It's a small thing but if more folks did it, it could help feed metrics into recruitment folks that roles are not getting filled because of the inability to offer remote roles. ",2023-07-11 23:42:06

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart thank you. 

About 6 months ago, like all of us, I was just another guy living through pretty some pretty weird circumstances. The leaving cert CAO was closing and all I could think about was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. Thankfully one day I stumbled across this sub and said “f*** it, might aswell look for answers here”. I simply asked if anyone could help me paint a picture of what it’s like to be a computer science student. An hour or two went by and I thought I’d been lost in the new section, when all of a sudden my phone blew up. I got about 30 messages from different developers telling me their college experiences, and giving me advice. Well it’s been 6 months and I’m a computer science student at UCD. 
I’m currently learning C programming and couldn’t be happier...

### Comparison with USA salaries
Overall, the figures seems to be a bit on the lower end when compared with USA salaries for the same job/company/experience, and that is despite the fact that USA has lower tax rates in cities like Seattle while Dublin has superhigh taxes and high housing rents. 

* To take a rough example, a new college graduate while working for Google/Microsoft/Amazon would get a salary of around 100,000 + 20 to 30,000 (joining bonus) + 30 to 40,000 (stocks) while for that same job description in Google Dublin you would get around 55,000 + 3 to 7,000 (bonus) + 10 to 20,000 (stock). [More data on USA grad salaries can be seen in this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tgvh4i/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_experienced/)

17yrgi9,Dealing with deranged pro-Israel talk in work,"Is anyone else experiencing anything like this? 

I work for an American crowd with offices all over including in Tel Aviv. After the 7 October, there has been a lot of absolutely disgusting and insane pro-Israel talk being posted in one particular (public) Slack channel. People saying that claims of apartheid against Palestinians are fake, American jews saying they are afraid for their lives (while writing from suburban north California 🤦). Other Americans barely containing their racism while giving out about how black activists in the US are coming out strong for Palestine. People outstraight denying the many atrocities such as the bombing of the Al Alhi hospital. 

One of the most offensive messages in this channel was a photo of the recent pro-Israel march in Washington DC done in the style of an old-school TOP TEXT, BOTTOM TEXT meme that said: ""20 million Jews march on DC, according to Gaza health ministry"". Completely disgusting and insane thing to say in a public forum in the workplace.

There hasn't been a peep from any Palestinian, Arab or Muslim employees mind you. 

It's just so toxic that people feel they can run their mouths like this (while claiming to be the victims, lol) and it must leave Muslim employees feeling totally silenced. 

Americans love to inappropriately discuss politics in work in my experience but this is a totally different level. I really want to do something about it - probably will write to the local HR here in Dublin first to sound them out. Is anyone out there in a union that is taking a stand on this issue?

Serious of hiring and firing. I've seen people who moved jobs, only to be fired within 2 weeks!! I couldn't believe it. Never seen anything like it.

Staff are working with a sub par product. Management blame the staff. Staff are fired and others are hired. Cycle continues. The CEO founder thinks he knows everything and it's a struggle to make simple improvements. The 2 brother founders just fire anyone who even slightly disagrees. The CEO even talked at an all hands meeting after making 30% of the company redundant about how great it was! Bizarre. The other brother screams at people in meetings, regularly is a no show to other meetings and doesn't even let people know. Just leaves them waiting there.

The company is actively for sale and at which point everyone will most likely be made redundant and customers will be left in thr dark.

I really would not recommend joining. They use google sheets as their CRM. Its the biggest mess of a company I've ever worked for. Some tiny companies I worked for that had 4-5 staff members were run far better and had better tools and that is saying something.",2023-06-28 14:49:30

Looking for comfortable features like ergonomic designs, adjustable armrests, and lumbar support that can alleviate back strain after long hours of sitting.

**a. Durable materials:** Cheap doesn’t have to mean flimsy; many chairs made from durable synthetic fabrics or leather stand up to the rigors of daily use without breaking the bank. Check for strong construction when looking at the chair's frame, as well as solid fabric coverings to make sure you get a sturdy seat with lasting quality. 

**b. Budget-friendly features:** To help you save money without sacrificing quality, look for chairs with budget-minded features such as headrests, adjustable angles, and backrests. This will allow you to customize the seat for optimal comfort and support throughout your workday. If you’re going to be spending a lot of time on a gaming chair, look for models with extra padding or built-in memory foam so you can stay comfortable for hours.

**c. Price points:** It's essential to determine how much money you want to spend when looking for an affordable office chair. Prices range from as low as $50 up to around $300 depending on the material and feature offered. Please be sure to compare different models within your budget range so that you can find the best value for your money. 

**d. Considerations:** When shopping for a budget office chair, it's important to consider the purpose of the purchase. Those looking for an economy seat for occasional gaming or office tasks should look to lighter-weight chairs that offer comfort and support over extended periods. For those who need more robust features, like heavy padding and adjustable heights, investing in higher-end models might be a more practical choice. 

### 1. How to find the best chair for you?

Finding the right budget office chair for you is all about personal preference. Consider your body type and posture when looking through various models, as a chair that fits one person perfectly may not be the best fit for another. Consider how often you'll be using the chair and what kind of activities will take place in it; if you're going to be sitting for long periods, look for chairs with more ergonomic features such as adjustable armrests or lumbar support. Finally, think about your budget and find a price range that suits your needs without breaking the bank. 

Once you have narrowed down your search to several different models, it's important to try them out before purchasing. Many retailers offer test-drive programs so you can get a feel for the chair before committing to it. This is also a good time to ask questions and compare features between different models, as well as read online reviews from other customers who have already used the chairs. 

With all these factors in mind, you’ll be able to find the best budget office chair for working and gaming 8-9 hrs/day without breaking the bank. Find comfort and affordability with a desk seat designed to keep you productive or entertained throughout the day. 

### 2. Chair features to look for when making your purchase

Once you have determined your budget, several features make up an ideal office chair. Look for adjustable armrests and lumbar support to keep your spine in the correct posture while sitting, as well as a strong frame that can support your body weight without breaking or warping. When choosing fabrics, look for materials that are durable enough to withstand extended use but still comfortable enough to reduce fatigue. Memory foam seating is also beneficial for those who will be seated for long periods, as it molds itself around the user’s shape and provides superior comfort compared to traditional cushions. Finally, consider accessories such as headrests and footrests when making your purchase; these extras add comfort but may not be a must-have for everyone. 

### 3. Chair care and maintenance tips

Once you have found the ideal budget office chair for working and gaming 8-9 hrs/day, it is important to take proper care of it to ensure its longevity. Regularly inspect the chair’s frame, arms, and legs for any signs of wear or damage. If necessary, use a soft cloth to dust off any dirt or debris that has built up over time. Additionally, use appropriate cleaning agents on fabric chairs when needed; always check the manufacturer’s instructions before proceeding with any cleaners as some materials can be sensitive. Finally, store your desk seat in an area away from direct sunlight and excessive moisture to keep it looking and functioning at its best. 

### 6. FAQ's about office chairs

**Q: What is the best budget office chair in 8-9 hrs/day?** 

A: Depending on your personal preferences and needs. Consider factors such as comfort, ergonomics, fabric durability, accessories, and price when making your purchase. 

**Q: How often should I inspect the office chair for wear and tear?** 

A: It’s important to regularly inspect your desk seat for any signs of damage or wear. Depending on how often you use it, it may be a good idea to check it every few weeks or months. Pay extra attention to areas prone to wear and tear such as the arms, frame, and legs. 

**Q: How do I clean the office chair?** 

A: Depending on the type of material it is made from. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions before attempting any cleaning as some materials can be sensitive. In general, a soft cloth or vacuum cleaner should be used to remove dust and dirt from most surfaces. For fabric chairs, it may also be necessary to use appropriate cleaning agents to keep them looking new for longer.  

**Q: Are footrests necessary for office chairs?**

A: Footrests are not necessary for all office chairs, but they can provide extra comfort to those who need them. If you plan on sitting for long periods, a footrest can help reduce tension in your legs and lower back. However, if you only use your chair for short tasks then this accessory may be unnecessary.

12eofjr,Google and Amazon Struggle to Lay Off Workers in Europe,N/A,2023-04-07 15:11:20
yvtau4,Bad Experiences Interviewing for Microsoft,"This all happened around 9 or 10 years ago, specifically interviewing for Microsoft Dublin. This was back when Steve Ballmer was still CEO, notorious at the time for whooping it up on stage and claiming Microsoft employees were the best of the best.

I was notified by a bunch of friends who worked in multiple companies, and also by my work colleagues, that Microsoft were hiring. They had all applied and I followed their lead, applying also. This was all for non-Dev roles.

Soon afterwards, I heard from friends who interviewed before me that the interview process was crazy - Confrontational, offensive, insulting, and weird questions etc. They were told ""Microsoft is the best and we only hire the best"".

Example: At least 2 females were asked if they were in a relationship and planning to get pregnant. It was indicated that the company did not want to hire women who might get pregnant in the near future. (My work colleagues all got together to discuss this issue and while it was decided that this was potentially illegal, the women kept their mouths shut and both were later hired).

Example: One guy heard he should be funny and likeable in the interview and so he tried to be just that. He was told, during the interview, among other criticism, that he was a ""weirdo"" and they would not be hiring him under any circumstances.

I also heard from a few people who had been hired that it was an absolute shit-show - badly-managed chaos. So I was not excited about the prospect of interviewing for this company.

When my interview came up, it was the strangest experience I have had professionally. I had taken a day off for the phone interview and the Microsoft HR told me not to take a day off. I needed to take a day off anyway because I had built up too many holidays and needed to take them. Too much rigmarole to go into here. Long story short, I took a day off and when they found out, on the phone, they got very angry and started remonstrating me for this, telling me they had expressly told me not to take a day off.

I tried to explain my position but they continued to go through my CV and criticize me personally. At one point, they were criticizing my personality and the fact that I ""didn't sound happy"" on the phone. I told them this was because the interview was going in a strange way.

They then asked me a random, weird question about manholes and why they are round. I attempted to answer, saying ""Well, many manholes are not round, they're square. It depends on what you regard as a manhole. In Ireland, there are many ways to access underground areas.... etc"". They got very angry about this and told me it was not the answer they wanted. They wanted me to think outside the box. I pointed out that it seemed a flawed question to begin with and would not result in the kind of information they wanted about a candidate. This made them even more angry. They criticized me personally some more and at this point. I felt like I had taken enough and definitely did not want the job. (I could expand on this, but you get the picture).

I told the HR interviewer, **""Yeah, Well, you know what.... You can take your job and shove it up your arse!**"" and promptly hung up on her.

For a few years afterwards, whenever I met someone in Dublin who worked in the same or similar type of role as me, I would ask them if they had ever interviewed for Microsoft and if they had a similar experience.

If I add together all my colleagues who interviewed, all the friends at other companies, and the people I met subsequently, there were at a minimum 30 people, all working in Dublin, who complained about the same angry, confrontational, offensive interview process. Many of them took the job and worked in Microsoft and many still do to this day.

I mentioned this in another thread and was roundly attacked by loyal Microsoft employees who accused me of being a liar and ""making shit up"". Quite bizarre from my perspective, since it's not merely my own experience, but reports from a lot of other people.

I realise that Microsoft may have changed it's process, may have a new CEO now, may have completely changed direction, may have a different HR team, but does anyone else have experiences like this or know someone who encountered this crazy bunch of HR nutters, back in the day?

I reiterate, this was maybe 9/10 years ago in Dublin. And the interviewers insisted at the time that their interview process resulted in them hiring ""the best of the best"". The funny thing was, judging by what I saw, it resulted in them turning down the best workers and hiring people who I knew for a fact did little to no work.

EDIT: Whoop! Already with the downvotes.... Is there some rule on this sub that anything that does not depict Microsoft in a good light is off limits, truth be damned???

EDIT: Jesus Christ, am I missing something here? I post about something that happened - something that would seem to be not very controversial - and I am repeatedly told I am a liar....

Does MS demand complete loyalty and obedience? Is MS a cult? Are ye all mad in the head?

Around 30 people in Dublin had a bad experience interviewing for one particular company which at the time was infamous for aggressive interviews.... Hardly a difficult pill to swallow.

This is not normally a hate-filled sub, so how did I become a lightning rod by recounting an actual experience?",2022-11-15 10:31:00

13dnitr,Equality is not equal,"Not using my main, as that may identify me.

I work for a large tech MNC, and we have a load of open roles for tech stuff. I recently found out that for several of our open roles (upper level, not junior roles), they have been earmarked as being held for female applicants. From experience, you'd be hard pressed to find female applicants for junior roles within that field, never mind more senior roles. But, the company is pushing for 50/50 gender equality across all departments, so this is where we are. I also know several experienced individuals who'd be perfect for the roles, but they're male, so won't get the job, no matter how great they are, and no matter how they'd benefit the business.

I think it's a horrible direction to be heading, and fear for my future employability as a white male approaching middle age. The best candidate should get the job, simple as.

127gr8x,Advice needed - shared salary with new hires and now I feel sick,"backstory: I started at a big tech company nearly 8 years ago straight out of college. Pay increases were lackluster to say the least but I never really argued as I thought it could be worse, well now it is. 

To get my last promotion I had to get a 19% pay increase to bring me up to the next pay level. 

Since then our team went from 6 to 2. I was doing 4 times the amount of work with assurances I would be rewarded for my efforts. I worked to the bone and trained 4 new hires in the last year. After Christmas I was burnt out by January 20th. It has been exhausting. 

Full transparency I am a solutions engineer and I was earning 42K, after the recent pay rises I am now on 48k. It is not in the pay bracket for the promotion I was promised so now they have to get VP approval and open HR cases. I've been told June it will be sorted but I'm not holding my breath. I basically am not earning enough to get promoted. 

This leads me to this week. We had a team dinner and the new hire (started Q4) asked if I was happy with the recent pay rises, I told them not really but ''there's no budget left'' so I can't complain. This is technically a 15% pay increase so its better than nothing. They asked how much I was on and nearly choked on their drink. Two of them were hired a level below me (level 5 vs level 6) and have started on 44k. Still don't know how I sat through the rest of the dinner. when I felt like screaming crying and throwing up.

As discussing salary is frowned upon how do I bring this up to my manager. Do I go in guns blazing or go to HR behind their back?

8 years in the same role is unheard of in Tech I know so is this my sign to just cut and run?

1auk6lu,Interviewing as if you're Google in 2004,"This is satire.

Just another company living in a bubble. So I just got off the phone with this recruiter at Intercom. You know, the place where you might get fondled. 

So it seems like they really see themselves not only as having a high hiring bar but you as an interviewee not being worth their time. 

The thing that irked me was that after the technical interview and the goals alignment one aka the one where they try to figure out if you might cause any trouble if they decide to stick you on unpaid on-call or you might give them some lip over mandatory 2 days in the office, you have an interview where (swallow your drink before you spit it on the monitor) you start off as a tech talk with an Intercom employee about creating an API endpoint and after around 1hr the interviewer leaves the conference and lets you work on the project for another 1-1.5hrs, then comes back and sees how many features you implemented and how complex they are.


So in short, they don't even bother putting in the same amount of time you put in for the interview. What would they come up with next, take home assignment where you need to have a pendulum clock in the background to prove that your [recording is not stitched together](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG4.nhlUS7D.Ia4mrlCvbpPi?pid=ImgGn)? 


All that for some mediocre TC that you can get in any other company. Yes, I know, I don't have to go through it and I won't but that does not mean I can't stand up for myself. I also know companies have a budget for social media mentions so maybe someone at Intercom can see the replies and think twice before having such a dumb interview process.

1aeugnz,Seems like the market is dry for forced hybrid companies,"This post is a parody. 

Noticed that I keep getting messages from different recruiters for the same particular companies for the past 3-4 months. What do they all have in common is the shit location for their office and the fact that they are adamant you are 3 days in the office and no room for flexibility. 

One of them is Helios with their office in Blanchardstown. Anyone heard of them? Can't imagine someone driving there 3 days a week unless your driveway is on the M50 [something like this maybe](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG1.ExlFqSttLlUHhuGxt7S3?w=1024&h=1024&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain)

The other one is IBM with their office in Mulhuddart which is not even there it's in the fuck middle of nowhere on a field where you'd probably be eaten by stray dogs if you cycle.  [Here's a picture I got off street view of the campus](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG4.xaBfDYHWGR46Hi_jzrGw?pid=ImgGn)

Runner up is SIG which although have their office in a more central location it seems like they keep looking for people. Probably last person got stabbed as their offices are around Sheriff street. Oh and they don't have parking so you have to park your car on the sidewalk. 

Are those people not being told by the recruiters that nobody is interested in spending 2 hours in traffic? Are they surrounded by yes men? Seems like the market is still a jobseekers market in their point of view.

**The number of users with leaked data is found to be 1,566,030.**

The leaked data is predominantly from customers in the **UK, Ireland, Australia** and other English-speaking countries where JD Sports operates. 

Under UK law, a company that has detected a data breach is required to notify the [Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/) within 72 hours. Apparently, JD Sports failed to report the incident to the ICO.

[Barry Loftus,](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/barry-loftus-3652238) Group IT Director of JD Sports, with whom I dealt with concerning this incident, agreed to the publication of the information about the leak. 

It must be noted that this is not the first time that this company’s sensitive data are available for free download. They already had a similar incident in October 2021 of which I informed them. However, the company did not respond to my report then. One can still find confirmation of this leak on specialized search engines.

m184qa,"Interviewing mid level, process and thoughts.","*TLDR*: Only bite off what you can chew, prep as much as possible and don't be an asshole.
I know this isn't news to anyone, but I'm not gonna make it some click baity TLDR.

## Context

Currently am an SRE(49k 3yrs) in Dublin, 70% Dev 30% OPS.  Main motivator for me was direction of career, salary, and on call.
Keep in mind, I was doing the move from SRE -> (pure) Development, not exactly the same as most people applying for a direct apples to apples.

## How did your interviews go?

- Application gets submitted.
- [Optional] Talk to the recruiter
- [Always] Talk to HR (10-60m never less).
- [Frequent] Code Test
- [In-frequent] Take home assignment.
- [In-frequent] Review of take home assignment.
- [Frequent] Architecture interview.
- [Always] Manager interview.
- [Frequent] Behavioral interview.

Keep in mind, this is a high level breakdown. Every company is different. 
Some (Looking at you microsoft) send Code test before even a HR call.
Some others have 8 rounds (that aren't FANG) your mileage will vary.
Over time figure out what process works for you most.


## Section breakdown

### HR Talk

This is really just a talk. Usually they ask why you're looking, why you think you're good.
What you should be doing too, is to listen out for [key phrases](https://i.redd.it/yv6lfgdyvbg01.jpg), and look for red flags. Know your deal breakers here, for me a few examples were :
- Are you willing to be working weekends every second week and get the days off to take during the following week (Salesforce)
- Are you willing to work 10 hour shifts Starting on Sundays ending on Wednesday night (ServiceNow)

### Code Test

This is really the mixed bag of the industry, how can we be tested on what we can actually do.
For me, it's _arguably_ the hardest, not because the questions are hard, but the extra factors (amount of question, optimization, test cases I can't see)
A few people suggest grinding leetcode, I don't really agree with that personally. It means you could be barking up the wrong tree for any interview.
My 2c is to really work smarter, not harder. Check glassdoor interviews for the company, familiarise yourself with typical questions (can you reverse a string) to the point you can do it in your sleep.
[Doing out the questions from something like this](https://simpleprogrammer.com/programming-interview-questions/) would have you set for a lot of interviews. 

### Systems Design and Architecture

I'd say this is harder than any code test, for the sake that you can't grind this part out.
You need to be able to communicate and design a technically challenging system and justify it or you can't.
Maybe attending some TED talks, and watching lots of videos on youtube is a good way to see different designs and architectures.


## What I found didn't work.

### Take home projects

I find these take too much time. 
If it looks like it will take 2 hours, it may take 4 to do it close to perfectly.
The other problem I found was, if you're interviewing with 3 companies at once. They all give you take home. Then it just didn't work as there's not enough time in a week (without burning out for me) to do them all correctly.
Take homes _can_ work if you're interviewing for only one company at a time. But that to me (and to those I've talked to is never the case).


### Long processes

Some companies had 6+ rounds that weren't even a FANG type company.
When they told me their process I knew it wasn't worth it for me.
If you can handle the really long processes, go for it but I don't think it's a good thing from any perspective.
From a company you lose talent because your process takes forever. From a prospective employee, well you're gonna burn out.

## What made me succeed in finding a new role.

### Learning to accept failure.

Something I wish more people talked about was failure. 
We don't really talk about where we went wrong. So it's hard to learn from others.
Lookit, you're probably not going to get the first, 5th, or 10th job you apply for. How do you cope with that?
Ultimately this boiled down to me learning more about myself and how to handle the process.

#### Mental Limitations :
- How many interviews can you do in a day?
- How many tech tests can you prep for?
- How can you cope with failure and rejection many times in a week.

#### Technical Limitations :
- What languages can you actually, competently answer questions in. If you were given tic tac toe in JS/Python/C/Java/GO which ones would you actually be able to answer it?)
- Be ready to be grilled about obsurity. Some interviewers like to push you to your limits.

### CV
- I didn't need a 2 page CV. 1 page is fine (foreigners reading this make sure not to have a photo of yourself on the CV)
- Gear a CV towards a specific role, if you are applying for devops and something else have 2 different CVs. Anything else is unmaintanable and too time consuming.
- Get good at balancing brevity and clarity. 

Ultiamtely, the CV is an advertisement to sell yourself. You'd be less inclined to buy a product that you never saw before versus Coke Cola.
Same applies here, sell yourself the best you can on your CV. It can be a golden ticket or the cross you burn yourself on.


### Q_&&_A

Working on the questions was something that took me a while to get right.
You can have answers, but that doesn't mean they're the best you can give.
Have a really good answer to basic questions like
    - Why do you want to leave your current company?
    - What makes you think you'd be a good fit?
    - How do you deal with conflict with coworkers?


## So what did I learn?

- Take breaks from interviews. I needed to. Chances are you needed to. You need to find what works for you. 


To me the metaphor of being on an ocean on a raft was helpful. 
You can't control the currents. But you can direct your raft.
You're not in a car on a street driving to a picnic.
Some days the ocean will try destroy the raft. You just need to keep getting back on and sailing until you find that new role.

Once I heard a quote about entrepreneurship. It was something along the lines of ""opportunity is like a scent in the air, if you stop walking and smell it maybe it can lead to something great"". Oddly enough, a pandemic is an _amazing_ chance to interview. WFH is everywhere.


## Closing thoughts

The interview game is hard.

Figuring out my value became easier over time. Talking to recruiters, see what they thought I'd be worth was a good way.
They're going to want to try get the most so it's a good way of knowing.
Think about it this way,go for the median of the range of values told to you.

This quote hits home ""_It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life._"" 
Finally, everyone has an opinion,even mine may not be worth all that much, the main thing is to get as much input, then form your own opinion.




### Final extra thoughts

SRE is, well, varied company by company, no matter how many books google publish trying to define it our industry has yet to fully agree.
I think SRE is a great way to start a career. you get exposed to everything, Networking, systems, CICD, development, operations, monitoring + alerting.
At the same time it really wasn't for me. The pager variety of issues was too much. 
I think having that broader understanding makes you better and gave me time to learn what I really liked.

Any companies that I mentioned here remember, not all roles they have are like that. I'd say a lot are better.

I think now is the time for us to form a cohesive group and get ourselves a place at the bargining table. Imagine the face of every company in ireland when the devs say they are going on strike . It would be catastrophic to a lot of places. 

&#x200B;

Either way, maybe I am just thinking out loud, but I was hoping I am not the only one doing so. If people truely are worried about their positions are going to be taken by chat bots then now is the time for us to make sure that doesn't happen. 

&#x200B;

I'm open to any opinons on the matter. ",2024-03-05 22:34:52

mo5ro2,Irish Income Taxes at Every Income Level,"I hope it's ok to post this, but with many people on here are often considering new jobs and/or raises or bonuses, it's helpful to know how much 'take home pay' you will have after taxes for any particular level of income. If you're used to the standard rate of income tax, pushing into the higher rate can come as a bit of a shock. So I've tried to explain how all the employment taxes work - hope it might be helpful to someone. 

Everyone’s biggest deduction is Income Tax. Here’s how it works:

* Calculate 20% of your earnings up to €35,300 and 40% of earnings above this.
* Next, determine your tax credits - €3,300 for most people (€1,650 for a single person + €1,650 for a PAYE worker) though it can vary. 
* Then subtract your tax credits from the figure calculated in Step 1, and that’s how much Income Tax you pay. 

***Worth knowing*** \- you’ll pay nothing on earnings below €17k, only a ‘little’ on earnings up to €35,300, and an uncomfortable amount on earnings above this. But, there’s an easy way to significantly reduce your income tax that we’ll explain in a future post. 

Next up is PRSI - the tax that funds the majority of social welfare payments:

* This one is complicated with many different classifications, but the vast majority of people pay 4% on all their earnings.

***Worth knowing*** \- your employer also pays about 11% of your salary in PRSI.

Finally, everyone’s favourite, the Universal Social Charge. Similar to Income Tax, it has different rates and thresholds so you pay more as you earn more:

* You’ll pay almost nothing (just 0.5%) on your first €12,012 of earnings, and 2% on the next €8,765.
* The rate rises to 4.5% on earnings above €20,687, and stays at this level before jumping to a whopping 8% on earnings above €70,044.

***Worth knowing*** \- at the risk of stating the obvious, USC really begins to bite at higher incomes. 

There might be more…? Skip this if you work in the private sector, but public servants (nurses, guards, teachers etc.) must also pay ASC:

* Introduced in 2009, the Additional Superannuation Contribution is an extra tax on public servants for their pensions. (But don’t make the mistake of thinking your public service pension will be enough to support you - it won’t! We will explain why not in a future post) 
* ASC kicks in at 10% on earnings above €34,500 and increases to 10.5% above €60,000. 

***Worth knowing*** \- this one really hurts, can easily add up to more than USC, and can often catch new public sector employees by surprise. 

These four line items collectively explain your tax deductions. You’ll have noticed that those on low incomes pay almost nothing but that the burden rises rapidly as earnings increase. There’s a big jump around €35k (especially for public servants due to ASC) and another at €70k when USC increases. For a little bit more detail on all of this, or a calculator that you can adjust to your own circumstances, see my [post](https://slowandsteadyfinance.substack.com/p/explaining-income-taxes-in-ireland).",2021-04-10 14:30:33

s4gjuk,[Rant] Tell me why I shouldn't delete LinkedIn please.,"As of late LinkedIn has become such a joke of an application.

My feed is just an infinite loop of nonsense  who cares if you joined such and such company and you feel blessed who cares if you just had a child, who cares about your pathetic stolen uncited motivational quote. 


My end. I never post if I join another company. I don't do the corporate simp about thing either. It's just cringey asf. 


And then theres the neverending amount of people with totally fabricated roles. CEO at ....., Corporate motivator. Blah. 

Then there's the obviously made up story by some idiot.

The real icing on the cake was capitalising the murder of  that poor young girl to incite people for a social justice agenda. 

It's just a garbage fb at this state. It used to be decent when it was a professional. 


There is social platforms for all these things already.

Note: Don't mean to be rude but please stop being self appointed psychiatrists. 
I'm just interested in why should I keep LinkedIn or how to sustain a LinkedIn account without losing your mind lol.



TLDR: LinkedIn has become such a clusterf that I no longer can find the posts that I want to read.",2022-01-15 09:22:09
10ktzbd,I created a list of small-medium size companies in Ireland(non-dublin) that hires software developers or front-end devs across Ireland. The data is in a excel format.,"Context: I was having difficulty find a job during pandemic through usual means like Indeed or LinkedIn. Most of the companies in LinkedIn or Indeed are medium to big companies

 So, I create a list of companies that could potentially hire software or front-end devs and created this excel file. All the companies are distributed by counties and some also includes the link to career page( although I couldn't find all the links).

 If I have missed any companies , I am sorry. I am setting this file to edit mode so that if you want to add companies, you can. You can send a mail to the companies asking about any job vacancies or check their LinkedIn page. Ideally I wanted it to be a webapp but I don't have the time for it since I work full-time.

 The source of data is google.

BTW: Miscellaneous tab are the ones that I have crowdfunded from various other threats or talking to people. People can send emails to for job enquiry.

Duplicate without names

https://preview.redd.it/k8mpidxyflq61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=959cc6c418c9b013f5905713b02a9119f6cbfd4b

On February 17, 2021, I discovered an ElasticSearch (Kibana) server in the public domain (this is when there is access without entering a password) with an IP address [34.244.144.236:8080](https://34.244.144.236:8080) ([ec2-34-244-144-236.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com](https://ec2-34-244-144-236.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com)) as I later found out, owned by Fastway Couriers.

As follows from the data of the specialized search engine [https://leakix.net/](https://leakix.net/), the [server](https://leakix.net/host/34.244.144.236) first appeared in the public domain on **October 6, 2020**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tsg0qwsdglq61.png?width=1887&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe95c749e718a6ce58f7bbf18e6d94883a36e1c5

And the server got into the search in [Zoomeye](https://www.zoomeye.org/searchResult?q=34.244.144.236) on February 7, 2021

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2mc8d7zeglq61.png?width=1747&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ac89c388bdb084b795f9609503a68d41dae4af7

At the time of detection by the search engine, the server had 9 critical vulnerabilities

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/igalnptuglq61.png?width=1417&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0e788a8fe7a29eca5eb035727ea516aefbdf340

And the search engine [Shodan.io](https://Shodan.io), which discovered the server only on February 20, 2021 (now the data has been deleted, at the time of discovery, the information was available) found even 23 vulnerabilities of varying severity

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jtc6j0bgglq61.png?width=1899&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff87ec985b23c5af63431cd033cfa5ddf0c9b0b2

To determine the owner of the server, I downloaded a certain amount of data (all data was available for download) and on February 24, 2021, when I found out the owner of the server, I contacted Fastway Couriers using the contact information found in the logs.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/el81bnzpglq61.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bb3dd15208d69aca7690ab6c21cc9ed044a0f40

A few days later, the Elastic server was removed from public access, and on March 2, Fastway Couriers employee  contacted me and thanked me for the vulnerability discovered.

However, on March 11, the company issued a press release claiming that the company was the victim of a ""malicious cyberattack.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/75sfwtrhglq61.png?width=1909&format=png&auto=webp&s=6257ede44fcdf5dc85e5a87639a555aa46c428df

&#x200B;

This press release has now been [removed](https://fastway.ie/why-fastway/media-releases/399-statement-from-fastway-couriers-regarding-data-breach), as has any mention of a ""malicious cyber attack."" I suppose that the company decided to take such a step after my publication on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/m7rtm4/about_data_leaks_from_fastway_couriers/)

Because almost all of the information in their press release is false. Starting with a ""malicious cyberattack"", ending with a statement by their director that allegedly ""financial information was not harmed"", as if they had it protected. The message that they were allegedly ""attacked while technical work was underway on the server"" is also a lie. As you can see, since October 6, 2020 (or maybe earlier), their server has been in the public domain.

And CEO Fastway Couriers made a mistake with the number of affected users by an order of magnitude - look at the logs from Elastic, the number of documents is indicated in brackets. They are, of course, not unique and may be repeated, but most are unique. By the name of the indexes, you can roughly understand what kind of information is stored in them. I downloaded information from the *merger\_db\_events* index. But there is no guarantee that someone else did not use the open server earlier

vx8lt7,Radiant: an app that turns Spotify into a proper radio replacement.,"One of the members of this sub suggested I post this here, so here she goes.

I built an app called Radiant which takes Spotify and gives you an infinite stream of music, some you know, lots you don't, based on your tastes with an artificial radio presenter (Rad) at the helm.

Rad announces the songs, reads you the local news and weather and cracks wise whilst doing it.

You can even Tweet at Rad (@OfficialRadDJ) and he'll read and respond to your Tweets live for everyone listening to hear.

Some of the other things Rad can do include:

* Music changes throughout the day to suit whatever time it is.
* You can have Rad play your own playlists.
* Thumbs up/down what's playing to train Rad's future selections.
* Long press the thumbs up/down for more control.
* Everything you like on Rad gets added to a 'Liked on Radiant' playlist on Spotify.
* Pre-canned presets for certain vibes and moods.
* Configure many aspects of how Rad does his thing (Gender, how often he pops up, whether he reads the news etc)
* Request any song you want to hear next (Big expansion of that coming soon).
* Plenty more besides.

Radiant is especially great when you're out and about and have no interest in fiddling with your phone, house parties, long commutes, work do's or as a replacement for Spin 103.8 and its 8 songs on repeat driving you demented in the office.

&#x200B;

[Rad running in Tablet mode on an M1 Mac](https://preview.redd.it/4srm1ruae4b91.png?width=2068&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f2b8aaf911521118f8986962a9393a341b02a64)

So given this isn't a new app, why am I posting this here, now?

It was iOS only and built natively, but it was fairly obvious an Android app was a must. So faced with the prospect of rebuilding it from scratch, bringing it to parity with the existing app and then maintaining 2 apps in tandem on my lonesome, I decided to unify the code base and rebuild it as a cross-platform hybrid application.

Happy to report that the result far exceeded my expectations and it's now fully rolled out in all of its hybrid glory on both iOS and Android.

It's using Svelte+Typescript+Capacitor under the hood with an entirely edge (Cloudflare worker) based backend infrastructure.

Given it's a brand new codebase which will have plenty of pointy edges to it, I'd love to get some feedback and insights from the community here on how to improve and I'm happy to field any further questions on how it was built and what next for the project.

I wanted to share a project that I've been working on: [DaftRentalBot](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/DaftRentalBot), a Python bot that helps users find and apply to rental properties on daft.ie. With this bot, you can specify search filters such as location, price range, etc., and it will search for matching properties on the website. Then it will apply to those houses on your behalf using a customizable application message. It automatically refreshes every 30 seconds to get the latest advertisements and apply to those houses if not already. The bot also keeps a log of applied houses in a `logger.csv` file.

I'm excited to share this project with the Reddit community, and I welcome any feedback or contributions. If you're looking for a rental property in Ireland, give [DaftRentalBot](https://github.com/siddarth-patil/DaftRentalBot) a try and see if it helps you find you a home!",2023-01-03 13:08:51

Keeping in line with the previous rules, the results will be withheld till there are a few dozen responses in order to preserve anonymity. I will be posting the direct google responses link sheet so if any data wizard here can put together some quick visualization for it then it would be great

su2dft,Pulled out of interview after seeing how long the process takes,"After I applied for a Frontend Engineer role for this multinational company, they sent back a 'roadmap' of the interview process. It was 8 stages in total, between different interviews, code tests and projects. 

They got back to me the other day saying that they were impressed by my cv and would like to arrange an initial call. I've been honestly scared off of going ahead with them. 

I'm under no illusions that interviews will generally take 3 or 4 rounds but 8 is absolutely ridiculous, especially if you only get so far and then they ghost you, which seems to be common.",2022-02-16 18:13:16

Unfortunately, he's been writing me up for stepping away from my desk throughout the day. For example, I have to go pick up a mail from An Post because they never rang the bell, ended up taking 1.5 hour for lunch. My calendar is well updated anytime I leave my desk. He messaged me with a timestamp and suggests that I should have taken the vacation time / day. 

Is this normal? I feel like a third grader asking for a hall pass.

I am working for 4 product owners at the moment (as I am responsible for building features for several products in the company). I never missed any meetings and I always completed all my deliverables within the sprint. I think our clients are happy with my work and I get along very well with the Product Owners and Solution Architects.

ouiu3q,Is Irish Tech Interview becoming difficult?,"I have been interviewing here lately from LinkedIn recruiters, and it seems that many hiring managers are expecting a lot from the candidates for an application development job. Is this the new norm for the Irish market? Or I am just unlucky with the company selections?  I am not really talking about Google/Amazon/Facebook kind of place here with six figures comp, but for places that pay the market rate of 50-80k rate. 

I have been getting architectural questions that asked me to design an enterprise system from scratch on MS paint and explain various trade-offs for each component. Then there are some live programming problems, some of which were pretty difficult for the small amount of time involving specific data structures. Also, there is a take-home project component which is not an issue but can be very time-consuming.

The recruiters said that they are looking for people with 2-3 years of experience, which makes me feel very incompetent. Every developer I know with similar experience is still mastering their knowledge of the language/framework they are using. They can communicate the technical consequences of a business decision and design a solution to implement specific features. But the large-scale system design is usually done by someone with 10 YOE+ and usually as a software architect, not by some mid-level / early senior developers. 

It seems like you need to study outside of work to have hopes of passing these interviews. I hope I am wrong, but this is a worrying trend for me. How would anyone with family obligations keep up with this circus? Does anyone else have a similar experience?",2021-07-30 11:31:10

st0d8m,Dear Recruiters,"It’s quite likely a lot of the (smarter) recruiters visit this subreddit to get a feel for how the other side thinks.

I like many of us with more than a few years under belt in this industry get between 2-6 LinkedIn emails about job opportunities 
However a few things truly grind my gears (hold my beer, gets up on soap box):

* job is in Dublin - most senior engineers are at stage their life when family is important, Dublin is expensive (even with our inflated salaries) place to live never mind raise a family. Plus if there is anything last few years shown is that offices are redundant (I could see how they are useful for new associates but that’s about it) and commuting hours is a waste of productivity 

* technology Y is in job spec when it’s not on LinkedIn history which would not be an issue if recruiters actually make clear time be allowed to level up in language/framework X

* no mention if it’s greenfield or maintenance of old cobbled together systems held by strings that be living hell to maintain 

* no mention of salary range, seriously who wants to go thru multiple interviews to talk about what’s important > money 

* no mention of interview process, are there silly algorithms (balance binary tree type craic) questions that in real life you never ever encounter, is there a take home assignment or whiteboarding 

* is there oncall and culture of ownership, if there is are you actually allowed improve the code or are left polishing turd with your hands tied 

* does company provide modern tools like latest MacBook, IntelliJ and sponsor learning like plural sight courses 

And so on, it seems the whole hiring process is such a clusterfuck where people avoid switching even if more money is offered as they realise more stress is not worth slightly more (never forget we only get 50c on every extra euro) salary either",2022-02-15 10:56:27

Some highlights from the survey:

* [Only 2 people are making above 200,000](https://i.imgur.com/ebrxdrA.png)



* For the Age Group of ""18 - 24"" the most common income seems to be in the group of ""30,000 - 39,000"", while the maximum income in this category is ""80,000 - 89,000"" being earned by 1 individual.

* For the Age Group of ""25 - 29"" the most common income seems to be in the group of ""50,000 - 59,000"", while the maximum income in this category is ""140,000 - 149,000"" being earned by 2 individuals via Amazon Ireland.

* For the Age Group of ""30 - 44"" the most common income seems to be in the group of ""70,000 - 79,000"", while the maximum income in this category is ""160,000 - 169,000"" being earned by 1 individual.


* For the Age Group of ""30 - 44"" the most common income seems to be in the group of ""100,000 - 109,000"", while the maximum income in this category is ""200,000"" being earned by 1 individual for Site Reliability Engineer job

* For data where people have shared company names it seems Facebook, Fidelity, Amazon, Salesforce, Workday are some of the companies which seem to be paying 100,000+, with all of them requiring a minimum of 5 years of experience.

* There seems to be at least 60 people who have more then 5 years of experience are getting less than 59,000

Overall, the salary figures seems to be a bit on the lower end when compared with USA salaries for the same job/company/experience, and that is despite the fact that USA has lower tax rates in cities like Seattle while Dublin has superhigh taxes and high housing rents. To take a rough example, a new college graduate while working for Google/Microsoft/Amazon would get a salary of around 100,000 + 20 to 30,000 (joining bonus) + 30 to 40,000 (stocks) while for that same job description in Google Dublin you would get around 55,000 + 3 to 7,000 (bonus) + 10 to 20,000 (stock). More data on USA grad salaries [can be seen in this thread](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e6k4lm/unofficial_salary_sharing_thread_for_new_grads/)

**It would also be great if some of you can analyze the data more and put together more meaningful findings or data visualization to enrich this data for our /r/DevelEire community**

4. 100k is not the ceiling in Dublin, can go higher.
5. The WLB seems to be 7 ~ 8 hours for most - with 100k base.
6. FAANG/MNC are not the only ones that pays well.
7. Communication skills is key.
8. Don't work more than what you're paid for ;) - Take care of mental health.

of about every major employee that I will have major interactions in the future. After few more days, I get overwhelm with the work that i do and also confused with what I am going to do

Also I get my salary for the first time and it fills with joy.

Month 2 : Slowly and Slowly I get into the working of the my company in the sense that how the hierarchy works, how much personal a employee can get with different employee

Let me be clear: Everyone is so cool. Everyone roasts everyone. Nobody know who is the actually boss is . It is great.

Work wise, it is pretty much the same but know the responsibility is increasing and so is the level is entertainment on the weekend.

Month 3:I start making conversation to the client sometimes directly but on a low scale. Sometime I have very low work but sometime I have large volume of work. But the work is good.

Project wise It is all satisfying.

Month 4 is same as 3 except now the level of work was raised so I had to upped my skill. It was such a warming experiencing for me. I learned a lot about how the employee behave in the Ireland as compared to where I came from. Here if you are dong from medium to excellent level of work people do appreciate you.

Month 5: I now start interaction with client on weekly basis since Now I have been assigned to two major projects along with some other side projects. I like it since it teaches me time management. Also, since joining to company I have gained a level of maturity that I never had and this has been helping on my side projects and the things I want to learn. Since most of work is based on JavaScript, an in order to switch off from that I design web scrappers and do some data science work on the side.

Month 6: I have been given the oppturnity to contribute to projects big time like in last few weeks I have been able to solve 150+ jira tickets and my employers are all satisfied with my level of commitment and attitude towards it Also I have been able to focus more on my side projects.

164ty3p,How do you guys get around the “don’t discuss salaries with coworkers” bullshit?,"My contract states the exact line above. It annoys me because me and my coworkers talk about our salaries everyday (obviously) and it’s come to my attention that some guys who do much more than me earn a lot less than me and guys who do a lot less than me are earning a lot more. All at the same level. 

I won’t throw them under the bus, but I’d imagine I’d be admitting to violating the code of conduct if I went to my manager “I was discussing with the team and I think my salary should be adjusted to reflect others on the team”… so how can I word it as if I didn’t discuss with coworkers… but I know that my money should be more than what it is? 

I feel like if I say I read it glassdoor or one of those sites, they could easily use the “ah there’s lot of fake salaries on there” excuse..",2023-08-29 20:48:23

mdnjk7,DevelEire Salary Survey Visualisation,"Happy Friday!

I've published a public Tableau dashboard to explore the [Salary Survey results](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/mda400/results_for_2021_develeire_salary_survey/).

[Link to dashboard.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/monie8460/viz/DeveleireSalarySurvey/SalarySurvey)

**Note this is not any specific analysis - it just makes it a little easier to explore the results.**

&#x200B;

This dashboard is fully interactive so you can filter the results by various attributes. The distribution bar chart is also interactive so you can click on the bar you're interested in to filter the table below.

The idea is that you can use the filters to see the distributions of income based on City, College, Degree, Job Category, and Job Type. You can then drill down into the specific income buckets to see individual data points.

There were a number of data quality issues that were addressed:

* Job titles were grouped into specific categories.
* Colleges were parsed for misspellings and grouped into their current names (amalgamations etc.). Only Irish colleges were kept with the remaining grouped as 'International'.
* Degrees and level of education were also parsed and grouped.
* Responses were generally cleaned up a little.

&#x200B;

There are still some data issues that could be mitigated in future surveys:

* It is unclear if Income Category is salary or total compensation. As this is specifically a salary survey, base salary should be captured accurately along with other compensation.
* Industry was a free text field that had so many variations on responses it became useless.
* Stocks was unclear if it was total initial grant, first year grant, refreshers etc.
* None or N/A should have been a valid response to most of the questions. Instead there are free text responses that are all variations on ""no"", ""null"", ""NA"", ""none"", ""N/A"" etc.
* As Programming Languages was also free text I haven't gone to the effort of parsing individual responses. That can go on the backlog.
* Negotiation and On Call wasn't particularly useful. More detail should be captured here if included.
* Pension was variations of 5% or 0.05 etc. This could be standardised for responses.
* As a general rule of thumb in survey design avoid free text fields wherever possible. 'Other' can be an equally valid and useful response.

&#x200B;

I'm really disappointed in the gender divide of responses. We're all very aware of the issues with diversity in tech, and I think this was further compounded with the demographic of the average r/DevelEire user. It would have provided some really insightful data if we had more diverse responses. We've a long way to go!

&#x200B;

If anybody has any specific analysis they would like or general feedback then let me know and I can update the dashboard.",2021-03-26 12:30:04

No they are not, they are at exactly the skill level you are paying for. Ireland has loads of talented people and you can see that from the startups that popped up in Dublin in the last years. 

IE software engineers most likely fill a gaussian curve perfectly, if you interview 30 and are way below the bar, maybe you should stop offering peanuts. Peanuts can be anything, from low salary, to shitty WFH policy, various ""expectations"" that sound like bait and switches etc.

k5i5vh,"Well, I did it. Got the job! Some notes on what worked for me","Just accepted an offer today. I got a lot of help from people in this sub, so first off, big thanks to everyone here for being so helpful!

In no particular order, here's a few things I found helpful.

**Resume**

* Keep to 1 page, even if you have to get rid of a lot of good stuff. Nearly all interviewers I spoke to commended me for the brevity of my resume.
* Use a service such as [resumeworded.com](https://resumeworded.com), but take their advice with a grain of salt. A lot of the time it simply doesn't make sense to use quantifiable numbers in your bullet points, for instance.
* Do include 1 line about your interests. Recruiters will tell you they don't care about your interests, but keep in mind that this isn't for the recruiter, but for the interviewer. My interviews got 10x better when I gave them something to relate to upfront.
* Use LaTeX. There are many good templates to use that you can modify to your liking.
* Use git to adapt your resume to each job. Where possible, just straight up copy & paste job requirements into your resume. Great way to get through the ATS!
* This post helped me a lot:[https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im\_an\_exrecruiter\_for\_some\_of\_the\_top\_companies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/)

**Applying**

* Remember that the easier it is to apply, the more candidates there are.
* Don't play the numbers game if a job really fits your skillset. Take a whole day to do your research, perfect your resume to that particular job, and to write a cover letter. Recruiters notice this.
* If you think your resume isn't going to make it through the ATS, see if you can call the recruiter. Say you're having trouble getting through the application form and ask if you can email your resume to someone. It will end up on the same stack of resumes that did make it through the ATS.
* Don't get hung up on requirements. They're just guidelines. You're also not married to your favourite stack. A good developer can switch language without issues. Some recruiters know this, some don't, so be prepared to explain that if needed.
* Keep track of your applications and which version of your resume you used. Trello is a great tool for this.
* Most companies first list a job posting on their own website before paying for a posting on LinkedIn or Indeed. If you can find an unadvertised job, you won't have much competition!

**Interviewing**

* A little bit of enthusiasm goes a long, long way.
* The author of Cracking the Coding Interview also has a youtube channel with great tips on solving algorithms. Worthwhile if you're a visual learner.
* Don't be afraid to talk about mistakes. All devs make them and it makes you relatable and shows you're growing your skillset.
* Keep in mind that you're interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you.

jondfe,"I finally got a job thanks to this subreddit. Now it's time to return favor by telling you my hacks, tricks and improve your chances of getting the job."," TLDR: Got the offer Pre-COVID-19,offer got canceled then got job offer in a different manner. Learned a lot along the way.

Hello, **This is my story and here it goes. First and foremost clean up your LinkedIn and GitHub(Only for computer science && graduate students).Refer to your career services department in your college.**

I started my job searching in October of 2019 as the job market was good at that times and I was too eager to get one. I started by bookmarking many top-medium sized IT, software companies career. Also join all the recruitment companies present within your locality.(They get paid by getting you a job) I got all the details from google search. This helped me in reducing the time to go to individual website--->clicking on career section etc. I even set the filters already in order to reduce the time.

Also join all the recruitment companies present within your locality.(They get paid by getting you a job) I got all the details from google search. DO ALL THESE ATLEAST 2-3 or even 6 MONTHS before the completion of your course.(I should have done this before but later I realized my mistake).

***#Tip 1: Indeed, Monsters cannot be always trusted because sometimes they would post a job opening which would never be present on company website and vice-versa.*** ***So be careful.***

***#Tip 2: Indeed, Monsters cannot be always trusted because sometime after submitting application on Indeed, I would contact recruiter about the update on my application but they would say ""We have not received your application and would advice you to submit directly from our website"".SO DO THAT IF OPENING IS AVAIBLE ON COMPANY's WEBSITE instead of Indeed,Monsters.com etc.***

This helped me in becoming aware of many opening which were niche and not posted on every job website. Also this helped me in reaching application to my company and avoiding **job portals brutal ATS system.**

I got through first stage of interview which was resume screening almost 90% of time by tailoring/editing/tuning according to the JOB REQUIRMTNERS(Priority) and cover letter according to the JOB SPECIFICATION.

***#Tip 3: Change your resume according to required skills only  and for cover letter include some company research and try to answer one important question ""How does your skills fit this job profile ?""***  

The next stage would generally involve coding test or video interview or aptitude test. This was the stage I was getting tensed about during initial days. Afterward I got comfortable in by practicing a lot.

***#Tip 4: For video interview, try to time your answer within 1-2 minutes(Include only key points) always use STAR method for delivering answers. For coding test use hacker rank and leetcode.If the test is going to be online, they mostly using codility(which is going to be the standards for the future) so practice on that nothing else.***

Afterwards I would get the information about the next stage which would be one-one interview about your experience, work history(if you have experience).

***#Tip 5: ALWAYS ask if you could bring any sort of document/presentation with you EVEN IF THEY DONT MENTIONED IT.*** **Make a presentation of 6-8 slides about your work experience final year projects or projects you are comfortable with to explain it to the employees/recruiters of the company. ALSO read glassdoor profile of company to get an idea about the questions that might be asked in the interview.**

Now here's what happened to me. I got selected but due to COIVD-19,all my offers were canceled. 

**NOW COMES THE MOST STRUGGLING , BORING BUT IMPORTANT PART OF MY JOB SEARCHING PROCESS**.

Since I got a lot of free-time as I was unemployed during this period(my part -time shifts were also cancelled).I used it in a manner that helped me later.

***#Tip 6: CONTACT EVERY RECUTRITES THAT OFFERED YOU A CHANCE FOR INTERVIEW AND ASK FOR FEEDBACK.THIS WILL HELP YOU LATER(TRUST ME).I EVEN GOT PRAISE FOR FEW RESCRUTIERS STATING THAT NOT MANY REJECTED CANDIDATES BOTHER ASKING FOR FEEDBACK.***

Afterwards I started improving my soft-skills by recording the questions that I was asked in interviews, and later assessing. Also, I started learning new skills relevant to my degree. The best recourse I came across was [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/udemyfreebies/new/).I also took many hacker rank test and starting posting the result on LinkedIn. This caught the eyes of many employees of the companies. I added them on LinkedIn and requested them to refer me if ever they or me came across any suitable opening in their company.

In these last few months, some companies started opening vacancies, so I stared my asking employees to refer me on LinkedIn.

First I got an unpaid internship in a small company for web developer. In next few months, I started applying to small methods in and unusual ways.

**HERE IS THE UNUSAL WAY: Since I was a computer science student, I went to CONATCT US page of every small to medium company that could hire a computer science student. I got email address of every company which were of format info@, career@ etc. Then I drafted a email which was of format ""General Introduction --> project worked on --> skills --> soft skills --> ""I have attached my CV(General) I am looking forward to be hearing from you.""-->attach CV"".**

**HERE comes the important part NEVER SEND YOUR CV Instantly. Instead schedule your email to going at next day morning 9-10 am .So that you job email is the first(or among the first) thing they see in the morning.**

After few weeks I got a call from the company .There was a simple interview regarding my current internship and my past projects. Afterwards they reviewed my LinkedIn, GitHub and I got the job offer the very next day.

tq4al0,No questions. No advice. Just a feel story I wanted to share.,"I am a employee of SAAS company and I work for a London-based-fintech company doing web dev. They follow a JIRA-ticket based system and sometimes they issues 20-30 tickets per month. So every Friday there is a check-in routine that happens every week. Before that I have present the solution in-front of our client's team.

Usually on the call, there are two managers and team members who issued the tickets. Today my PM was not present on the call after my presentation was done, one of the manager who was impressed by my performance ""We should hired you as a operational engineer and give you the money that we pay your current employer""

I was totally shocked, fazed by this and I said ""Sure"". After a year of working on the project, the client finally recognized my talent. I couldn't contain my happiness and I wanted to share this story with you guys.

sumyc6,[UPDATE] Radio silence after final round interview..,"TLDR from yesterdays post: I heard nothing back from a company a week after final interviews even after emailing the recruiter, was just pissed off at the current state of interviews and venting.

So the Recruiter (lets call her Recruiter A) actually got back to me shortly after posting (typical) saying they were very impressed in the interviews, but recommended me for a different role instead. Recruiter B is now dealing with me, trying to put me through **the same interview process again** but for a different team.

I already met the manager for the initial role, did a take home coding assessment, did 4 interviews with members of the team etc. Now Recruiter B is requesting that I meet a new manager, do a technical assessment (same language by the way), then meet with 3 members of the new team to go through the **exact same interview process**.

I might add that in the first batch of interviews they were literally reading technical questions from a list, and I got repeating questions in both technical interviews. I presume it'll be the same if I go through with the second batch of interviews. How many different ways can I explain the difference between an interface and an abstract class before you decide I'm suitable for the role?

I told the recruiter it is excessive, and asked that they collaborate with the initial interviewing team to reduce the number of interviews involved. Apparently this is not possible, as everyone on the new team really wants to meet me themselves. Get a grip.

I have agreed to meet with the manager next week. I will let him know that I have already been through the process and do not plan on meeting everyone on his team individually, if it suits I will gladly do one interview with all 3 people, rather than 3 separate interviews.

Companies are really taking the piss lately - after my post yesterday I received messages from others in the same position and I saw a similar post where someone bailed on the interview process purely because of how many rounds were involved.

If I go through with this second batch of interviews, in total I will be partaking in nine rounds of 45 minute interviews, one take home coding assessment (I spent about 3 hours on it) and at least 45 mins talking to recruiters. What the actual fuck.",2022-02-17 11:47:57

This month, I've been looking for a new role as a senior developer here in Ireland (around ten years of experience); this has been my experience.

&#x200B;

For most of the roles I applied for, or recruiters have applied on my behalf, I've never heard back from them, which I think is disgraceful.

&#x200B;

Note: For some companies, HR goes after the technical, but the chart looks like a mess, So I flipped that around. And the 'phone call' part is their hr or internal recruitment team checking some basic stuff over the phone. Same for those companies where are tecnhical interview, then design, etc.

&#x200B;

For junior developers: Keep your mind open if you are not being called back. Just keep pushing. Eventually, your interviews will come. As you can see, I applied for many roles (end Jan/early Feb), and around 60% have yet to reply. For junior positions, there will likely be hundreds of applicants. If your cv gets open, you will get the call. Keep pushing!",2023-02-21 13:31:31

I was recently looking at changing job and it seems like everyone is using leetcode/hackerrank to screen applicants.

I can understand why'd you do this to a graduate - they don't have a body of work so it's a good way to filter people who actually leant stuff from their degree. However I feel like there should be a point where someone should say ""this guy has a portfolio and references, he knows his stuff"".

I haven't touched a lot of this stuff since I graduated - sure I still know how to determine if my time efficiency is off in code I wrote but I'm long gone from the time where I could recite the efficiency of common algorithms from memory.

What's more, coding without docs or an IDE seems like an alien concept to me now. I found that a key skill was knowing how to look up info (I don't mean on stackoverflow, but using stuff like dir and go to declaration to gather info from the code itself, along with official docs). I feel like the leetcode/hackerrank stuff is testing how you can solve really simple, abstract problems in code you can memorize but isn't really relevant to the problems I had to solve in the real world.

This is getting a bit ranty, but I'm just kinda frustrated that I have to put time into brushing up on the niche of playing leetcode games on a whiteboard instead of something more practical like learning new frameworks or languages.",2022-05-07 12:46:11

ywz2m5,Irish engineering subreddit,"Hi!

So I've decided to create r/engineeringIreland to try and create a space for non-software engineers in Ireland. Those in fields such as Biomedical, Mechanical, Electronic, Aerospace, etc. I feel could all do with some representation with their own community as it can be hard to connect with other engineers in Ireland and find information on those fields.

r/DevelEire is a great resource however it has a clear focus on developers in Ireland, as an undergraduate engineer myself, I feel like it can very hard to find out information about engineering in Ireland and connect with others in these fields.

Hopefully this could be a resource for engineers to share information about jobs, salaries, companies, and the general state of engineering in Ireland, as well as for students to find out about courses and ask others who might be in roles they would like to be in, much like what this subreddit does.

This is currently the only subreddit for the tech sector in Ireland, so I can assume their will be some overlap in the members here with other engineering fields, so hopefully some engineers will see this.

Any suggestions are welcome! I would be very interested to hear from other Irish engineers if they feel this is a good idea or not!",2022-11-16 16:57:53

q5ujva,On Friday I got fired with no formal warnings,"On Friday I got fired from the worst job I’ve ever worked and I’ve worked in dunnes during university. 
I didn’t do computer science in university but I don’t know is there any better sub to post this in. 
I studied product design in university which was very broad course work everything from html to psychological was apart of my course work. Left college and got a job with a 3D printing design company but due to covid was let go. 
Worked in a fruit market through covid then and finally got a actual job in for a event design/ production company in may
The company was small two directors myself and the builder. I was in the office all day with the directors (non remote). They were very anti covid/anti vax. Would listen to joe rogan like it was the holy gospel. 

I could put up with that the first project was simple and I made up artwork for a wall and the floor. The I sent off my work but the printer edited and it caused a fuck up. Of course I got the blame no matter how much i showed them the work I sent to the file not having issues. 

I most made 3D renders and cad models for building with the CNC. But if something was a 1mm off I would be screamed at. Being like why don’t you check your work. 
Then in the rendering software being given out for shadows not being white.
Every issue was my fault there weather it was they’re pdf export was reducing the quality and of the images or clients not sending us correct dims on a object I’ve never seen. 

With me constantly feeling like I should just walk out of the place mid job and let them deal with it. I never did. As much as I was aware the two directors and I didn’t see eye to eye on pretty much anything I was never given a formal warning on anything. And the work was done normal on time except for one project wear the design was finalised 1 week after the due date, which I wasn’t apart of except for the renders. 

While finishing work on Friday, I knew one of the directors wanted me gone. I closed my pc for the weekend after working late serval times that week. And the other director sat beside my desk and say this isn’t working out I’m gonna have to let you go. I said yeah sure and basically skipped out of the place only annoyed that I didn’t leave them in a pile of shit. 

But now today is day one of being unemployed again. I’m working on projects I’ve not completed and ideas in my head. 

But I feel like shit. I opened LinkedIn seeing people who finished uni this year getting good jobs and I can’t even keep a shit one. I don’t know even if I’m good enough to go back to do something else. I’ve freelance work occasionally but nothing at the moment. 
I’ve hated every minute work there. I’m afraid that the next place will be the same. That I’m just not a good designer. And now with two positions that I’ve had for less then 6months I feel like I’m going to be like a major red flag to any employer in my current passion. So I don’t know what to do. I just feel like shit. 

Like I don’t know here’s the work I’ve done in the past [https://timmurphy.myportfolio.com](https://timmurphy.myportfolio.com). But it’s not going to get any wear cause there not that’s type of work anywhere. So I don’t know. Sorry for long rant but if you read it all cheers.",2021-10-11 12:15:23

In March of this year, the DPA ruling came out:

&#x200B;

>The Deputy Commissioner of the Data Protection Commission ('DPC') announced on LinkedIn, on 2 March 2023, the publication of the final decision, as issued on 30 December 2022, in which the DPC imposed a fine of €15,000 on A&G Couriers Limited T/A Fastway Couriers (Ireland), as well as a reprimand, for violations of Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), following a breach notification by Fastway Couriers.  
>  
>**Background to the decision**  
>  
>In particular, the DPC noted that it had received a breach notification from Fastway Couriers on 4 March 2021 which concerned the unauthorised access to personal data held by the same, while it was engaging with its service provider in order to undertake a modification to its ICT systems to facilitate declarations of duty and VAT.  
>  
>**Findings of the DPC**  
>  
>***Further to the above, the DPC found that Fastway Couriers infringed Article 32(1) of the GDPR by failing to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure an appropriate security level in relation to its processing in the context of the provision of delivery services and stored personal data in its internal report system at the time of the personal data breach.***  
>  
>**Outcomes**  
>  
>In conclusion, **the DPC imposed on Fastway Couriers an administrative fine of €15,000.** Furthermore, the DPC issued Fastway Couriers with a reprimand in respect of the infringements

k4073k,4 day work weeks - Dublin,"I'm a 28 year old team lead in Dublin, been working in tech for about 5 years and I'm on a comfortable salary. Over the last year of being locked in a studio wfh I've come to value my time a lot more than my pay.  The thought of getting another pay rise no longer motivates me as it's just more of the same work for money I don't even want / use.  


The prospect of working a 4 day work week seems much more appealing. I'm wondering if there are many devs in Dublin working 4 day work weeks.

I have a problem with these types of questions, and never ask them (unless of course, a candidate decides they want to talk about it and brings it about themselves).

I don't give a fig about what you do in your spare time, nor do I expect you to go out of your way to maintain a blog, read every book, or have some rasberry pi that tweets every time you take a shite. You do? Great - happy for you - you do you and all. For me, so long as you can do the job I'm hiring for, and get along with everyone in the team in the process, I'm happy. I feel frustrated with the expection of people hiring, that engineers need to be doing these additional things to prove themselves, and frustrated for the engineers feeling pressured to need ""an edge"" by doing them.

Last year I was promoted to engineering manager and now my boss tells me he wants me to be the head of engineering (vp of engineering is the official title).    
    
I've never been one to feel any level of stress for my work and I certainly don't right at this very moment but at some point I have to take a step back and wonder if everyone else is huffing paint or something. I just turned 27, there's about 50 engineers at my company, there's quite a few of them who are good and not just good in the technical sense but also great people persons. Some of them are 40s - 50s with a hell of a lot more experience than I have and I really do have to question am I right for this role? I have had a lot of extra capacity in my current role to assist and help other engineering managers, but I have definitely felt like I've made a mistake or two and that I had a lot of left over energy / bandwidth to do more, so perhaps that is adding to my apprehension here.

Is this attitude already engrained into the developer culture? I've seen countless people advising the only way to make more money is to job hop every two years. If that's the case, why on earth would you go above and beyond in your current role. I've noticed some more experienced colleagues (maybe 15+ YOE) really don't seem arsed a lot of the time.

I've also worked with some talented devs who are really involved in the company and company culture. Organising events, joining groups and in general just exceeding what would be expected of them within their role.

They want me in the office 5 days a week. So let's break it down. Assume that a working year is 220 days. So roughly €545 p/d. Or €68.10 p/h

Each way it's 30 mins so an hour a day so the value of my time to get to and from work would be, for simplicity, €68.


Fuel would be at least another €4, probably more.

Yeah, I could pack lunch every day and bring my own coffee but let's be realistic. That's rarely going to actually happen so let's add a very  unrealistic low estimate of an extra €10 p/d.

Just those and now we're at €82 p/d for me just to get to work and get a sandwich and a coffee or 2. So €410 a week. Or ~€18k p/a. That's how much it would cost me to go to the office **if** I include the value of my time into it.",2022-05-15 21:37:34

1ax4i6w,Anyone else feel like this? ,"This is a hard one to describe. Working in a USA based company, fully remote a few years. Survived numerous layoffs and even managed to get the odd promotion. 

I started off as a very much tech support worker and ended up as a sort of project manager. Pay went up significantly along with much less micromanaging. However I feel like I accomplish nothing. I write plans, I hold meetings I fact find. Then a few months down the line the project gets no funding and we try something else. My manager is very supportive of me and thinks I'm doing great but I feel a real sense of listlessness around work. 

However I also feel this current job is probably not going to be beat anywhere else. My colleagues are West coast USA, so I can start at 8/9/10 whenever. I have a young family, I can bring my kids to school in the morning and give their breakfast. My manager is flexible and really accommodating I rarely have late meetings. The pay is good, benefits are excellent and fully remote feels like gold dust right now. I just have this nagging sense I'm not accomplishing anything. It's hard to explain as I am not trying to climb the ladder, I'm happy in my current level of responsibility and I really only see work as a means to provide for my family. 

I guess I feel that I cannot even entertain the idea of moving role as I feel that this is the best I can get in terms of pay, conditions, work life balance and remote working. I know people have far bigger work issues going on but I just wanted to see if I am alone in this? ",2024-02-22 11:45:42

I currently work with a tech consulting company. I was hired as a remote worker to deal with one customer who had recently stopped the contract with the parent company due to the downturn.

Now it seems that they want me to go work with another customer with at least 2/3 days a week on site which is over 2 hour's drive away from where I live currently, at a huge determent to my current lifestyle and living arrangement, and the additional cost and stress of driving such a distance.

They offered to pay mileage, but it seems Ill be worse off than before factoring in all the personal time I’ll lose. My lifestyle revolves around my current location and I have no plans to relocate in this current market.

This to me seems unreasonable based on what I initially signed up for with them. my contract states I’m remote so not a hybrid role. I've been fully remote for the last 4 years now across different companies.

Is this a “reasonable accommodation” on my part, or am I being played here?

Any suggestions on how I should navigate this one?

v1n18i,Experience moving to the Netherlands?,"Hey all, I'm considering moving to the Netherlands for a while as this place is fairly unlivable as it is. I understand there are problems with housing there as well just not as bad as here.

I work in Cyber Security but there seems to be a good few job postings advertising English speaking positions. If I went I would learn some Dutch but have none at the minute. I know Netherlands is a fairly popular destination for Irish tech workers to go and work for a while so would love to hear anyone's experience doing so. Thanks!

kmlmqa,My experience of working in Ireland for two months.,"Hello Everyone. I graduated from UCD in December 2019 and started looking for job right after that.

The first thing I noticed that 20 December to 7th February is the worst time in regarding to job searching. It's because nobody will reply regarding your application status/update. Then after a long period of no reply, I finally got a successful reply just a day after the interview in a small company. Regardless of that, I got the role I wanted with the learning that I desired.

On my first day, I got some work which was very basic. After few days, my seniors has too many deadline to achieve so instead of giving me training, they told me that they will be given all kinds of support work( a blessing in disguise or a lighting in the bottle). This work ranges from creating email template to doing PHP, WordPress work .I was so nervous but once I understood the work I had to do, I became fast regarding problem solving. This was my first exposure on an industrial level work and I also though of each and every step. Because I had to do bug fixes on live application which would be viewed globally, I was nervous but then i got the confident of doing so. This role went on till my Christmas break.

During this period, My seniors dev's were constantly motivated to think outside the box, to not be afraid of changing the algo or worrying about the result because they were constantly monitoring my work.

The clients were also impressed with my work and time discipline. For Christmas they also one event and they sent us a good Christmas package which were supporting local business. This showed their dedication towards supporting local Irish business overall A BIG THUMBS UP.

Being from India, A lot of my Indian colleagues were saying ""You are lucky"" about not working in Indian management system. LUCKY ME. YAY!",2020-12-29 19:59:02
191kjzo,How hard is it to answer a Slack message,"This is a real pet peeve of mine, but if you are a few levels above me in an org and you don't bother to answer simple Slack messages after a few days, you're a bad colleague.

I'm a senior staff and need to check into existing work before starting a new project, but the point of contact for this existing work won't answer Slack messages about it. So I've established a paper trail that I reached out and I am now just continuing with my planning/investigation. If there is overlap or redundant work, I'm going to point to the paper trail and say I tried, but still though, answer your Slack messages...

Most people however are not the best. Most do a decent job and go home.

With the feeling that companies are stringing out interview process over months to find ""the best"", and asking for more.

Developers need to do more than develop, managers need to do more than manage.

Has the industry taken a turn for the worse that will force people to give up on WLB, stay put in roles and hope they don't get made redundant, or just leave the industry?

Or is this just a trough in between peaks that needs to be waited out?

13q1w54,Right to Remote,"Gentle reminder for everyone to try get there voices heard and reach out to the link via email around what you would like the act to include.

Personally my biggest 2 points were:

Performance: If we worked all during the pandemic and had glowing reviews, they suddenly can't use ""possible performance concerns"" as an excuse to deny remote. I also threw in a point of each case should be person by person and no-one should be denied remote work for general company wide performance statements.

Social / Collaboration : No job should deny remote work on the basis of 
1: Social Culture in workplace, its fine if you want to be social and make friends, for those of use who work to live, I want to work and log off ASAP. I like my colleagues but have my own friends.
2 : Collaboration: if most of my team is in Asia, Main land Europe or America, and so I'm going to have to join remote calls anyways.... why would I need to commute 3 hours a day to then video call them and the customer teams I work it ( also not based in Ireland).

I know it's just a an outreach thingy but hopefully if a lot of us complain atleast some of what we say may make it in to give us and the next generteration a chance at nit being office bound.

mwbiwe,Strangest/worst interview experience?,"I'm sure everyone has experienced at least one weird interview during their career. 

The weirdest for me was with an energy company hiring a dev/trader. Sounded pretty good from the description, but was an awful interview experience. 

The initial call was with the company owner and a manager from the head office. The manager was sound enough, and thought the owner of the company seemed a bit off but so far all was good. 

Got to the in person interview anyway and thats where it turned strange. The owner walked in about 10 mins late during the interview. Not exactly professional but I get it, things come up and people run late. 

Then all of a sudden the owner starts quizzing me on where I went to school, asking what I did during my summers, did I play sports, who was my manager in my previous summer jobs. All sorts or irrelevant questions that took me by surprise.

That was all a bit weird but I figured I'd get over that if I got the job and didn't see too much of that clown. The manager then proceeded to show me the ""IT department"".  It was 4 lads in a room, all looking like zombies. Got vibes that it was a shite place to work and nobody gave a fuck about the tech. When I was shown the system I would be maintaining, it was an extremely basic html page, running on localhost. 
Bear in mind, this wasnt a small local company. This was a nationwide energy company responsible for providing a good chunk of renewable energy to the grid, with shit software responsible for generating millions of euro a year, running on localhost. 

I noped the fuck outta there.

The first few months where okay I was pairing with my manager a 'director' basically a principal engineer who was great to work with and helped me get up to speed 

Nearly every day the pipelines fall over from bad design decisions, technical debt, source data issues etc and shit hits the fan. (We get the blame)

2 weeks ago I was pairing with my manager he said il call you back someone is ringing me. Withing 20 mins his slack account was decativated and he was fired on the spot. He had code on his laptop I needed to test an airflow dag 

The team gets brought into an emergency meeting saying due to 'orginasinastional restructure' the manager is gone immediately. Now I am 100% on prod support in a different time zone from the rest of the team. 

The pipelines are constantly fucked despite all the improvements we made and I'm shocked at what happened to my manager. I feel he was used as a scape goat and politically executed because he was a great engineer

169phir,Anyone here made a drastic career change away from software development?,"For context I've been a software developer for 9 years now, I've worked at 4 different companies, from a 5 person start up, to large multinationals (which is where I am currently).

Problem is I've never really enjoyed the work, and it's only become progressively worse year after year. I'm good at my job, not a rockstar or 10x developer, but I know I'm good. Give me a feature to build or bug to fix and I'll knuckle down and solve it, but I just do not for the life of me find the work interesting or motivating.

I've always worked in fintech (trading specifically) and I find it so depressing. I can see someone fund their account with 5 million, and walk away with 15 million at the end of the week (along with a gift basket from the company), I can also see someone put 2 grand in their account and lose it in an hour. It just feels like I'm making the word worse off, but my individual impact is so small it just makes it all the more pointless.

I feel like an alien in my family ('twas far from Dublin and trading I was raised). Whenever I'm asked by family/non-dev friends what I do for a living, I find it really hard to explain it in a way that makes sense/doesn't sound soulless. Realistically I split my time between multi-hour meetings and typing on a keyboard. Once every couple of weeks I get to press a button that increments a version number in Octopus and it starts all over again.

I think the last straw is the latest project from sales: to build an AI chat widget for our platform; with the lofty goal of making our clients better traders. It's literally being called ""Your trading mentor"". Everyone else on my team is super excited about this and I don't understand why.

Compliance says we cannot give trading advice or anything that could even be construed as trading advice, so every response is prefixed with a prominent ""THIS IS NOT TRADING ADVICE"" message. I don't understand why everyone on my team is hyped about building a trading mentor that cannot mentor, it's such an obvious and cynical jump on a bandwagon. Now you might think that at least we're getting some working exposure to LLMs, but no, it's just a frontend for OpenAI's GPT-4.

It's just another feature that we'll spend hours in meetings about, spend a couple of weeks developing, A/B test for a while, see that nobody is actually using it and then disable it permanently.

I'm autistic and my therapist reckons I'm experiencing autistic burnout, and to be honest I reckon she's right. I'm thinking of going back to education, doing a springboard course and retraining to become a chef. Is this completely mad?

TLDR: I came out of college thinking I'd be painting fine art, instead I'm just painting houses. Should I reject modernity, embrace physical graft?",2023-09-04 11:26:03

Year 1: 30k + 0.9k - First job out of college, didn't try to negotiate. After researching a bit after joining and bringing up the poor salary I was told ""in 6 months""

Year 2: 30k + 1.8k - ""You're exceeding our expectations, we'll be revisiting the budget in 6 months and making sure you'll get an increase""

Year 3: 30k + 1.8k- and the same thing happened

Year 4: 51k + ~2k - Moved Job, previous company was quick to match it but I refused. It was only after moving I realized I'd been working crazy hours in my previous company and I really got to relax after moving job.

Year 5: 64k + ~5k - Promotion

Year 6: 77k  + ~8k - Promotion, I've probably peaked in my current company and will have to move to get a higher compensation


I've never received stocks anywhere I've worked so it's just salary + bonus. 
I negotiated hard when I moved jobs since I didn't want to be playing catch up after being manipulated by my manager in my first job. If you don't negotiate you're really shooting yourself in the foot.

j1vost,Honest Feedback On The Irish IT Industry," 

I’m an Irish engineer. I studied Structural Engineering and have been working in the Irish construction industry on site for three years.  


I’m seriously considering a career change and I’d like to get some honest feedback on what it is really like in the Irish IT industry.  


I’l first outline the reasons why I want to leave construction so that you know what type of feedback I’m looking for.  


Hours :  


Standard site hours on large Dublin based project is 7.00-18.00 mon - thurs, 7.00 - 15.00 Friday. I can probably count on one hand the amount of times I’ve actually got to take the “early finish” on Friday as something always comes up. That's standard contracted hours not approaching a deadline. When the real pressure is on rotating Saturday mornings are common. So your talking 50 hours plus every week.

Pay :  


30-35k is standard for the first couple of years. After that you might get up into the 40k range if you go project management route. I’m on 32k with 3 years experience after a difficult hons degree. I work with a lot of engineers who are not on much better, many with masters degrees.

Stress :  


Construction industry pressure is insane. Problems need immediate solutions when they occur and the overhead costs are massive when delays are caused. The whole industry operates on a “just get it done now” culture. For the limited experience I have and the pay I receive I think the stress / responsibility is ridiculous. There are nights I wake up thinking about work the next day.

Working Conditions :  


On big projects you will be working out of a proper cabin with internet, heating , bathrooms etc. It’s still pretty rough, out in all weather conditions and covered in mud all day. On small projects it’s a lot worse.

Social / Culture :  


I don’t really fit in with the culture at all, unless you are into GAA/football/drinking there is very little to talk about. It’s a very lad culture (90% men) and I’m definitely more of a quiet hipstery type. There is honestly not a single person I work with who I would consider meeting up with outside of work with socially. Which is very isolating.

Independent Work :  


I feel I perform best when given a task that needs to be completed within a couple of days timeframe rather than this very second and then really focusing on it independently. Just working away at it quietly and figuring it out. About 1/3 of my job is this and I am very good at it. Unfortunately though the other 2/3 is basically team management, dealing with subcontractors, overseeing on site work. Basically project management and I feel I really don’t have the aggressive social skills needed to do it well.  


Work from home :  


I would love to have the option in future to work from home, my partner would like to move out of Dublin with her job in future but I am basically tied to the on site Dublin centric industry.  


Boom / Bust :  


Construction is so cyclical that half of the guys I work with have been in Australia or Canada working due to the crash. It’s booming now but when there’s no jobs there really are no jobs. I have a life here now and a partner and do not plan on leaving if I can avoid it.

In contrast I am considering the IT industry. Many friends of mine (late 20s) already work in IT related jobs. In comparison they all seem to be on more money, work less hours, have more working flexibility, currently all work from home, seldom talk about stress in a very serious way and actually have a little work social group who all seem fairly sound. Any times I’ve met up with their friends from work I’v felt more like I would suit that culture. When I talk about my job they really don’t relate.  


What I am considering :  


I have done some programming in college in my more maths based modules. Nothing serious but I felt that I could intuitively understand it and it was probably one of my better subjects in college. I am considering starting CS50 in my spare time this year just to answer the question of could I actually do it. Then if I am still interested leaving engineering next year and doing a H Dip in IT.  


TLDR : I’m an engineer who hates the construction industry due to long hours, stress and poor pay. Friends of mine who work in IT seem to have a much better job overall. Is it really that much better in IT?  Is it possible for me to do a course in IT and change careers?

I have got to read all of this feedback, absorb it, and make changes to my work. I don't mind doing that, but I do mind coping with the rudeness.

I've not really been able to keep up. There was very obviously some unhappiness in the team from this, and as a result, my manager has informed me my probation period will be extended another 3 months (was due to end at the start of December).

A few friends across the industry have said this is a bad sign, that generally a probation extension is a chance for the company to find a replacement for you without reducing capacity in the interim. Has anyone else experienced that? Am I basically out the door already and I just don't know it?

I was given some general info about improving myself, but nothing really specific. The vibe with the team has totally soured, and I don't feel comfortable asking questions (and a few times Ive gotten some fairly hurtful responses). Im finding it difficult to do anything because Im constantly worried about asking one question too many or asking something so blatantly obvious to the rest of them that someone will go to the manager again.

r5lyte,Recruiters are mad sometimes,I recently had a recruiter contact me about a software position for a decent company.

So we organise a time for an online interview and he tells me that the first interview is short and just an introduction to get to know me I'm like fine. So fast forward a week interview is the next day and he sends me the job spec which he kept forgetting to send on during the week and now I find out that the online interview is 2 hours long with a short get to know you section followed by a 90 minute code interview. I was like what the fuck I had no prep time going into an interview for a full dev position what kind of madness is that. Needless to say I told him I'm not doing it and left it at that. Then the same week I have another recruiter ask me to interview for a senior team management role for 100k a year using two languages that are not on my profile or I have ever used. Like seriously don't they screen profiles first. They are mad in the head sometimes haha,2021-11-30 12:12:29
q8xyyu,Not happy with how manager handled resignation,"I resigned my job as dev a few months ago from a software consultancy to join a sass company. I wanted to work in a proper tech company.

At the time the consultancy had me onsite (remote) with one of their clients. Now this was my second time working with this client, I had built a great relationship with the team and senior management (they even offered me a permanent role when I resigned from the consultancy).

My notice period was 1 month, my manager asked my me for 2 so he could protect the relationship with the client. I really liked and respected my manager so I agreed to it (despite the fact it would cost me money, as my new place was paying 50% more). 

He asked me to say nothing to client, again so he could handle the relationship. It was coming to my last week, and the client were making plans with me as if I'd be there for the foreseeable. I talked to my manager who said he hadn't talked to them and then ""emailed"" them.

I'm actually riled with him, as I respected both him and the client and only agreed to 2 months notice due to that respect, and he only gave them 1 week notice. Is this normal?",2021-10-15 21:30:40

ok1aki,Boards.ie down for nearly a week while migrating,"Boards.ie went down midnight last Thursday morning while they were migrating to a new system, and they are still down.  


Look, it's easy for me on the outside to throw shade at this without knowing any of the ins and outs of it, but this is surely crazy right? I'm not really involved in prod support or managing anywhere near this much data but I'd be curios about peoples opinions of what is going on.

&#x200B;

They have some challenges of a huge amount of data and that data would be continuously growing if they stayed up, but their latest update is talking about reviews of pull requests to a theme happening last night, this is surely madness right? I can't think of a scenario where this couldn't have been tested with a subset of data without being down.

lj2eaa,For any students: SISTEM 2021 (an Irish tech conference by students for students) is on next Saturday,"I know there's a fair amount of students on this subreddit so thought I'd give this event a share.

SISTEM is a tech conference for students, organized by different student computing societies (netsocs, compsocs, etc) from across the different colleges on the island. It's all online this year, and there's a pretty great lineup of speakers from Ireland and beyond. All of the talks/workshops are designed to be fairly entry-level and accessible. There's stuff on gaming, SRE, Next.js, AI , soft skills, neurodiversity in tech and loads more. There'll be lightning talks from other students as well towards the end of the day, which are always good craic and interesting.

It's on next Saturday (20th February). Tickets are a fiver, and all of that money is going to charity (this year it's going to Pieta House and Irish Network Against Racism). It's all aimed on students but there's nothing stopping non-students from checking it out either.

There's more info on the website here: [https://sistemconf.com](https://sistemconf.com) and you can get your ticket here: [https://hopin.com/events/sistem-2021](https://hopin.com/events/sistem-2021)

Highly recommend giving it a look -- I was involved organizing it over the last two years, I think it's a great chance to check out some parts of tech I'd never really been familiar with before. It also takes a massive amount of effort to run this kind of thing and it's all done voluntarily by students.

km0m60,Are we lucky to have jobs?,"On the last day before Christmas holidays I had a meeting with my manager / technical director. I told him that we need to discuss wages in January as I can't continue with what I'm on. I'm struggling.

He told me there's no chance of pay increases, and that given covid we're lucky to have jobs. The company is using covid as an excuse for everything, and they're only down a few % on their original target.

I told my manager that I would leave if I wasn't given a decent wage, he's response was that ""You won't, and you'll struggle to find something else"".

Is my boss right? While I know I won't find a job in a week, I'm confident I'll find another one. I'm dusting off my CV and I'm going to apply for new jobs in January.

I just wanted to say that it took hard work, applying to 50 postings a day, and around three months but made it through a process to the end(7 interviews). I am now looking back and saying it was all worth it.

If you are out there looking right now, keep your chin up. It will work, positions are still being filled and there is someone out there that needs your specific quirks. You two just haven't met yet 🙂. 

I thought I didn't get the position at least 6 times before the final interview. I thought that maybe I would constantly just get emails thanking me for my time but no thanks. I thought that maybe luck of the draw caught up to me and I had been found wanting. But I was my greatest enemy and grey skies made bright futures seem like fiction. 

Unemployment has stayed below 4% for awhile now so you have a 96% chance of getting there, I'm sure I will get hate for that statistic lol. Remember if it all seems dark, opening a door or window may illuminate your space. If those are still closed, try the back ones, if those fail then renovate. 

I believe in you and you are worth it. DM if you feel otherwise.

I am a recent grad. I spent 6 months doing QA automation. I left this job to move into dev role at a company, where I have been for 2 months. I have been working really hard here, I start work earlier than everyone and often end up working to 9pm. All good so far, I am happy to work these hours.

&#x200B;

My issue is my manager is a prick. No matter how much I do it is not good enough. Week 1 was grand he was pretty friendly. But every week since he has been giving out more and more. This weeks meeting was basically an hour of him fucking the head off me for nothing at all. I can take a bollocking I spent time in the army before pursing CS so it is not that I am soft. At the point now where I feel sick going into work because this bollocking is unavoidable.

&#x200B;

My problem is if I leave now I will have 2 short stays at a job, which will look bad. I liked the first job, I just left because I thought this job was going to be the pot at the end of the rainbow. 

&#x200B;

Any advice on how to handle this situation? Should I stick it out for another year or try and get another job?

tl4j9v,Are Dublin salaries competitive only for Senior engineers?,"Hi everyone,

I am an Italian girl and I was considering some development positions in Dublin. I have \~ 2 yoe.

According to surveys found [on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/t771ra/early_career_professionals_2_years_work/) or on [Morgan McKinley's website](https://www.morganmckinley.com/ie/ireland-salary-guide-calculator), it seems to me that the salary for development roles with \~ 2 yoe lies in the interval 35k - 50k on average, which roughly corresponds to 2,3K \~ 3K per month after tax.

Honestly, considering how expensive Dublin is, these salaries seem pretty low, especially if you plan to live alone.

Obviously we have lower salaries in Italy (which is known for the shitty salaries in IT), but with 2 yoe is fairly easy to get jobs paying 2K net/month in the North of Italy, and considering the difference in CoL, you could end up saving more than in Dublin.

Of course I'm sure that in Dublin you would have a lot more possibilities to grow and to switch companies, but still... I was expecting more compensation for that CoL. Am I missing something? Does it make more sense to come to Dublin only as a Senior Engineer, hence with an higher salary?",2022-03-23 18:05:20

i3me2u,React Rail - A modern Irish Rail timetable,"*Hi all!*

*I just wanted to share a personal project of mine that I've been working for the last couple of months, hope that's okay :)*

Source:  [https://github.com/JeeZeh/React-Irish-Rail](https://github.com/JeeZeh/React-Irish-Rail) 

# [React Rail - A modern Irish Rail timetable](https://www.reactrail.com)

Originally a personal learning project for React to load Irish Rail trains for a given station, React Rail has grown into a little more than that. See below for a summary of what it can do!

## Who is it for?

I think it is most valuable for someone who is familiar with the Irish Rail system/routes to a reasonable degree. If you know which trains you need to take but you just need to know when to take them, this is for you.

As a newcomer to the system it is a relatively noise-free display of train data that might be relevant to you if you find other apps a little too confusing.

## What does it do?

1. View the upcoming trains at any Irish Rail station for the next 2 hours
2. Explore the journey for each train approaching a station (see where it is in real time)
3. Filter the trains by reachable destination. This lets you figure out getting from one station to another i.e. you can only filter by directly connected stations
4. Save stations to your favourites for quick access in the future
5. Quickly access nearby station data if you provide location access
6. Bookmark/share your current station and lookahead time (trains in the next X mins) for future reference
7. Install the website as an app on mobile and desktop for quick access from the home screen etc.

## What does it NOT do?

* It does not perform route planning (get from A->B beyond a single train). I *may* look into this in the future, but I don't want to be responsible for any missed trains!
* It does not show data from any other transport provider (e.g. Dublin Bus)

## How does it work?

The 'app' is comprised of 2 components

* A Node.js server acts as a simple proxy & cache to the [Irish Rail API](http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/) as it does not support CORS.
* A user interface built with React to parse and display the API data.

169ah8v,Finally landed my first grad position,"This is kinda just a victory post for me. Sorry if it sounds pretentious, but I’m so damn chuffed.

Finished up my degree in May, and unfortunately the company I interned with are in a hiring freeze so none of the interns were brought back.

Literally applied to jobs day in, day out for months with only a slow trickle of interviews that didn’t lead anywhere. Last week though I finally landed a job in a start up. The company seems really cool, and the salary is really good. It also just feels amazing to finally get something and not have to worry about how long my savings will last me, and about how many jobs I need to apply to etc.

It’s definitely rough out there for grads at the moment. But I guess to others who are in my boat - something will come your way eventually, so keep at it.

Alright, that’s all. Thanks!

Edit: Since people were asking, I’m just gonna share a bit on the interview process. I found it on LinkedIn - but not through the ‘traditional’ way of applying to an opening. I came through one of the higher ups in the company and connected with him, and just shot him a message. From that, he decided to give me a first round interview.

This was fairly basic - he told me a bit about the company, I walked him through what I had covered in the degree and in the internship. Basically was just to find out if I had a bit of knowledge and wasn’t completely crazy. After that I was offered a second round interview.

In the second round interview i covered some aspects of software design - customer requirements, system design, front end and back end code and then deployment. There was no coding challenge as such, but I was required to read a bit of code and explain what it was doing, and how it worked (in detail). It wasn’t really like any interview I’d done before, but it was much more enjoyable. Also they didn’t get bogged down in the niche specifics of any of the languages.

Then the following day I was officially offered the job.",2023-09-03 22:31:42

uejnk1,I'm Homeless,"I hope it's ok that I post this here.

As the title says I'm currently homeless and have been for about 7 months now. My back story and how I got here is a bit long so won't go into it right now so the reason I'm posting this is because I'm looking for a lifeline.

Part of the reason I became homeless was because I became very isolated in life, just lost contact with everyone (family and friends) so had nowhere to fall back on and my life is still that way, I'm by myself all day everyday and it's very hard.

I've had an interest in programming for a good while and have acted on that interest by beginning to learn some programming languages. I have books, PDF's and use udemy. I've not gotten past the basics. I find it really hard to progress with studying because of how I feel and my living conditions make it hard. I usually deal with my feelings of loneliness by finding things on the internet that give me emotional spikes and so distract me of how I feel but it's all just a time waster and just doesn't help. I live in a homeless hostel and it's very livable in terms of physical needs but socially it is very stressful. It is always noisy, I have never gotten a full nights sleep and during the day people play music and their televisions or phones and the sound gets to me so that also makes it difficult to study.

I'm making this post in the hopes that in Dublin there might be some kind of help for people in difficult situations and from difficult backgrounds to help them enter the tech industry and change their lives. I read a while ago Apple has a mentor program for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Doing something like that would be amazing. Or maybe if someone wants to be a teacher that would be great too. Its just being alone makes it hard to focus. I know maybe it should be the other way round, being alone I should be all the more focused but for me I'm just overwhelmed by it. So I'm hoping on some kind of a life line. I'm in a hole and don't know how to get out of it. I feel study and work is the way forward, by increasing my labour value all other aspects of life will improve, I hope so.",2022-04-29 11:20:25

Particularly remote work. 

I would like to connect people together on a discord server to:
1) meet other ""makers""/swe's (kind of hate that buzz word, but 🤬 it)- particularly those that want to join or create a startup or open source project.
2) share information amongst each other: introduce to new things will show you paths to improve your skillset.
3) have programming/tech discussions ; talk about a trending/interesting things, etc.
4) buddy programming: helping people imo is a very valuable skill.
5) Q and A: this isn't to replace stack overflow (which is great), just an alternative.
6) connect with other  Devs living in Ireland. Hopefully meet IRL 

Obviously a group like this requires a certain threshold (network effects) to be useful. Currently we are well bellow this number as originally it was just a few friends.

So yeah, shoot me a message with your discord name if you would like to join and I will add you to the server.

vnkj33,DevelEire Salary Survey 2022 Visualisation,"Ok results are in and now visualised...

[**Original link to results post.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/vmiwdl/results_of_2022_develeire_salary_survey/)

[**Link to visualisation.**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/monie8460/viz/DeveleireSalarySurvey2022/SalarySurvey)

Note that again I have just created something very similar [to last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/mdnjk7/develeire_salary_survey_visualisation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This is not an analysis and simply a visualisation of the results.

\---

There are a few things worth considering when looking at this data.

* Salaries in tech in Europe follow [a trimodal nature](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/). If you have not read that blog post already I would highly recommend reading it to understand why this data looks the way it does. 
* There is an inherent bias in the type of person who uses this subreddit and moreover the type of person who responds to these surveys. They generally tend to have higher salaries and are male.
* Survey design is not easy. Some of the questions here are structured with a specific type of responder in mind. When an atypical respondent reads these questions they either answer inaccurately or disengage with the survey entirely. This again means there is bias in the data towards a specific type of tech worker.

\---

Now a few things to point out in the visualisation.

* This simply shows the distribution of salary bands aggregated by whichever group you select. You can also filter by multiple attributes.
* This is fully interactive so you can click on elements of the bar chart to see the corresponding data.
* You can also search the data for Job Title/Company/Programming Language.

Again, there were multiple data quality issues that were addressed.

* Job Titles were parsed and grouped into specific categories. I expect some people to be mildly offended at how I have done this and tell me that a Machine Learning Engineer is definitely NOT the same as a Data Scientist. The intent is for the filtered distribution to be general enough to be meaningful. The original Job Titles persist in the underlying details. If there is any grouping that is particularly egregious please let me know and I'll update (I have no idea what DevOps actually is).
* Colleges were parsed for misspellings and grouped into their current names (amalgamations and new technological universities - I discovered many new ones!). Only Irish colleges were kept with the remaining grouped as 'International'.
* Degrees and level of education were also parsed and grouped.
* Responses were generally cleaned up a little.

\---

Finally some comments on data issues that weren't addressed.

* It is good that bonus/stocks were considered differently this time but the free text fields means these are ultimately mostly unusable again. If I find some more time I might try to parse out currency signs, different number formats, percentages signs etc. to try make this more useful. A comparable number might be a Total Compensation Target which takes into account all of these things in addition to the respective components.
* Industry had the same issues as last year where there are too many variations to parse.
* Pensions and holidays could be worded differently to more accurately capture responses.
* The WFH questions confused me so I didn't include them and they weren't well answered anyway.

\---

As usual if anyone has any specific feedback let me know and I can update the visualisation, otherwise I hope the results are insightful!",2022-06-29 16:57:50

We had a townhall last week, and work said that they give anyone a pay rise until June at the earliest, that means I will have been on the same salary for 2 years. I'm going to say to my manager I wan't a payrise, and I'm not waiting until June. If I get nothing significant I'm going to give my notice.

I'm not paid market salary (about 15K below) despite management insisting that everyone is above the market rate. I hate the work I'm doing, I'm bored af, the project atm is a legacy JS framework that I'm being forced to work on as we took over a client site.

I'm ready to leave, I don't care about not having income for a few months, I have plenty of savings, but I need more money for a mortgage, to actually start enjoying life, and I can't do it on this salary.

Would I be a dickhead, or unreasonable for doing this?",2020-12-13 19:07:25

And of course PAS runs slow as a wet week so nothing happens quickly. I interviewed in March!

I gave permission for them to contact my current back in September and still no update apart from the papers are off to get final sign off. Luckily my current is going to keep me on indefinitely but it’s still not a great position to be in. I can’t start any large projects, only bug fixes and maintenance tasks as well as doing handovers. I can’t help thinking that any bugs I introduce or work that’s less than perfect will be seen as me slacking off because I’m leaving.

I'm wondering if anyone here has ever moved away from software to another career and if they recommend or regret it? Any searches for career switches I've found here seem to be all about either switching to software from another career or within software itself.

I've become quickly become jaded with any software job I've been at so far, regardless of its pay, benefits, flexibility etc and I realise it's probably the work itself. I don't feel like I make any impact either at company level or to society itself.

&#x200B;

Ones i can think of myself are basic and could probably apply to other jobs:

* Burnout.
* For most of your work won't actually be coding (Some might consider this a positive)
* Many meetings emails and calls, just to figure out what it is you're supposed to be building.
* Getting stuck on never ending projects or even immoral projects(adware , addictive gambling or software with addictive micropayment loops for example)
* Bad managers (not my personal experience, but i've seen it with others due to open plan offices)
* Open plan offices.
* Impossible tasks that require you do something but also stipulate you can't use certain libraries
* The cycle of being super in demand to sudden layoffs.
* The fashion cycle of languages, methodologies and technologies ( Machine Learning right now for example)
* Feature creep
* The assumption that you can just move to a task and hit the ground running with language/ API or library you've never used before.
* Open plan offices again.
* A lack of understanding from non-IT about how much work something requires.",2023-01-27 21:11:09

q7zlb5,Dumpster fire interview - vent,"Not sure why I'm spilling this all out into the ether - maybe some of you will have had a similar experience starting out. Maybe some can offer a slap of harsh realities or even some consoling constructive advice. I'm nearing the end of a conversion course in SD through Springboard. No prior experience in this area at all. This sub has been great btw in trying to understand more about this industry and experience's had by other redditors.

  
 Anyway, we're expected to apply for an internships/jobs from Jan onwards and I go to the career fair. Have a virtual call with a nice guy from a company. Just a chat and no real expectations (internship role is a bit out of my county and not sure if realistically I'd make the move for what it is). He puts me on for one interview then 2 days later. Accidentally forwards me the CVs of some others scheduled in who had BScs and MAs in relevant fields (not expecting much now but I'll go for the interview, sure).   
No idea what to expect except some logic questions. I do a bit of prep as far as I can in doing those riddle-like questions. Interview goes surprisingly well (young guy and vibe well together) as I actually manage to talk aloud about the puzzle given and work it out (at least I think so as we do about 3 in the interview). Get an email from the original guy afterwards saying he'll put me through to the final round and that I did well. 

  
Interview the next day is with the office head and the VP of the company... (in another country). Bricking it a little and told there'll be more logic questions. On the day, different vibe - two senior interview guys - nice and polite but maybe my vibe or theirs was more serious but I was overcome with stress and completely bombed. Not only did I not get the logic questions but when one explained to me the paradoxical logic in the problem, I nodded on just begging in my mind that they just give the answer. Failed both questions. Not only that though(!), I was asked about all kinds of things about SQL, HTTPS protocols - things which I hadn't studied before (I had done SQL in a databases module earlier this year but nothing really on security). I realise some of these topics might have been easy to a more seasoned dev, I really felt like a deer in headlights. Finding it intimidating and overwhelming when I see job descriptions list off a massive stack of tools used that Ive never heard of or job descriptions/titles that are still outside my range of understanding. 

I just felt terrible after this interview. Total and utter feeling of uselessness and questioning this new direction altogether. As I near the end of this year I'm having serious doubts of being able to perform in interviews - I feel like I just know nothing and am doing the coursework just keeping up to speed. I know I shouldn't feel this way - just need to learn from it and do better. Still need to figure out a plan of action here. Grateful for any advice!

Looking back in a year from now I might think how naive I'm being here. Any similar experiences? Or maybe just roast me here if you like (put share some positive advice)!",2021-10-14 13:21:07

I am a recent graduate from GMIT. Graduated with First Class Honours. I've applied countless times to different companies. Only made it to the interview stage 3 - 4 times. Companies interviewed for:
- Cisco: First one, went pretty bad.
- Ericsson: Went pretty well, no offer.
- Sidero: Went very well imo, no offer.
- Neueda: Again, very well imo. However, they have ghosted me.

I've also applied for a few internships as yes, I am that desperate, and I've been rejected from the few that have gotten back to me so far. I've applied to Cisco and Ericsson again and I'm just waiting to see what's the story with those.

Long story short: companies seem to want me to have experience but I'm unable to get experience because I can't get hired due to a lack of experience.

Any advice? Is it simply a bad time to look for a job or am I doing something wrong? I feel like I'm not that bad at interviews right now; I answer everything thrown at me to a fairly good standard, always do well in coding tasks given.

But i feel its come with a lot of pressure and I get stuck all the time with no one to turn to.

But shouldn't I be in the company of people who have more experience than me? I just don't want to leave because I made the wrong decision. It makes me feel as if I'm in the wrong line of work.

ltmxcw,What are mid/senior level interview processes like? I've almost developed a phobia of them.,"Apologies for the long post but been thinking about this one for a while.   
There tends to be a lot in this group about the interview process for grads. I'm wondering what differences to expect in the interview process as someone going for more experienced roles.   
So for context I've been working as a backend Java engineer for 4 years.   
Salary growth is limited at the company I work for so I've decided to look elsewhere. My day to day job mostly involves correcting bugs and making small/medium changes to the existing codebase. 

Sad thing is, I've never really had to go all the way through a normal process. At my current company I started as an intern after a single interview with the engineering lead and worked my way from there. 

Generally the process seems to be:   
1) Initial screening call  
2) Take home code exercise (or a timed code test)  
3) Zoom call to talk about the code exercise  
4) Multiple rounds of technical questions  
5) System design round?   
6)  job offer. 

I'm most vague about step 4 and step 5. For grads they say to practice on data structures and algorithms as well as leetcode/hackerrank stuff. Does that apply as much to devs with experience who might be rusty in that area?   
Is the approach ""just"" to spend the next few months practicing leetcode exercises, brush up on DS & algos, and study: cracking the coding interview?

1agmzsz,Vent - I'm so frustrated and cynical about the job market,"Hi all.  First off, this isn't a woe is me, pity me post, I just really need to get stuff off my chest.  I'm not the first person to post about this, and definitely won't be the last either, but I'm at my wit's end in this current job market.  Without giving too much away, my background (only a few years) is in cyber security, and I just feel like I've no hope of ever getting back into a security role.  I have certs, hands on industry experience (mainly blue teaming and consulting (yeah, I know)) and I would love to get into a SOC role and work towards digital forensics.

The problem is, I just can't get any roles.  I know there are layoffs left, right, and center at the moment, and that in itself is frustrating me, because these roles are badly needed, but I'm just losing hope and my drive to keep going.  I'm labbing, doing certs (or attempting them at least), reading, attending webinars, the works.  But most of the responses I get from interviewers over the past year is:

* You are lacking experience
* You're not what we're looking for at the moment
* We've decided to fill the role with existing internal personnel
* Getting ghosted (by HR, managers, and recruiters).

I know this has been the same for many people, but I feel like I can't do this anymore, and will just pack in my goals and ambitions and get a menial job.  Again, I'm not looking for pity, just need to vent to people that understand the industry.  I'm not the best analyst in the world, and never will be, but I think I can be damn good at it at any rate, and I'm incredibly passionate about it.

If anyone has any nuggets of wisdom, advice, or just wants to give their two cents, please fire away!Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.  ",2024-02-01 22:03:04

12u24zf,Return to Office,"Basically finally getting the boot stuck in and being told back a minimum 2 days a week.

My company has a well know ""Remote"" Culture but they've been doing thier own power trip since things turned tight.

Had a meeting with my manager asking why its being enforced on me since I'm the only one on my team in Ireland (out of the 20 people  worldwide 14 are remote designated by managers included). There just trying to not rock the boat it seems, I asked to be moved to remote but suddenly it seems the reasoning of no one else I work with is in ireland isn't a good enough reason?

Next step is to just try setup a meeting with his manger (who is also remote designated) and request again. I feel like the only way out is to lie and say I plan on moving to the country (not exactly a lie, currently live in Dublin but planning to move to Kildare / Meath) but even then he said it's ""only"" an hour and a half commute.

Anyone have any advice on how they got thier manger to understand that it's a stupid idea and or how to tactfully explain that I will most likely have to leave the company if they don't accept my request to be made remote?.

TL:DR New work policy is 2 days minimum, I'm the only one on my team in the country so there's no reason for me to go in, manger is still expecting me to go in as it's mandatory. How to explain to them that it's stupid in a nice way",2023-04-21 13:41:51

115qzoa,Feeling Unmotivated,"Hi

I'm a software engineer in Dublin with 5 years experience. I've been working in my current place since just before covid, so it's about 3 years now. Recently something happened in work and I've just lost all motivation and I don't really care anymore. I'll give some background first.

I did love this place. I thought i won the lottery a few months into working here as I loved it. The job is fully remote, I make decent money, I'm constantly growing and being challenged. My manager is great, the team is great and the tech stack is modern af. I love it and care so much about the product, its a great place to work.

We had performance reviews before Christmas and for the most part it was solid. People are happy with me, my manager is delighted with me and no manager issues. There were a few comments about something I could improve on.

As a result of these comments I was denied a promotion I was expecting, and I got no pay rise. It kinda of ruined my Christmas as it's all I could think of. Since coming back in January I've just lost motivation. I'm just coasting, I take the piss with tickets and I really don't care if the work gets done.

I feel shafted. I told my manager I disagree with these comments and I asked for examples (which haven't been provided), but nothing happened. 

I'm looking on LinkedIn and with all the recent layoffs, the jobs look dull af. There's nothing that interests me atm. I guess I have to stick it out for year but I'd love to walk.

Any advice",2023-02-18 20:57:55

z8zt95,Feeling very incompetent at my new role. Afraid of getting fired. What should I do?,"I was working at a mid-size company and was doing really well as a mid-level developer, launched a couple products in 2021 and early 2022 and promoted to Senior. Unfortunately, the 2022 downturned caused the company to go bust and everybody was fired two months ago.

So I accepted a contractor position at an investment bank. So far I have been a completely incompetent worker. They are paying me a lot of money (150k), but I have delivered nothing except a small bugfix PR this month (\~10 loc). I hate being a deadweight and I am afraid I am going to get fired soon, so I don't know what to do here.

I think the change of weather is partly to blame as I feel quite blue and unproductive lately, but the way of working in this corporation is very hard to navigate for me. Here is the point I am thinking I am struggling with.

1. They are using very slow HVD. Doing any task take 30 seconds+, which breaks the workflow for me.
2. They wrote their own IDE. Everything is coded from scratch. No use of library. It's all lockedown. I dont even have access to HTTP client and need to write my own to test API calls.
3. I am put on L3 Support getting calls / tickets from users. Many of the issues are product / feature request related, in which I believe something that should be handled by our non-existence product owner and not a developer. I am just here ping-ponging the issue between team lead and the customer. And they just keep blaming each other.
4. Legacy codebase with some 300k lines written by prior contractors and little to no documentation. This is a very complicated monolith apps. One class has 6,000+ lines in it. They put all the major functionality into this single app and which code it triggers is entirely based on the states in the deployment servers. So it is extremely difficult to reproduce anything locally as a result. Also there's no unit tests, so any change I made, I absolutely have no idea whether it will work or not.
5. The project is a specialized financial application requiring significant domain knowledge in Finance like how financial risk is calculated, measures, calculators, etc. Like I don't even know where to start working on these support tickets or even pinpoint where the issue is coming from. These are not simple ""Hey my app crashes here is the payload, can you take a look?""
6. No expectation or milestone is given to me. It's like they just dump me onto this team and that's it.

I think I would need at least a year just to understand any of these things. But it feels weird being a temporary contractor in this position. I went in assuming they have an existing product owner / manager and need extra hand implementing functionality.

What would you do to salvage this situation ? This is my first time contracting.",2022-11-30 18:58:40

xdy2t3,Advice on Next Steps - Rescinded Offer,"**TLDR**; had sre role from Meta rescinded with less than 3 weeks to start. Had quit my prior role and would welcome advice on how best to tackle the search for a new role.

Hi all,

I know there are a lot of threads on careers recently but I was hoping to reach out to get some advice from the community following a rescinded offer.

I was due to start a position on Meta's Discover Production Engineering Program in October. The program is designed to recruit individuals who don't have degrees in computer science to work as Production Engineers (Meta SRE). It's a year long program with a job offer at the end conditional on performance.

I had received and signed an offer letter in June of this year with a start date of the first week of October. Was super excited to be starting - especially as it was SRE back-end which is the area I'm most interested in (Linux, automation, systems at scale). I had left my prior job in late August in advance of starting.

Unfortuantely I got a call yesterday confirming that Meta were rescinding my offer with the 2022 cohort (both Dublin and London) cancelled. It was quite tough to take given I was due to start in less than 3 weeks.

I now need to find a new role, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed to be honest and not quite sure where to start. I was very lucky to have found the Meta program as it was pitched perfectly to my experience and interests.

My prior role was office based - I did some coding / automation but coding / systems wasn't the core focus of the role. I'm currently finishing a part time bootcamp with the Code Institute which has given me some exposure to front end but I've found the material quite shallow. I have some (limited) coding experience from my degree.

I'm now planning on starting to apply for entry level roles focusing on SRE. I'm conscious the market is quite tight especially for people with limited experience. **Is there any specific advice the community would have for individuals job hunting who have non-traditional backgrounds ?**

Plan B would be to start a search based on my existing skillset but I feel that would be giving up on my goal to migrate to a swe role.

Thanks !",2022-09-14 10:12:17

I don't mean paid over time I mean the temptation to do extra unpaid work. Now that I'm working from home full time I have picked up a habit of working late in the evening (easily till 10pm) / even logging on at weekends to do stuff.

No one has a gun to my head making me do this. In fact I'm sure my scrum master would actively discourage it if they knew hours I was putting in. I for the most part enjoy my work or at least am driven to always try solve ""just one more thing"".

* I conceptualised and completed this in a day, it is going to be broken.

* There is a 2500 request limit on the Directions API, and to conserve these I limit it to only find routes for the latest 25 listings on daft. (I would prefer 150 as it would be more accurate)

* It only gets listings from Dublin and works best closest to the city centre.

* I am a terrible front end developer.

These days are in the minority but are extremely annoying when they present themselves.  


IF you experience days where you just cannot focus, how do you deal with them?  


Additional Info:  
I have a job with a high degree of randomization and ambiguity.   
The context switching takes its toll on concentration.

In my organization I perform well overall, my performance reviews are great, I am trusted, given autonomy, been promoted multiple times and manage a team.  
I am lucky that I have many days where I can focus and move multiple projects on in many ways, justifying my existence.  
The organization also looks at results, not time in front of a screen, which allows for off days.  
I still do not like the idea of off days.   
I know that in other organizations this would not be tolerated, and I also know I could end up in one of them someday, so I want to be better capable to deal with these type of days.  


Update: I do not think I have ADHD, I do think I have a job that requires a lot of context switching and young children at home making life complex for the moment.

qmhs3p,Feeling like Im not cut out to be in this job.,"I could use some advice. I moved jobs about seven months ago, and while the first few months were good, I've started to feel like Im not cut out for this role or for career in general (I've 3 years prior experience, but with a company with less technological breadth).I've not really progressed in my knowledge of the companies products and tools as others have, so I have big knowledge gaps that ultimately cause goals and deadlines to be missed. I'm stressed and making idiotic mistakes and not grasping the requirements of tasks correctly, meaning I'm leaning on team mates for guidance and knowledge sharing, which is straining those relationships to breaking point. It's a bit of a vicious circle where I need guidance, but asking for too much in the past means no one really wants to give it, so I end up stuck for even longer.

The joy has gone out of this job for me already, every day I wake up unhappy and by lunchtime Im a ball of stress and haven't a notion what I should be doing. I can't sleep, and my appetite is gone. Lately I've started to question if Im even cut out for this career, as I genuinely think Im not smart enough for it. Part of me wants to quit the job and go back to something more manageable stress wise, like retail work, but to be honest the quality of my work there was pretty piss poor too. To be honest I think I might just be an fuckup. I have no idea what I am doing. This line of thinking has lead me to a really, really dark place, and Im trying hard to shake some intrusive thoughts from morning to night.

So should I hand in my notice and go look elsewhere or in a different field? I don't even know where to start career wise as Im already in my 30s and I'd be starting from scratch.",2021-11-04 10:38:25

c21zk8,Burnt out as a developer,"(using throwaway) 

I'm 42 and I've been a developer/coder in some form or another since leaving school in the 90s. The only time I wasn't working in IT was when I was at university.

Recently I've found that the industry has taken a bit of a nasty turn. The demand for experienced developers means that there are some amazing salaries on offer, but that comes with some significant downsides. For me it is the expectation of many employers to expect that I will work late without question.

For a younger person with no family commitments, that probably wouldn't be a problem. I have young children and crucially my wife works evenings. She works in healthcare and is relied upon by her clients. I simply cannot be expected to work late on demand.

The problem is that even though I explained this to each of my last three employers before signing the contract, and even though they acknowledged it - but refused to write it in to the contract - the inevitable happened. They asked me to work late on days I couldn't. This then resulted in the manager pulling me in for a chat about my commitment to the job, not being a team player etc.

Two weeks ago I was told by the CEO that I was not allowed to leave the office until a problem (not of my making) was fixed, not even for food as it would be ordered in. I stayed two hours late and then got up to leave as my wife had to go to work. The CEO actually tried to physically block my path, I pushed through explaining why I had no choice. I got an text later that evening saying my probationary period was being terminated, a taxi was then sent around to pickup my key card. They did give me a months gardening leave, but still it was a kick to the gut especially since a week earlier they gave me a drone (yep) as a thank you for cancelling a family weekend trip so that I could work over that weekend.

So basically I love coding, but I hate the fact the industry seems to be super stressful right now. I wan't to stay in IT, maybe moving sideways in to architecture, QA or project management - but I know plenty of people in those sorts of jobs who are experiencing the same problems as I have.

I don't particularly want to do contracting for financial reasons, and I don't have the selling skills to go self-employed. So I'm in a bit of a bind. Can any of the develeireians advise?",2019-06-18 13:03:05

1bd8x5y,Not responding to a slack ping while on lunch..,"I was the the point of contact for my team recently. I was about 25 minutes into my lunch, and I got pinged on slack regarding to an incident (the alias for my team got pinged - but I was the only one on it as I was the point of contact at the time). My manager then DM'd me about 15 minutes later asking if I saw the ping. I responded when I got back from my hour long lunch, and got a bit of stick for not replying when I was originally pinged. 

&#x200B;

* My company does not provide us with phones. I have slack installed on my personal phone but I have the notifications muted. 
* My slack status stated that I was on lunch
* My company has opsgenie and I'm set up there to receive pages 

&#x200B;

Considering the above points - I don't think I'm at fault here. I was taking my lunch which I'm legally entitled to, my slack status clearly said I was on lunch, and as far as I'm aware companies can't make me use slack on my personal device? Not to mention we have opsgenie in place - so realistically this should have been used if someone needed to contact me urgently. 

&#x200B;

Would love to hear some opinions on this.

1ai8l3c,Leave Mastercard for Microsoft given the current state of things?,"I'm currently in the interview process for Microsoft. Anyone have any insight into what the Entra Access team is like? Seems like the majority of the team are based on the West Coast, so the 8 hour time difference might be a pain. With a toddler,  my evenings are already pretty hectic!

I've been working in Mastercard since 2022. My org outside Dublin are mainly East Coast or India so collab time is never too much of an issue. The culture has changed substantially recently & morale is pretty low with RTO (edit: Return to Office) mandate, sensor tracking (edit: desk sensors, not biometrics), removing flex Friday's, layoffs (edit: outside Europe), etc.

So, any info about working in Microsoft would be great.

**Edit to add**: By 'current state of things', I mean the current market conditions in general. I don't want to put anyone off applying to MC. I've loved the majority of my time working in MC & have learned a huge amount. I posted this to try get some insight into the state of things/culture/work life balance etc. in MS. So please, don't let this put you off applying for roles in MC because you could love it! I think the widespread tech layoffs of the last couple of years have us all a bit more cautious when switching company.

**Final edit**: This post got far more engagement than I expected. MC are still more flexible than other companies that have 5 days in office RTO mandates. Unfortunately, some form of digital tracking of employees at the macro level is becomming increasingly common across industries now. I've heard of other companies that track individual key strokes to monitor performance or force employees to have their camera on at all times when WFH so a picture can be taken at set intervals to see that you're at your computer. Obviously, that wouldn't fly here.

Every company has pros & cons. Glassdoor is a great site to check employee reviews, so it's a matter of doing your research to see what company most aligns with your personal values when weighing up job offers. MC have great social committees that some people will love, particularly younger employees. It's still a good place to work & there's loads of opportunities to grow your career, as MC strongly support internal org moves & promotions. IMO the global communications to employees recently have been handled with less sensitivey than in the past. Thanks to the MSFT heads for replies.",2024-02-03 22:51:09

16pnslu,The legacy rainbow 🌈,"Many many OS iterations ago, when I was a whippersnapper, I met a wise old sage we'd flow in from Basel, Switzerland, to look at a legacy system on a Unix box. My job was to watch him like a hawk so we'd know what he'd done. I didn't understand it fully but I was a diligent observer and reasonable communicator so I was able to pass it on, up the chain of command.

Anyway, all this guy did was tweak a few lines of code. I was flabbergasted the company would pay stupid money for this on top of the air fare and 5* hotel around the corner.  

Naturally we got chatting and I found out he worked about 5 days in a busy month. I vowed, there and then, to be like him. To stick at what I was doing for long enough that nobody else could remember how to do it, to become that highly sought-after guy.

An entire career later and I'm still waiting. I may forget my children's names, or my mother's face but I'll never forget how to poke values into memory using Basic on a Vic20, or design a green screen app on an AS/400. Yet no calls are coming. Nobody seeks my layers of accumulated  knowledge. Half a lifetime has gone and the bat phone remains silent. 

I may be able to design and build a polished functional distributed app with all sorts of widgets and cloudyness but so can lots of others. It's the really old stuff I was hoping would   soften my golden years. The realisation that's never going to happen is disappointing, but not unexpected (life has only ever given me lemons).

16594jz,Irish Dev Jobs Sub,"https://www.reddit.com/r/IrishDevJobs/

As I said before I'm finishing the monthly jobs thread. To replace it I've created this associated sub. All jobs advertisements and job referrals are to go in there, I'll keep it pinned to the top of the sub till it gets a good few subscribers then probably migrate it to the sidebar at some point. 

Why -- I don't think I've been doing a good job and it's just work. Mod efforts are better focussed on things like Salary Surveys which are things the subscribers seem to appreciate much more. I don't think job ads as content are that interesting either hence why I want to keep them off /r/DevelEire or at least in one place but given our audience we're a hotspot for these posts. The mods are the same as here and I'm relaxing the rules requirement so even if you don't have a salary range you can post an ad though some rules will probably have to be implemented at some point. 

If any of the lads who had opinions on how the jobs thread should be run now or wanted their ideas taken onboard is a good time to put your hand up. I'll consider additional mods if you have new ideas and are determined to make it work.",2023-08-30 08:45:35

uvw4ar,Do I risk being fired?,"Hi guys,
I work as a Junior Software engineer for a US MNC in Dublin. Lately, there's a ticket that I have been struggling with, it has gone beyond  4 sprints. I was able to finish all the other tasks in the sprint. The Lead , the manager and the Scrum master looks frustrated at me. In the past I have done pretty well, with very few tickets going over to another sprint. It has led me to some anxiety, nobody  mentioned that they would fire me but I just can't shake off this feeling. I don't wanna leave this company due to my visa status atm, and also notice period is a month long and leaving due to just 1 ticket seems a bit childish to me. What are my options and do I risk being fired?

Edit: I have been working here for like an year. I have cleared my probation

Edit 2: for people asking me if I have asked for help.
Yes, I have.

And people did helped. Some people did try to help me get into the context of how could I do it. I'm trying it also but I feel like I need help at every stage of this. I can't seem to have even bit of independence while doing this task. I had moments of brain freeze where I didn't know what to do next. My communication skills aren't the best but they aren't worst either. Scrumaster hasn't flagged it yet. 

Also the ticket seems to be well groomed, it has clear criterias but the overall implementation is cumbersome, it cannot be broken down. Working on it parallely is not quite possible.

Edit 3: Thanks for all your support. I was finally able to finish that task after asking sm, lead and manager to setup a call between me and other teams to fast track it. It also led to discover a bug on their side, earlier the other team was very adamant on the bug being on our side as we were integrating the two platforms.",2022-05-23 09:12:42

In the last 2 years I've been at a few companies and it's been the worst time of my professional life. It might be the pandemic but the manager and co-workers have been incredibly nasty. Things have been said to me that no one would ever say to me in person. 

From managers I've noticed ridiculous targets set, gaslighting and contradictory statements. Stuff like being told to focus 100% on project A and then getting shouted out for not working on project B.

Then co-workers being very back stabbing. Minor mistakes being blown out of proportion and people seeking for someone to blame. People talking to your manger rather than coming directly to you. 

I'm very open to criticism and happy to discuss my performance. Also I have experience working in highly stressful places and situations. But again the last 2 years has been so much worse than anything I experienced before.

ng0xip,Taking a remote job based in another county,"I’ve just gotten an offer from a great company. People seem very happy working for them, the role and compensation are great, only thing is it’s based in another county. 

I’m living in Dublin and don’t have any immediate plans to move, and I’ve been told that full-time or part-time remote are both totally cool with them, even in the long term. Accepting would be a sure thing, but at this stage I’m worrying that working from home full time isn’t for me, and that I’d miss the option of getting to go into the office and see people.

A large part of my new team would be based in America, so there would be a remote aspect of the work either way. I’d also have the option of travelling a few hours to go to the office for meetings or events.

Suppose I just wanted to hear what people think. WFH is great in a lot of ways, and maybe the reason I don’t like it so much is that my current job is a bit shit and there isn’t much of a social life here, which I think might not be the case in the new place.

Anyone know about options for even short-term  stay extensions in situations like this? Are there  Irish job boards focused on employers desperate for talent who'll sponsor visas? Even referrals for good immigration lawyers could change his whole outlook right now.

I created a free [website](http://theranking.co/) that contains a database I’ve built with information on recently funded startups. On it, you can find the following information on each startup:

* Name
* Where it’s based
* Category
* Founder’s names and LinkedIn
* When it was founded
* A quick description
* Latest investment round
* Amount of money raised
* Links to investors involved in the latest funding round
* And most importantly, **a link to their job openings**.

I’m hoping this last point will make it a more useful resource for those interested in working in recently funded startups. Recent fundings usually translate into growing teams so expect almost all entries to have a link to their job listings. As a plus, a lot of new startups are open to **hiring remotely.**

In addition, I'm sending out a **free newsletter with a curated list of job openings** every Tuesday and Thursday. Make sure to subscribe on [TheRanking.co](https://theranking.co/).

j2jnt4,What is your preferred interview process?,"I think we all know the interview process in our industry is highly contested. Some think it is perfectly fine or a necessary evil, while others think we're made to jump through too many hoops to prove ourselves for roles.

So I'm interested in finding out what people on this subreddit would view as their preferred interview process for a role. I'd also like to ask you do try to keep it realistic. As much as we'd all like to probably just have a one hour interview that covers everything and doesn't involve us having to do any sort of technical questions, it's highly unlikely you'll find a process like that.

For example for me, going for ***mid level software developer*** role I would ideally like:

* Phone interview with a senior/lead dev on the team I'd be working for. No technical questions at this stage. It is purely for him to ask me questions about by CV and past work, and for me to ask questions about the role/team/company. I tend to ask *a lot* questions here, so it's important for me to have this, as I can usually decide from this whether I want to go to the next stage or not. Max 1 hour in length.
* Some sort of take home technical problem to solve. I hate those leetcode/hacker rank style algorithm questions you have to solve in 15-30 minutes, so I actually prefer if they give you one to do in your own time that involves you having to demonstrate design and good practices, and most importantly allows me to Google during it. I know a lot of people who don't like this style of problem, but I find I write much better code/solutions over having 30 mins to solve a leetcode problem and having to constantly explain myself out loud to the interviewer. Max 2-3 hours in length.
* Final onsite interview to meet manager/team and ask any final questions. Maybe go through solution to problem solved in stage 2, but no other sort of technical challenges to be done. Max 1-2 hour in length, usually depending on how many questions I still have outstanding about the role.",2020-09-30 10:31:13

Would love to get some opinions on this. 

I'm currently working in a high growth tech company (300- 500 employees), not dev role. I've been there for only few months. It's a very challenging job by its nature and the base salary is pretty good. It was very stressful at the beginning and I had to take some meds to keep sane. It's been much better after the medicine but I just got another job offer from a very large company (10k+ employees), lower title with lower base - 15% less, although with the shares total package would be pretty much the same. 

I want to take a little mental break from the stress in the past three years but also feel like if this is a setback career wise. 

What would you do in my situation?

Cheers

Edit: Thanks for the advice, really appreciate them. On the medicating side, just to add I don't think the job itself is bad, more of a personal preference. I've had some big life changes in the past three years and one of them caused depression and I took med for a year 2021-2022. Maybe because of all that I tend to feel stressed more easily than other people. And unfortunately this job requires more stress management, nothing toxic in the environment. So moving into a large company I'd hope the pace is slower and expectation more realistic, their reputation is very good. ",2023-12-26 12:15:39

- we create all the user stories,

- We demo new functionalities and listen to feedback to improve behaviour 
- Manage workload for the team and then report that to the upper management 

The scrum master / PO (this particular guy has merged the two titles into one) which isn’t even agile but enough on that 
- Incessantly harps on about excel documentation that is outdated the second it’s written as opposed to confluence 

- Constantly pings about remembering to write the user stories. But doesn’t do it himself or does it with the barest possible detail. 

- For some reason documents the real definition of the user stories in excel and doesn’t transcribe the info over. The real JIRA is on Excel. 

- Can’t write a line of code or doesn’t understand code at all. Doesn’t understand anything technical and his main line is (“for a dummy like me” or “or for someone non technical”).

- Contribute flat out wrong or incorrect assumptions and generally monopolize time better spent being productive. I’ve seen 30 minute meetings become 2 hour discussions on inane bullshit. 

- Is the walking definition of meetings that could have been an email.

To me all they do is have constantly have meetings or do some stuff in PI planning and constantly annoy on you teams. In my case it’s a time sink.

xhmfqn,San Francisco or stay in Ireland?,"Throwaway for privacy reasons.

&#x200B;

I am considering moving to San Francisco (am a US citizen) but unsure wether it would be worth it.

I earn €160k working remotely for a US company in Ireland. My total expenses are about €1200 per month. I am under 30 and have no kids.

Even with the money I am making here I feel that the housing is a disaster (quantity & quality) and that setting down here could be a mistake, the quality of life would be better in California.

I can move to San Francisco and keep the job (get paid in the USD equivalent) which would be good for the short term but ideally my sights would be on big tech and landing something close to the $300k at least.

Maybe it's a product of how far I've come professionally, that places hiring for my job title tend to be mature/stable/conservative.

In saying this I'm aware that I'm happy with my income so that possibly makes me hard to inspire.

I just can't remember the last time I looked at a company/office in Ireland and thought ""that's cool, how do I get in there?"". And all the tech hype just seems to make the contrast with what a boring industry it actually is even worse.

I'm probably just getting old. What does everyone else have as qualities that get them interested in an employer?",2023-04-24 07:58:29
11okez7,"Looks like my sister is being put on a Personal Improvement Plan, and wondering whats the best course of action to take.","Hi all

My sister is having a bit of trouble in her job. She started a graduate position around 7-8 months ago in July. She started off fine, gave her the opportunity to gain some certifications and was going well in those first few months. Then, she was assigned to a team and further induction to the work would take place to help mentor her along the way and get her started on her experience.

Except that didn't really happen. The months after she completed her certifications, she was pretty much told to do self learning material such as watch youtube and linked in learning videos on the subject. She wasn't provided any work to do or the mentorship guidance that was outlined as part of the graduate program. She'd get the odd piece of something to do here and there, but nothing long and definitely she was left to do it on her own with little to no supervision. They keep saying work is coming down the pipeline, but nothing really comes down in the first few months.

Eventually 6 months role by and she passes probation. And eventually she gets put onto a project by herself. However, she is given little guidance on what is the end result of this project and how to go about doing it. She carries on as best she can, but ultimately the work is not up to the mark. Her managers are very upset about this, and ask what they can do to remedy the situation. She proposes the mentorship and induction training she should have received, but they say they have a busy workload and expect results from her at this stage in her employment.

They mentioned the discussion of being put on a personal improvement plan, which is to be agreed upon. Honestly, to me, sounds like she's done all she's could with the opportunity she's got and has a feeling that this improvement plan won't remedy much at all. Matter of fact it just feels like justification for dismissal, as they just don't seem that interested in providing much further training or development to help get her where they think she should be.

My main question here is: is it better for her to just give notice wishing to end employment and be able to say that she resigned of her own accord when asked, or should she stick out the PIP, and have them ultimately dismiss her. I feel that may be a worse option as if future employers were to reach out, it would not look good.",2023-03-11 13:37:58

tybz0z,I'm in a team and I have a dilemma.,"I'm working in a team. I am the unsung  ""team lead"".
I'm also a junior ~3 yoe.

In the team we have 6 devs 2 of which are just not making the cut.

One has spent an entire sprint writing 4 tests. 


The other is a copy and paste dev. We work  converting legacy apps to newer frameworks. This lad basically extracts the legacy code and dumps it in to the new backend. If there's any change to business requirements he can't refactor the code to meet the new acceptance criteria. Add that to the amount of bugs and code smells he has introduced into the codebase by using garbage code from SO. The other day he asked me to help him write tests for the code he had just written. 



I couldn't believe this. This individual is working as a full stack dev for 2 years. He needs more support than the interns as a whole. I actually see him stagnating very quickly. 


I do realise it's on me too because at the start we hadn't good review standards. 


The thing is they  are a  liability and they pull out good devs down and stress them. We are finishing this project and moving on and they are pressuring managers to keep the team together. I don't want this really I'd like to keep the guys that work well together but I don't know how to say this to management in a way that doesn't make them look bad or me look bad. 

It's a real dilemma as I am not a malevolent person but I feel these people need to put out of their comfort zone. 

Managers don't really get involved in the day to day stuff because Im pretty good at driving projects. When the manager questions inconsistencies I can give good explanations but there has to be a cutoff point where you have to call out someone. It's been a 18 months and I think I need to do this. 

Any thoughts would be gratefully appreciated from experienced leads, seniors and managers.",2022-04-07 12:28:01
sr643p,Moving to the US from Ireland,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

Basically, I work for FAANG and to be honest I am sick of the cost of living in Dublin, I feel like the place is so expensive with not much return. I honestly feel like this country is really not attractive to young people in its current state and so I am looking to move abroad in the future.

&#x200B;

I can see that most engineers at the same level as me would have nearly 2-3x the TC as myself just for being in the US. Now I understand that things are more expensive like healthcare etc as well as having less sick/holiday days, but surely being on 120-150k more just for being based in the states could greatly outweigh the negatives of being there? From a purely financial point of view, I am thinking that any money now could greatly snowball and benefit me in the future through the use of investments and interest etc even if it's just for a few years. I am thinking of internally transferring to the US by the end of the year but I would like some thoughts and opinions from people who were/have been in this situation as right now I am quite lost and not sure what to strive for.

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance",2022-02-13 01:01:09

jc6kle,A note to those looking for work,"I've noticed a few threads and comments from people struggling to find work and getting worried about it and wanted to share some thoughts.

&#x200B;

**You never know what is going on in the company behind the job spec**

I've worked in companies where it has taken months to get approval to post a job online. As a result, the team's needs had changed from the time a dev manager wrote the job spec to when people started applying. Here are three scenarios that actually happened that somebody from the outside would never know:

1: An intermediate developer moved teams, then 2 weeks before the job spec got approved, a senior developer handed in her notice. Now the recruiters and interviewers were told we need someone senior - totally unfair on those who were applying, but that's how it worked.

2: A senior developer left, and in the time before their job got posted, an intermediate developer was promoted to senior. Now the team budget could only afford an intermediate developer, but the job spec was for senior.

3: We had three applicants who passed the interview for a single role. The engineering managers talked internally and all three ended up with offers, but two of them received offers for positions on different teams.

&#x200B;

The reason I rambled on with those examples is that you can never know what's going on internally from a job spec so don't take it personally if you are not chosen for interview/the job. The best advice I got was to find a tech stack you are interested in (be realistic here too, don't go too niche as there won't be enough jobs) and apply to every job you can find that looks for those skills. Don't be afraid to go for jobs that ask for more experience than you have (within reason!) - the recruiters will reject you if you don't have enough experience, but I think you'll be surprised how often you won't be rejected.

&#x200B;

It's very stressful to be looking for a job while unemployed so again, don't take it to heart if you're not chosen for a job. There are too many factors involved that are out of your control. Ask for feedback and ask for help here if you're having no luck.",2020-10-16 09:05:43

8ycfme,Hiring is broken,"<rant>

Few similar threads on here lately. But hiring in development roles is so badly broken that I feel like I'm going mad.

I just went through a huge hiring process with a company that I'd love to join. I thought I aced it, was pretty sure I had the job (after loads of phone calls, a take home test that took days of work and a half day face to face). Turns out I don't have enough experience even though I done well at every stage and answered every question that was thrown at me.

Everything is broken. I've seen so many bad hires, people that talk the talk in the interview and can't code at all. I'm not a very confident person but I know I was good enough for this role but noooope.

I genuinely don't have the time to spend days of work for every company I apply for.

I actually feel like quitting my job and trying to somehow fix this mess somehow. There has to be a better way to find devs.

I'm not actively job hunting at the moment, but something curious has caught my attention and I'm wondering if it's just me or a wider trend. In the past, I used to receive around three messages a week from recruiters on platforms like LinkedIn, offering new opportunities or just looking to connect. However, this year, there's been a noticeable drop-off to the point where I'm not receiving any such messages at all.

I haven't made any significant changes to my profile or job status that would explain this sudden silence. Given that I'm not currently looking for a job, it's not a pressing issue for me, but it's sparked my curiosity about the state of the job market. Are companies hiring less, or perhaps changing their recruitment strategies? Or maybe it's just a shift in how recruiters are reaching out to potential candidates?

I'd love to hear from others in this community. Have you experienced a similar decrease in recruiter outreach this year? Or, if you're on the other side of the equation working in recruitment or HR, have there been changes in your approach to finding candidates?

uhi1a2,"Someone picked a framework for me to work on, but I don't know the framework and don't know what to do.","So, I'm a senior dev. At least on paper. And only because, when looking for a job, calling yourself semi senior is the same as calling yourself, graduate with no experience. But I can build anything using Vue or React, so there's that. Two months ago I changed countries, so I started on a new company. What they didn't say during the interview, was that I would be working with .net 6 and C# (when I asked what technologies they used, they said ""oh, we use many frameworks"", which they do, but they failed to mention the one I would be using). I have no experience with either of them and whoever made the choice of using those, disappeared. 

Now I'm the only frontend developer and my project is absolutely fucked, because I don't know how to do some things, and since .net 6 is so new, nobody has the experience to help me out.

I know this is not on me. I feel like management knew what they were doing when they hired someone with no experience to work on a project that was already behind when I joined. What I want to know is what do I do now, because quitting is not an option until I get my residence :(

I watched as he struggled through Scratch to Gamemaker to Unity and now Godot.

We have a lovely workflow now where he codes forwards with some spaghetti code and I like the dutiful father I clean up after him with some refactors. Each time he looks at my new code his code improves moving forward needing less refactoring.

We are pretty much on even footing now which is amazing to me since I started coding at 18 and he's only 12 :P.

He is even doing better at marketing than I am with a YouTube channel and devlogs (All monitored by me of course) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP9PSVg0kdo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP9PSVg0kdo)

So right after the call, I was locked out of all work email/vpn etc.

They informed me I would be paid for the rest of my notice period.

My brother says that this counts as dismissal, as Im still employed for my notice period, and I was effictively just fired without notice or warning, and that this could look bad for me in the future. Is there anything to this? Can a company let you go at any time during the notice period?

Ive emailed them and got an almost immediate call back to clarify that its not dismissal for any reason, but they are allowing me to effictively stop working for them from now, and they will pay me to the end of my notice period.

Happy Christmas. I'm hoping some of the folks here can offer some advice. 

I'm a technical director at an agency in Dublin. The company has been doing really well after an initial covid slump. We're essentially on target.

We have never been busier, but the company won't give anyone pay rises. This is causing huge issues with staff retention and especially brain drain. We have lost 10 developers since the summer and our struggling to replace them.

We had developers making 10-15K below market rate, and because it woukd have been a huge % increase, the MD told me ""I don't care what the market rate is, they are getting no more money"". Obviously this is an issue.

One of the guys who left doubled his salary. A couple left without new jobs lines up because they thought it was worth their while to be unemployed and study for interviews. (It was, the got into great companies).

We are swamped with projects, not enough resources to deliver, some people have rejected offers to join because of the salary. Our MD expects the other developers to pick up the slack, but they won't (again due to money).

This is causing me great stress, as it's impossible to get anything done without developers. I'm honestly tempted to look for something similar myself.

Any advice?",2020-12-18 21:46:04

1au4sej,Zero motivation,"Hi all. Don't really know what I want to say here or how to say it, and it's quite embarrassing so I'll just go for it. I guess I'm just looking for some advice. Basically, I started working in tech as a QA almost 2 years ago, and I have done absolutely fuck all. I have been a complete lazy shite. I don't know how I've gotten away with it. It's terrible. I honestly think I have done only about 6 months actual work in the 2 years since I got into tech. One of the reasons I have done so little is because I have been waiting to be assigned a project for about 6 months of that time, so they are waiting for a suitable position to arise to assign to me. But during that time, I am expected to be upskilling but no one actually checks to if I am or not. I have had a lot of changes in my life recently so I won't be completely harsh on myself but I should be upskilling and learning new technologies. I just have zero motivation to actually do the work. When I am working on a project, what I know I do well in, but I really amn't skilled enough to do the job completely, but I just need to learn how to do it, but I won't. An example would be API testing. I should just learn how to do it, it would open many doors and increase my salary. This isn't to mention, I don't even want to be a tester, I actually want to be a dev, I know I have the aptitude but I don't know if I have the grit or interest. I'm actually at the point now that I'm thinking of switching careers because I don't know if I have it in me. I'm also worried I'm going to get found out and will be let go if there is layoffs. Has anyone else gone through anything similar or can relate? If so, have you any advice?",2024-02-18 21:03:42

So I work in a field closely related to software development.

uneo87,Need some advice please or maybe the hard cold truth.,"So almost a year ago I started a course with Code Institute in the UK with the hopes to change my career. I'm in my 30s and always had low skilled paid jobs. Throughout my life I was always around computers and tech, I'm a hands on guy a bit of a engineer out the box thinker. I messed around in my free time with HTML and CSS and enjoyed it so after a while I said what the hell let's do this Full Stack Developer 1 year course made of HTML CSS JavaScript Python SQL Bootstrap Django etc.

 Hardest thing I've ever done. The course itself is fast paced and runs quickly with every module. I'm on my last project 5 out of 5 and it's the hardest one involving the usage of all of the above.

This is the thing, I can't code to save my life. Like honestly I can barely write down a for/while loop in JS or python and these projects to me a very complex and looks like alien technology. I can read and understand code but I can't create it myself. 

Today I had a meltdown when I was trying to change the background color of my base page of my project and it wasn't working throwing a not found error in the terminal. Took me 3hours to realise I had forgotten to setup STATIC in my settings.py file of the main project. My navigation bar is not doing what I want it to do and honestly I'm loosing it. 

I saw other student's projects and they look amazing, you'd think they are lifetime coders but their are not they are just like me trying to improve themselves and never did this before.

How did I pass the other projects? Let's face it HTML  and CSS is Mickey Mouse stuff, but the other projects involving Python and JavaScript I have essentially copied codes from YouTube, StackOverflow and the internet in general and put it all together to make it work. But if you ask me to do it again tomorrow without those resources I wouldn't be able to do it. I spent almost every day trying to learn from 1h to 3h a day. I watch 'how to' tutorials to understand better but it's just not sticking.

I saw some interview examples on YouTube for Junior Devs and they look terrifying. 

I on honesty think this experience has pushed me away from coding, I think it showed me that I'm not so clever after all and perhaps that I spent £7000 for an ""experience"" only.

Does anyone else feelt this way or is it just me? I can take a criticism.",2022-05-11 17:06:31

tbtg6m,Interview process,"Previously posted here and I'm thinking about applying for a few  jobs. I've been a dev for 19 years. Currently a lead, thinking about maybe dropping back to senior. I'm aware this may be questioned by interviewers which is fine. I haven't done an interview in 15 years so I am well out of touch with what goes on.

The thought of being watched code a solution or whatever is rather daunting. I find at times during development that my mind could go blank, I can easily find an answer to whatever slipped my mind in a few minutes but it could be a very basic thing. There could be other things that I could easily code in a verbose manner but I know there would be a better way, for example something using apache commons or whatever, so I'd do a quick google there also. To someone watching, that may make you look incompetent but I don't view it as such. Its more of a ""refresh my memory"" instead of a ""how the hell do I do this!""

A lot of interviews seem very long winded these days too from what I hear. At times I wonder how I'd make it through one!

I'd heard someone say before that the best time to do interviews was when you don't necessarily need to get the job. I'm at the stage where I'm not exactly looking for an exit at my current company but if a better offer came out of an interview, I'd likely take it. For example, if I managed to get a similar compensation package for a senior role as what I currently get for a lead I'd take it, along with maybe fully remote or a good hybrid approach. From looking around and comments on here, there are senior roles which actually pay slightly more than I get as a lead.

Taking into account starting salaries etc and rent/cost of living prices in Dublin it seems almost counterintuitive to not desire a remote roll. A young person myself could actually have tangible savings while also increasing pay grade etc as expertise increases.
But in the long term once this covid crisis becomes a distant memory, will companies stick to there promises when giving out remote rolls or will a slow push for in-office work start again.

The battle of remote vs in office is already in full motion and I’m worried that I could almost be discriminated against for having a remote roll when others in my team may be in office.

I got through first stage of interview (which was resume screening) almost 90% of time by tailoring/editing/tuning resume according to the job requirements(priority) and cover letter according to the job specification. I got selected but due to COVID-19 , all my offers were canceled.

I lost all the hope but I kept on trying. One day, I went to contact us page of each small to medium company that could hire a computer science student. I got the email address of every company which were of format info@, career@, etc. Then I drafted a email which was of format ""General introduction ▶️ project worked on ▶️ skills ▶️ soft skills ▶️ ""I have attached my cv(general) I am looking forward to be hearing from you."" ▶️ attach cv.""

After few weeks I got a call from the company. There was a simple interview regarding my current internship and my past projects. Afterwards, they reviewed my LinkedIn, GitHub and I got the job offer the very next day.

That's how i got the job of a web developer of a salary under 27k. Currently I am enjoying the work but I hope to switch job and move to a job with better salary. If you have any questions, DM me.",2021-03-25 08:50:49

ilx0cf,Struggling to adjust to remote working as a graduate.,"Hi all,

I’m a few months into my graduate job and I’m not too sure whether I’m settling in as expected, or whether I’m falling behind quickly. I’ve had two internships as an undergraduate; one being a summer one, and the other being a longer 6 month internship, so I’d like to think I had an idea of what to expect in terms of work when starting the graduate job. 

The work itself has been manageable to an extent. It’s a mixture of Python and JS, both of which I’m comfortable with so there’s not many problems on the language side of things. The main issues arise with understanding the code base and understanding how to approach the problems. While this was also a struggle in previous internships, I had managed to overcome this by sitting with my coworkers, and feeling comfortable turning to them and asking “Hey, could you quickly explain this?”. In my new job and team it’s quite often that I can go the whole day without speaking to anybody if I don’t ask for help. While I do make sure to ask for help when I need it, it almost feels like I’m bothering people because I don’t really know them, and being WFH, I haven’t gotten a chance to get to know them. 

Has anybody else found this aspect of remote working a struggle? How should I approach it with my manager? I don’t expect any companies to really have a solid plan in place for on-boarding remote graduates, but I don’t want to end up not passing probation because I couldn’t adjust to working from home and letting my productivity slack.",2020-09-03 16:40:00

16xx6xw,Rant post - Loathe my job and the people I work with,"2 years in the industry, a little over a year in my current role. In that time I have unlearned much of what I knew leaving college. 

The work is simple and repetitive. The tech is abstracted by in-house tools that will never be useful in another company. 

Teammates seem happy doing these basic tasks without thought of how they can be improved. 

Little care given to doing things sustainably or with care. Can't learn from seniors or leads. 

Scrum masters are utterly clueless which results in confusion and disorganisation among the team. 

Manager doesn't respect employees time. Doesn't turn up to 1:1s with no notice given. Makes promises that don't materialise. 

Work culture fosters long days and last minute decisions that are expected to be done immediately. 

Actively looking for roles but it feels like an uphill battle considering I have essentially no transferable skills from this role.

Banks have now decided that if your in any IT related industry that your high risk and have to show ""proof of job security / sustainability"".

yczpp4,How soon is too soon to leave your first job?,"I've been working as a software engineer in a company for a couple of months as part of their 18 month graduate program. While the people are nice and the pay is fine, the work is absolutely mind numbing and it's in an area I really couldn't care less about. I only took the job because I interned here in third year and they offered me a job when I finished college. I should have looked for other jobs at the time but was too busy with trying to pass fourth year.

I'm wondering how soon is too soon to leave? If I start interviewing at other companies will it look bad that I've left my previous job so quickly? Would that make it seem like I'm unwilling to stay in one place for too long? Would it be more reasonable to stay for 6 months and then go? Or maybe a whole year?

mxudb0,"Dilemma: Stay at current job, or move.","Hi

I'm going with a throwaway for this as I would probably be doxed if I used my main account. I know the devs in my company are on here.

I've been dissatisfied at my current job for a number of years now. I'm not paid market rates, I don't enjoy my job, I don't feel like I have a lot in common with the people there. (Mostly has people who are 10 - 15 years older than I am.).

I was going to move last year, but Covid stopped me. I needed security as I have a young family to support. Tech seems to be roaring again, and I have good savings built up now that I can take the risk of a move not working out. I've been interviewing this year, and I think I found the right fit. I accepted an offer at a company and should be starting in a few months.

I resigned two months ago and things were going fine until my manager decided that he needs me and beat the offer from the new company. Now it's only a few grand more, but he beat it none the less.

I have an awful dilemma now:

1. Stay at my current job, on a vastly improved salary, not enjoying the work but I have security as I don't have probation. I don't have much in common with the people, but my manager is a gent and I feel loyal to him.
2. Move to my new company, which offers a vastly superior modern tech stack, which will open up further better paying opportunities. It's slightly less money, but nothing major. Net pay it's even lower in the difference.

My one gripe with staying is that I asked for a raise to what the new company is paying me at the start of the year, the owner said now as it would break the wage structure, and he doesn't hand out huge percentage increases like that, however now that the time is coming that I'm leaving, suddenly they found the money.

I had to go through a 4 stage interview process with this company, and multiple other companies to find something I liked because they wouldn't pay me what I'm worth. I honestly believe they didn't think I would look to move on, and I would just accept it.

Realistically, I know I should leave. But my manager has done a lot for me, he's great. The owner is just a dick.",2021-04-24 22:16:02

kzy8js,I have 192 days within which to find a job in Ireland... would appreciate any advice.,"Hullo!

&#x200B;

Wife, two dogs and myself are moving from South Africa to Ireland at the end of April 2021! It's been our dream forever and we just now, in our 30's, realized that there's some truth to: ""there's no time like the present""

As peachy as that sentiment is, it doesn't take into account that if I don't find employment within 90 days of arriving in Ireland (under EU Treaty Rights, I'm Polish born but South African raised), matters get quite complicated for us.

We're quite anxious people, and given the magnitude of what we're doing, saying that we're freaking out is an understatement.

&#x200B;

Some details:

* Wife isn't planning  on working right away (she needs a loooong holiday after what she went through plus we're starting a family).
* We have enough savings to keep us going for 1-2 years, but not enough to prove sufficient resources for 5 years which would be another path for her permanent residency.
* My background:
   * Got BCom Degree Hons (Human Resource) in 2010. It was a terrible personality mismatch and I was very unhappy. Worked for about 3 years in corporate HR, thereafter have been working as  a Teaching Assistant at a Universtiy in the HR Faculty
   * Obtained a BSc Computer Science in 2020, but don't have any formal work experience.
   * The closest thing to actual work experience is I have is I spent a few weeks developing a prototype application for a small company - they really liked it, and then their business went kaput. The rest of my time was spent doing courses on Udemy, etc., and building applications to automate workflows for my wife and her team (mainly just looking for ways to reduce their reliance on MS Excel).
   * My main skills lie in Python (particularly the Django stack and rest framework), C# (I've made a few small games in Unity) and C++ (with Qt it was the backbone of my CS Degree). A bit of HTML, CSS and JS, SQL and MongoDB I can also put on my CV, as I feel fairly certain I can build most things with those technologies, given enough time on Google/Stackoverflow. I'm busy learning Vue.js at the moment and building demo applications with a Django rest API backend.

&#x200B;

I've been struggling to find work as a developer in South Africa, for reasons beyond just a bad job market, economy and pandemic. I've been applying for work in Ireland, but my applications keep getting rejected because I'm not in Ireland.

&#x200B;

**Does anyone have any advice, opinions or insights on what I can do between now and the end of July in order to secure employment, especially as a software developer?** 

Anyone willing to share what the situation is like over there at the moment, and what stands out to employers? What to emphasize, and what to avoid?

The pandemic makes things a lot more difficult, I know, but I'm determined to make it work! From outside the country, it's very difficult to gauge the situation in Ireland and I don't really know what to expect when I land. We wouldn't mind heading over to the western side of Ireland - maybe Mayo, Donegal or Galway, but obviously not ruling anything out.

I'm not sure I really care too much, but I don't think I can just turn around and say that to them.

The stuff they're asking includes reading lots of tech books, gaining deep knowledge on an area as well as spending my free time learning as much as I can broadly about software as possible.

I think he's the kind of person that really lives and breathes programming.
He's also saying I need to ""make a name for myself"" in the company.

I've always had very autonomous jobs in the past, prev managers trusted me to do the work and it was done.

I've been at this company since December, she's stuck in her ways, has a certain management style and that's it type of view. Even seemed to be proud of it telling me a story before that she once met with a prev worker 3 times a day until something was done, because they started to fall back on one thing before. 

I've already told her the way I like to be managed which is if I need something that I'll reach out to her and keep the lines of comms opened.

Problem is she has to know a status update on everything that I'm working on pretty much every second day, even though I keep my work tracker which she can see up to date every day. 

She will drop me sudden messages wanting to talk on a daily basis, pretty sure she's doing this to check I'm at my computer.
Another team asked for some support and I felt I had capacity so I would help, I got briefed on their project which wouldn't take me any longer than 2 hours of my week to do. And she says that I shouldnt do that and I need to pass it by her first. Very frustrating when it's my workload that I know I can help out on.

1agf4t8,Unpaid on-call,"Hello everyone,

I've noticed a few discussions around on-call work obligations, and now I'm facing a situation that calls for some advice. My employer in Dublin is mandating that we are available on-call for a full week, and we are only compensated via time in lieu if an incident occurs. From what was explained with my manager, is that it is outlined in our contracts. 

However, the contract language is quite vague and doesn't explicitly detail the nature of the on-call work or any associated compensation structure. The paragraph was primarily for occasional overtime, such as attending meetings in a different time-zone.

I'm considering consulting with an employment lawyer to gain clarity on my rights in this situation and potentially take action. Before I do, I wanted to reach out to the community here. Has anyone been in a similar position? If you sought legal advice, what was your experience like, and what was the outcome?

Can you recommend any lawyer/firm that specializes in these kind of situations?

Thanks!",2024-02-01 16:34:57

Half my town has emigrated to Perth, Austrailia to do construction work. I would be tempted to go there myself because that's where my friends are but while it's a very good place to be if you are in contruction it might not be so good for software jobs.

One of the reasons I would like to emigrate is because investing in anything other that buying up houses to rent seems to be a waste of time in Ireland. I like to be able to put money into something like the S&P 500 and forget about it.

I'm looking for; a lively city, good earning potential, less depressing weather, potential path to citizenship and a way of building wealth that doesn't require me to become a landlord. (I know I'm asking for quite a bit there :) )

Now with the 15% global corp tax it seems that the credit will be scrapped which means companies might like to spread a bit in other European countries since there’s no big reason to keep everyone in Ireland.

My recent project I started mid last year, is interesting but there is a lot of non-coding work involved which is draining me. We have a decent team of developers. I get on well with all of them. A few are top developers and if I’m being honest I have imposter syndrome a lot. 

Agile methodology is also draining the life out of me. Constant refinements, arguments over features and stories not being done up right. We’ve just started SAFe this year and that’s a pain too. 

I love coding. I like working with other developers. I like coming up with new ideas. But at the moment I am not enjoying my job. I’ve thought about leaving but the fear of interviews as a result of the aforementioned imposter syndrome is putting me off.

10zucss,Looking for some advice about how to deal with a difficult senior,"Hi all, 
hopefully, someone could give me some advice about how to deal with a difficult colleague. I'm pretty sure I'm not at fault but at the same time don't want to start making a fuss given all the layoffs in the sector recently. I'm fairly new to working in tech (I believe the role is irrelevant), less than one year, and this person has ALOT of experience. 

Technically he isn't my manager but he acts as one to me and the team. I don't know why he isn't my manager, it would make logical sense for him to be. I'm a bit older than your average graduate and am now a permanent employee so expect to be treated as such by colleagues. The problem is is that I'm not particularly great at the job yet as I'm very much still learning which I expected and I believe is normal - there are others on the team who I seem to be doing more work than and am more proactive than so I don't know why I'm getting the treatment I am from this person. 

I will go into a little detail about how I am being treated. If I have done a task incorrectly, he will let out a huge over the top sigh and say something like that is a fail - something which I think is so unprofessional and unnecessary, when he could just say it needs to be done a different way. He would also ask me to do tasks that he knows I cannot do yet given my experience, even after me saying to him that it's impossible for me to do what he asks he persists, I think ""wtf is this guy's problem"".

His feedback often seems very harsh and I feel he just has a personal problem with me. Can someone give me some advice as what to do as I'm really at the end of my tether with this cunt.",2023-02-11 18:30:43

So can I ask to question to more senior people out there. What are your expectations of a Junior Engineer? 

I currently have just under 1 YOE and was interviewing for a new role as I dont feel like I'm progressing much in my current role.

The position I applied for had no experience requirements and vary broad skill requirements. 

Throughout the interview I was asked about my experience with Kubernetes ( No mention of past experience on my CV or in job description ). Very detailed and specific questions about AWS (Again no mention of it on my CV or in job description). How to set up CI/CD pipelines and what seemed to me like advanced system design questions. 

I left the interview feeling pretty deflated about both my skills and experience afterwards and after speaking to some of my peers who work in a broad range of companies. None of them had ever been asked questions of this calibre. 

I was expecting some basic whiteboarding questions, questions about APIs, OOP fundamentals and DS and Algorithm stuff. None of which was really touched on for more than a minute or two. 

Am I underdeveloped for the roles I am currently applying for or was the company's expectations of a junior developer way above board?

jdh6nh,Contract expiring - Company won't even talk about money,"I'm on a fixed term contract with a company in Dublin (I was with this company for 11 months, and then when Covid struck I got an offer of a 6 month FTC or I was out of a job). It's not ideal, but it was better than facing unemployment.

The contract is expiring in the next few weeks, and I want a pay rise. The company wont even talk about it despite reversing all Covid measures last month as business was flying again. I got the offer of a permanent contract with the same terms. I'm not sure what I should do. I figure I have two options.

1) - Sign the contract, keep money coming in for the rest of the year and start looking again after Christmas.

2) - Reject the contract, and start looking for a new job now. I might be in a position to start a new job in the new year.

Option 1 sounds better, but I'm not exactly fond of the work that I'm doing. It doesn't really excite me. I don't mind leaving, but losing Decembers salary, along with the Christmas bonus by not signing a contract might be insane.

Should I stay and just finish out the year?",2020-10-18 14:25:17

1anb9c9,Why so many companies are not looking for QA/Test roles any more?,"I started to look how market looks and I wanted to test myself.... 

I go to company website and there could be 5-10 various software roles, but not a single QA/test.

To be honest I see this trend for years and it looks it is getting more popular.



Is that it? no one believes in quality focused people any more?
I have mixed feelings about pure QA team separated from devs but I know how bad testing can be with devs only teams as well.. lets just say I saw both in good/bad implementations. 


From recent experience at work or with external products I see huge issues with quality everywhere, yet companies seems to cut QA budgets more and more. 

All good managers I knew understood that there is different kind of testing done by dev vs QA. Lets just say I was fixing few dev test envs which were not really looking to find issues hard ;)

Although recently I hear more bs from some devs or PMs that testing got no value, then obviously we see stuff like planes falling in extreme case we all read in news. Software gets more and more complex, but I see much less quality focus from top which corresponds to less $$$ and worse quality at the end.



Am I the only one who see this?",2024-02-10 07:56:03
1am8dpk,Feedback from manager is overwhelming,"Hey everyone,

I’m almost a year into a role as a software engineer and most of the role has been going well: working on interesting projects, enjoying the company and office life, most of the people I’m working with are sound and I feel like I’m making progress.

One issue that is getting to me though, and currently reaching a boiling point is the feedback I’m getting and relationship that I have with my manager. He will review my code and (in my opinion) nitpick issues with it and hold me to a really high bar whilst not holding other members of the team to the same standard. His criticisms also extend beyond code review and he will berate me on slack or in meetings. Every opinion or statement or question I have is met with beratement and belittling. Initially I put this down to cultural differences or just his style, but now after observing how he behaves with other team members, it feels really pointed towards me. For example there was a bug discovered in our codebase during the week and at first he was saying that it’s really embarrassing and a bad look for our team and felt like he was assuming that I caused the issue. But after I made it clear that I hadn’t worked on this part of the codebase and that it was likely an oversight of someone else on the team, he toned down his comments and was less harsh.

I certainly respect that he is a talented and experienced engineer, and I want to learn from him, but it’s gotten to the point where I don’t feel comfortable anymore with presenting my work or expressing myself out of fear of his comments and attitude. It feels like nothing is good enough that I do for his standards. Meanwhile other senior engineers have worse practices or standards and he lets it slip by. There’s also the issue where I receive conflicting feedback from him and other senior members of the team, and it ends up being a back and forth on my PRs where it just feels like a circle jerk of engineers wanting their own opinions to be the new shiny best practices. 

I might be projecting or making wild assumptions, but it feels like there’s an element of jealousy at play, or maybe some form of putting me in my place as a junior member of the team. I really feel myself longing to have a manager that is a “partner” in my development rather than someone for him to shit on and punch down on. 

I really feel like there has been a breakdown in the relationship and I don’t even have the capacity to take on board the constructive sides of his feedback because of the way in which it’s delivered.

It’s a struggle for me because I want to address this and work through it and avoid running away from the issue, but I can’t quite figure out how to approach the situation. Anyone have any advice on how to approach this, and indeed where to draw the line between fighting against it and just looking elsewhere for greener pastures?",2024-02-08 22:36:03

16pt7g0,I gift wrapped a job but my mates are too anxious/discouraged to apply,"Hi folks, 

My mates are in jobs they hate. All in and around the IT/Development sector, but they don't like the work they're doing or the people they're working with/for and a slew of other complaints. And frankly, their complaints are all valid. 

Now, I'm in a cushty enough gig at the moment. And I've explained it to them and they're all fairly jealous. But I've always changed jobs every few years, until I found a cushty enough gig.

So I went digging around in the company's internal recruitment to see what's coming down the pipeline and low and behold, in a few weeks there's going to be jobs posted that match their CVs almost perfectly. 

So I let them know and almost immediately the group chat goes wild. Not with excitement at the prospect of getting referred in, but a deep analysis on why each and every one of them don't match the requirements. I've never seen such a long list of deep seated personally observed flaws in all my life. 

The job listing read as follows... 

---
The Ideal Candidates Would Have... 
1.... 
2....
---

Followed by a paragraph which stated, unequivocally, that not everybody would match requirements perfectly but they aren't strict on them. But that didn't convince them. 

In an effort to alleviate their anxiety and encourage them I approached the hiring manager who told me the experience requirements were bog standard HR drivel and he doesn't care if they have a degree or even a leaving cert - if they know what they're doing in the interview and come with a referral then he gives everyone a fair shake at the job across a probation period. The cream floats to the top as he said. 

And even then, the lads started to tear themselves and each other down. At that stage I thought they just didn't want to change or this job/company in particular. But they all told me to keep them posted if there's a more junior role in the future. These lads have at least 5 years under each of their belts and want a junior/entry level role. I don't understand this attitude at all. I get that interviews are stressful, the whole job application process is. But you don't ever stand to lose anything other than a few hours of time but you do stand to gain so much. Better position, better wages, better team, better atmosphere.

Does anybody have any advice on how to convince a group of discouraged/anxious lads to take the bull by the horns and make a change for the better? To actually take a little risk and just believe in themselves (and each other) for a little while.

Some advice for others who are nervous about interviews from a guy who's done hundreds over the years - I think interviewing is a skill. It takes practice to become comfortable in them and to keep yourself in the right head space throughout the process. When I start looking for a new job I actually initially apply to a bunch of jobs I don't want.

Why? It's 2-fold. 
1. I get a bit of practice in before going for the jobs I actually want. Get back in the groove so to speak. 
2. I take note of what's being asked. When you're working in a company, I find blinders go on in terms of the rest of the industry and whats trending. This way I get an idea of what's being asked and what I need to know for the interviews I actually want. 

So I've fucked up a lot of interviews in my time. Really badly. But I'm still here. I'm still working and I've not been industry blacklisted because I couldn't explain some basic concepts in the moment. So don't ever be worried about an interview or the process - everybody fucks it at some point. The only person who remembers is you and as long as you learn from it the better you get.",2023-09-23 02:55:39

I won't go into too much background but I'm a complicated mess of feelings right now, which I could sum up as ""*It’s a great job, people are nice, but I just can't stand another minute of it*”. On paper everything is rosy. I don't have any personal issues with management or peers, and when I describe my job to others I think ""oh wow that's interesting!"" - but then I remember I do it for a living and find it excruciatingly boring / hard to engage with. Me from 5 years ago would be drooling to learn what I am working on now, but me from today is just... tired.

I think right now my best course of action is to take a break from work for some time to completely detach. However, that's not something I am used to (hence burnout, probably). I think my longest time off ever was about 3 weeks, and that was mostly for a structured vacation trip. I feel like I want the opposite now, but I'm also not sure completely unstructured time off would solve anything. I'm also not sure what are all the resources that are available to me.

I never loved it, but it was interesting and I considered it a reasonable use of time and energy.

I then had a baby and I lost all enthusiasm for it.
I changed roles to see if a change might help, into a more managerial position which offers a lot of variety, also known as context switching! 
It did not help as I am a lot busier, touching on a lot of areas I would not consider myself an expert in.

I think I could like my role but I find it a waste of time.
The machinery of industry is kept spinning and i earn money but I see that as a poor way to spend 8 hours.

Money has to be earned however, so enthusiasm needs to be found to make it bearable.
I could change careers but my earning potential would be drastically diminished.
I could change companies but just like my previous role change, I am unsure if that would help, and roles are a lot sparser in the current climate. I also do not relish taking on a new company with low enthusiasm, its not a recipe for success and beating the probation period.

By that point however I was completely blank and started to second guess everything I had typed prior. I then started to internally panic and couldn't do anything. 

The rest of the interview was just a short couple of questions and it was over. Told the interviewer I was sorry and apologised for my head going blank and for wasting their time.

123ibyq,Stress/Burnout as Graduate,"Hi all,
I'm coming to the end of my level 8 degree, and am starting to feel extremely nervous about joining the industry full-time. 

I have full-time work lined up with a very generous graduate salary in a very small company, but I'm seriously struggling to deal with the stress involved. I joined the company via a summer internship in 3rd year and have been working part time since returning to college for 4th year. The tech/languages I'm working in are very old and led to a steep learning curve (I believe familiarity with the old stack is the reason for the high offer). I'm constantly anxious about production problems that may be my fault, or mistakes I may have made previously. I'm terrified to look at work messages, or that I might receive a call from my boss about a production issue.

I just wanted to reach out to people and ask if this is a normal way to feel? I love to code, I enjoy it and I really feel like I can produce and have produced some great work, but I'm just so crippled with work anxiety I can't relax at all, and the 4th year workload on top of that doesn't help 😅. I'm scared going back to working full-time again will break me. Does anyone have any tips for coping?

Thanks.",2023-03-27 10:08:50

16k4ksc,Advice on return to office push,"Hi guys, it looks like the push has started at my place and I'm not quite sure what to do. I was working remote 99% of the time bar training meetings we had to come in for. Ones that could have just been done on Teams of course. But it worked quite well. I'm entry-level so the pay is awful, the only saving grace was rarely having to come in.

They're talking about two days a week which is impossible for me and a few others. Only the very senior people live within striking distance of Dublin. Even one day a week would be rough - there's no need for it. I do the same thing in the office that I do at home. Communicate over Teams. It's not the kind of office where you have a bit of a chat, bond, do some work. I've gotten glares for chatting even in a whisper.

I feel like if this push is serious then it's going to cause chaos. The place is already balanced on toothpicks and if the people holding it up leave it'll all come tumbling down and become a nightmare overnight. Already I've been kind of double-jobbing even though I'm not meant to be - I don't mind this WFH, but in combination with the office? No thanks.

I was lucky with where I was placed when I started. I got experience with quite a few tools that other entry-level people haven't touched. I've even helped out some of the senior guys with some of them. What I mean to say is I wonder if they'd get rid of me if I just carried on as normal. Very possibly - it's a big place, and the people pushing for this return don't know me and don't care. But maybe it's a risk worth taking.

* Feeding it documentation that was released after its data cutoff for tasks like generating Regex and CSS code or centering divs as a backend dev.
* Having it write all those BS corporate things like self evals, emails, and other managerial tasks.
* Using it as a Stackoverflow replacement or a faster way to learn new technologies by asking for tutorials or troubleshooting issues.
* Using it to write scripts or SQL queries, and even to clean up thousands of rows of Excel data or rewrite outdated documentation.
* Asking for examples of interview questions and answers and generating tricky SQL queries or complex Typescript type definitions.
* Using it for annoying refactoring that can't readily be done by conventional IDEs or to answer questions about open specifications and generate examples for them.
* Using it as a reasoning engine to help solve problems that are more abstract and not well-defined or to explain concepts I'm unfamiliar with in a Socratic-like dialogue.
* Using it to suggest names when naming isn't immediately obvious to me, and even to convert code from one language to another.

>If you like to work in a fast-paced environment and strive for quality and efficiency, then look below for more details.

&#x200B;

>A track record of projects completed on time – you are a flawless executor, not a procrastinator

The rest of job offer is pretty much ,,you must be excellent with PHP and Node js and excellent with NoSQL and good managing servers and writing shell script and also efficient with Frontend and with cloud storage and great communicator on top of that YOU MUST WRITE PERFECT REUSABLE CODE FAST.  


From my experience even best developers are not FLAWLESS and their code is not FLAWLESS, and it does not mean they are lazy (lets be honest this is what they mean by procrastinator). Its just there is never 100% certainty in creating software. I always give it my best, sometimes I even stay long hours (I suppose I am still lazy by this company standards) but rarely it works first time, rarely it takes me as much as I predicted (ok in my current jobs non-technical manager estimates for me or forces me to accept short deadlines bestowed upon me but still sometimes even I think something should take shorter it did). Requiring average dev to deploy code right on time always is... delusional.  

How do you guys cope with requirements like that. I apply out of desperation but beside being software dev (PHP) with 5 years of exp I do not check majority of these marks. I do not believe anyone except maybe top 5% developers (which this company most likely can't afford, you don't find them on Linkedin job offers section) would be able to be such one man army/orchestra.

So its probably one of the jobs you need to BS your way through. How do you guys cope and clean your conscience after this amount of fake BS that is needed to sell yourself to companies like these?",2023-03-09 00:36:13

18x8amd,Should I be worried about looking for a job with the current market?,"Hey,

I'm a 22 year old about to graduate with a CS degree and I am on track for a 2.1/1st. I closely keep an eye on the job market and of stories of other people's experiences when job hunting especially after all the tech layoffs that occurred the past couple years, not to mention the general economy not being much help either. I also do attend college held events that help you connect with companys that were willing to talk about the recruitment of more generally, the IT sector.

I do love programming to be honest and I enjoyed the short but sweet experience of an office environement I got back in TY. Whilst being told that I was able to code at a junior SWE level from first year by my lecturers, I valued having an open mind when it comes to all this stuff as learning about our sector (new stacks etc.) never really ends. Being able to get along with the team is also something that is important to me, I like the idea of the whole work relationship dynamic thingy.

My question is, should I be worried about getting a job with the current market? Should I attend more outside events and what are the best ways to make connections? I do think I'd hold up well as a graduate but how do I even get my foot in the door? Should I also look at the option of applying outside of Ireland/the EU?

**PS:** my college course did not make for a internship and instead had more intensified projects to add to our portfolios, so it does feel like I've been dealt the short end of the stick compared to other graduates from other colleges

155zzmx,Can't decide whether to leave WFH role for hybrid job - any advice?,"Hi lads. Wondering if I can get any advice as I don't know what to do myself so I'm looking for outside opinions. Has anyone here gone from a fully remote position back to a hybrid role?

I'm currently working fully remote and on decent wages. Company is great, team is great, very relaxed atmosphere for the most part. Log on early and finished every day around 5pm and no questions asked. By far the best place I have worked.

I recently interviewed and got offered a position for a good company in Dublin. It seems to be a great company to work for from what I've read online, everyone I was interviewed by was very friendly and the team sounds great. The salary is an 8k increase on my current role which would take me to mid 60's and also received stock options on top. The only downside is that it's 3 days on site per week.

I've been trying to weigh up my options and decide what's best to do. In my current role, I can stay WFH full time and could move up one level in the next few months which would also take me to mid 60's but that would be it for a minimum of 2 or 3 years before I could progress any higher. If I take this new role, there are definitely better opportunities career wise down the line. 

The biggest draw back for me is the commute x3 a week. It would be roughly 3 hours a day on top of work, so it's a big change. On paper when I work out how much I'd take home in the new role after paying for parking, train and Luas ticket I'm coming out with a tiny increase a month (as in ~€100 more than current role). I'm torn on what to do, I really like my current role and everyone I work with, but I feel like this new opportunity gives the potential to earn a lot more money and career progression down the line. And to add to that, I love the flexibility of working from home, it's very handy not having to worry about traffic any more or parking etc.

Apologies for the rant, I'd appreciate any advice.",2023-07-21 20:58:23

130gcm6,Seeking advice for a mid-level dev that sucks at leetcode,"Throwaway in case any info is identifying. Basically, title. I have a CS degree and 3.5yrs experience in a reputable multinational, quit my job last year (needed time off after the pandemic), spent 6 months travelling and relaxing, and had a helluva time trying to find my next job since then.

I really suck at leetcode. I'm autistic and have ADHD, and my working memory is 5-year-old tier. I can't do mental arithmetic and I can't hold a bunch of variables in my head to figure out solutions without experimenting and writing code. I'm pretty sure I only managed to get my first job because I went in via an internship, so only had to do the first leetcode interview round (and even that I didn't get all the answers). Now I'm going for mid-level dev jobs and the leetcode expectations have only gone up, and I'm feeling a bit fucked.

The frustrating part is that I'm a good developer. I can get my work done in reasonable time, I enjoy learning the systems and new technologies, and I have good communication skills. I always try to leave code in a better state than I found it, and I take initiative to automate processes and refactor code where I can. I'm generally well-liked by my colleagues and got nothing but positive performance reviews in my last place. It's just that my process is incompatible with what's expected in a leetcode interview.

After failing some leetcode interviews I got desperate and took the first offer I got (after maybe 4 months of applications), and started a new job a few weeks ago. Problem is: it's shit! So now I want to continue with applications and find something else, but I could really use some advice on how I can work around my terrible leetcode aptitude and show companies that I can, in fact, Do The Thing.

The only solution I've really come up with is basically just grinding and memorising all the common algorithms and data structures. I think I could do that, but I haven't managed to muster the motivation and interest to do so even when I was off work. I made a few attempts at it, but I suck and I hate it, so it never stuck. I wanna get out of this place soon, though, so I'm hoping there might be something else I can do besides ""spend ridiculous amounts of time memorising all the leetcode"".

14elg3b,"How to be positive about your current job when asked on interviews ""Why are you leaving your company?"", when you are in for less than 1 year?","I started working in a bank, and this was the worst decision of my life. They throw 80 projects under you, so you basically have to juggle 80 angry clients in parallel everyday. Needless to say nothing gets done, everything gets escalated, you get reprehended, do late hours to compensate, nothing ever gets done, the complete horror show. 

I am becoming a ghost, working non stop without breaks, eating in the computer desk, doing unpaid extra hours, and stiill being haunted by the sheer amount of tasks. This is destroying my health, my marriage (she hates me doing extra hours and not being present after work) and my relationship with my newborn (I barely see the baby during the day, and at night I am so tired that I basically play with the baby 5 minutes and want to put her down so I can lay down on the couch).

However I am there only 9 months, and was wondering what to say why I am leaving after short time when asked on interviews. I know being positive is the key, and also I do not want to give the new employer the feeling that I will leave them the first thing that I do not like or goes wrong. My last 4 jobs all lasted around 3 years each, this is the first time I am planning to leave before even completing 1 year in the job.

124lfqo,New Jobs Thread Rules,"These will go in to effect 1st of April 2023. Feedback for these new rules was sought [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/11g3luo/new_rules_for_the_monthly_irish_dev_jobs_thread/).

**One Role One Post.** The thinking behind this rule is that this Jobs Thread isn't Tinder -- you can't hide behind pictures of other jobs.

**Jobs Only/Top Level Comments Only.** It is a jobs thread after all, we've decided to narrow it down to just this. No shoutouts, no opinion, no commentary -- just Jobs for Devs in Ireland. Everything that isn't is a Job Ad will be removed.

**Job Ads have Minimum Requirements.** A job ad must contain: title of the role, salary range, tech stack, either a URL or a work email or some external source that helps verify the job, the responsibilities and minimum days require in the office expressed as a rate e.g. once per week, four times per year etc. Missing just one of these and the job just gets removed, if your HR office/hiring manager wants to advertise but won't supply a detail you need just tell them that's unfortunate.

**Approved Submitters Only.** This is to help in the case of egregious lying e.g. some person puts up a salary range of €70k to €100k but then four people who applied come back to me saying they were all offered £35k, the job is England and it's mostly a sales role and the only programming element is having update a few Excel macros. In this case the mods don't have pull off a Sherlock Holmes to get to the bottom of things -- we just make the original posting account unapproved. You can still setup accounts anonymously etc. You just have to get that account that posts the job approved by the mods.

**Job is based/available to Devs in Ireland.** I count this is as based in either Ireland and Northern Ireland or it's 100% remote and available to Irish based Devs.


I've asked the other mods to enforce these rules -- I expect the Jobs Thread will be much quieter in the coming months and that's a trade off I'm comfortable with.",2023-03-28 11:13:45
11sxcn2,Expected salary?,"It's salary increase time of year and I want to talk to the company about mine. Working for the company in Dublin for 11 years since college and am a senior developer, my reviews are perfect.

Last years salary was €63k which moved to €71k, now they sent me a letter with a 3.5% increase to €73.5k. It's not a large MNC, it's a smallish private company of 100-200 people - no equity or anything, and I don't expect the same ballpark figures I've been contacted about by them.

11g3luo,New Rules for the Monthly Irish Dev Jobs Thread,"Why -- whats the issue? If you check the actual Rules - they were conceived literally years ago and even then they haven't been enforced 100%. Time for an update and clarifying what we want. 

Another aspect is how times have changed. Devs want salary bands on advertised jobs -- I think it might even be law within the EU. The reason I've been hesitant to do this is because quite simply it's just work and work that I have to do so I never committed to enforcing salary bands. 

However I'm going to drop my 'Laissez-faire' attitude and be a bit stricter about what can be in the Jobs threads. This will mean removing more posts and in general just being more heavy handed with what is and isn't allowed. 

One rule I want to introduce is that the jobs thread is just for jobs. Maybe top level comments only. 

Another is enforcing salary bands. 

As is typical for me I usually request input from the community before setting about acting on something. So this is that appeal -- is this this right direction to take the jobs thread or am I just seeing problems where there are none?

I am in interviews with two other companies.

\#2 pays much higher, but more boring work-wise, but I would happily prostitute myself out for a more money.

\#3 is more of a tech company with interesting tech stack. Not sure of pay. But kind of startuppy, one trick pony, and am worried about job security. But I should get some good experience there.

Anyway, I would like to see how the other companies pan out, while accepting job #1.

Would an Irish employer easily have access to this info somehow or would Irish privacy laws etc for example prevent this?,"I was employed doing a low-skilled factory job which I left 4 years ago. My plan was to go back to college but that fell through for medical reasons and other private reasons. In the past year I've learned Data Science online and now have a few different interviews lined up. I've lied on my C.V. and said I left the factory job 10 months ago. I did this for a few different reasons. It doesn't look good on your C.V. to be unemployed for 4 years and people have a bias against hiring people in my situation. Also I don't want to say it was for medical reasons as that might put some employers off. Basically my question is, is there anyway for a new employer to know how long I've really been unemployed if I lie to them?

Also to note, The factory I worked at is a multinational company and they have a ""No references Policy"" for the roles in the factory for some weird corporate reason. Maybe this is just for the Low skilled roles, not sure. Even if I wanted a reference off my old manager there technically not supposed to give one out.

Edit: okay, thanks for the responses. Seems the consensus is to not lie and just tell the truth about the employment gap. Gonna do that from now on and change the 2022 date for the factory role on my CV to 2019.",2023-03-28 21:46:12

I believe I did decently well in all interviews(I made some silly mistakes), but it's been over two weeks and I didn't get any response (Recruiter didn't even bother to give reply for my emails). Meta usually asks leetcode Medium so I was able to solve those questions. I gave OA for Microsoft yesterday, I got two questions and for 2nd question I couldn't come up with an optimal solution.

I have been doing leetcode for past 2 years. I was able to solve only 300 questions in leetcode so far. I feel very disheartened right now. Even after solving questions for 2 years, I am not able to solve Medium-hard questions let alone Hard questions. I don't know if I will ever be smart enough to solve these problems. I have seen people solving 600+ questions in 6 months. I know count doesn't matter but at least they are able to solve that many. And when I solve a problem today I will forget about it within 2 to 3 days if I don't revise it. As I solve more problems it's getting hard to remember them ( I should at least remember the concepts right)

I have done my Masters in computer science and I have close to 3 years of experience as SWE, so it's 5 years after my undergrad. I still feel I haven't learnt anything at a scale of big tech companies. With the number of years of experience increasing under my belt I feel like I am not progressing much in my career. As I go forward I have to struggle a lot crack the interviews.

And preparing for interviews is not just Leetcode, we have to prepare for System design and low level design. Till now in my careers I never got a chance for coding heavily. I don't know what I can do to get better at my career.

People who work in good companies or in good teams always have better chance than me to crack any interview. An this gap keeps increasing if I don't get a good job anytime soon.

The reason I am asking this is because I am in my 3rd year of a software development degree. I am feeling demoralised. Prospects of landing an internship are looking slim. The idea of coding interviews makes me want to quit altogether. I cant see myself having to grind on Leetcode after I graduate, I understand that this might be the way it goes but frankly I am not interested and I feel like I have made a mistake with regards to my degree. I wish I picked a degree where I go into a talking interview get a job settle in and learn in the job within the first month or two like everyone does. Do they make solicitors quote random points from random legal acts in an interview?.

I understand basic concept's like OOP and data structures and algorithms but I go on Leetcode and I struggle to solve even some simple problems yet I feel like if I was on a team employed as a dev I would actually perform ok. I'm in a software degree but.... I don't really like or enjoy coding. That's not to say I hate all of IT.

My story: Been in the industry almost 6-7 \~ ish years. Switched a few companies within those years, occasionally had a small 2 weeks break between jobs. I remember I used to look forward to Mondays when I got into my graduate role job, thinking how cool work is. Working from home mostly since the pandemic. Started really dreading going to work this year. I'm extremely privileged to have been able to WFH most of the time. All my teammates have been great (past and present) as well as workload, work-life balance etc. Salary is decent, work is ok, not super interesting and wouldn't say it is super complicated either.

Now, I can't really imagine myself doing this for the next decades of my life. Going through career ladder (either management/lead), never mind the years. Now, I only look forward to weekends and sort of dread Mondays. If you've been through this, how did you process/get over all of this? Are you still in the tech industry?Some friend suggested taking a career break for like 6 months. Can't really imagine that because that would mean I can't afford to get a mortgage.  


Note: I am doing a lot of things that I like after work. Gym, hanging out with friends, running, hiking, not side projects because I don't want to look at code anymore.

- more simplistic tech stack (iOS focused)
- team will grow, allowing me to step into a leadership role in the future (lead dev) 

Offer 2: 
- much larger company, recent M&A, lots of funding
- 90-100k salary im expecting their offer to be 
- working outside of my area of expertise (iOS, android, unity and others) in older tech stack (objc/java)
- much more complicated product, possibly highly demanding (worried about stress levels?) 
- flexible paid time off 
- possible future occasional requirement of being in office for new hires, business meetings 
- a lot of veteran devs with long tenure. Possibly lots to learn from? 
- used on billions of devices, allegedly 

So… I know at the end of the day this decision is a personal one. I like work life balance and flexibility, often prioritising that over pure salary gains. However, I was wondering am I actually crazy to consider taking a position worth 20-30k less for a better QoL? What would you guys do? Take the job working in unfamiliar territory with potential for high pressure, or take the smaller (non-startup) company with an easier going day to day? 

Maybe someone’s been in this position before and has words of wisdom? ☺️ thanks!",2023-02-20 17:14:58
194z1ch,Management pressure to ideate on new Artificial Intelligence use cases,"I'm working in a company that has a Petabyte-scale data lake in the AWS ecosystem.   
My team works on applications/software that process and serve data sets from this data lake, but none of us have AI experience.   
In our quarterly planning, there's suddenly a lot of pressure from management for us to think of ways for the company to use AI.   
It's as broad and vague as that, along the lines of 'AI has huge upside and is very topical, so how can we use it to create additional value?'.  
I'm a bit stumped in terms of how to start providing ideas for this. A few of us use GitHub CoPilot and ChatGPT, but this is very high-level stuff.   
I guess my question is, has anyone else found themselves in a similar situation, and what sort of processes/resources did you find useful to start generating ideas?",2024-01-12 16:24:57

18z6mns,IT Cybersecurity Jobs likely to be remote?,"Hello,

I studied business/accounting/compliance but also care for my disabled daughter, so for long term career prospects I need something remote, currently having issues in my current career due to hybrid being commonplace.

I have studied a module of cybersecurity as part of my compliance diploma and really enjoyed it, and I’m aware of its growth particularly with new legislation enacted. 

I was wondering if this was an area I could perhaps work in remotely without resistance? 
I’m of the belief that IT is the most likely to be remote, correct me if I’m wrong on that 🙂

Any recommendations on what course to take would be appreciated also.

Thanks.",2024-01-05 13:15:30

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/bxjxyAG). These applications only include Ireland and the UK.

I applied to a few big companies in mainland Europe but heard nothing substantial in response.

I mainly used LinkedIn for most applications and also used my university's job portal for about 3. I have one previous summer SWE internship.

The offer I accepted was mainly driven by salary but I also have experience in the tech stack from a previous internship and want to continue working with it in the future.

My previous CV was failing ATS checks so I recently changed to [Jake's resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) template which can't say I've noticed a difference yet but I feel as though I might have been rejected by some companies because of my previous one failing. I used ResumeWorded and JobScan to check this.

The applications that I withdrew from was because the OA either required excessive amount of work or a HireVue interview - I refuse to do interviews with HireVue because of the nonsense it tracks (i.e. happiness of the candidate, etc..)

Ghosted applications could still be in progress but majority of them were applied to in September.

174nett,"new ""expert beginner"" technical lead","Hey, I am a senior software engineer with a decade of experience, and am facing a situation at work. Our team recently got a new technical lead, who in my opinion got the role based on their tenure.

There are several of their behaviors that have concerned me over the past few months.

1. Low quality work: They have a non-development background, so a lot of the code and designs they produce is low quality with haste. I would describe them as an ""expert beginner"".

2. Over-complication: They tend to over-complicate things and frequently expand the scope of projects, this is often exacerbated by their ""expert beginner"" experience. I have replaced their multi-week long projects with an afternoon of writing a script and sending an email.

3. Lack of documentation: One of the most significant issues is that they provide no written forms of documentation or designs. Everything is spoken about and decided in meetings. I am unsure if this is done on purpose to hide paper trails of objections etc.

4. Interest-driven work: They appear to treat work as a playground, focusing on what interests them at the moment. For instance, Kubernetes has caught their attention this week, and they are diving into it instead of prioritizing company initiatives dictated by our CTO.

I am becoming increasingly concerned for the team's and my own job security, especially with the lack of a paper trail. As blame and issues will likely fall on us, not on the person making the very poor and advised-against decisions, because management seems content with them.

I have tried offering advice, setting an example with high quality work and pointed out concerns but they frequently ignore and override me. So I am just trying to avoid any work or project they have proposed to mitigate blow-back on myself.

Does anyone have any advice for my situation? Such as ways to point out to the manager subtly the issues?",2023-10-10 15:02:31
173dgjy,Not getting a single reply to any job applications,"So, I graduated with a 2.1 in 2022 and had a lot of opportunities of interviews for roles, as well as a number of concrete offers of roles that could have been very suitable. So much so that I ended up pulling out of some interviews as  I literally didn't have the time. Ended up taking a role that I was advised would give me the best experience and opportunities.

A year and a half later and I'm completely stuck in a rut in my current role. My job isn't giving me anything that was promised. I've tried speaking with my superiors about that and they've more or less said I should be lucky to be with the company giving there's so many hiring freezes and layoffs in the sector. 

I took this role despite the wage being lesser than others offered in the believe it would give me better opportunities going forward. When I was having doubts at first I decided I'd persevere and get the head down and hope if I put in the work it would eventually get better. 

It hasn't. I feel like I'm just a number now more than ever. I'm unhappy and it's starting to affect my mental health. I decided to start applying for another job about 3 months ago. I was looking at jobs in a similar and even lower salary bracket to my current position. 

After over 100 applications, I haven't had a single email back even to say I'm not suitable or they decided to go with another applicant. Absolutely nothing. Radio silence. I understand the landscape has changed but I don't understand how I've gone from feeling overwhelmed by the amount of offers I had to now feeling completely inadequate and stupid.

I've had my CV looked over by hiring managers I know and I've polished it up as best I can. Yet still I haven't heard a thing. I feel like I missed a chance after graduating and now I'm stuck in a lesser paying job I took to gain experience, yet have got absolutely nothing valuable.

Anyone got any advice? I'm struggling and feel I can't keep applying without getting as much as a ""No""",2023-10-08 23:38:44

On top of that my current work is using an older technical stack that is falling out of grace in my specific area. The new job is all greenfield with limited legacy code and a technical stack that is way more appealing to me.   


I feel like I'm choosing between job security and job satisfaction and I can't seem to decide. It's worth noting that I am still quite young and don't have any children or mortgages to pay so the risk isn't as bad as it could be later in life.

145x0ga,Senior/team lead role interview process,"Hi

I'm being laid off from my job, working from home for an American multinational. I have been working for them for 12 years, from graduation to now, where I've been a team/tech lead for 4 years.

I guess you could say I was comfortable there, earning a nice salary (a bit lower than the huge sums I've seen on here), and living in a rural county, where I was able to purchase a house etc and settle down with my wife. My main focus was working on a dotnet core backend/api. I also dabbled a bit with front end when I was needed, mainly react, but I'd hesitate to even put it on my CV. 

Over the past few weeks I've been looking at job postings and was wondering if anyone has any pointers or main areas I should focus on for a senior/tech lead interview? I did of course do a bit of googling in this but was rather overwhelmed with information. At this level are companies still asking leetcode style questions? Is linkedin the best place to look for job adverts? I notice a lot of places specify AWS. I have worked with it, but I have no formal certification. What I know was just whatever I needed for the job, and do not consider myself any sort of expert with it. Is it worth pursuing the official developer certification? 

I'd only be interested in remote roles, as I'm not willing to uproot my family. If I had to go into an office once a month or something, that would be doable. 

Sorry if this seems a bit all over the place, I just feel as if I may be a bit out of my depth, having not even thought about an interview for 12 years, it's all becoming a bit real and worrisome.",2023-06-10 10:43:25

1aow2yt,Not happy in role but not sure if it's a good time to leave," Well folks at a crossroads. Been working as a software developer for about 5 years now in an MNC in Dublin (was an SRE in same company for two years beforehand) and am working remotely now.

I moved to a new team a few months back under the same manager with the promise that the focus will be on developing new features for a critical service (myself and one other person). Sounded very interesting so I went for it.

We had an outage not so long ago which changed the direction of the team to resiliency. The other person on the team has left which means I'm flying solo and really doing no development work but rather maintenance, alerts, responding to incidents etc. They've told me they won't be backfilling his role for another 6 months or so which means I'll be doing this for the foreseeable and have, by default, become the SME for a critical service I've only been working on for a few months.

I want to follow him out the door but I'm unsure if it's the right time to go. I get on well with the boss too so there is a bit of guilt if I left him hanging but I'm not enjoying the job anymore. 

Is the job market that bad at the moment ? A lot of the LinkedIn recruiter messages have dried up which is making me hesitate a bit but still seems to be plenty of jobs. Cheers",2024-02-12 09:23:59

Also, my partner is not Irish so it’s important I get to spend a couple of weeks with her family every year.

The Public Sector is fine, but I just find the tools I am given to work with, plus the pushback on trying to implement new processes, as well as the glacial pace of change, incredibly frustrating. I am relatively new to the PS and am just used to working in a more dynamic environment, where the latest and best tools are adopted quickly and enthusiastically.

Anywhere in the Private Sector that can match those holidays? I lead an SDET team, but also (try) to help the wider division move to Agile (it’s like pushing a boulder up a hill!  :-) )

113p5re,What would you guesstimate average junior salaries to be at?,"[https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/)

There's the pre-emptive link to trimodal nature of software salaries as it always crops up.

&#x200B;

Following discussions in the jobs thread, I was thinking about junior salaries.

For Juniors in Dublin I'd say:

0-1: 35-45K

1-2: 45-55K

3+: 55K+ 

you're moving in to mid territory at 3 YoE, likely going to job hop and could move your salary from somewhere in the 50Ks to anything 60-80K.

&#x200B;

If you look at FAANGMULA types or well funded startups and fintech then you likely leap frog all these numbers in your first year. Naturally, the barrier to entry being much larger here for these prized roles, and they are freezing and firing right now anyway.",2023-02-16 12:11:07

So I work as an information developer for a large multinational who is currently in a spiral of layoffs.

This has meant the loss of my senior and team lead, so I am now in the lucky position of doing the work of 3 senior people while the ground shifts daily.

My team lead was not one to share knowledge and management are now coming to me with all their questions. However, I have basically being doing all the unwanted work for years now so I'm in the dark.

Anyway, I have a mortgage / family and need to put a plan in place.

There's been talk of shuffling the deck so maybe I should stick around and hope things settle down?

Or should I bolt, given that they have culled the US staff, the Irish staff could well be next 🤔

Lastly - are there any roles out there similar to information development? I have some previous experience in graphics and post production. Just trying to think outside the box ..

11vw7ti,I feel shafted in work every 2 years,"
(Please excuse my English, I'm not a native speaker).

I'm a SWE with 5 years experience come the summer. I know the average tenure for a SWE at a company is around 2 years. I think I know why. I've been with 3 companies in my career and every 2 years since I left my first I feel shafted at the the two year mark.

1. I join my first company in the summer of 2018, I lasted around a year in my first company due to layoffs in summer of 2019. Obviously I'm going to feel shafted
2. I find a new job fairly fast in 2019. It was good, then covid happened obviously a pay freezes were brought in. They were still in place in 2021. As I was still early years in my career, pay freezes stagnated my salary significantly. I was honest with my manager and told him that I expected a 50% raise to bring me up to market rates. The owner refused and gave me 20%. I told my manager again that I will go to the market and get my 50% if I have to. A month later I had a new job offer with my 50% raise, and suddenly the owner was able to match itt. I refused the counter as they made me to go and interview to get it, so they can suffer. (They lost a big client account, who I was working on afteR Ai LEFT)/
3. I'm in my new role 2 years and similar to the previous role I want a significant pay raise. I also want a promotion. I was denied one in January (even though I'm at the above level on my career map), but every 1:1 I make it clear to my manager that my work last year earned me a promotion and I'm disgusted that I'm not being moved up a level. He agree with me, but HR won't approve it. I'm fond of my manager, but I've made it clear to him that if I don't get what I want I'll move again.

I don't want to keep leaving companies. I've really enjoyed the work I've done in everyplace I've been in and the people I've worked witth. But I'm not prepared to stick around when I'm getting shafted and just accept it. I'm not the most confident person, so it feels like companies think I'll just accept their decision and they act stunned when I leave. I hatte interviewing and not gettting what I've earned is gettting old.

Anyone else similar? Is this why people move on average every two years?",2023-03-19 20:12:37

I'm currently a UX Researcher. First job as a junior researcher I started on €50k which I thought was huge. Now my second job, I'm on well over €70k - again, huge money for me considering my low experience level. UX Research pays really well.

However I love programming, web dev, learning how computers work, messing around with homelabs etc. and I spend all of my free time learning about computing related topics. I easily lose track of time when solving a problem in my program and I enjoy every minute of it.

I cannot say the same for research. Pretty much the opposite sentiment to be honest. It's not how my brain works.

Currently working towards a couple of third-level qualifications in software and have some solid portfolio projects built.

I really want to transition to development in some form - back end, full stack, whatever - in the near future, but I keep seeing posts on this sub about people with like 5 years experience on 'only' €50k. Is the pay really that bad? Is the market oversaturated? Is it still possible to earn good money (like what I'm currently on) in this field?

I know money isn't everything, but it makes it harder for me to pull the trigger and make the switch.

Also curious whether any devs on here think it might be possible for someone with no professional dev experience to start off in a mid-level role?

27 yo, backend dev with 4+ years experience. Love my job but realise that I've really done nothing with my life since COVID other than the odd weekend away. I've always wanted to try living abroad for an extended period of time. As such, I've decided feck it and in the new year I'm moving to Australia, with a big group of friends. I know there are plenty of other options in terms of Europe/ Canada etc to live and work, but Australia is where the vast majority of my friends are going and it's somewhere I've always wanted to go myself.

However I have a lot of anxiety about leaving that I am struggling to get over. With the amount of hiring freezes, budget cuts etc, I feel like I'm a fool to leave a well paying dev job here to try something new. On top of that, Australia's working holiday visa is quite stringent (rural work to get extensions, 6 month caps working for a single employer etc). I would eventually like to get a Dev job but I don't want to depend on it. Everyone and their cousin seem to be leaving.

Has anyone been in this position and could share their experiences? Nearing 30 and wanting to do something like this before settling down.

17hngrb,Issues creeping up at work,"Throwaway

Recently I’ve started having some issues in work. I’ve been in my job long enough to know what I’m doing, although I’m not experienced enough to do everything completely correct at all times.

Issue 1: my team (bar 1 senior dev) won’t approve my PRs. They will approve each others PRs but not mine. I know this because I get the emails. I have to chase people down for approvals. 50% of the team
Need to approve a PR before it can be merged.

Issue 2: I recently got given extra responsibility which impacts the team greatly. Ever since the TL (who gave me the responsibility) has been off with me. She dosent reply to my messages and when she does shes extremely short. 

This TL has since severely scrutinised my PRs questioning me on the minutest of details and blocking my PR from going in even when the merge criteria hasn’t been met (e.g. enough approvals). It’s gotten to the point where they call me out on calls, and when I give it back to them they back down and move on, saying they were confused over something. They then remove the block but never approve the PR.

As I said, I’m not a coding god. However, most of the time the comments I get are “spelling mistake”, “can you add a test for this specific case” or something else not directly related to my code. 

The problem is it’s really getting to me. I work on a lot of tasks that have a lot of moving parts that depend on the last. However, when the PR goes up it takes hours for approvals so I can’t get more than 20% into my next task. It results in me working at about 60% capacity.

I have weekly 1:1s with my manager but I don’t know how to bring this up as I just feel like I’m complaining for the sake of it. I also don’t think anything can really be done. 

My team is very chill (too chill) and my manager dosent care what we do or how we do it once the code works and work gets done. We’re all hybrid and it still happens in the office and out, however things seem to move a bit easier in person. 

Has anyone any advice on this? Tempted to start looking elsewhere but I really like this place, it’s just recently this shit has started happening and it’s stressing me out to bits.

After working for 1,5 year for an Irish company me and several other guys we were laid off temporary (i know , really lame term) on June. 

We are supposed to be still employees for them but we dont get paid. They will ""call us"" once there is more clients or work but lets be honest this wont happen. Actually, the expect us to quit. So i was wondering if i am entitled to any severance after i fill two years (in December) in this company.

I know that by the law so far since its less than two years i am not entitled to any severance but does being employed but unpaid for a company counts as service time for them?

I ask that because my hiring manager sents me emails that he says  i should let them know if i get another job lol

Thank god i found eventually a full remote work in another country and in a interesting role so i dont mind anymore but i was wondering if i can squeeze them!

I know also that they are forced to pay me any untaken vacation days that i i dint took this year right?

15ssjon,Need advice around contracting.,"First time poster: Let me know if this is not the right place.

I am a 40 YO backend developer(mostly Java ). I am pragmatic developer focused on getting things done fast. (good problem solver and average coder). I am looking for maximising my pay for next couple of years.

Currently at 120K (including all benefits). Based on my limited research around contracting, I understood that equivalent daily rate would be:

(120K + 20% (premium)) /220 = 650.

&#x200B;

1. Haven’t seen rates higher than 600 for Java + micro services published on LinkedIn, Do they exists?
2. Is it legal to be on multiple contracting roles at once (ignoring mental health, time with family etc.) or do most of the contract has clause for you not signing up additional contracts ?
3. What is the best way to keep most of the money with me and to pay as little as possible to revenue in taxes?
4. I plan to do this for only couple of hours. So, If I start a company and get myself registered as director and draw a min salary and keep reminder of money in the company what happens when I stop contracting and dissolve the company?

It would be great to gain insight into your experiences before I seek legal advice.

&#x200B;

Edit: Key Points from comments: 

1. Commanding higher daily rate in contracting is not feasible in short run. .
2. Multiple contracts: YMMV
3. Best way to save while contracting is maxing out pension
4. There are companies, that have salary range around 150 for devs.

159c9o6,"The lame way that our company is trying to pass a ""temporary"" lay off","Hi guys,

My MPS company after its revenue wasnt going so well and we dint had any new clients or projects  decided to do some mass lay offs. 

They baptized them ""temporary lay offs"" where its supposed that we are still in the company but we arent paid till a new client or projects comes but it feels more like a lame way to get us laid off without paying back holidays or any compensation package. They ask us to return our equipment like laptop etc and also the ID office card which it doesnt make sense if its supposed to be a temporary lay off. Not to mention that they have closed our email accounts etc.

So my question is how to handle this? Is there a way that we can still push back for compensation packages or something?

I guess since they wont pay us anymore the only leverage that we have is not return the equipment and make a scene asking either for a proper lay off with compensation package and paid the untaken holidays or well a real temporary lay off where we keep the equipment till a new client comes?

1adx8d0,"Struggling to Land an Entry-Level/Graduate Tech Role Job in Ireland/UK, Despite Graduating with a Master's Degree","Hope you're all doing well. I wanted to share a bit about my post-graduation journey and seek some advice or insights from the community. I am based in Ireland and I am an Irish ciitizen. I can also work in the UK without visa sponsorship.

About my journey. I graduated in December 2020 with a master's degree in MSc Software Design and Development at University of Galway, Ireland. Shortly after, I started applying for jobs in November 2020, I managed to secure an unpaid internship at a cybersecurity company (Based in overseas) as a data scientist intern, working remotely from my hometown (in a city in Ireland lol).

During the internship, I had the opportunity to dive into a few data projects, including some involving machine learning and graph databases. However, after six months, I decided to leave as I wasn't given enough projects and wanted to focus on securing a job.

The job hunt has been quite a rollercoaster. I've had numerous interviews, especially with companies in Irealnd and UK (I'm looking to move there), but I've been facing rejection and even ghosting after interviews. Rejections often cited a lack of experience, with many entry-level positions requiring 1-2 years or 2-3 years of experience.

Coding assessments have proven to be a challenge, as I have limited knowledge in data structures and algorithms, and LeetCode has been a struggle due to consistency issues. In other words, I lost my motivation after, I can't solve easy problem in leetcode and gave up easily. my master's program didn't provide much exposure to these topics (Data Structures & Algorithms and preparing coding assesment).

While my CV is getting shortlisted more often, the interview process has been stressful, involving HireVue video interviews and coding rounds. Although I've made it to the final round with some companies, I've faced rejection and even experienced instances where companies froze hiring during the final stages.

Since 2022, the tech industry's rapid evolution, coupled with tech layoffs and intense competition, has made the job search even more challenging. Taking a break in job hunting, I worked as an exam invigilator in my local university (seasonal job or temp job) to stay occupied.

Recently, I completed a training program in Data Analytics (In London, UK) in December 2023, thoroughly enjoying the experience and making valuable connections. However, the job market remains slow, with most jobs are senior roles for data analysts.

On a personal note, the constant job hunting stress has taken a toll on my mental health (Not too serious). It's been challenging to find the energy for exercise or to get out more. I'm sharing this not only to vent but also to see if anyone has tips on managing mental health during the job search.

Currently, I'm studying for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam and trying to learn JavaScript and React to build a project portfolio. Additionally, I'm considering part-time job opportunities as I recently completed my training program. It will not only keep me busy but also provide an opportunity to get out of the house more often.

I'm back on the job hunt, facing constant rejections. It seems the market is oversaturated, and I'm reaching out to the community for any advice, insights, or shared experiences. How have you navigated through tough times in the job market?

Any tips on approaching recruiters effectively or any other strategies to increase my chances? I appreciate any help or encouragement you can offer!

17nmarp,Feeling under qualified for a role at interview,"An in-house recruiter at for a big tech company reached out to me on LinkedIn for a role that I would really like. 

I had seen the role advertised but thought I didn't stand a chance, missing a few of their requirements and less years of experience than they are seeking. 

I'm a bit surprised the recruiter reached out to me but maybe it's due to specific experience I have, or maybe they are just playing a numbers game? The role, the company and the location would all be a game changer for me.  


Is it better to go into the process modestly and express concerns that I might die during a technical  interview or to play it super confident, or just a happy middle ground?

Would love some input or to hear if someone has had a similar experience and how it went. ",2023-11-04 14:01:39
17jd7c7,Rant : fed up with companies not responding at all,"I'm in my internship hunt and have applied to over 30 companies by now (rookie number I know), but I'm just really fed up with companies that don't even have the courtesy to send out a rejection email if they don't proceed with my application. It can't be that hard to automatically send an email to inform candidates that their application isn't being considered anymore instead of leaving them in the dark. What really brought me over the line was this one application that took in total 2 and half hours to complete which required a CV, a personalised cover letter, college transcripts, Leaving Cert points, an analysis of my previous work experience, personal statements,  and an unnecessary amount of additional question boxes which required a paragraph each to answer (most of these questions were already answered in the cover letter anyway). I would have been completely satisfied with an autogenerated email confirming that I will not be proceeding onto the next stage. I hope these companies understand that it makes themselves look 10 times worse when they don't bother sending out anything after you've applied to them.

Of course with all the big tech lay offs it's not the most ideal time, but just looking for some idea of how UX has been affected? I'm transitioning from Architecture in which I have a masters degree, 9 years experience, and I'm a registered architect in Ireland. I'm pretty burned out from it and the opportunities to design just get narrower and narrower due to extremely tight deadlines and very stringent regulations. I have probably spent longer in this career than I had intended, and when I first heard about UX it sounded like such a good fit. I have completed a course with the UX Design Institute and I am developing a portfolio at the moment. Of course, I understand a diploma from UXDI won't be enough to get me started but it was a worthwhile introduction. So to summarize, is the UX market still going well in Ireland? Would appreciate any feedback from people in the field and even better if some has made the same career transition. Thanks!",2023-05-25 14:37:19

12bl1yi,Would you take a counter offer?,"I am working as a support person/developer in my current company at the moment, on 55k. 10 years experience overall. I keep well informed about salaries and know I'm underpaid. I've asked for pay rises in line with market rates over the years but I've been turned down each time, despite showing many examples, and getting excellent reviews. We recently had some new hires in the department and I know they are being paid the same as me, with 0 experience. Another person with less experience was promoted and is now significantly out earning me despite doing the same job. I was basically told by a manager that the only way to get it is to get another offer and see what happens.

So an opportunity came up recently to interview for a role at another company, and to my surprise, I was offered it. A senior developer position for 65k. After a lot of soul searching I have accepted the offer and just now waiting on a start date.

Here's my dilemma. Despite the pay issue, I generally like my current role for various reasons - close to home, low stress, I have friends all over the business, generally interesting work, good pension, secure etc. I suspect I might be counter offered to stay. If so, I would really consider it. But a new start might also be good for me, new challenge, new scenery etc. But then, it might not work out either!

Has anyone ever taken a counter offer and how did it work out?

1adjgem,Moving from a private company to the county council,"Hey All,


TLDR: Thinking of moving to a county council job, is there any wiggle room on salary based on experience or do they only put you up the scale based on previous public sector work?

Full question:
I'm interested in a job with a local county council, a few reasons but one of the big ones boil down to I'm tired of the constant layoff dance with my company and private work in general. I've worked in 2 of the ""big"" companies 3 years in the first, now 2 in the second. I like the idea of how close it is to work and the security of the role and think I could progress to managment a lot easier then were I'm at now.

Has anyone transitioned and if so did you haggle at salary talks or is it basically you follow the scale and that's it? The salary at the 1st point is 10k less than I'm on now whereas the max is only a 1k pay cut. I'd probably be willing to lose 1k for the security and proximity.

I was thinking to change a job for some time so I've been interviewing recently. However market is shit, so no good offer was on the horizon. Finally, I got one (possibly two) and looking for the advice. I work in SRE/DevOps space.

Situation:
- Working for a FAANG company. Pays well, but I hate corporate life, unrealistic ""stretch goals"" and constant stress around that. Job is more about politics than anything technical. Constantly writing stories, tickets to other teams and arguing about priorities. I'm close to get promoted, but I'm being promised that for half a year. In order to get promoted I need a shiny project to showcase, but because of unrealistic goals there is no time to work on it. So realistically I could get promoted in around 6 months, but job will get only worse then. Worried that all internal tech stack made me outdated on the market and gap will be just growing.

- Got an offer from well established US startup. All new fancy technologies. Pay is better that what I have now, but worse than the one I would have once promoted. I will be the only person in Europe in the team, quite disconnected from the rest in US. Full remote. Also, on-call will be a bit more strict than the one I have now.

- Potential offer from one more company that has really good reputation on the market, people retention is very high that indicates that people are happy to work there. Potentially pays really well, but I didn't get the offer yet. They are doing yearly company retreats somewhere warm. However, they have very dated tech stack and no willingness to change anything from what I heard (which does solve my concern regarding the tech gap). The job itself has bunch of chores but the rest is kind of free to choose on what you like (if to believe them).

I have applied to pretty much all the grad roles on gradireland and nothing came back to me. I graduated last year from IT Carlow in MSc. in IT Management. Since then, I was able to get two junior project manager offers. One from Tesco and one from Courts Services. They were both revoked by the companies. One because there was a “miss communication” and the position was already filled, the second because I was on a visa and the courts services only hire people who have an EU passport.

I have been trying my best to keep my head levelled at this stage but it’s fucking frustrating how I had two of my dream offers in front of me and they both were snatched away because of some stupid reason which was not my fault. Before anyone says this, I have already fought with both the HR’s about this and there was absolutely nothing I could do (I never signed a contract with both the companies).

I told the interviewers and the HR on the spot that I am on visa stamp 1G and they said to me that they’ll have to check if they can give me sponsorship or not but apart from that, no one ever said anything about my visa being a problem for the job. 

This is highly unprofessional from their side and I am completely heartbroken, needlessly to say.

I stupidly agreed(Felt kinda pressured into saying yes but hindsght is a great thing).
After checking my Linkedin history it turns out he was apparently putting my name forward for a role from this company with the same specs back at the beginning of April but I never got a callback.

It was only after the recent call I also realised a co-worker of mine was being quoted the exact same job by a different recruiter within the agency(same job spec and level) at 55k-60k in March so I assume this role was filled and they are now hiring at a much lower base 

OR 

I'm the low grade pawn in the interview list or the funding has been cut etc.

Anyways, I got a 1st stage interview invite the following day via the recruiter.

Ended up emailing him back and explaining I had seen the job being advertised at a much higher base salary back in March .
 He immediately rang me back explaining that ""whoever quoted that number doesn't understand the salary grades at the company"" and said it was a difficult situation as he had alreafy told the company 45k was agreed.

He also seemed content to convince me to not bother pursuing if I preferred a higher salary. 

All in all an awkward call and it was left with me agreeing to pursue the interview and he said he could could scope out of 45k is the absolute MAX but nothing was really confirmed. 

Honestly kinda torn already as the new job is essentially the same pay as my current. 
Only plus would be an opportunity to learn new tech and more experience as my current job is essentially stagnant and cant see much prospect of gaining any worthwhile tech skills anytime soon.

134gxkw,Maths in Computer science at Uni,"Hello I'm at the end of school and sitting my exams this summer. I've been told that fields like ML and data science require an in depth knowledge of maths that is things like linear algebra, probability, calculus and graph theory. These look interesting and in demand so I might potentially go into these. I was looking to go to UCC, but noticed the lack of maths content unlike NUIG and DCU. All of the maths is optional and I think mostly limited to calculus and some linear algebra, there is no stats whatsoever from what I see. Is that something to be concerned about? Like could I get a masters in a maths related field after this degree? Thanks for everyone's help.",2023-05-01 08:46:35

119u6cp,Am I being screwed by the agency?,"So long story short. I am contracting to a company via big agency.

We settled on the price in December 2021 and I started in last year. The contract was 6months and they were happy to extend mid last year, before that I asked for an increase and the agent kinda told me they don't do it mid year. I said whatever and waited for the end of the year, I asked (the agent) for an increase and this time I was told a no again.  
For some reason the HR of the company forwarded me the contract they signed with the agency and the daily rate is 30% higher to what I get in the end. (Not sure if its a lot or not).

Is it possible the company said yes to the price increase and the agency is just screwing me? I mean, it would make sense - the less I cost, the more they make. But at the same time if I leave and tell the company that it's because of money, they would be probably be pissed with the agency and would not want to work with them again (or am I just naive).

I recently completed the UCD Master's in Computer Science Conversion course. If I've learned anything from that is that I have little to no interest in anything frontend or data science related (Even though UCD shoved it very much down our throats compared to any other CS related stuff).I guess what I am asking is should I just keep trying to get a entry level job in software engineering or DevOps or the like?

Despite having finished the course with good grades I still feel relatively poor at programming.  It gave us good basics and stuff regarding web applications but other than that... Currently I am studying C and C++ in my spare time as we were never taught this and I always found the low-level language more interesting considering you can do a lot more with the hardware etc.

I would just like to get people’s thoughts and opinions on this.

I have a lot of responsibility to deliver successful projects whilst working directly with external parties to make sure seamless integrations are met, whilst also supporting the team and preparing work for them and also delivering work. 

I have recently found this role fully consuming and requires my full attention to be “on the ball” all the time. 

My manager wants to promote me to another level. I know I have the ability but I feel like I am really stretched which is leaving me stressed out at the minute.

How do people manage this? I often find myself irritated now and it affects my relationships outside of work because I struggle to switch off. How do people operate at this level and maintain a balance in life or is that wishful thinking?

18gpgy8,Salary Increase Advice - What's the market like?,"Wondering what the market is currently like and if my counter offer is reasonable.

BSc(Hons)(First Class Honours) with 5 YoE in total, 2 with the current employer.

Working remotely for a Galway, Ireland based company(50 People) and currently on:

* €55k/Year
* Mediocre Private Health Care policy
* 3% employer pension match
* ESOP shares currently valued at approx €1550

Employer has offered during review:

* Increase of salary to €62k / Year
* Title Change from 'Software Engineer to 'Senior Software Engineer'

From my own research it's a 12.73% increase but factoring in CSO inflation of 4.9%(Oct'23 Rate) I'm left with a 7.83% increase which normally I would be happy with but seeing the cost of everything continue in the upward trajectory I'm inclined to push for more.

From Glassdoor the Salary for a Senior Software Engineer in the area is between €67k-€85k but I want to get a feel for the current market before using these figures as reference.

I've asked for an increase to between €70k-€72k and am waiting to hear back.

Is my counter offer accurate? Am I being underpaid here?

TL;DR; offered an increase from 55k to 62k and a title change to 'Senior Software Engineer'  working remotely. Offered increase is below Glassdoor average

18esag5,Career Advise,"Long story short, I joined a company as a graduate and 7 years later I’m an architect for customer solutions in my company. We got bought by a larger company and around the same time the product portfolio was reinvented for a modern tech stack. Some questionable shit went on.  A 15 year mature product was rebuilt in 2 years and ALL new projects are crippled with bugs and excessive implementation time. Due to the product going back to where it was 10 years ago, But with a new backend. 

I’ve been lucky with mentors and rose quickly. With the poorly implemented product all projects are running way over budget. Once per year each customer gets a set price upgrade to the latest version of the new product. The depth of change in these upgrades means the cost to deliver an upgrade is millions more than the dubious contract agreed with customers 2 years ago. Every project is in a big hole. Redundancies have silently being going on but I can see in the next year or two the parent company just shutting us down to cut costs. 

I’m concerned that my growth in the company is based on very specialised knowledge in a very niche field. I’m fearful I’m not solutions architect in other companies should I switch. At the same time I skipped passed the period where I would have got in depth knowledge to be a very good developer. I was good when I did it. But nothing special. I was better with people, doc, practises, overall product knowledge and knew enough to steer a development team. I still do development to stay in it since it’s of interest and when shit hits the fan I’m first called in aross all accounts. 

Moving to a more senior technical and leadership role has suited me by and large. I do suffer from imposter syndrome and the feeling I don’t know when I don’t know has really come to haunt me again recently. I largely believe the last two years have been successful. I’ve managed at team to deliver projects of man years to go live on budget nearly on time. 

But should the business cave, I’m stuck wondering what do I do next or what other types of jobs should I look at. 

Any advice on precautionary steps or other types of roles to look into?",2023-12-10 01:25:27
188ujkz,Graduate program,"I hope this post is appropriate on this forum.

I applied for a graduate program at a Dublin based consultancy company. After making it through the initial assessments I was successful in making it to the final assessment before the final interviews. The assessment was comprised of a paired activity, individual assessment, and a strengths based interview. Unfortunately I was unsuccessful. 

This final part of the assessment that I made it to was comprised of six people, myself (a male), and five women. I told my close friend (a female employee that also works for this company but was not involved in the interviews) all of the questions that came up, and of my responses, and she thought I did very well. When I told her I was unsuccessful she said it was probably because the company is trying to be gender equal by 2025 and said it was stupid as they should be hiring the best candidates for the job regardless of gender. She told me of her assessments from a few years ago regarding VR and AR (AI wasn't as advanced as it is now) and I came up with ideas that I would suggest to the company (including ones incorporating AI) if similar questions were posed to me in interviews. She said my ideas were great and very well thought out. 

My query is can request a data subject access request about my assessment and interviews. Firstly I'd like to know how my assessment went so I can improve on any further applications I make to other companies, and secondly I'd like to make sure I wasn't unsuccessful in applying for the role purely on my gender, since my friend reckons it's because they want to be gender equal in the next couple of years. Would this be discrimination based on my gender? 

If I accessed the data pertaining to my assessment and interview would it inform me on how to improve for future assessments and interviews, or if I was passed over for the role because of my gender? Would such a request harm future opportunities at that company if I tried for the graduate program next year?",2023-12-02 03:30:21

16rs7u0,Thoughts on my career so far as a 20 something with young children,"Hi all, just hoping to get some of yisser thoughts on my career so far and whether you think I'm on the right track.  
My background is I studied music, half-farted around for 3 years after college doing music stuff/working as a barista etc. During covid I decided I would like to have a secure career so I did the HDip in Science in Computing in NCI with Springboard. Luckily, I found I had a reasonable aptitude for coding and I was getting firsts across the board (although I wouldn't be surprised if there was grade-inflation going on in there tbh). I managed to get an internship with a pretty large, non-FAANG American crowd that ran concurrently with the final of term of the Springboard course and I was kept on full-time afterwards (this would be about 2 years ago now).  
My team builds automations to automate back-office processes within the company. Dirty RPA jobs are our bread and butter but we do other cool stuff like building small serverless apps in AWS with a Slack app frontend.  
Positives of my job are that 

* I have been trusted with challenging projects from the off - some of which proved to be too much (and in those cases my manager agreed that we could pass them off to another dev) and others proved to be a great learning experience.
* I have a great manager who is very supportive of family life
* Am a ""hybrid"" employee but haven't been to the office in nearly a year (it helps that I'm the only person on my team who lives in Ireland)
* I have what seems to be a very good salary and benefits for someone with my education and experience (56k base, about 20k in RSUs per year, 6% pension contribution matched by employer and my, my wife's and my two kids' health insurance fully paid by the employer. I think my TC is close to 90k)

Things I'm thinking may not be so positive:

* we work on a waterfall system. It's one dev per project (supervised by the lead dev), you design it, build it, test it, deploy it and leave it to the ops team. Then you move on to the next project. So, I don't have much experience with Git, code reviews, other things that seem typical of the much-vaunted agile environment.
* I'm a bit isolated from my colleagues - some devs on my team I have never spoken to 1:1 and I find it hard to pin people down on Slack for a quick answer to something. A lot of the time I am figuring things out the hard way by just trying a million different ways - this is great in some ways because you never forget those lessons but also very time-consuming.
* Though we do some cool stuff tech-stack wise as mentioned above, we mostly do UiPath which is a drag and drop programming ""language"" built on top of .NET. I would be a bit concerned that this is too niche a technology to be usefully-transferable.
* I'm not dong any OOP stuff - UiPath is basically writing scripts with [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) and I also do a good bit of Python which I have been teaching myself on the fly. We did Java in the HDip and I honestly found it fascinating to work with in terms of how it shows you a little bit of how things work a bit closer to the metal.

Since I started full time 2 years ago, I have tried to keep the head down and just be a good worker and learner but I have since got married and had 2 kids (it has been a busy time!) and while 56500 was almost unbelievable to me as someone coming off the minimum wage, with two kids and my wife no longer in work to be a stay at home mam, it suddenly doesn't seem like that much (obvs it is more than the median household income in this country so in the grand scheme we are doing very well but still). So, now I am thinking that I should have a serious plan to get the most out of work in terms of learning and income. Curious to know what you make of this, am I actually doing grand or do I need to ramp things up?

160wdi3,"""Underleveled"" take home exercise","Hi all, 👋

I'm currently in the market for a new position and have been engaged with a few different companies in their hiring process for lead/principal/senior/special big coder positions. 

One of these processes included a take-home exercise that essentially only tested knowledge of basic language features, which to me feels like the sort of thing that would be more useful when trying to tell more junior candidates apart. I get the impression that the technical hiring touch point maybe hasn't that much experience recruiting, though I could be completely wrong on that. 

If you were hiring for a position like this, would you appreciate this kind of feedback from a candidate? (ie. This is far too easy for this level of seniority, and it won't help you narrow down your incoming candidates at all.) Would you be offended if a candidate offered advice on running a hiring pipeline?

As a candidate, have you ever felt like offering this kind of feedback? Obviously, the typical complaint is that hiring processes are far too taxing or time-consuming. And while I appreciate that this request is trying to be respectful of my time, I'm worried that if it doesn't allow me to showcase my skills, it ultimately ends up wasting more of everyone's time than saving any.


Edit: thanks for the comments. Quick note as well for context, is that this ask is coming quite far into the process, rather than at the very beginning which I guess is ultimately why I'm considering saying something.

I suggested that I could hire this person through my company, train them and mentor them to be of a high quality/skill.

This wasn't exactly welcomed, and the thought of me hiring someone through my company was alien to them. ""Why would you hire them? You're a contractor?"", ""Why wouldn't we just hire one and you can train them?""

I tried countering that if I trained someone up and grew their skills to be as good as mine, then I'm essentially training a replacement. And that it's a huge risk to me if the company decided to terminate my contract, after all I am a contractor.

I explained that what I'm offering here is me getting more involved in specialized analysis for them, while making sure all the normal analysis is covered well by the junior. This would allow for us all to Win, and could open up future projects for us all.

I plan to ask them about that, but it's after 6pm now.

I know this is kind of a generic job question, but I'm thinking tech folks would be more likely to work in places with these sorts of work-from-de-beach policies. ",2024-01-24 18:29:00

1978ojf,How should I navigate my long notice period as a relative junior (~3YoE)?,"Hi all, wanted to get some industry insight here. 

I'm coming up to 3 years of experience in my first role out of university. Currently working in the SRE/DevOps type space in a financial/investment firm and for various reasons I'm looking to find a new position elsewhere, preferably outside the investment space. 

The main issue is because of the likelihood of poaching in this industry, my notice period is  3 months long - when I talk to my peers they're all shocked as they're working for reasonably sized tech firms and have ~1 month notice periods. How likely do you think it would be for potential companies to see my experience & notice period and look elsewhere? Do you think this is an issue?

I am thinking to either start applying to places and let them know about my notice and see how they react, OR I can put in my notice and scramble to see what jobs I can find before I'm jobless. I'm not sure if I would be able to negotiate a shorter notice period in my current position, as colleagues of mine who have left were not able to.

179xdv0,"6 years of experience in a relatively successful career without a level 8, considering a Springboard HDIP level 8, is it worth it?","Hi folks,

&#x200B;

I'm a dev with 6 years of experience across two companies. My career to this point has gone well in an MNC, received some promotions to a senior position and my feedback has always been on the higher end of things. I feel like I could continue to progress in this role in the company with no major issues. 

However I come from a non-traditional route into the industry, and the highest qualification I have is a level 6, along with industry certs (Microsoft, google etc). 

I may potentially look to jump ship at the end of next year, and even potentially emigrate. Recently I was wondering if my lack of a level 8 would hold me back in this department when looking for new jobs. I know for the longer term visa in some countries they take qualifications into account when calculating the points based system.  
I also sometimes feel as though I am missing some of basics that I may have glossed over in my expedited non traditional route. 

I was recently looking at this 1 year HDIP level 8 Springboard course in NCI and considering it (open to other 1 year courses also). It's a pretty full on commitment for the 9 months with classes 3 nights a week, but hope I could find the content straightforward enough and potentially get an exemption from a module or two with my experience.  
[https://www.ncirl.ie/Courses/NCI-Course-Details/course/HDCOMPSDEV](https://www.ncirl.ie/Courses/NCI-Course-Details/course/HDCOMPSDEV)

&#x200B;

I'm also wondering is there any point in me bothering with it? I'm confident in my abilities, but sometimes feel like the lack of a level 8 may become a pain point in the future, especially if considering immigrating. 

Wondering if anyone has been in a similar position and found it worthwhile to go back for a level 8? or was it a waste of time?

16yubhv,"25m from Ireland, and I'm at a crossroads in my career. I need some advice/guidance.","Hey everyone, I'm a 25-year-old guy from Ireland, and I'm at a crossroads in my career. I graduated in 2022 with a degree in Product Design with Marketing and Innovation. Before that, I managed a fast-food restaurant and worked in a supermarket's fruit and veg aisle.

For the past three years, I've been at a corporate gifting/branding company. This company acts as a middleman, supplying staff gifts, branded items, and personalized event items through various suppliers. During my time there, I've worn many hats.

I've dabbled in web management using WordPress, Elementor, CSS, and HTML. I even completed a CSS & HTML coding course recently. I've managed all of the company's social media and email marketing, handling graphic design for these platforms and various printed materials.

On the tech side, I've managed our CRM, transitioning from Active Campaign to Hubspot and integrating it with our accounting software (Xero) using Zapier. IT troubleshooting, PC fixes, and setting up various tech-related aspects were also part of my role.

I've even dabbled in sales, contacting clients, providing quotes, and ensuring their needs were met.

But now, I'm in a bit of a career dilemma. I'm interested in IT-related fields, but I often don't meet the usual job requirements. I'm also considering graduate programs. On top of that, the idea of starting my own business, similar to my previous employer, utilizing AI, intrigues me.

I've applied for marketing roles, even though I'm not entirely sure if that's where my passion lies. I'm drawn to roles like brand manager or anything involving brand protection and identity management.

Honestly, I'm a bit lost. I haven't found a job that truly excites me and feels like the perfect fit. Your advice and opinions would be greatly appreciated. Please, be candid and expressive.

TL;DR: 25M in Ireland, Product Design & Marketing grad, diverse experience but unsure about career direction, considering IT, grad programs, entrepreneurship, or brand management. Seeking advice and opinions. Thanks! ❤️",2023-10-03 15:04:39

My manager tells me to rise bugs and mark as task blockers, but process is super costly to raise one and developers of framework are super quick to tell ""ask X->Y->Z..."" and usually no one have enough knowledge to understand their own framework code (which is massive), linux or tested product use case.  They are quick to close tickets as well without solution, as ""its only happened to you"".

I start to think maybe its better to find a workaround in my test code to avoid broken parts of framework and stay quiet to not become ""that bad guy""...who asks for basics :/

Background: I have Social Science degrees and looking for a career change, and I have no programming experience. My goal is to finish HDip and apply for a master's program, and eventually become a developer. So here are the two options I have:

A. TUS Athlone - Higher Diploma in Agile Software Design

I was told that this program offers practical training, but the program pages reveal very little about the program's curriculum, all I know is that we'll be learning Object-Oriented Programming, Agile Design and Testing, Databases, Network and Cloud Architecture, and Web Technologies.

The main reason for me to hesitate is that life cost in Athlone is affordable, and there's a big plus - TUS has an Ericsson sponsored Master's program, which provides opportunities including paid internship and even a return offer (I don't know if an HDip student from TUS has some advantages when applying for this Master's program).

B. Maynooth University - Higher Diploma in Software Development 

I am aware that this program is pretty intense, and comparing to TUS Athlone, Maynooth also includes  Algorithms and Data Structures, Computer Systems and more in its curriculum. The training I'll be receiving seems to be more solid. But I need to get first-class honor grade to apply for the Master's program at Maynooth University.

Also, he tuition of Maynooth's program is much higher, and the accommodation in Maynooth can be a huge problem.

So there is a small company that has been doing really innovative work in the field I am interested in, I was trying to get on a call with them for almost 3 months, everything worked out and we got on a call recently, Me and the CTO,
Before anything was said, he clarified that at this point he is not sure if he can pay me for the internship, since they do not do internships and are currently looking for senior roles being a small startup, but they were willing to make an exception, I agreed to it at the moment because I felt there was a great learning potential here even if I didn’t make money.

He expressed that he was highly interested in my profile because it was similar to his when he was at my age. And we got talking and shared a lot of ideas. (He was visibly more interested than I was, and I was very interested Ngl) 

The company isn’t based in Ireland, he offered that I could work remotely from Ireland or they could arrange a work visa for me if I wish to work from European office location in Stockholm.

For context- I applied to 110+ companies for internships and I got rejected at most since they were looking for a third/ fourth year student and most that did get back to me with an offer couldn’t help with work permits or was offering a longer internship than just summer.

I'm currently facing a dilemma and could really use some advice. I've just received a summer internship offer from Amazon, which I'm extremely grateful for. However, I'm about to start a work placement next week that lasts until August with a mid-level company. This placement is conveniently located near where I live, which is really nice.

The thing is, I know how valuable having a FANG company like Amazon on my resume could be. On the other hand, the thought of leaving my work placement halfway through doesn't sit well with me. It feels like a really bad thing to do.

Also finding accommodation in Dublin seem extremely stressful, based on the little research I've done. 

I'm leaning towards staying with my current work placement simply because I think it a really bad thing to leave my work placement early, but I can't stop thinking about the opportunity with Amazon. It's a FANG company, after all, and I'm not sure if I'll get such an opportunity again.

I started working as a graduate developer for a large company. The team I joined is fairly new and there is not much work going around but I've already been with this team for 2 months and I have done almost no work at all and I am confident I'll have nothing this month either.

I understand the whole learning curve and getting up to speed, but this team doesn't have the work to give and there is almost no actual coding done due to how new the team is right now.

17cegzm,Being made redundant but possibility to come back as contractor,"So due to cost-cutting and downsizing, my company had a large number of layoffs.  The employee consultation phase has ended and I've found out now I'm going to be made redundant.  My team in the US have no say in it and there's work for me to do, and they're very keen to keep me but it's out of their control.  I threw out the idea of coming back as a consultant/contractor and they seemed positive about it.  I've been there 12 years, the idea of them paying me a large sum for redundancy for me to leave only for me to come back on even more money as a contractor is laughable at how ridiculous all these layoffs are to begin with, but obviously an attractive option if it managed to not get blocked by leadership. (Honestly so scared of looking for new jobs, this is the only job I've known, and there are times I really feel like a jack of all trades and master of none and I'd struggle to find a job elsewhere)  

I have no idea if it's even allowed to return as a contractor while keeping my redundancy package...  

But if it was and I could, what are the steps to go about this.  I am aware I'd have to set up like an umbrella company or Ltd company.  When it comes to salary negotiation, how do I figure out what is a legitimate ask on salary, I know contractors get paid a good bit more than employees for a variety of reasons but how do I ensure I don't lowball myself, nor take the piss in asking too much?",2023-10-20 15:51:33

Obviously depends on the industry and market etc etc so I know the variety of it. Upon receiving the contract for stock where they explain how company is targeting a value of X in 4 - 5 years time upon exit and thus my shares become X when meeting that target value - the amount you'll get will be lower of course if the company is valued at a below expected target value i understand that.

But curious to know if anyone has any positive experience in this ? but also what do you guys think of company aiming for 4 - 5 years for an exit ? isn't it way too long to stay in a company just for a stock if other aspects like compensation, packages, annual leave etc are not that good ?

I asked around to my friends that are senior to me and have experience with internships, they said they’ve never heard of a recruiter reaching out to someone for an internship so I was a little skeptical about it at first, but after checking with a few people I verified that the recruiter that reached out to me is indeed working for Hubspot and has recruited a few seniors of mine in the past.

I have been using LetsHost since 2017 and now got 7 domains with them.  
But I have been slowly getting pissed off the last year or two.

When I started the pre tax cost was €27, now its €38, this on its own wouldnt be enought to get me to do this post, but it is one of the pieces of straw.

What really got me is there auto renewal setup, more specificlaly how it silently failed.  
They send out 4 emails at 60/30/15/7 days with the auto renew happening on 2 days before expiry using the saved card details.  
You would expect to get an email on day 2 stating that it was either a success or fail, what I actually got was nothing.  
Unfortnately for reasons out of my control I was afk for this period.  
On day -1 (when I get home) I login and use the saved card to renew the domain, it works, so it was not an issue with my card.

So any decent registrar that has fair pricing and a ***functioning*** auto renew (preferbly at 7+ days, 2 days is too short for my liking).  
I do not want to loose any domain because the registrar's systems fail.

I'm considering a conversion course, but I don't want to waste my time on something like that if it won't get me anywhere in terms of a career. However, trying to just teach myself and work on my own projects and then hoping it's enough to get hired seems very unlikely to succeed. So if I go for a course, which courses could you recommend? I want to do a course that's practical, not too theory heavy as I struggle with that stuff, something that can help me get my foot in the door as an intern. I'm not picky when it comes to the field, and could be front-end, back-end, full-stack. The dream would be game-dev but I understand that's not realistic. 

As a bit of background, I'm very familiar with computers, been a PC gaming nerd from a young age, and I've a basic grasp of programming. I make large-scale mods for Unity games using Harmony (basically using reflection in C# at runtime), and I made a basic windows forms config app for one of them. Over the last two years or so I've done dozens of small projects via tutorials making apps in flutter, xamerin and started looking at React and I've some past experience with helping out on an Angular project, though it feels like I barely remember the specifics for any of these, sort of ""jack of all trades master of none"" but even being the jack of all feels dubious. 

I wouldn't be very skilled or proficient with any of these frameworks as I was just following tutorials for the most part or doing very basic front-end development. I have a hard time retaining the syntax, work flow and other particularities due to switching between them and tutorials being mostly very surface-level. But I do have a decent foundational understanding of core programming concepts at this stage, enough to pick up and learn new frameworks and languages to a basic degree. I'd probably still benefit from a formal course if it's beyond the basics of a coding bootcamp.",2023-04-24 11:08:07

My current job is very stable and flexible. The salary and benefits package they offer seemed to be alright but not great and from what I've seen on Glassdoor you can only get health insurance after 5 year on the job.

The hiring manager what's to schedule the first part, but I wanted to learn more about the working environment there as I don't want to waste anyone's time.

11nj3np,Moving to team lead role (frontend),"Hi all, I'm seeking some advice here. I'm a very experienced senior frontend developer and I'm seeking some advice on how I can best position/upgrade myself and my skillset to move into a lead position. I have a few ideas myself, but I'm curious to know what you guys think are some key skills to accomplish this.

I kinda feel that I've done the rounds having worked as a senior dev for a few different companies, but none really offered the opportunity to move beyond this. The same applies for my current role tbh, so I'm looking at the job market. 

I guess I'm facing imposter syndrome and lack the confidence to apply for such roles, especially as I've yet to gain proper team lead experience. So I guess I want to nail down the key areas & skills that I need to improve in order to boost my confidence for such a role. Many thanks.",2023-03-10 08:15:16

Also, are there like tech heavy areas?

116x9u6,Which aspect should I (experienced Java developer) prepare for remote hiring,"Hello fellows, I'm a Java developer with 8 years of experience. I came from an Asian country. I want to move to Ireland, because my wife's major is Accounting, which is also welcomed in Ireland as far as I know. So we decide Ireland (We have little knowledge about other EU country, any other suggestions are also welcomed.)

I've watched this channel for months and have normal knowledge about Dublin, so we prefer Cork or any other city. My questions are:

1. What's the requirement and interview style about Dublin and Cork companies? Java basic? Spring boot or any other frameworks? System design? My old project experiences? Leetcode? Big questions?
   1. I've finished On Java8 English edition, it's a little slower than I expected. As I need to prepare English(I'm able to read posts and speak to foreigners, but I need to enrich my vocabulary.) and tech stacks, so it will be effective if I prepare what they want in interview, instead of prepare all, which is not achievable for me.
2. Is is possible to find a company located in Dublin while I live in Cork? Need to go to office each week? I don't have a driving license. Or to the point, is it easy to find a company located in Cork, which would like to apply Critical Skills Employment Permit for me?
   1. I can accept a bit lower salary in Cork. But I'm not clear about salary in Dublin and Cork in my circumstance. What's the bottom line of salary I should keep for living in Dublin and Cork?

I know I post so many questions, it's not easy to answer them all. Any words and suggestions are helpful to me. You will keep me from making mistakes and save me plenty of time. Thank you.

Hello all!!

I wanted to ask about work logging requirements and how they affect our daily routines.

Personally, I was recently informed that my employer(4 years - Fullstack dev) is now requiring us to log our work in 30-minute increments, which is a new requirement for me. It's definitely taking some getting used to, but I'm curious to know if anyone else has had a similar experience.

So, how about you? Does your employer require you to track your work in this level of detail, or do they use other methods to measure your productivity and performance? Have you found that work logging has helped you stay on track and meet your goals, or does it feel like more of a burden?",2023-03-01 21:07:08

I’ve no interest in going into the office as it’s far from me. So is it appropriate to ask for a raise over a slack message?

I was told the company doesn’t do performance reviews for people performing well, and that I’m doing good and have nothing to worry about (I brought up the performance review question, as that’s when I was going to ask for a raise.. but they don’t do it?)

So.. can I just hit him up on slack like “hey.. blah blah I’m over performing, all this extra responsibility, the base bay for this role has went up over the last 12 months since I started and I’m now earning less than newer colleagues at the same level with less responsibility. What’s the chance of a raise?”

19au5vp,Which Programming Path Should I Take?,"Hi there. I just wanted to ask about programming, and what the best way to go forward might be.

I've done two ecollege courses in Python as of now, and initially my plan was to learn more stuff and get more qualifications together, such as HTML/CSS and maybe Javascript too. I'm just doing them since they're free anyway, and I was thinking that it all stacks up.

I've been also working a little with C# due to working on Unity fangames, and I've been trying to learn some C++ in my own time too, given my girlfriend is also doing a web development course and they do some C++ in that. I thought it would be nice to learn anyway since it's a pretty universal language.

That all being said, so far I just have two different Python qualifications; Python ITS-303, and PCAP-31-03. I had mostly only used Python for some Linux scripts prior to taking these courses, and the latter one went over all the fundamentals of OOP.

I'm just wondering what you guys might think is worth doing in the long run? I'd consider web development, but I also like the idea of game development (I feel like one could only really be an indie dev though), and I do generally like programming in general (I generally enjoy trying to solve problems), so I wouldn't mind writing programs for a company etc. I just wonder regardless, what path I should take though. Would I need to go further into Python for example, and what is it generally like trying to get into a programming job in this day and age (given it seems to be becoming increasingly common)?

Ideally, I would like to be able to work remotely, since my girlfriend lives abroad and it would be ideal if I was still able to travel. I don't know if that's common though, and I could of course try get a job over there (Sweden) in the long run. For now though, I feel like I really need to start somewhere, and I haven't tried asking for advice on here yet.

(Also, if it helps,  please take the following statement as absolution from any possible repercussions:  I understand you are not lawyers and I should seek expert legal advice rather than asking people from the internet. I promise not to sue or return seeking retribution if everything goes pear shaped).

I was recently made redundant after about a year in a role.  They opted to pay me in lieu of me working my notice.  That's all fine.  However, they had been paying health insurance for me, Mrs. Ambassador and the kids and they stopped this at midnight on the day they gave me the heave-ho.

Presumably,  if they had required me to work the month's notice, they would have had to continue paying the health insurance. My thinking is, that since this was part of my contracted package, they should have paid it for the month in lieu too.

I was asked to sign an agreement that everything around my termination was tickety-boo and above board but, since they weren't offering anything over and abovewhat I was legally entitled to (and they handled the whole thing pretty terribly), I declined as I didn't see any benefit for me in doing so.

Summer has always been a quiet time for the Jobs Thread and the tech scene in general. September and January seem to the the busiest parts of the year. 

I've made the current thread a 'quarterly' thread instead of a monthly thread. This is just an added incentive for anyone to post a job. It will increase the exposure of a job 2x to 3x. If the job thread is still empty at the end of this 3 month period -- I'm happy to put up my hand to say any efforts or changes I've implemented haven't worked/helped. 

I've also considered scrapping the jobs thread. Perhaps DevelEire is a good forum but a poor place to have jobs -- the jobs thread has never been a focus of the forum it was just a convenient place to put jobs so that they didn't litter the rest of the forum/become indistinguishable from spam. Would scrapping it be a worthwhile idea? 

What are your thoughts or opinions on the Jobs Thread since the New Rules were implemented?

14oxu0w,Cardnado: obfuscate your shopping habits and still take advantage of the club-only discounts (alpha),"# Sideproject

This is a great portfolio app for devs who are just starting their career so if you have any questions just hit me with a DM and I'll be happy to help and explain the design /logic in depth.  Check the last part of the post for more details. It's not my best code but I will be iterating on it.

I have around \~4 years experience and I can't recommend others enough to try and build some side projects, it keeps you from getting Pidgeon holed at work and you can experiment with new technology. It's like going to the gym for your dev skills. I've learned a tone of new stuff as usually in a corp environment you only work on one small part of a project.

I did not go public with this yet as I am still in the process of setting up the DNS/domain name so the URL is impossible to remember, but though ppl here might be interested: [https://ambitious-bay-0b6f71003.3.azurestaticapps.net/index.html](https://ambitious-bay-0b6f71003.3.azurestaticapps.net/index.html)

# What does it do?

What this app does is basically lets you put in your store card number and share it with others. In turn you will randomly get one from the database. This way one can get a 'member discount' without telling the store their shopping habits.

So why not just make a static page with a bunch of cards from different stores? Well some might want to avail of some vouchers so this way user A's card is being used by user B+C and user B's by C+A and so on so it eventually evens out (yes, a bit of communism).

Currently it only has one store but I'm looking for feedback on what else I could add.

Please do not brake it.

# Tech details [https://github.com/DauntedPine/cardnado](https://github.com/DauntedPine/cardnado)

**(app) Client - Azure static web app hobby plan**

The client logic is written in Typescript and uses JQuery and JSbarcode lib. For the UI I used Bootstrap. I initially wanted to create a vanilla UI but gave up fast, it just looked like crap and I'm not talented and/or have patience. I'm not that good with UI anyway so in certain places it's hacked, such as when the barcode svg is generated a method is called to resize it to fit the parent div (I'd expect it's width to be 100% but somehow it's an absolute number, could be an issue with the JS lib).

I chose to write in Typescript because I can't stand using vanilla JS, I just love the autocomplete / type checks and less buggy nature of it, I think it's worth a try. I am using webpack that points to index.ts, my point of entry to build the .ts files and pack everything into a main.js. Still some issues there with debugging (can't debug the .ts files in VSCode / Chrome, have to do it with vanilla).

**(api) Backend - Azure functions**

The backend (add-card and get-card) are Azure serverless functions written in Typescript. They communicate with a Cosmos document DB that holds the data. So far I only keep the card number and in the future there will be a report flag. I chose document because as more stores will be added extra info might be required and that info might not be structured. They also run on free plans (as long as they don't get hammered).

**(common) Common**

I wrote one single card validator that is being used by both the client and the backend. So if something changes, I only change it in one place. This saves unnecessary requests to the backend when somebody inputs am invalid card. The backend also needs to validate input as someone might send a request directly.

**(.github/workflows) DevOps:**

The API is currently deployed manually from VSCode but I'm working on making it deploy automatically though Github Actions. The UI is being deployed automatically. Check the ci-yaml for more details, in short github reads that config and knows what to do based on the options/values

**(utils) Utils:**

Just some utils I made to check randomness of card retrieval. Distribution is ok-ish but I wouldn't use it for cryptography haha.",2023-07-02 20:08:24

Alternatively, I'm thinking to focus on working in the public sector for the slow and steady career progression and for work-life balance. I'm a bit afraid of getting bored in this though.

My internship is now halfway through and I feel like I like what I’m doing and hope I can get a full-time role within the company. The company layoff a few people in the Dublin office including 2 of my team mates and another one resigned due to back-to-office policy. 

I feel like they are short-staffed in my team and I was wondering do I have to let my manager know I’m Interested in a full-time role or wait until the very end of my internship and see what they say or possibly an offer?

13qiyse,Is TCD computer science worth the move to Dublin?,"I finished my LC last year, and I have the points to do CS in trinity + DARE if the points further inflate so I think I’m secure. 

I’ve done a few courses on programming this past year and now I’m certain I want to study CS. I’m intrigued by trinity’s course specifically because it is very theoretical/maths heavy (which I enjoyed in school) and I feel like it could give me a more of an in depth education than any other course in Ireland.

My biggest concerns are 

1. Work experience, apparently you have to complete the masters for you to be able to spend 4th year on an internship, which I feel is a bit pointless if I plan on becoming a SWE, and it’s a disadvantage because every other course has one in 3rd year with no cache.

2. Dublin expenses! The housing crisis is a nationwide problem but Dublin’s on actual steroids, I’ve had friends who had to defer this year, mid course, because they couldn’t find accommodation. I’ve saved enough money to afford the first year, but I’ll probably have to work throughout the year and during the summers during my course to afford it, which might be difficult especially because it’s a really demanding course.

I could study CS in UCC which is logistically easier in every way. So is there enough of a difference between the courses to justify the struggle of moving to Dublin? Don’t get me wrong, I really like Dublin as a city, and I would enjoy the independence/“big city” lifestyle which is another bias I have to TCD but I have to be realistic given the circumstances.",2023-05-24 11:34:57

I’m currently working as a data analyst using primarily python and SQL. My company has an Irish office but I’m based on a US team so I’m fully WFH. I’ve always wanted to move into software and I’m strongly considering doing one of the software focused HDips. The only issue is that I live in Westmeath and realistically won’t be able to relocate. 

So I guess I have two questions:

Are there many companies in the midlands that hire developers? I believe Ericsson hire quite a few but I’ve heard mixed reviews about them. 

Are there many companies in Dublin/Galway/etc. that hire fully or majority WFH developers?

Contracting is completely new to me so I am trying to navigate as best I can and make a decision on what to do. I was made redundant in Feb so not presently working, however, I had my own company a number of years ago, and heading down the path of registering for income tax / VAT, etc. is not something I want to do.

1akyzun,The IGNITE program is open in Cork...,"IGNITE is essentially a startup incubator created by UCC (University) in Cork. The candidates are given advice and funding to work on their starups full-time. I believe it deals with many tech startups which, they hope,  can provide jobs and exports in the future.

A number of issues come to mind though. First, I'd like to state that the startup business is really, really tough. The stats in general are grim. The stats for tech startups (including SAAS) are even grimer.

The article highlights the fact that this program has created ""170 start-ups over the last 12 years and these companies have created more than 370 jobs"". That's not really something I'd boast about - 370 ""jobs"" over 12 years.

I was chatting to a guy a while back who was a previous inductee on the program. His business was in a terrible position financially, he'd taken out a large loan to fund an asset purchase that had already vastly depreciated. He had no idea what his margin or break-even points were. The guy had been working as an accountant before quitting his job to join the full-time program.

Finally, the advice on these programs, I'd have difficulty in taking on-board. Entrepreneurship is one of the most difficult and rewarding business ventures out there. Like every profession though - those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.

I'm wondering whether someone working for a State agency pulling a pension and a regular paycheck is in a position to advise an entrepreneur? IMPO it's difficult to trust any external advice as an entrepreneur. Everyone has an agenda.

I've had a look at other incubator programs in Ireland. Many suffer from the same issues. These businesses start off top-heavy with government funding. Last until the funding runs out, then promptly fold. Very few survive in the wild.

So what should Ireland do incubate it's own tech startup ecosystem instead? Generally, as a rule-of-thumb if a business can't attract private (or angel) funding then it might not stand a chance in the marketplace anyway.

Real startups need tax breaks, help with legal and further tax breaks for private investors in the tech scene. _Real_ money is always preferable to State money in the startup scene IMO. It's just smarter.

I'd be interested to others opinions on this? Any State incubator grads here for example?",2024-02-07 09:18:22

173t1ho,Contracting Dilemma,"Throwaway account as I have many colleagues and friends around here. I have >15 years of experience in tech and have worked in staff level positions including FAANG. I've got an offer with an international VC funded startup that does not have an entity in Ireland. They will pay me in USD and at what seems like a like US level salary \~200K a year.

Since they don't have an entity in IE or EU, I will be contractor on paper and invoice them every month but the roles are responsibilities are no different from an employee. I can open a LTD company and bill them through that and I will end up paying way lower tax if I direct the money to PRSA / claim expenses. Looks like this is common from reading other posts in this sub but it feels wrong to me.

I can't influence the company to setup an entity and hire me as an employee and as far as I understand that it's their prerogative.

At the same time I don't want to end up with some legal / financial liability in the future. So what should I do? Stay quiet, setup an LTD and be happy or go for an umbrella PAYE option (contract plus has it but they don't recommend it for long term assignments). Any other options?

Edit: In the contract plus umbrella PAYE option I will be paying both employee and employer PRSI contributions from the same pool of money which also feels wrong.",2023-10-09 14:21:14

Looking for a bit of advice.

I’m 32 years old working in a steady, decently paid job for the last 8 years. However, it’s incredible mundane and boring and not something I have any interest in but it pays the bills and supports my family which is my main priority obviously.

I completed an online professional diploma in Graphic Design with UCD (which I really enjoyed) but because my everyday job doesn’t include any graphic design, I found it kind of went to waste as I wasn’t skilled enough to get an entry level GD position and could only keep up learning in the limited time outside of work.

I have always wanted to learn to code and now thinking of learning more about software/game/web development. I understand this is something that will also require a lot of patience and time so I’m wondering if anyone can share any insights on the below:

* Any specific path to go down for more entry-level opportunities? (Developer? Engineer? Analyst?)
* At 32, with a wife and child to support, am I mad to risk switching careers?
* Any recommended resources or introductions to coding? (Code Academy?)
* If you are in the industry, do you recommend it?

Thanks in advance for any advice.",2024-02-08 12:24:21

My other question is if there are any specific programming languages i should be looking to learn or any areas/roles that are maybe more lucrative long term than others.

152x50p,What type of role would be suited for our startup?,"We're two fellas from Dublin, we've built a web app that serves a very specific purpose in a very specific niche, specific to Ireland. 

In essence it'll save businesses in this sector quite a bit of time on a weekly basis by streamlining a process that's currently handled in a very manual way. 

There are hundreds of businesses in this sector in Ireland who would be potential users, but the service would have no relevance outside of Ireland. 

We have a couple of businesses lined up to use it through preexisting connections, however neither of us are sales guys so we'd like to hire someone to assist us in growing our user base beyond this. 

So the person would essentially be reaching out to potential users, explaining the benefits, walking them through the (very simple) setup process, etc. The benefits of the platform should be fairly obvious to any potential user, but it'd still likely take a bit of cajoling, handholding etc. 

This is not really our area at all, so I wanted to ask here what type of role should we be advertising for that would be relevant to this (sales? marketing? support? etc). And while I'm here, what type of salary would be reasonable?

Basically I work in a Multinational with a fairly sweet gig that has me doing very little outside of answering emails and doing reports for customers. The job is quite easy and the WLB is incredible, so much so that's its become extremely boring.

An old employer (also Multinational) has offered me a postion for a bit more than I'm on now with a lot more progression. I know I could work the new job no problem and continue my old job by doing the reports in the evening and reply to emails from my phone.

Has anyone done this and what was it like? The goal is I have a wedding coming up and every month I could do this would be 3k towards it.

I do have an ""exclusivity clause"" in my contract  but from what I've read there not actually enforceable.

1bnbes3,Becoming a better manager of developers,"TLDR:  
I have a role thats equivalent to engineering manager.  
Although technical in experience, I am not a developer.  
I manage a small team of software developers & want to get opinions on how to be a better manager, despite not being a full developer myself.

&#x200B;

First some background:   
I have 15 years experience mostly around data, dba, database development, DWH development, data architecture mostly in Microsoft platforms  (SSIS, SQL Server, ADF, Power BI), some Azure experience where I have used Azure Functions, Logic Apps, Power Platform where needed. I am very much a generalist, with no deep level of expertise in any area. 

I understand broad architectures & design patterns but I have not worked in any from a developer perspective.

**I manage a team of developers but I am not a developer.**

My current style is to acknowledge that the developers on the team are experts in their field and to trust their knowledge & experience.  
I ask lots of questions regarding choice of frameworks, design patterns etc, not to say the choices are wrong, but to ensure the team have fully thought through what is being proposed.  
I assist with working through some of the more difficult business requirements, giving input on platforms, business process flows & how they might be implemented.

I advocate for my team, always acknowledge that they are the ones doing the work. I make a point of not stealing credit.  
I push them in relation to their career plans, to help ensure they are taking any training opportunities available.  
I also support them as a people manager, the poop umbrella, ensuring organizational politics & nonsense does not interfere with them on a day to day basis.   
I also ensure they look after themselves, they have habits of working late, weekends or not taking time for family and I push this quite hard. Besides work needing them sharp, I also want to see them content.

My lack of technical experience in development is giving me a bit of imposer syndrome, especially regarding proliferation of attitudes like Musk saying managers must code 80% of the time.

Im asking here what people think are the best ways to improve at my role, both for my team and for me.

Appreciate any advice & opinion, short of telling me to quit and hire a manager with dev experience!

1bkow8r,Will not securing a graduate role put me at a disadvantage?,"I graduate this summer but I've had no luck securing a job.

I know a few companies were looking for grads back in September last year but I didn't put my heart into any of the applications as I believed I would be receiving a return offer for the company where I had done my internship. I know I should have taken it more seriously back then as that return offer never materialised but hindsight is 20/20 I guess.

I think I may have missed the bus on graduate specific roles as I don't think I've seen any since December. I've been applying for positions that are not specific about years of experience or require between 1-2 years experience but have just been instantly rejected or ghosted. The one company that got back to me with feedback said they were looking for someone with 4+ years experience although the position had been advertised as entry level.

My main question is if I don't get a grad role this summer does that put me at a disadvantage? I assume that I wouldn't be able to apply to any grad roles for next year so I'd only be able to apply to roles that are vague about years of experience required and as a result competing with engineers with a lot more experience than me. Is there anything I can do to improve my chances if I find myself in that position? Do hiring managers even look at personal projects for roles like that?

Also, if I don't get anything with a start date during the summer I'll probably have to go back to working retail full time to save money. I don't mind it but would that look bad to potential employers when I'm applying in the future? 

Any advice would be appreciated :')",2024-03-22 02:39:57

1bo93r9,MSc in AI worth it for an experienced SWE?,"Hi everyone,

I am a Principal/Staff Software Engineer with over eight years of experience as a SWE/SRE in FAANG/big tech companies. I also already hold an MSc in Computer Science.

I am debating whether it might be worth pursuing an MSc in AI online and part-time. The reasons are simple:

* I became interested in ML and AI even before the recent AI hype. One of the companies I worked for offered a 6-month introductory training to ML. I tried to pivot to a different role internally where I could utilize these skills, but nothing was available then.
* The company where I currently work is pushing a lot for AI, and that's where most of their investments are.
* Completing my profile with a strong knowledge of AI can only benefit me and allow my profile to be more ""future-proof."" While I won't be able to compete with people with PhDs in AI, it might open some doors to apply for AI-savvy SWE roles.

From my little research, one that fits my requirements is the [National MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Limerick](https://ictskillnet.ie/courses/national-msc-in-artificial-intelligence/). The fees are also reasonable if subsidized through ICT Skillnet, it can be done part-time and it is fully online. My main doubts at the moment are regarding the workload and ROI. I have a full-time job with decent WLB, but I have a family with small kids and only a little free time. It might make more sense to learn through online courses like deeplearning.ai, fast.ai, etc., and build up knowledge without getting a formal degree.

What do you think? Has any of you done this MSc? If so, was it worth it?",2024-03-26 14:21:12

1b5mm2t,Accommodation rights for ADHD,"Hello everyone. I am a software engineer in one of the big multinationals and since I've had troubles focusing on meetings, hitting deadlines and things were slipping my mind too much I've been put on focus. I looked into ADHD and people's experiences with it and it matches pretty closely, so I booked appointments. But these take time, so meanwhile I've been trying to self-medicate with caffeine, nicotine and some online nootropics I found, but they weren't really effective and were causing me stomach aches.

My performance did improve, but apparently not enough (I should note the demands went up noticeably during focus and almost every mistake/miss was pointed out to me and documented, even things that he wouldn't mention before, which makes me worried he is trying to fill the firing quota and the decision's been practically already made) and it seems like in a couple weeks max I will be put on PIP. I will have my diagnosis till then, but no medications yet, because it needs a separate appointment to get (even after I get the first one, getting the correct dosage and type can take time). I did mention that I am seeking a diagnosis on it, but manager was dismissive saying ""ADHD pills aren't gonna save you"" implying it wouldn't be enough.

Could I ask for any accommodations when the PIP starts, like getting more time, fewer demands or maybe delaying it till I start medication? Is there a point fighting this or should I just take severance and look for another job? Thanks in advance for any advice.

Edit: Some people seem to think when I mentioned nootropics I meant stimulants or illegal drugs. I didn't, it was mind lab pro, it's fairly popular and legal as a nootropic, but I assume nowhere good enough as prescription ADHD medication.",2024-03-03 17:28:41

1bjbnht,To leave my current 12 month rolling contract role for a 6 month rolling contract role with higher pay?," 

**My Situation:**

I'm a 26-year-old data analyst with an Hdip in Data Analytics (graduated September 2022). Currently, I work for a government organisation on a 12-month rolling contract. The workload is alot. The salary (36,400€) also makes saving and building financial security difficult. This is further complicated by the lack of benefits like paid sick leave, causing stress when missing work could impact finances.

**The Opportunity:**

I recently received an offer for a similar civil service position with a significant 50% salary increase (56,300€). This increase will allow me to finally plan for the future (provided a stick it out for longer than a year). Additionally, the chance to learn new technologies is especially appealing, as I feel stuck in a rut with limited development opportunities in my current role. The role will be a six month rolling contract and will have similar right and protections to my current role (which is not a lot). 

**The Concerns:**

However, there are some red flags:

* **Hiring Process:** The offer came without an interview, raising questions about their vetting procedures.
* **Contract Length:** The 6-month rolling contract compared to my current 12-month one is concerning, despite reassurances of potential extension.
* **Limited Information:**  All i've had was a 15 minute phone call with the manager. he assured me that it is very likely that i will be extended after the 6 months. I reached out to a team member on linkedin. they said that all they would say was that it was a slow paced job with good learning opprtunties. i then asked him about the six month rolling contracts and he didn't reply. this guy has been working there about a year and a half and seems high up on the team. Again this seems like a bit of a red flag to me. 
* **Work-Life Balance:** Transitioning from a 2-days in the office  to a 5-days in the office  is a significant change.

**The Dilemma:**

While the financial improvements and learning potential are highly attractive, the job security and work-life balance concerns are substantial. Leaving my current  position for a potentially short-term solution is risky.

**The Potential Upside:**

If I can tolerate the role for at least a year, it becomes a worthwhile move. The financial security and acquired skills would be a valuable stepping stone for my career.

**Current Situation's Drawbacks:**

The reality is, my current role isn't ideal either. It offers:

* Low Pay
* Limited Development Opportunities
* Potential Overwork
* Lack of Appreciation
* Uncertain Future Job Security (12-month rolling contract)

**Job Market Considerations:**

Landing interviews for similar roles in my desired salary range has proven difficult. The current job market adds another layer of uncertainty.

**Seeking Guidance:**

I'm at a crossroads. Financial stability and professional development are both important to me. Ideally, I'd find a position offering both with strong job security.  Can you offer guidance on navigating this career decision?

From my own experience I’ve been in tech for nearly a quarter of a century and last used a recruitment agency back in 2000 to find a role.  Back then I was new to the industry and didn’t have any experience or contacts behind me.  I’ve changed jobs a few time since than and it’s either been through somebody I knew working in the company, a company recruiter reaching out to me or me applying directly to the company on their jobs portal.  It’s never occurred to me to use an agency for any of this and I figure it’s an easier hire decision for a company if they don’t have to pay 20% to an agency and gives me a bit more licence to ask for a slightly higher wage.  I know a lot of other folks with a similar background with similar stories.

So I’m curious about the profile of the folks that use agencies?  Are they mainly devs starting out on their career?  Or are they folks moving to Ireland from abroad and don’t know the lay of the land here?  Do any devs based in Ireland with experience use agencies?",2024-03-18 10:16:47

I am currently a software engineer in a large tech company with 5 YOE.

Recently I have been considering making a switch to become a CS teacher in a secondary school or college/IT.

I love programming, but I am getting jaded from climbing the corporate ladder, dealing with office politics, long hours, Oncall, etc

I think becoming a teacher would be a good option. I know it has a whole set of different challenges, but I think I would really value the additional time off, especially when I am older and have a family. I also was a teaching assistant in college and I found that to be very rewarding.

Has anyone here made such a switch or is planning to ?

* What additional qualifications did you need to become a CS Teacher? (I already have a CS degree)
* Would you need to teach an additional subject or is CS enough?
* Is it better to teach in a secondary school or college?

1bba78z,Does Job Hopping Between Contract Roles Matter?,"Since graduating in September 2022, I've been working as a Data Analyst in a government contract role for a year and a half. My contract is renewed on a annual basis.  While it's been a valuable first experience, the current salary of €36,400 makes saving in Dublin nearly impossible.

Living paycheck to paycheck is stressful, especially with student loans to repay. The fear of missing rent due to illness (no sick leave pay) adds another layer of anxiety. Additionally, I feel overworked and undervalued.

Fortunately, I recently received a €55,000 offer for another government contract position with a 6-month renewal cycle. This 45% raise would provide much-needed financial security.

Ideally, I'd like a long-term (2-3 year) role to avoid appearing like a job hopper. However, the new position requires a 5-day-a-week office presence, something I wouldn't prefer long-term.

Just wondering if it's a general expectation to get at least a small raise (ie 2%ish) to at least somewhat compensate for rising cost of living... Or if it's fairly normal to not get any raises in a position like mine . Word of mouth is that there will be very little on offer for raises this year.

1bii08p,Can a job be too soft,"TLDR: Im in my role a while, its quite interesting, lets me touch on lots of areas, lets me come and go to manage family commitments as I need and pays reasonably well.  
Should I enjoy it or am i getting soft?

&#x200B;

Im in my current company for circa a decade. Its a small/medium organization who use technology as an enabler but not for directly generating profit.  
I was brought in as a DBA, had my role changed to Data Engineer pretty quickly as the role required the technical and soft skills for breaking down departmental data silos.  
I felt stagnation after 5 years and resigned, so they altered my role to help keep me interested, giving input to projects outside of my field of expertise that required a technical viewpoint.  
I was allowed hire a technical resource to take some of the development workload.

  
Then 2 years ago I was given a role that is akin to Engineering Manager.  
I manage a small team of developers day to day, and although I am still relatively technical, I am more strategy focused.  
Its a bit of everything, I people manage, project manage, research for technical architecture, new platforms & lots more.   
Because it encompass so much, I do a lot of context switching throughout the day and dont have the focus time to be the technical implementation resource anymore.  
I struggled with this quite a bit initially, trying to squeeze (data engineering) development into the spaces between meetings, research and people management, but a few years has taught me to let go a bit, trust the team who know what they are doing and only take on what I can realistically manage.

  
I have two small kids and the role is very flexible around family commitments, school drop-off/pickup, sick kids, appointments, etc. This is a key point as it is of very high importance to me.

When I view other roles in the areas of Engineering Manager, Director of Analytics and similar level, they all appear to be full-time onsite, rigid start and end times, much more demands, much less space for life.

As I have been in this company so long I no longer know if my role is just a decent role, or its a very soft role and I will have a very sharp awakening when I leave.

1bjssg1,"What are Java jobs like, day to day?","Hey how you doing 😊

&#x200B;

I was reading for a while across Internet and decided to ask. I read that most new projects don't use Java, they pick some other languages, often related to JavaScript. Java was used in old projects, often in big financial companies and mostly you would fix bugs and have meetings with no end. Are there any exciting projects with Java? Or is it boring? I thought maybe I could make apps for Android in Java. 

&#x200B;

I'm thinking about doing some online course to get a better job in IT and in a few years good stable income.  Programming, network or even desktop support/sysadmin. So trying to decide between Java developer vs Full Stack developer. I'm aware it's hard for junior programmers now as there are no jobs, and maybe in IT in general but I will try. I also applied for FIT and will see how that goes. 

&#x200B;

I worked a bit in a low level technical/software support, played around with WordPress but don't have any IT qualifications/degrees and don't have any programming skills, only HTML and CSS. So I thought I would do some course. I can do some graphic design but there are little jobs in that, and low salaries. Maybe Fullstack developer would be more fun? Not sure if it involves websites development or other projects. 

&#x200B;

I must say I'm easily bored and my mind drifts. I would probably fall asleep in meetings. So I'm not sure Java is a good choice if it involves so many meetings?

&#x200B;

I'm also kind of interested in networks but again I thought I might get bored if all you do all day is monitor network. Penetration testing might be more fun. ",2024-03-21 00:07:20

1bph4f4,From IT Contractor to Permanent Employee,"Hey everyone, seeking some advice on a career move here.  
28, M, I've been working as an IT contractor for several years now, specializing as a senior web developer. My current gig pays well at 650eur/day, but my client has recently offered me a permanent position within their company.

Here's the thing: job security isn't my top priority right now. I enjoy the flexibility and financial perks of contracting, and the idea of being tied down to one employer doesn't quite appeal to me at the moment. Plus, I've heard rumblings that securing contract renewals might get trickier down the line.

On the other hand, constantly hunting for new gigs and competing with other candidates isn't exactly thrilling either. So, I'm torn between sticking with contracting or taking the plunge into permanent employment.

One major consideration is salary. I've been denied a raise in the past, so I'm looking for some assurances on compensation growth if I do decide to go permanent. Ideally, I'd like a 10% raise every one or two years to stay motivated and financially satisfied.

Any thoughts or advice on how to approach this decision? I appreciate any insights or experiences you all can share. Any proper way to convert my matter?

Additional details:  
\- I've been putting 20% of my gross into a Private Pension Fund  
\- 50eur/Monthly premium paid for Sick pay ensurance

1bnlyzi,CyberSecurity pathway?,"I am a 2nd year Computer Science student that hopes to pursue a career in Cyber Security as it seems really interesting to me as opposed to the usual Software Engineering route.

I'm not so worried about finding my niche yet, as I know the world of Cyber security is far too big a domain to just use an all encompassing title, but I'm sure I'll find it eventually.

The problem is that I have no clue what I should be doing with my time now before I graduate so that I can have the qualifications for a career.

I hear that a role in cyber security is far down the path of any technical career and you should start with a helpdesk role or IT internship first. I have no prior work experience other than a warehouse job I got after the leaving cert, so getting this seems like a long ways away.

to get one of these entry jobs they specify you need an IT or cyber security degree to get an interview, so does that mean my CS degree will be useless? will I have just wasted 4 years of my time when I should have done something else?

I would have no problem reading all about different areas of Cyber security + technical skills, going at my own pace while I have the time, but I've read a cert is more concrete than self learning projects so should I not bother self learning in my spare time.

with a certification I would need to start getting certs like the CompTia A+ or equivalent ones; even then would this be enough just to land an internship without the degree?

I wanna specify I still enjoy programming in languages like C and Assembly from what I've learned so far in my CS degree, I also love the Linux environment and participating in CTF's + reading about all branches of computing and mathematics, so I love my degree but I worry that I may have made a mistake when it comes to my actual career.

is this really the only path I have to get into the field? any suggestions of other routes for me would be great if you or anyone you know have experience in Cyber security.

My SO was doing the same job as me, but walked into a fantastic new position on the back of her similarly unrelated master’s degree (data science).

This master’s degree course isn’t specifically in what I plan on hanging my hat on for life, but my view is that it A) won’t bring my earning potential _down_, B) it will be beneficial even _if_ searching outside of cyber security jobs, and C) the time will pass anyway.

My family (including those in software development) feel that this would be a colossal waste of time. Are they correct?",2024-03-17 15:05:24

\- What is the quality of the lectures / teachers and is the course content quite up to date i.e is there  focus on using ai and other new tech.

1be9jso,Am I too optimistic? Irish dream and trasitioning to IT,"I'm planning a bold career shift. This year, I'll be studying a Level 8 Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Dublin. My goal is to move from my current business/marketing role in digital products to a hands-on IT position, ideally as a developer or software engineer.

My Background:

- No formal computer science degree.
- 5 years of work experience: 3 years as a 'Product Owner' managing the development of digital products in non-tech businesses. 1 year as a business analyst. 1 year as a junior product owner.
- Self-taught some JavaScript, basic web development concepts, and familiar with cloud technologies.
- Passionate about IT! Devs say I'm understanding and a good manager.

The Plan:

- Take a year off work to focus on the diploma, with a part-time job to help with expenses.
- Aim to land a junior IT role in Ireland soon after graduation.
- Leverage the Level 8/9 graduate visa to work in Ireland for a year.
- Hope to secure a critical skills job for a longer stay.

Questions:

- Is this plan realistic?
- Any advice for someone making this transition?
- What challenges should I expect?
I have enough saved for a year with a minimum wage job, but I'll need that full-time IT role afterward. Any perspective is truly appreciated!

TLDR: Non-tech professional with product management experience wants to become a developer in Ireland. Is this possible?

&nbsp;

I'm just interested in getting some insight here. I have nearly 11 years experience in my career and am currently in a senior management role. My experience looks this:

* Started with Company A, worked there for 4.5 years (left for career reasons).

* Moved to Company B, worked there for 2.5 years (left after being furloughed for Covid).

* Returned to Company A because Covid had just kicked off and everything was very uncertain. I stayed there for 2 years and moved on again for career development reasons.

* Started with Company C, my current company, and have been here for 1.5 years now.

&nbsp;

I've recently been approached by Company B to see if I would come back for a new opportunity and I'm really considering it. Not only is this is a great opportunity with a bump in seniority level and salary, but even before this I've been a little worried about the stability of the company I'm currently with so I'm quite keen on it. I'm also very concerned however that another move this soon might be harmful to my long term prospects because I'm going to be seen as a job hopper on future applications.

1bcxuig,Job Market Experience Expectations,"I've been applying for jobs recently, and it seems like I'm just being automatically rejected from most companies for not having the required experience in XYZ framework or whatever. 

I've been programming professionally for six odd years, with four of those spent building fairly successful iOS apps as an indie dev. I'd rather not continue in the iOS world (and it seems very few companies here are hiring anyway). I understand that this means I'm likely to take a hit on salary etc., but it seems like I'm being rejected out of hand for even basic roles because I haven't spent two years writing React professionally. 

Maybe it's ego on my part, but after this long programming I'm pretty confident I could be productive in a new framework pretty quickly -- I know the fundamentals and the rest is mostly translation. 

I could express all this in an interview, along with selling myself as a self-starter with an innovative entrepreneurial mindset and all that jazz (and I do sincerely believe I'd be an asset to a team) but if I don't get called for interviews I'm stuck. 

I get that the market is very tight right now, and a four-year stint as an indie might put people off as I haven't been working in a big ol' scrum team, but I'm genuinely unsure how to proceed here.

Should I be doing some sort of a course to show willing? If so are there any that hiring managers (or their AI friends) actually respect?

1br0x00,Entry-Level/Grad Advice,"Hi everyone, big fan of the community, though admittedly a bit of a lurker. Messaging on behalf of a family member who’s really struggling with the job hunt right now.

They graduated with the joint CS bachelors/masters (first class honours) from trinity back in 2023, but ended up missing the boat on the grad program cycle, and took a year out to pursue other stuff (competitive sports). 

They re-applied for grad roles in 2024, but really struggled to land anything. Secured 2 offers from KPMG (IT Audit) and the Central Bank (back office stuff), but to be honest I think they’re capable of more, and fear these roles would mean missing the boat on being a software dev/ struggling more down the line, especially with good credentials right now.

Would love some advice. 

(1) is it still possible to recruit just-in-time for entry-level roles starting in September? And if so, does anyone have any leads on companies that would hire for these sort of roles/where to look?

(2) was this last graduate cycle particularly grim?

(3) if they ended up having no other option, which of the two offers do you think would be best on a CV if they were to push for dev roles after a year?

1bmj8kj,What to do now?,"Rant alert, and apologies in advance for the long post, summary is: I am stuck on what to do after I graduated and can't find a job. My experience is all over the place, and basically: *Jack of all trades*, *master of none,* except I am not a proper jack of all the trades (bit of imposter syndrome I hope). What do I do?

Fresh graduate and just stuck on not knowing what to do.

I have experience as a ""junior"" system administrator at a school, and junior in quotes since there was no senior. I was alone, but still didn't do anything massive, so I wouldn't call myself a full on system administrator. 

For example, I set up their website including domain purchase and sub domains and such, but it was a drag and drop, not to be confused with experience in HTML/JS. I set up their LMS, a script setup. I signed them up to Google suite for education. Set up their accounts, and their classrooms. 

Besides these, I handled also support for the teachers and students/parents. Whether for their accounts that I made or hardware needs. For example, fixed computers around the school, Set up a school network, which is literally just plug in switches and one consumer level router, that came from the ISP. 

I sometimes also help with the camera system, debugging what the issue is, whether network, or the camera it self.

Besides this ""work"" experience, I also did the internship with them where I coded a python script/program, that would handle their attendance sheet to clean it up and provide them with late people, and how late they were, etc.

In the mean time in Uni, my whole life was Java. We were taught OOP in Java. We were taught coding itself in Java, and all projects was in Java, including my thesis project where I used for the first time Spring, and this whole environment to make a web application. P.s. I am uni graduate of an EU uni (Hungary,Budapest), but am not an EU citizen.

I speak English as you can see at a C1 level, and a bit of German, but only up to like A2.

So now I don't know what to do. Do I focus on learning more Python? go down the data engineering path and so on? or should I focus on more Java, and its frameworks, Spring and such? Should I focus on learning German properly? Should I work on getting certificates or badges, like AWS or similar? 

Salaries I saw, show that Data related roles such as Data engineering and such are higher than those in other fields. But its not like I am getting anywhere in either, so not sure it should be a factor, but its what made me interested in maybe learning more python and related tech.

I have been applying for months now, and haven't reached the interview stage except for once. I have tried applying to almost everything: Python, Java, System administration, Teaching, Support. 

I understand the job market is bad, so what do you think I should do to improve my chances?

Sorry for the long post, and would've posted my cv but there is so many copies, I am not sure what I should post or not, in all cases its here also, but you can see the actual details in the paragraphs above. For example more experiences that I wasn't sure to include or not, is more teaching I did while at Uni.

Between llm help, youtube tutorials, and whatever else I can get my hands on I've been working on a few projects.

So when I look to add functionality or reuse the code it's a bit of a hot-mess. 

I was about to push the button on a website called ""Superprof"" which offers tutors, but the amount of negative reviews of that site put me off. 

So, if anyone knows of or could recommend someone who could act as a bit of tutor/senior dev/code reviewer, to point me in the right direction that would be great.

Or maybe there's some other forum or discord group I should check out?

1b785rh,How to approach my belief that I am a grade behind where I should (private sector),"I have been with a company for many years now and have had some promotions. I have changed manager recently.

Back a number of years ago, I was given a promotion at the same time the company went through a changing of the grades. I got promoted into, I'll call it, B1. This meant I was seen as being in say, C4, before this. 

Reading through the grade documentation, the C group is for admin or clerical work supporting other processes. Now you could argue that's what I was doing, however to me it seems to be more for admins or PA's.

In the B group, it lists that this is someone delivers through their own work mainly, requires college education and it gives examples of jobs that this applies to....one of those was very similar title to what I was before promotion.

I got another promotion a few years back to take me to B2.

In the documentation, it gives an example of a fictional company and what each grade would equal to in terms of knowledge.  For this fictional company, we'll pretend it's a bicycle company, for the grade I am in it says 'can replace chain, shown how to repair chain'

Next grade is 'determines strength of chain required, knows a lot about gears'

Next grade is 'understands frame manufacture'

My manager left and now I have a new one. He has discussed expanding my job and giving me more work to do.

In my review he said 'What grade are you, B3?' and I chimed in and said no I am B2. Then he went on to say he wanted to expand my job and work on a grade promotion.

I believe now that if I was at B3, they would have said the same thing about moving me into B4. 

I have assumed a lot of extra responsibility over the last couple years during my current role and it wasn't recognised with a promotion. I think I deserve to be B4 with the new promotion soon, my current grade appears to me to be a very basic level while I think the responsibilities I have are quite high.

Another reason why I think I am a grade behind is that every year I get the top rating. I do work hard, but I am average in my view and think they could do better than me. Maybe I'm wrong, but if someone is getting top marks every year, they're in the wrong grade.  

I was thinking of using time in the year look ahead, to ask them if they thought B2 was the correct grade for the job/role I am in. And then when he answers, explain that I think my current grade sounds basic while I think my role is not basic.

I don't want to come off confrontational or unhappy but at the same time I do think I'm a grade behind.

1bivuyn,Evaluating a senior software engineer Offer in Ireland,"I’m in the process of relocating to Ireland and have recently received a job offer to work remotely as a senior software engineer. The offer is for an annual salary of €75,000. Given the cost of living and the standard market rates in Ireland, I’m trying to understand whether this is a competitive and fair offer.

I have a PhD in computer science but no previous experience as a software engineer. This position is R&D senior software engineer.

EDIT: I wanted to address some concerns that some of you may have regarding my senior position at 0 YOE. I understand that it may have seemed surprising, but there's no mystery behind it. My team considered my four-year PhD and one-year postdoctoral experience as a qualification for the job, which required 5-7 YOE. Many of my peers who have completed their PhDs have landed senior data scientist or senior software engineer roles, as it is a lot of work! My PhD is in AI and computer vision, where software engineering techniques are essential in ensuring that experiments work correctly. I'm excited to shift my focus from solving research problems to business problems. I should also mention that this position is highly specialized and related to my PhD, which is why the team was interested in my profile. No doubt that it may not be easy to qualify for any other senior software engineering position that is not related to my PhD topic. I hope this can help to contextualise this job offer.

  
EDIT: I just wanted to clarify something - even though the job is remote, I need to be based in Ireland. I really appreciate all the great advice you guys have given me. It seems like senior engineers might make more money, but considering my current situation, I think I should go ahead and accept the job offer. I came across a salary guide (9 dots survey) that suggests a salary of 80k or more is normal for senior software engineers in Ireland.

1b85wib,looking for advice in regards to australia,"Hello. I'll try and shorten this as much as possible.

I graduated just before covid in the field of computer science, jobs were frozen around then (least in my city) so I took a job as ""IT support"" (for context, some people call it a system engineering gig, it's not the usual hello sir please turn off your pc gig we have a lot of different fields and services for this job such as networking, cyber security, SQL a lot of stuff, just the offcial title is support agent) and have been working in it for around 1.5 years now. 

I met this girl. Training to be a doctor, madly in love boys she's everything I could want and more. She's in final year, what she has left is

4 months of actual college/exams 

6 months in one hospital in ireland 

6 months in another in ireland

1 year abroad 

Now for the abroad part she wants to go to austalia. This is the part that worries me. How feasible is it I'll get another IT/software/cybersecuity/developer job on one of those working visas while she does the year there? I don't wanna lose her, she's honestly the best but from the research I've done it's apperently impossible and I should be expecting to work as a sheep sheerer for a year.

Note: her moving away while I stay here is not on the cards, we're both a bit clingy and a whole year of separation would drive us insane.",2024-03-06 17:39:57

I was hired as application support as could not get my foot in the door anywhere last year and when I joined my company implemented saleaforce and since my second week in the company I've been doing to roll of a SF admin, there was 1 other guy doing the admin work but he left last September and suddenly I found myself in a position as the sole admin in the company and have rolled out a full adaption on my own.
I done the business analysis role also gathering requirements etc. 

And in the last few months I've started to play around with developing some custom features with apex and have developed something significantly valuable that solved a major buisness problem and would have cost between 10-15k for the 3rd party to develop.

I am definitely underpaid so was wondering should I ask for a raise? If so what would I say?

If I shouldn't ask why?

I will be with the company 1 year in May.

I was a mature student and graduated a year and a half ago.

Im aware I would have to do a masters after the conversion course. So giving 3 years of study, do people think it would be realistic to make 80k plus within 5 years? This is what would be needed to buy alone and I would be 37 at that point so would have to own by then. (Expected it at 27 not 37)

1bk32m6,CV Advice,"Hello, looking for advice on my CV and how to make the most of the space. 

&#x200B;

I started my career in IT as a full-time paid intern for 6 months for company A. After the internship ended, 2 months later I came back to the same place to work in a part-time capacity for 8 months until I graduated my bachelors degree (doing about 3 days per week and 4/5 days when I was more free). 2 months later I started to work there full time again for another 2+ years until I moved to company B.

What would be the best way to convey this experience with this company? I feel like having 3 separate entries for the same job from intern to associate to full-time would be a waste of space on the CV especially as I add more experience over time but at the same time I want to convey that I have 3+ years of experience with this company rather than just 2.

The issue is that these 3 years were built up with a few months gaps in between so when asked for a reference from HR, the previous company gives my latest start date which was when I joined full time 2 months after. 

&#x200B;

So my work experience would look something like this: 

\- Company B (full-time)

\- Comapny A (full-time) (2 months later)

\- Comapny A (Part-time) (2 months later)

\- Company A (Intern full-time)

They claim that participants can have 0 experience in the IT world and still be offered an entry level job as soon as the course is finished, and that they will connect employees with employers.

Reading some posts about the scarcity of jobs and getting to know that salary threshold is being increased to 44K Euros from next year has made me feel anxious and hopeless. I have started to feel I committed a blunder by choosing to pursue my post-graduation in Ireland at this point in time. I have already paid 50% tuition fees to the university (7250 Euros) and cannot back out now.

I am a Computer Science undergraduate with 2 YoE as a front-end developer and after getting laid off in Dec 2022 and staying unemployed more than a year, I decided to pursue the MS route and TU Dublin was the best college I got an admit from.

Do you anticipate the job market improving even marginally in the near future and/or if there is anything I could do to position myself well for software engineer jobs as someone with mere 2 years of experience? I would really need to have a job paying 38K-44K Euros by the time I graduate in Aug 2025 or else I will be in serious debt.

1bd215n,How to Secure Visa sponsorship jobs or Internships in Ireland as an International Student while pursuing Masters?,"Hi all,



I am from India, and I'm going to pursue MSc in Software Design and Cloud Native Computing, Level 9 at TUS Athlone starting in September 2024. While I did some research before application and acceptance, I am still not satisfied with the overall answers I have come across on Reddit and other places. Hence, I thought of asking it right here.



A bit about myself:



Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering (4 years)

2 years of work experience as a Software Developer (SDE-1)

My concerns as an international student:



Provided I have 2 years of work experience, do you guys think I should look out for summer internships? How will my profile look with a summer internship experience on top of full-time experience back from home?

When is the right time to start applying for summer internships? Typically, summer internships start in late May and run until August. Given this timeframe, when is the optimal time to start applying considering interviews, technical rounds, rejections, and other time factors?

I do understand that job searching is not easy, especially in current difficult times. Considering this, how early should I start applying, or when is the right time to start applying for full-time jobs once I'm in Ireland?

I came across a comment in one of the threads (unable to find the thread, sadly) stating that recruiters don't hire international students on student visas due to visa complications. If this is the case, how are some international students receiving full-time job offers and starting right after completing their courses? Note, I am not talking about finding a job when on a graduate visa.

Please share your experiences.



Thank you.

18q4qbh,Anyone been watching the Twitter saga unfold?,"Most of you will be familiar with the story. The biggest tech story of last year may have been the purchase of Twitter by mega-mogul / billionaire Elon Musk.

To catch some of you guys up, the story has unfolded like this.

Oct '22: after proposing an acquisition of Twitter; then reneging on this offer, then getting sued. Musk acquires Twitter for $44 billion.

Jan '23: after firing 80% of Twitter's workforce. Twitter has only 550 full-time employees left. To administrate a social network that had 330 million active users (2019 figure).

Nov '23: Musk fires the CEO and CFO. Twitter stock gets delisted from the Stock Exchange. He later fires an employee who critized him.

A whole host of top execs resign from the company after Musk issues a statement that employees should work longer hours or resign from the company.

Large advertisers like General Motors, Volkswagon, announce an advertising pause. Advertising Agencies warn their clients against advertising on the platform citing ""increased hate speech"". At this stage Twitter is losing $4 million per day.

Twitter experiences a huge increase in ""hate speech"" and is accused of prioritising right-wing content.

Moral of the story: the billionaire moguls that society loves to paint as superhuman role-models. 

...are in fact mortal like the rest of us. Tax these guys properly before they piss their entire fortunes up against a wall.",2023-12-24 21:52:09

14l67uw,Advice on moving to a lower salary,"Hey folks, here's the deal: I currently make €200k per year, and I just got a promotion that will bump me up to the 225-250k range. A colleague 2 levels up (before my promo) from me (still an IC) makes €300k. But here's the kicker—I'm seriously thinking about leaving Ireland for a bunch of reasons that are taking a toll on my sanity. The breakdown:

Where my comp comes from:

* I'm a Security Engineer working for a smaller US company, specializing in a ""niche"" area.
* Security org is small. Talent density is through the roof. My teammates are a bunch of geniuses. So company pays top dollar.
* We're only 2 people in EU. Everyone else is in the US.
* I've only got three years of experience, but in my early teens I did some pretty cool stuff in the security scene. That's what got me this.

The Problem:

Living in Ireland is mentally unsustainable for me. I'm originally from Spain and been living here for 2 years. I have made a lot of friends and my girlfriend is here. However, living in Dublin is making me crazy. I hate it every day of the week. The horrible infrastructure, no things to do and a laundry list of things that won't get fixed anytime soon have taken a toll on my mental well-being. Plus, paying half of what I earn in taxes to live in a place like this? Here's what I've tried so far:

* Relocating within the company: I've been trying to get a transfer to other countries where we have offices, but it's been a no-go. Legal red tape because of what I do.
* Finding another job in Ireland that allows me to relocate: lots of recruiters have reached out to me, but once I mention my salary, 95% of them are like, ""Sorry, can't match that."" The remaining 5% that can match offer me roles that I don't like.
* Exploring opportunities in different countries directly: first things first, the US is a big no for me. Been there a lot and I hate it. Nope. I've checked out other EU countries that I like, but none of the job offers I've come across would pay me more than 100-120k. So that would more than halve my salary.
* Chasing after those ""truly remote"" jobs: I've had some conversations about truly remote positions, but honestly, none of them have sparked my interest. Some of them seem sketchy (crypto and fintech), and I value stability in my career.
* Going back to Spain: I come from a small town in Spain where the cost of living is super low. There's an arbitrage opportunity by taking remote job and working from there. To me that would mean letting my current situation kill my dream of going out and explore the world. I wanna leave it for when I retire.

So, here's where I'm at: I feel like the quickest way to escape this misery is to find a lower-paying job in a country I like. But I don't want to do something rash that might ruin my career ambitions. I still want to live a comfortable life and have the freedom to do so wherever I please. My privileged position points to being able to do that if I handle it well, but I don't know how. I'm sure someone in this sub has been through a similar situation.

qhhnn0,A COVID compliance ticketing app for Irish nightclubs,"Hi everyone,

I would like to get some thoughts on the above. Surely, the following would be a quick turnaround for a small company that is already in the app development space. Any thoughts on why a suitable app has not already been released?

Requirements:
A registered data controller for GDPR compliance.
A hosted native app (iOS, android) and web portal that allows an end user to register an account either as a nightclub or individual.
An individual can upload a digital COVID cert, a photo id and payment method.
OCR to verify that the cert and photo id have matching details.
A marketplace to allow nightclubs to sell tickets to individuals.
An NFC connection between the individual's phone and the nightclub door staff running the app that, at the point of entry to the nightclub, allows the door staff to view the photo id and verify the identify of the individual by simply holding the phones close together.

Any thoughts on why two or three seasoned app developers with an existing library of components (user registration forms etc) could not roll this out in a fortnight?",2021-10-28 07:36:57

182tt86,Company withhold my unpaid vacation days,"Hi guys,

Another day goes by and the war with my ex company continues! A company that put a handful of employees out of payment the last few months, in a state called ""temporary lay off"" because they were useless enough to retain new clients or new  projects to their only one big existing client!

Eventually, i handed my resign letter since I found a better opportunity.

The thing is that my company owns me still almost 20 days unpaid vacations and they withhold this amount till i return the equipment (a cheap ass monitor and laptop and headphones with keyboard/mouse etc).

I told them , that i urge them to proceed with the payment and they can withhold as an insurance an amount of my unpaid vacation days till we figure out all the details and logistics of returning this equipment(i am not living anyway anymore in Ireland). I havent yet got an answer but i wanted to hear second opinions as well.

Is it legal to withhold ALL the amount of my unpaid vacation days till all the equipment is returned when the equipment is way cheaper than the whole amount that i am owned?

Also they say they can't proceed with the payroll before end of December since the November timeline got lost but since i am not technically an employee for them arent they forced to issue a payroll anyway for that special case?",2023-11-24 14:53:03

vvp7sx,Is AI just a dodgy marketing scheme?,"Hear me out on this one. Don't just down vote me and move on pls!

I've been working in marketing for a while ( I have some dev experience though ), and whenever I hear about a piece of software advertising itself as 'AI'? I immediately think 'dodgy marketing ploy'.

I'd love to get the opinion of the full-time devs on r/DevelEire. Many of whom work with AI companies.

The reasons for my scepticism are...


1. Alphabet/Google have stated outright that software is incapable of meaningful creativity, goal setting and strategy. IMO this isn't going to change anytime soon.

2. I do a little copywriting and the 'AI' copywriting software gives me the impression it was developed by a first-year CS student.

3. Everyone who can afford to drop €150 on Fiverr for a piece of crapware markets their software as 'AI'!

4. IMO machine learning (ML) and true AI aren't the same thing, ML is revolutionising the internet. Almost every Google product uses ML to great effect.

5. I've never used a piece of software that I'd consider AI. Not Google, not Amazon, not M$. Noone has even passed the Turing test yet, AFAIK.


I've had this conversation with deep learning specialists and they weren't able to convince me otherwise. I have some dev experience but I'm definitely not an AI programmer.

I am almost 40, been in the Telecom industry as a sales and business development manager dealing with contracts, customers suppliers, and buying and selling wholesale telecom services for the past 10 years. Not in Ireland though.

Here in Ireland now for about 2 years, unable to land a sales job in tech, just recently had my interview with BT (British Telecom) for a sales role and they froze new hirings till last quarter. Sales roles in the telecom industry (B2B voice sales positions, I am not talking about door-to-door retail selling roles) are rare in Ireland, so I have been looking for sales positions in the tech industry but I have not heard back from any of the jobs I apply for. I have applied for plenty of jobs past 2 years, entry-level to mid-level roles and I get no replies. Yes, I have updated my CV, and tweaked it to somehow match the job requirement. Nothing...

I have read here getting a sales job in the tech is not that hard and that there are plenty of roles, but I have been unable to even get to an interview process. 

I am not from EU, but I do not need visa sponsorship, I do not think this would be an issue. What am I doing wrong here? Any insight would be great, anyone knows of any open position in their company please also let me know, even if it is an entry-level job, I hope finding the next job would be easier when I finally have some working experience in Ireland on my resume. 

Currently, I am traveling every morning to Dublin and back from Westmeath and work as a truck driver till I find a possibility to get back to similar job I used to have.

My plan ended on the 27th. 3 calculates your data usage for a period, aggregates it and then publishes events which you can see in my3.

The bug? 

I got one of these data events timestamped 00:00:00 on the 28th, and as on the 28th I was out of plan, this even was charged at the out of plan rate, costing me the remaining €52 credit in my account.

I reached out to their support, and twice got them to raise a support ticket, which when I reached out for an update they said it was closed and that nothing was wrong (and they never thought of notifying me either of the times)

I'm looking for any advices/experiences as I'm very much frustrated and feeling like all paths are narrow or highly competitive.

To make it short, I'm a 25 yr Female, non Irish/EEA, having already a Bachelor degree in Philosophy & Logic. I'm currently living in Ireland with my husband working in Software industry, I'm on stamp 1G residency.

I am looking to enroll for an Undergrad program in CS, I'm already familiar for a while with CS basics to a fair extent, implemented much algorithms/problem solving, familiar with DS/OOP and a bunch or programming languages plus did some basic software stuff and aware of the field but looking for solid ground education + degree.

Also a note: I'm not looking for any kind of financial aid and I'm able to afford the international students fees

I found at first that many universities offer some places for mature applicants, however the process seems very ambiguous with no clear criteria of selection or even what are the number of places offered.

One university such as TUDublin also mentioned that mature students definition includes only Irish/EEA \[[https://www.tudublin.ie/study/undergraduate/cao/entry-routes/mature-applicants/\]](https://www.tudublin.ie/study/undergraduate/cao/entry-routes/mature-applicants/]). However, it also has a whole section in their website for international applicants. which in the requirement section links for either leaving cert criteria, or the mature applicants page again??

I also found UCD's Open Learning Progression Pathway for CS \[[https://www.ucd.ie/all/cometoucd/applying/openlearning/\]](https://www.ucd.ie/all/cometoucd/applying/openlearning/]) It looked somehow promising however it only offers just two positions for the highest GPA's, quite a stretch narrow probability to bet or waste a year on?

Could these courses even if not leading to UCD's program after, be used to support other applications?

Anyone here having experience with UCD Open Learning Progression Pathway, or even any experience applying as a mature student as a non-EEA? what are the chances of acceptance? number of applicants? competition? selection criteria?

Please advice as I'm starting to feel very pessimistic,

Thanks all in advance",2023-08-21 02:05:04

If it's acceptable to begin a text with ""So..."" I don't know. But that's how this feels. 

Let me say that I live a *very* privileged life. Coming to Ireland a few years ago, as a poor migrant, doing manual labour and security for a while, I eventually ended in a corporate job that pays me well and I am living the good life. 

But my current job is draining my existence and it's so mind numbing that most days, I feel my brain is a weight I carry around to have something pushing me against the ground, so I don't float away. I'm wasting 9 hours a day doing something that does not interest or excite me. I want something more. 

I'm taking a BSc. in Information Systems with TUD. Part time. Currently 3rd year. I recently ""published"" a Flask web application I developed. Very functional, very proud but nothing special.

Now, this application I suspect is what gave me a chance with the 2K Graduate Programe. They sent me an invitation to their webinar and I'm waiting to receive my Hackerrank challenges. Followed by a take home challenge and an interview. 

The problem is, I don't know C++. I started learning it today, went through the whole Codecademy course but that won't be enough. 

I'm having angry thoughts about going to work tomorrow and spending 9 hours in which I am not coding, I am not learning, I am just... There. I absolutely hate it and that makes me feel like a spoiled brat. But somehow I need to change jobs into something that challenges me intellectually. I got recently diagnosed with some shite, my brain is my best functioning organ and I need to use it. 

I am not sure if this post is a rant or an ask for help. Would anyone be able to direct me towards what I should be learning for the 2K job application process? Anyone went through the process and has more details?

I currently use an IPad for the sole purpose of taking notes for studying and because its handier than carrying around nmerous copies.

Can anoyone explain to me who in the right mind thought it would be a great idea to have the reply function on apple email app default set to ""reply all""?

I typically use my laptop or phone to reply to emails where the default setting is to reply to the individual who sent the email with the option to reply to all if needed by selecting an extra tab (how it rightly should be), but to my embarrasment ive now replied to a group email that was meant to be confidential. (nothing serious just not my most shining moment)

Ive only had issues with the IPad since i got it (my only and last apple product), the UI and requirements to do simple tasks (download an app) drives me mad.

yyqkhz,Dublin work life balance - please give me perspective as I am an American,"Hi Reddit fam,

I am an American in the business intelligence/data analytics space moving to Dublin 18 next month. I was curious in GENERAL what is the culture in Dublin/Ireland in regards to work life balance?

I would be working with data engineering and visualization with the likes of snowflake/bigquery and tableau/looker. In the United States it is almost a sin to ask for work life balance and you are expected to give every inch you possibly can for the company since it is such a blessing to be employed by them. I feel like, limited perspective, the capitalist entrepreneurship mentality is so deeply ingrained that our entire society doesn't have much of a choice but to acquiesce.

I have also always heard that the European mentality and culture is ""better"" than the US when it comes to work life balance. So here are a few questions.

Would it be looked down on to work only 40 hours in a week and want to be home the rest of the hours?

Are most companies looking to offer pto but look down on you when you use it?

Are you allowed to shift hours to accommodate other events that may pop up in life?

Do your direct manager and team mates feel like they have a secret culture of work shaming if you get the job done and you go home?

In line with the previous question, do you feel like I'm general your manager and team mates have your best vested interest in mind and want to support your personal and professional development?

Just looking for some societal rules of thumb here.
For example you would be a Chad demigod in the United States of you were able to maintain working 90 hours week in and out and produce the output of an entire team. Once this happened the manager would in turn start judging your other team mates based on the bar you set. Everything is sacrificeable for the ultimate goal, the bottom line.",2022-11-18 18:10:05

# ""Losing my job in the Irish tech industry: ‘I received the dreaded email ...’"",

Sorry, Julia. You're really in the HR industry.

Another example: "" Stripe, the online payments company ... told staff in an email that it was cutting 14 per cent of its workforce.... Industry sources suggest many of the roles will be in recruitment.""

Again, sad for those in recruitment, but no bearing on the tech industry.

A lot of people make big bones about how the ""work in the tech industry"" and then you find out they do sales, advertising, HR, copywriting etc.... Jobs that are not so much in the Tech industry as they are in the business part of every industry.

I myself started off doing non-tech jobs in the tech industry.

Just found out the receptionist at my last job lost her job in the Tech industry. No more will she sit at the front desk, answering the phone and checking the badges of people coming through the door.... or rather, she will continue to do just that, but in another office someplace else.

Actually, there's one company that could stand to lose their entire recruitment department -  MICROSOFT -  dickheads that they are. (A few years ago, after one of them was rude to me in a second round interview, I told her she could shove her job up her arse and promptly hung up on her). As I understand it, from many colleagues who have interviewed for them, they are the worst shower of arseholes in Ireland. So perhaps I have a bias....

EDIT: Odd that I would be attacked and called a liar for pointing out the ""lived experience"" of myself and at least 30 other people who interviewed for Microsoft (for a non-dev role, I should add). Most of those people shut their mouths and took the job and still work for Microsoft today.

Criticize another company on Develeire (Twitter for example).... No Problemo! Criticize Microsoft.... ""Woah, Dude! You're crossed a line. You're a liar!"".... That should tell you something.... LOL",2022-11-14 17:40:49

anyone know of any companies that provide Alsexa skill and Google Action development work? have a project on the burner and not having much success finding potential venders.

edit: to clarify the company I work for is starting a project that aims to use Alexa Skills and Google Actions to allow users access content and services on a smart speaker like the Echo or Home. there would also be a need for an interaction with Sales Force and some form of database or content management system. 

I have been trying to find some vendors that provide development of Alexa Skills or Google Actions. so similar to how someone would hire a 3rd party to develop a mobile app or website or whatever for them, we are looking for someone to develop the Skills and Actions and any subsequent integrations to Sales Force or required databases/content management systems for us.

so I'm looking for the names of potential development companies I can contact to see if they would be able to help us and quote for the work.

191i9r0,"Help me understand why I am so stupid, situation of hopelessness and how to recover","Hello all, Firstly I am not  unemployed, 3YOE with a ok salary. But doesn't matter anything I do, I  am just an abject failure, a big project getting it merged, fail,  getting a new job fail, improving myself, a failure.

At  present I just want to leave my job and start a new one, but don't have  one in hand. I used to consider myself good, I used to (still am) able  to do LC medium and 30-40% ish of the hard ones, I used to consider  myself good at dev, I follow the best of paterns and stuff and as such  in work as well as personal, I didn't have much reviews even the most  stringest reviews are ok at work (my latest was a 1800 line change, only  7-8 comments on the whole code, most of it was fine). I try to keep up  learning, I am going over a few books to learn the insides and  architecture.

But  still, I am a total failure, the 1800 line change, although not  completely my fault, is going on for \~4 months now, I say not completely  my fault because the entire proejct is quite big, building testing,...  takes quite a large amt of time, we need >5 reviews for this work,  and chasing people for reviews is tedious to say the least, asking for  help I need to wait for days (once 2 weeks chasing, I got a person),  even today, I texted in the morning, till now waiting just to get a  reply. Now my manager is chasing me, his manager, the other team, when  it's not (TOTALLY) my fault, I accept a lot of fault is mine, probably  90% but I don't know when the time went, thats the problem. I update the  status daily to my manager and his superior. Fyi, I am not blaming the  org, its a pretty chill org, so the fault lies in me, I just dont know  what I am doing wrong.

I suck at  my work, I suck at dev, I suck at most things, and I have not only  started applying now, around June-July I applied 200+, from Dec again  200+, not one call, I got an email for google, but the recruiter is now  ""looking for a suitable opening"", but nothing else. And I have 0 hope I  can clear it, considering I can just get by some of the hard questions  in LC.

My  work is a total shitfest, I work in everything under the sun, and as  such I don't have anything I can say I am an expert on (professionally,  personally I have a decent knowledge on the inner workings on Spark,  Hadoop, Docker, k8s), I was about to take the docker certification  examination but it was way too expensive, company said they would  sponsor but would need me to sign a bond of sort for a few years and I  didn't think it was the best idea.

In  work, I have worked on C#, Angular, Python, Java, Spring boot, k8s,  Flume (OSS contribution as well), Kafka, Solr, ELK (Elastic logstash  kibana), gRPC & protobuf, airflow, autosys.... these all just in the  last 6 months, and its tiring to say the least. My current project, I  am working on a micro service with stupid amount of everything. There  are many more stuff in \~3 years of exp.

I am attaching my resume, please give me any pointers on

1. What can I do to improve? I suspect my communication is very poor, tips to work on that + any other things I could do
2. How to search for a job? I am interested in Dev Roles + Data Engg roles, just not a mixture I am working on now

Here's Patrick Breyer talking about a vote to happen in the European Parliament tomorrow.

[Indiscriminate messaging and #chatcontrol](https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/indiscriminate-messaging-and-chatcontrol-last-chance-to-protest/)

The proposed change will '**allow e-mail and messaging providers to indiscriminately scan and search your private messages for suspicious content in real-time'.** To me this seems like an(other) attempt to mark everyone as suspicious all the time. After all, if you've done nothing wrong then you've got nothing to hide. I've called/messaged (hah) most of my MEPs. I think this legislation is wrong headed, counter productive and a bad plan for the future.

&#x200B;

If you're a techy, then it is likely that you'll have a more-than-averagely informed opinion about this sort of thing. Maybe you think about privacy more than most people because you're more aware than most people of how weak the protections are. I hope that you'll agree with me that granting ISPs carte-blanch to rummage through our communications (and yes, I do understand that this happens a lot already for commercial reasons - and I don't like that either) is a bad thing. I think you could do worse than poke your MEP on the topic. You can find out who they are [at the European Parliament site](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/ireland/en/your-meps)",2021-07-05 15:13:54

1awa3c5,How can I get a medical exemption to work from home due to chronic pain?,"Hello!

I suffer from a great deal of chronic back and neck pain. This started as soon as I graduated uni and begun working in an office full time. Before COVID hit and I was in the office every day I was in some of the worst day to day pain of my life from sitting at a desk, and I had to take several sick days as I could barely get out of bed some days. I had just assumed that was permanent.

As soon as COVID hit and we were completely work from home, I'd say at least 75% of my pain went away within a month. For the first time I could actually live a normal life again and not be in pain. I was also able to accomplish much more at work and was promoted twice during these years. 

Now that we are 50% back in the office, much of my pain has come back. Much of it has been able to be kept at bay due to ""coffee badging"" but that doesn't seem very sustainable, and it only partially solves the problem as this requires 2 hours of sitting on a bus at minimum, which causes pain. 

I do have a standing desk but am not able to use this all day as I don't have the best knees either. I also exercise every day and take several breaks throughout the day.

I did see a doctor about this in my home country right before I moved here. I spent several years with multiple physical therapists, but didn't see a lot of improvement. A few doctors suspected scoliosis. But when I saw a spine surgeon and got an MRI, he said my spine was completely fine and the pain was likely muscular. The only conclusion I got was that some people's anatomies are not well suited to sitting all day and mine was one of them. 

My question is, is there a process with doctors here in Ireland I can use the above information for to get a medical exemption to work from home? I'd prefer to not have to get an MRI again, so hopefully I can transfer the results of the MRI from my home country. I'm just not sure how this process would work since there is no official medical diagnosis causing the pain, so is this even possible?

Long time lurker, first time poster.

I often look at this group for career advice and insight, so I thought I'd share my situation and hopefully gather some insight even though I work in PM/BD and not dev. 

I have recently been made redundant in my position.

I am a Stamp 1 (Critical Skills) holder with a focus on Lab, Business Development, and Project Management.

I came over to Dublin in 2018 to pursue and complete my masters and I've worked at my company since January, 2020. I love Ireland and can't fathom moving back to my home country or elsewhere right now. 

I am hoping to move into a PM, BD, or Sales. I've had several interviews but feel so hesitant and unsure of what to say about requiring a critical skills permit. I feel like they won't give me a fair chance after knowing that even though I am willing to submit and pay for the permit myself. 

Do I need to tell interviewers my visa situation? I assume so since I don't think I can work until I get my permit. 

Anyway, just seeking any advice from people who have been in this position before. It is incredibly stressful so any thoughts or words of encouragement are appreciated.",2023-07-14 11:28:42

First off this is a throwaway account. I made it to get some advice on a situation I am in.

To cut a long story short. I am currently half way through a masters in cloud computing. I am working as a junior engineer too. The pay is poor and I am being kind. Essentially, I have an offer on the table of 38 grand in the netherlands, which is almost 50% pay rise. Ideally, I would rather to stay where I am until the masters is done (last exam is May but theres work placement too) and then once done, I would leave. However, the pay I am currently on is very poor and to justify staying for the next few months I would like a pay rise, when I say rise I really mean jump. My masters to me is the golden ticket and I am not jepordising that for anything, hence why I want to stay until its done. I love the people in my current company and if it wwasn't for the money I would have no issue in staying at all. The reason I am applying elsewhere (different countries) is solely due to wanting to experience a different life and way of living. I genuinely don't know how to go about leveraging my position but I definitely have a case for a pay jump that much I know for certain. I would love to take the job in the netherlands but again the masters is my golden ticket here and I don't plan on losing that ticket. Anyone have any advice",2023-02-12 18:56:29

I enjoyed the role for many years, but I feel the growth in this space is limited and starting to feel a bit stuck.

Some people at this point might decide to move into people management, but I don't think that is me. I have a strong technical background and I quite enjoy bringing people together to resolve complex technical problems and leading projects to completion. Therefore, I was thinking that a ***Technical Program Manager*** role might be a good fit for me. However, I am a bit unsure about how to transition from one role to the other and I would really appreciate some advice:

* Are there any specific skills, courses or certifications I should work on to transition from leading technical content development/training to software development?
* Would you consider some of my current skills transferable or am I looking to totally re-skill?

I was thinking a Professional Scrum Master cert might be a good starting point along with some sort of budget planning, but not 100% sure, so I welcome any advice you might have for me or any experiences.

Thanks so much in advance :)",2022-07-09 22:07:57

118dtko,Questions for Trinity Graduates,"If anyone who has done computer science at trinity, answer the following questions, I would really appreciate it. I have checked through all the posts regarding DCU vs UCD vs Trinity, etc., so it would be helpful if anyone can answer these questions.

1. Did people often get burnt out from the workload? How do the staff deal with this?
2. Does the theoretical nature of the course make it difficult to find jobs afterwards? I get the idea that other courses are more practical, however I also read that you have to grind leetcode and have a GitHub anyway for jobs, so my understanding of computer science degrees was that it would be a few letters on a CV to get you through the screening process of jobs.
3. How does the staff in the course manage those with disabilities? Are they understanding with assignments and reasonable accommodations, if approved by the disability service, and provide extended deadlines if needed under reasonable circumstance?
4. I saw that assembly seems to be a massive part of the course, as well as other parts which seem to be inapplicable to most jobs - would you say that these modules provided useful as background knowledge, or did you think that these modules were utterly useless? If they were useless, would you say that the use(ful/less)ness would be similar in most courses, anyway?
5. Do you think that a more theoretical background or a practical background is preferable when tools and practices in software eng / computer science seem to change so much? Of course, practical is best starting off, but when the tools become outdated, does the theoretical aspect make it easier to 'pick up' new tools?
6. How was getting summer internships? I am aware that there is no internship for just a BA, but you can do it by saying you will do the masters and then dropping out, but I am not sure if I want to go this route. Did the summer internships provide enough work experience for getting a job?
7. Is the mathematics manageable? I am not struggling with mathematics at the minute, but I am worried that in computer science they might move too fast and it may be more difficult. Is this an issue, or would just putting the head down and studying make it possible to get good grades, despite not being a maths whizz?
8. Did you enjoy your time at Trinity computer science, course-wise?

Thank you for your time.",2023-02-21 20:13:03

vc9dgp,Is it possible to overcome boredom with coding?,"Hi, I'm considering the idea of doing a conversion course because as some have posted, the only way to survive in Ireland is to get into IT but I struggle to maintain an interest in it. I got through 70% of a Udemy python course but didn't really understand it and had trouble working at it consistently. Ditto for learning how to code Pacman in python, I completed it but if you asked me to do it myself, I wouldn't have a clue. I didn't enjoy the Harvard CS50 lecturers mostly because the lecturer is a bit full on hyperactive but also because I was again completely stuck with the homework tasks. I think it's a combination of no aptitude and lack of interest but the perks of the job are attractive and in line with my personality, I just have no talent. Wondering if it's possible to hammer one's brain into the right mould to fit into the current working landscape which does reward IT workers handsomely?

EDIT: Sorry, it does come across that I'm just innit for the money, I'm just looking for a means to survive, hell maybe even thrive.

15w4heb,Interview & Work Culture Research (for a potential immigrant),"Hi all. After mulling for quite a while I've settled on doing my level best to immigrate to Ireland. I'm planning to give myself until the end of the year to study before starting to apply for jobs at the beginning of 2024, and would appreciate guidance on what interviewing looks like in Ireland and where my efforts are best spent. 

For the context of what kind of work I do, and what I'm looking for: I have 5 years experience (after getting my credentials), with the last 3.5 for a well known, legacy fintech company, largely working on high volume apis and js based front ends. My wheelhouse is definitely JS (node, react, vue etc), but I have worked on .NET and Python projects as well. I'm also familiar with building projects and their infrastructure on cloud microservices, with most of that experience in aws. My degree is in an unrelated field from a well regarded university, and I did a bootcamp and a gov't accredited coding apprenticeship (basically a year of full time work+homework) to get my foot in the door of tech. I am likely going to be looking for mid or senior roles in front end development. I am very comfortable architecting projects from the data layer to the front end. Behavioral interviews, take home projects, even timed coding tests don't freak me out, I know I could do just fine on any of those. it's really just the whiteboarding that's got me in fits. I don't write code by hand, I don't code without a search engine, I don't code with people watching the back of my head, and while I often explain my work to clients or jr. devs I'm mentoring (and am a go to resource for non-technical staff for explanations), it's almost always after the fact, not while I'm sorting through the problem.

Given the kinds of roles I'll be looking at, I have the following questions:

1. Is grinding leetcode (or similar) even a good use of time, or should I focus my efforts elsewhere? What does an average technical interview look like?
2. What sort of process should I expect? Phone screen, behavior, technical, team fit?
3. What are key benefits in the Irish tech space, or key pitfalls I should be aware of and consider asking about during the whole process in terms of benefits and work culture?
4. Are there any particularly good resources for job hunts, salary research, etc that you've found useful?
5. Is anyone familiar with the practical steps for the interview process with people living abroad? I assume videoconferencing might be the bulk of it, but if not I'd appreciate insights.
6. I assume multinationals would be the ones to offer relocation packages in general, but if there's a broader net to cast with that I'd love to know what my odds are looking outside the bigger companies. 
7. Is there something else I've missed that I should consider looking into?

Preemptive info: Yes, I am aware of the housing crisis. Yes, I know a lot of people feel Dublin is unsafe. Yes I know my salary will be chronically lower (even taking into account that I will never ever live in the Bay Area or work for a FAANG). Yes, I know what the visa process looks like on my end. I have spent a considerable amount of time in Dublin, and I have done the math on salaries and am happy with the tradeoffs. I also know several people in Dublin/Ireland at large (including one of my closest friends) and have both family and other close friends elsewhere in the EU. I *promise* this is a well considered path.",2023-08-20 07:15:08

* Algorithmic Questions
* Ability to articulate & present your thought process in the interview setting.

v6escr,To all Software Devs,"Hi guys,

I have been an IT recruiter for almost 3 years.
I really like the job, it's a pretty nice feeling helping someone find a company that they love. I have started an online course in Computer Science so I don't seem like an idiot when talking about tech etc.

But, Recruiters get a bad rep. But it's like anything, you get good ones and you get bad ones. Be it a doctor, a software engineer or any job.

The reason for the post?

A lot of the software engineers I speak to tell me they get bombarded with LinkedIn messages (8-10 per day), most of which are not relevant to them, wrong tech, too junior or too senior etc.

I want to help stop this spam culture and boloxing to be honest, educate fellow recruiters and try to enforce change.

What do you look for in a message, or what information do you want to know when receiving a message/reach out? What kind of messages stand out? Do you want compensation outlined initially?
The interview process? 

What are the key things you would like to see on a reach out? And what are the things you don't like about certain reach outs?

Thanks a million guys, just looking to be better!",2022-06-06 21:56:34

j200n3,A honest-est Thread for Dev Salary in Dublin,"Hi guys,

I am Vietnamese, I was born in 1994, and I spent 8 years studying in Singapore and 2 years working in JP Morgan Singapore. 

I am a believer of fair and transparent salary. Meaning, I would also encourage people in my team and my friends to openly share their salary to each other.

Firstly, I think as employees, we should be able to have a view on the industry payscale.

Secondly, HR are basically ""evil"", they always discouraged ppl to share salary, and i dont think it is a good practice

Thirdly, Salary should not be a metric to judge one's skills and competencies, but Salary is surely important aspect to maintain a good life. Hence, noone should be ashamed on the amount. To me, as long as you're working to make a living and take care of your's loved ones, you should be proud of yourself.

I'm a 24 y/o girl from the states and I've been working in Cali for 3 years now as a software engineer.

z0ka5a,Moving to the UAE,"So in short I have a remote job - working for an US company through their entity in Ireland.

I recently figured that UAE started offering something called Green Visa from last month, that gives you an opportunity to sort out a work residence permit without company sponsoring you if you already have an employment contract.

My company would keep me on a same salary in terms of contract in Ireland vs moving to UAE, and they don't care if I move or not. Time zones would be hard maybe, I'd have to work 1-10pm to have an overlap with PT. 

The big reason to move would be paying zero in income taxes in UAE compared to the marginal tax rate of 52% that we get in Ireland. And I'd have to be there 6 months a year for the residency only.

Job security is somewhat of a concern though and that's why I am holding back. And career opportunities are a big plus for staying in Ireland vs UAE I believe (big tech is here). I am an Non-EU citizen, transitioned to a Stamp 4 in Ireland and in 2 years I'd be able to get a long term 5 year residency - in case I decide to come back to Ireland that could be useful as no work permit would then be necessary.

But... No income taxes would equal to an almost double monthly salary in UAE compared to Ireland while I am costing my company the same amount of money (0 tax on Capital Gains as well is another plus)

Have you considered moving to the UAE for this reason if you are in a similar situation?

What would you do in this position?",2022-11-21 00:29:21

14cmepq,comp sci or physics+conversion masters later?,"not too sure if this is the right sub for it but I'm a 6th year stuck between physics or computer science. I don't have any major interest in compsci but I've done some research into it and I can definitely learn to like it along the way, this alongside mostly doing it for the dollar. I know it is a heavy course but I guess I don't really understand the magnitude of these things and think ""ill just work hard"" lol. The pay is really inviting though, and I remember being really interested in computers as a kid and even messing around with proxies and debugging web games. 

On the other hand, I genuinely am interested in physics and do it for LC. Similarly, heavy course but since I'm definitely interested in it, the ""work hard"" switch might do its job. More specifically interested in Physics, Medical Physics and Bioengineering at TUD, in hopes of becoming a medical physicist later, but the only con is I'm very big on travel and I like the idea of being able to take spontaneous trips and  work from anywhere in the world as long as you have your laptop, in contrast to having to do residency, other programs and international job uncertainty. 

Ive kinda thought of just doing my physics degree to put this debate on hold, and then later decide if I'm doing a masters in medical physics or a conversion computer science degree (which would be good bc they leave out a lot of the maths stuff that would probably depress me to the earths core if I chose it for undergrad), not sure of the reputation off this degree though. Again, its kinda just for the dollar but I don't hate comp sci or anything, I just like the freedom and money that comes with it. Then again, even if u take a spontaneous trip to Paris and work remote without your boss knowing, are you really free if you're stuck with work that isn't fulfilling?

This went on a strange philosophical tangent, please just drop some opinions below lol",2023-06-18 14:53:55

151l8fn,Title: Seeking Advice: Choosing Between a Job Offer or Pursuing a Master's Degree,"My fellow redditors,

I'm currently facing a major dilemma and could really use some advice. I'm about to graduate with a (1.1) from one of the top three universities in Ireland, where I have been studying business computing. I have also been enrolled in the Internship Program with one of the larger  Saas company (non-faang), gaining valuable industry experience for the past two years, specifically in project management and cloud support. It looks like I'll receive a job offer in the range of 40k-50k after graduation, which seems quite promising.

However, here's where the decision-making gets tricky. I recently came across an opportunity for a scholarship to pursue a master's degree in Ireland. This would be a full scholarship plus maintenance guaranteed as long as I go straight into it . The catch is that it would mean spending an additional year in Ireland, which, to be honest, I find a bit boring.

On the other hand, I stumbled upon the Erasmus Mundus program, offering a two-year master's degree in cybersecurity with a scholarship attached to it as well. This option seems appealing since it would provide a change of scenery and potentially open up new career opportunities. Does a two year masters makes much difference for employment 

Now, here's where I need your guidance. Given my background in business computing, success factors project management, and cloud support, I'm torn between accepting the job offer that's likely to come my way or pursuing a master's degree in cybersecurity. I'm unsure about the long-term impact of each choice on my career.

Should I prioritize gaining work experience and building on my existing skills with the job offer, or should I take this opportunity to explore a different field and expand my knowledge through the master's program? Any insights, personal experiences, or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance, fellow Redditors!",2023-07-16 23:33:01

Hope this is the right place for this post, I'm looking for opinions on some part time Springboard postgraduate degrees in Data Analytics, that I would be doing alongside my current industry job. 

The main one I'm considering is a masters in Data Analytics at CCT college Dublin, but I'd never heard of the college before and couldn't find much info/reviews online from people who studied there. Has anyone any experience there or heard any reputations about it as a place to study? The course I'm looking at is part time and 90 ECTS which seems like a lot to cover in 12 months. If the quality of teaching isn't great that would be a very intense and stressful year alongside working at the same time. 

The other one I'm looking at is a postgraduate diploma in Data Analytics at NCI, that one's 60 ECTS part time 1 year.

zrx2qd,Looking to work in software development for 6 months as part of the Work Placement Experience Programme,"So, long story short: I am currently in a situation where I consider myself to have at least entry level experience and skills, but am unable to land a job. My experience is varied between several programming languages & frameworks as well as design, product, & other soft skills.

I have a degree in digital design, a level 6 in software development, and have worked on leading & developing a software startup project that almost got investment but I have since shelved. I also have several non-IT-related qualifications.

I have work experience in multiple areas, both IT-related, non-IT-related, and semi-IT-related (tech support, etc.)

I am currently a participant in the work placement experience programme (WPEP) for a small business, where I am completing mostly menial IT-related tasks such as developing a WordPress website, performing a cloud migration, and some design work (branding, PowerPoint presentation creation, etc), and am due to finish it in early April. However, I do not see much long-term benefit from it due to the type of tasks I am doing. I am therefore looking to restart the WPEP for a company that's more focused on software development, and where I can start building a long-term future career.

I would like to gain experience in either development (front, back, or fullstack), or possibly software testing. I am mostly experienced in frontend, and have some very basic backend experience. Happy to work with both.

My skills include:

* Frontend web development
   * JavaScript/TypeScript
   * Svelte
   * VueJS
   * React
   * HTML/CSS
   * Tailwind
   * WordPress
* Backend/server-side languages
   * C#
   * NodeJS
* Mobile Development
   * Flutter
   * Would love to learn iOS development but I currently do not have a Mac
* Development Tools
   * Visual Studio Code
   * VIsual Studio IDE
   * Git
* Design
   * UI/UX
   * Logo design
   * Figma
   * Adobe Suite
   * Affinity Suite
* Video post production
* Project management (I don't see myself as a PM, but I know the theory - Agile/Scrum/Kanban/etc)
* And more random things (I can send you my CV if we talk)

My knowledge of all the above varies, and I certainly do not claim to be an expert in any of them. I am also rusty with many of them. Very much a jack of all trades! But I know enough to be able to practice and hone them, with guidance, into a career within 6 months.

If you are working for a company who would be potentially interested in taking me on for 6 months as part of the WPEP programme, then I would love to have a chat with you!

My only asks are:

* To have the skills & confidence required to apply & get a job by the end of the programme (or to potentially continue working for your own company for a salary at the end of the WPEP programme)
* To have mentorship & guidance throughout the duration of the programme
* Remote work (due to living in a remote area). I could potentially travel to Dublin or Waterford on the odd occasion if necessary. I have experience working remotely.
* A reference upon completion of the programme

I am looking to potentially start before the end of January.

More info about the WPEP programme here:

xrjb2j,Routes into tech/CS?,"I know it's hard to give advice but I'm just curious what sort of ideas people might have. Mostly wondering what sort of options might be open to me that I am not even aware of.

I'm currently doing a 4-year undergrad in another STEM discipline and are just about half way through my degree but I honestly am starting to really hate it. I didn't get the worst results in my first two years - just about managed to get a first overall so far but not sure how much longer I can keep that up consider I feel really overworked and on the verge of falling behind.

I could apply for an internal transfer but that would almost certainly mean starting from first year since my degree is more mathematics heavy with minimal coding, no data structures and only some basic discrete mathematics. While I don't mind redoing the first two years I don't think I'm really in a financial situation right now to afford that, certainly not if I stay at my current university.

Alternatively I could transfer to pure mathematics and take more CS modules but not sure how much choice I would have there considering I might be missing prerequisites.

I have some experience writing code and some very basic skills with doing so collaboratively from messing around with OSS development as a teenager, and I read up a bit on the theory side of CS and I think I would find it much more manageable (and by extension enjoyable) both as a degree and as a career. Honestly in hindsight I'm not sure why I picked the degree that I did instead of CS.

Are there any options worth looking into apart from a 4-year degree? I know some people do PLCs but they seem quite limited in scope. I would consider studying somewhere else in the EU but I only speak one other European language (and not a major one) so that I presume would limit my options somewhat.

kflb94,Career Advice in this Sub,"Beware strangers bearing gifts.

I’ve noticed that career advice in this sub seems to skew towards “start getting a new job” inordinately. I want to just point out that this is NOT good advice. The only people for whom it is good advice is recruiters who make a nice commission churning people around.

There are some good recruiters and I have worked with some and even found good jobs through them but as an industry it is largely parasitic and has a lot of fairly cynical car salesman types who just want to turn you over, get their commission and move on to the next guy.

In ANY relationship when things get rocky the first thing you should do is try to work it out. Marching out the door with your fingers in the air is fun, and I have done it a few times myself but it causes problems for all concerned, especially yourself. Changing jobs is ranked quite highly on the list of things that can lead to a breakdown. It’s on the same scale as losing a loved one or moving house. Relationships take time and energy to build and it can be hard to do that again and again and again. Never mind the fact that if you do it too frequently your CV can look like a patchwork.

The cost of replacing a staff member is huge. Unless you have some kind of problematic personality no business that’s any good wants to go through the hassle and expense of hiring if they can help it. The flip side to this is that when they see a CV that has you jumping around a bit they have to wonder why they should take the risk with you?

If you’re brilliant you’re brilliant and you can pretty much do whatever you want but 95% of us aren’t and if you are in the 5% this really isn’t anything you need to worry about.

So whoever you lurkers are, that are anonymously downvoting good advice that actually “doesn’t” revolve around turning your life upside down, please take a moment to reflect on yourselves.

It can be murder out there. Sometimes it’s better to be on the inside looking out - even if things aren’t great. And frequently things aren’t great. That’s why it’s “work”.",2020-12-18 13:41:38

1b3bbw1,Do career prospects differ for each Irish university? ,"I looked at a few posts before hand on it and seen how the main opinion is that prestige of the university doesn’t matter at all for career prospects but is that really true ? Like surely they would differ between like say Trinity,UCD and Maynooth,TUD . Just because the points for the first two are over 500 to get in and also have bigger names and are more prestigious whilst Maynooth and TUD have significantly less point requirements are smaller names and don’t have the same level of prestige . Not trying to shame Maynooth and TUD because they are both probably still really good colleges but I’m just wondering about this because if you look at posts about UK or US unis they treat the rankings of their college really seriously . 

TLDR: are the career prospects higher for CS the higher the CAO points for the course is and ranking/reputation of the university ? ",2024-02-29 21:05:04
149b9uy,"Help in choosing a Uni, Trinity College Dublin Vs Saarland University in Germany?","Hello community,

I had put up a post few months ago asking job opportunities in Ireland after doing Masters in Computational Engineering from TCD. I have over 3 years of experience. Anywho, as of yesterday, I got accepted in Saarland University in Germany, in their Bioinformatics course, which is from their course curriculum a core Computer Science course with ginormous subjects in ML and data science with electives in Bio (genome sequencing, Computational Chem etc).
Now I am in a soup of which Uni to take up considering future job options, quality of life etc. 

The pros in favour of TCD is the brand value it comes with (it matters a lot in the country from where I am), the course is good. Cons for Trinity being that it’s expensive, one year course only and the expenses in Ireland. 

The Pros for Saarland is that its a public university so 0 EUR tuition fee, living expenses are a quarter of what they are in Ireland and the best is that my department is part of the famous Max Planck Research Institute of Germany.
Cons against Saarland being that it isn’t ranked as great as TCD and the course is Bioinformatics.

I am really confused guys, I know this isn’t the right subreddit, but please, any insight is greatly appreciated.

""Must be eligible to work in the US"", ""Would you require sponsorship to work in the US?"" or similar.

Are these questions actually auto-filters for some companies to filter out people that don't already have a visa for working in the US?

How early do I need to apply for one of these visas?

I've tried searching but there are so many variables and different visas that I'm losing myself in the ocean of seemingly unstructured information out there.

TL;DR: What visa should I be getting for an internship in the US?

Any and all help appreciated.",2019-09-25 17:47:39

13aycip,A mistake in MSc programme selection?,"Hello from a throwaway account. 

So I was a part-time student in MTU's masters in AI, and was and am in full-time employment. As I am from a country and place where 'prestige' is sometimes valued more than anything else, when I could I transferred to another programme, which I started from scratch, in other city and more glamorous and known university (I won't say where and which to avoid flame wars). And, as semester ended, I see that I might have made a mistake: I truly feel that previous programme was better and much more hands-on than what I do now (I just had an exam where I had to memorize loads of tech acronyms, what for?). 

So, I'll appreciate any suggestions what to do, as I am thinking of tucking tail and going back to Cork which I really liked. Do you think that my impression of my previous school being better than the current, highly-ranked one might be correct? How is MTU, or CIT, seen in industry? I might want to jump jobs soon, would a degree from an older and 'prestigeous' uni serve me better? What if I want to go abroad for PhD, is MTU ok?",2023-05-07 18:20:43

I'll be flying to Ireland to complete my masters in Digital Innovation at UCD september 2024. I have 2 YOE working in .NET and Progress4GL for a big MNC(Employs 5000-1000) for US Healthcare. I want to get into contracting as I want to earn good money initially to cover off my education loans and make good money in short term.  


I'll be working under critical skills visa if I land a job in tech and I need to work for at least two years in tech to get an Irish PR.

From all the posts out here, the general pros and cons I see are:  


Pros:  
1) Good pay(obviously) and no corporate politics   
2) Generally same work hours as a normal employee  


Cons:  
1) No paid vacations, limited PTOs   
2) Job security and possible contract termination during recessions,low profits etc.  


My questions are :  
1) What are the odds of contract extensions generally in contracting as I want to work for at least two years at some job to secure my PR.  
2) How to break paying huge taxes?(I've seen starting an umbrella company/self-employed helps)  
3) What daily hour rate can a 2YOE SE expect in contracting?  


Any help would be appreciated.",2024-02-19 00:35:35

15agroh,Springboard courses,"Hi All,

&#x200B;

Currently have a level 8 BA with a minor in CS and working in finance but I want to move into Web Development, Looking at taking either the Code Insistute 'Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development' NFQ level 6 I believe or the NCI 'Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Web Development)' Level 8.

[https://springboardcourses.ie/details/11175](https://springboardcourses.ie/details/11175)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Code Insitute is funded through  Fetch courses I believe and NCI through SpringBoard.

&#x200B;

I have read lots of mixed reviews about Code Insitute especially their JS and Python modules being outdated, but as I already have a level 8 BA with a minor in CS, I think this course might be more hands-on in terms of it having more programming and less theory than the NCI course. I think having more experience in programming is what I need to give me the confidence and a refresher of programming since it's been almost two years.

&#x200B;

Do you think I would be better off getting a level 8 Higher Diploma Science in Computing from NCI or going with the level 6 from code institute?

&#x200B;

Does anyone have experience with these courses?

&#x200B;

Would be interesting to hear what projects/lab work is in the NCI course and what languages are used as their module breakdown doesn't give a lot of insight.",2023-07-26 20:27:04

One of teachers said that our opportunities for finding placements would increase in the end of the year when we finish course but I really want to try find something over summer( 0% about money it's about getting knowledge) because my experience from my previous jobs(I'm in 30s) is telling me that learning while working is the best.

I sent already tons of emails, applied all around Cork and I'm giving some time to it now, but one respond got me ""... thank you for you interest in internship but you are too early in education to consider you..."". 

Fair enough I still need time to write simple programs like leap year or first 100 prime numbers, FizzBuzz etc., and using Chat GP like mad but....

I've got the drive, the passion, and a Google search bar that's been workin' overtime, but I still need a bit of guidance from ye experienced folks, should I give up finding summer placement based on your experience and code,code,code until my curly brackets buttons fall off keyboard or there is still chance to find it?",2023-02-11 16:18:47

I have 3 years of experience as a software developer in C# .net.

Now DCU is cheaper than UCD but UCD is ranked way higher. Would this matter significantly when I apply for jobs?

16cir2x,"Managed to get my degree, but really didn't take college very seriously. Lost out on a position due to my technical questions. Did I screw myself?","Hi, so myself and another dude have entry level positions doing like tech support its basically updating sql instances to newer more secure instances. 

The guy who started the same day as me has like a diploma in something IT related, not fully sure. I have my degree and also did an 8 month internship (I didn't really learn anything applicable to other positions tho)

A position on the hardware desk opened up and myself and the other dude were both told to apply and interview. I found out the reason he was chosen over me for that role was due to my technical questions. I don't really care about the position and I'm happy for him that he got it. But hearing it was my technical questions that let me down has me questioning if I've screwed myself over by not taking my studies seriously enough. 

It's something I've always been a bit nervous about. That was my first interview where I actually got technical questions and while I didn't bomb them or anything, I still did worse than he did on them. Am I at a disadvantage because I have the qualification but not necessarily the knowledge I should have from college? Hardware isn't really something I'm that interested in anyway, game design is what I want to do and what I'm interested in but I am feeling kind of down that he answered better than me. I kind of think I have better understanding of the current SQL stuff we're doing now. He asks me for help quite often and I think my understanding of SQL is a little better than his. I really just don't know the technical jargon to describe complex issues, even though I could probably solve said issue, I don't know the correct terminology to explain it.

TLDR; Am I screwed in the workplace because of my poor effort in college?",2023-09-07 15:27:47

I was looking forward to learn about compilers, operating system design (and having to actually implement something for a kernel, which ridiculously in my current college the assignments where 10 questions to answer... like WTF, did I go back to school?), finite state machines and maybe a course that is more C/C++ based.

As a soon to be graduate ,one of my main worries is how the market is going to be in next ten years in terms of talking about playing the ""long game"" . 
It is well clear here and from personal experience that the entry market is well saturated , but will this not lead to eventually having a surplus of engineers in all aspects of the carreer wheter its mid-senior , which in hindsight will lead to deflation of wages and higher competition? Or maybe a saturation right across the board?

Edit: Also i would be interested to hear about the future of ML and AI jobs , a few of my mates are jumping on it atm with masters and phd programs.Is it a hype train or is it something that will really will be much in demand .

1b3c27l,Navigating Career Challenges in Data Analytics (or Related) roles: Seeking Advice and Perspectives,"Hey everyone,

I’m in a bit of a tough spot and could really use some advice.  I’m an Irish citizen, born in Ireland to Pakistani parents. I got my MSc in Software Design and Development (Computer Science conversion course) in 2020, and started off with an unpaid data scientist internship at a company in Pakistan, but I worked remotely from Ireland. That lasted about 9 months, and I didn’t get to do much in terms of projects.

Ever since then, I’ve been trying to land a proper job (Especially in Software), but it’s just been rejection after rejection, mostly because I struggle with the coding assessments. My degree didn’t really cover Data Structures and Algorithms, which seems to be a big deal. Also, recruiters keep ghosting me, or I get to the final round of interviews and then get rejected. Sometimes companies even freeze hiring after I’ve gone through a bunch of interviews. My parents are pretty worried. they’re from Pakistan and they are pressuring me to send me and   work there.  However, considering the economic situation, quality of life, and my personal aspirations, I'm hesitant. I aim to establish my career in Ireland or the UK, closer to my support system and where I feel my opportunities for growth are better aligned with my goals.

In December 2023, I finished a training program in Data Analytics in London and got back to job hunting in Ireland and the UK, focusing on data roles. But it’s still the same story: constant rejections. It’s getting pretty depressing, especially since entry-level positions seem super hard to come by right now.  
But I do have one job opptunity for a non-tech role in talent acquisition or business development at a consulting agency (Fully remote-full time). It’s not really what I want, but it’s something. Maybe I can take it and keep looking for a data role on the side?

What do you guys think? Should I take the non-tech job for now, or hold out for something in data analytics? Any advice on dealing with this kind of job hunt frustration?

Oh, and to add to the pressure, my  parents are really pushing for me to move to Pakistan. They don’t get why I’m holding out for something here when I could supposedly have opportunities there. It’s a whole other layer of stress on top of everything else.

Thanks for any help or insight you can give!

1aulx9i,Seeking Guidance and Feedback on My Journey into Tech," 

Hello everyone in r/DevelEire,

I hope this message finds you all well and thriving. I'm reaching out to this incredible community for a bit of guidance and perhaps a bit of mentorship if you'd spare the time.

A bit about myself - I'm a 32-year-old Argentinian who's made Cork my home. Two years ago, I embarked on a journey that was completely new to me - programming. The world of code has been both challenging and exhilarating, and after much hard work, I've recently graduated from a full stack bootcamp. It's been a transformative experience, and I'm eager to dive into the professional world of programming.

However, I've hit a bit of a roadblock. Despite my efforts in applying for various positions, I've yet to secure my first job in the field. The feedback from companies has been consistent - they prefer to proceed with candidates who have more experience. It's a bit of a catch-22 situation; I need a job to gain experience, but I need experience to get a job.

This is where I humbly ask for your help. I would be immensely grateful if any of you could take a moment to review my CV. Your expertise and insights on how I could improve it, or any advice on breaking into the tech scene here, especially for trainee/junior roles, would be invaluable. I understand that everyone's time is precious, so I truly appreciate any feedback you can provide.

I'm keen to learn, grow, and contribute to the tech community, and I believe that with the right guidance, I can overcome this hurdle. A big hug to everyone, and I hope you're all doing great. Looking forward to any advice or suggestions you might have.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. Stay safe and take care.

Best regards,  
Facundo

Im currently in my final year of uni have in and around 2 years in IT related jobs and im wanting to finish my degree in computing science and move to Austrailia to work for a few years in the industry, has anyone here done it before or have knowledge on what to do?

For example like how do i get in contact with employers to get sponsored?

Or is there a recruitment  company that sorts it all for you 

Or is there a company that pays well and i could work remote from anywhere in the world

16d84qa,Looking for insight on Cybersecurity or Cloud Development,"I am 19 years old. My problem is that I have a pretty vast skillset and really don't know what I want to do, as no matter what I pick I will feel like all my other skills have gone to waste. I have done Graphic Design since I was about 12 and have done loads of freelance work, I have done VFX for equally as long and worked in a firm as a summer job in 2020. However, I have also taken a huge interest in development, specifically python. I have a software which I sell and it's worked out pretty well. I feel as though I should definitely go for either CS or Cloud Development as the possible salaries tend to be way higher than that of Graphic Design or VFX. My main questions are

Will python be useful, or is CD for example more C++, Java, etc.

This ones probably quite broad, but what can I expect to be working on in CS or CD.

I heard there is quite a shortage of CS Experts in Ireland, however I really want to get out of this country as I really dislike it. What are the opportunities like outside Ireland?

Lastly, what route should I take for qualifications. 
I have looked into UCD and IBAT diploma courses for Cyber Security, then possibly trying to get other qualifications such as CCNA, etc after this just to but I'm really not sure. Is doing a Comp Science course a good idea or something as a more blanket course that would allow me more choice etc? Also what courses are good for Cloud Development?",2023-09-08 11:35:02

Are there relevant research positions in big tech in Ireland?","I'm finishing my PhD in computer science and thinking of leaving academia for industry. Is it possible to find a research position in big tech in Ireland? The majority of industry-affiliated research scientists in my field that I've met are based either in London or in the US, but I don't really want to move from Ireland, especially somewhere outside the EU.

I do consider roles without a research component too (data scientist, data engineer, NLProc engineer), but I've heard that fresh PhDs often face a curse of being overqualified and underqualified at the same time for any non-research role. Is it true? I have 3 years of part-time industry experience, but it was a long time ago, so I don't think it's going to help much.

And there's also a tricky bit: I'm a non-EU national, so I'm looking for an employer that would sponsor a CSEP for me (universities/research centres don't do that, and that's one of the reasons I want to leave academia).

Is there any hope?",2023-08-08 01:29:33
15cxj94,Help/Advise needed with choosing course.,"Hello! 
I'm looking for some help and advice in what to do next to restart my career. I recently did a springboard course with TU Dublin, a CPD course in Data Analytics, and I really enjoyed it. I previously had a bachelors in electronic engineering and overall have really enjoyed the programming aspects of these courses. I'm currently job hunting with little luck. From my analytic course, while I enjoyed it, I felt that I've had to go learn other analytic skills to be able to apply to a wider range of jobs, as the course was heavily R language focused. In my spare time, I've taken up learning SQL and Python just to meet some requirements. 
One of lecturers suggested to me that with my background I should opt to go the data science/engineering route. I intend on doing another springboard course as it was suggested I should continue with a postgraduate in applied statistics or data science. I have an interest in either but I'd like some advice before I apply because I'd like to improve my skillset and chances of employment. Any help anybody can give is appreciated.

My internship is coming to an end soon. I asked my manager for a review, and he said I was doing pretty well but there are areas I could improve he did point out a few areas, but overall nothing negative towards me. 

I received the official feedback in written format, which stated that I was working at a satisfactory standard. My friend told me it was a bad review in a corporate world and  a good review would be considered exceptional, and he think the way my manager put down working on a satisfactory standard means I will not get a permanent offer/return offer.

I have nearly 15 years of experience in healthcare setting, currently working in a senior management role in a Dublin hospital, mainly covering out of hours. I was always interested in IT,  and just completed a higher diploma in software development (android focus)from DCU.  I also have a master's in nursing and  masters in clinical leadership.
I really dont want to change my career completly, as I have to play it safe. Family, Dad of two daughters, mortgage etc. 
Currently I earn decent enough, around 67k Annual wages, + plus all the premium pay for nights and weekends ( nearly 20-30k) per year.
Although I completed the program, with great difficulty, I am not really fluent in it.  I can not risk going full on to fulltime junior dev jobs.

However, there's a problem with my CSEP application that would delay my start date by several months.  However, I pitched the idea to the company's internal immigration team to consider employing me on a [Working Holiday Authorization (WHA)](https://www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/usa/our-services/visas/working-holiday-authorisation/) until I am able to get a CSEP as to not delay the start date.

The application itself states: ""**Participants must leave Ireland on the expiration of the permission, which cannot be extended, either under the authorisation itself, or through attempting to convert it to a different form of immigration status**;""

Therefore, can I apply for a WHA, and upon expiration, LEAVE IRELAND on a weekend for example,  and then come back to Ireland when my CSEP starts (assuming they request it to start after my WHA ends)?

Now I plan on pursuing my masters in Ireland (first choice, cause I have a family to accommodate me for my study period) and I have never been at more crossroads.

I'm not particularly great with the front-end design but can usually figure out how to build things if I see them, with css. I have the usual student full stack projects such as blog, ecommerce, etc. I'm comfortable putting together these Django, React or Flask. Building out API's. I'm working in a tech support role with code everyday now but not really building/designing things from scratch. I'd be more debugging and fixing features. I am aiming to secure a role as a junior web dev and am wondering if you have any advice as to where I should be focussing my efforts at the moment. Is it worth building a mammoth project? I feel like my time is best spent absorbing as many new concepts as I can. But should I deep dive React and Django to death instead? I have been taking the approach of starting loads of mini repos focussed on one feature of the language I'm studying. Would this put an employer off? The other thing is with chat gpt on the scene now, I find myself wondering if I should read the docs for half an hour to write some tricky problem or just get the ai to write it almost instantly and then explain it to me. I still stretch the problem solving muscle throughout the day but am I doing myself a disservice by using the ai to get out of tight spots in a hurry?

The agency froze pay increases and there's no sign of reinstating them. I don't feel my wage growth should suffer and I'm planning on talking to my manager soon about money, and I know he's going to say that pay increases are frozen.

When he say that I'm going to say, look, I get that, but I'm increasing the price for my services and its going to cost 50K to keep me, otherwise it's time to part ways.

Am I crazy for doing this at this moment in time? I see more postings for jobs recently, and I don't think it will be that hard to get a new job. Any thoughts?",2020-07-22 13:23:24

Teaching is becoming harder and harder with much more social issues etc to deal with, shit pay, extreme stress and work load. I've been considering a career change into a dev role for a while now and was going to take the plunge next summer. Now I'm reconsidering after seeing how scarily good chatgpt is at generating virtually any code I throw at it. Bye bye stack overflow, asked the AI a question I posted on stack overflow a few months ago and got the correct fix within seconds and without the snarky passive aggressive bs. I know the code generated isn't perfect, but it's definitely a great starting point for a lot of features and projects. Should ChatGPT scare me into not changing careers and how should I advise my students on career paths?

y21ojn,Advice on Becoming a Programmer/Dev,"Hi All, 

Background: 
27 year old Male, business owner, married, just had my firstborn, just bought our first home, bout to move in end of the month, will be our family home for at least 5 years. 
Went to college 4 years, studied business & German. 
Refugee background (left home country in 98), parents renting and doing ok, not amazing, will fall on me to support them in around 10-15 years time. No one in the family has much wealth except maybe me I have been very lucky with opportunities and work hard, and have had several businesses in Ireland, some successful some not. 

Now I’m finding myself looking at becoming a developer (loved computers, gaming, creating since I was very young) used to religiously play MMOs and tweak all sorts in private servers. I think it’s really what I want to do, also have quite a bit of knowledge in crypto/blockchain (non dev knowledge). 

I’m thinking this is the future and I want to tone down the risk in future for myself & family. My wife works a decent job also but at the moment I’m the bigger earner. (I’m also somewhat successful in trading futures & options) I hold a good chunk of stocks/crypto. 
I’m tri lingual Arabic, German & English.
At least C1 level in each one. 

If you’re a developer, could you tell me from your experience/what you’ve seen/heard, what are the most sought after skills/languages/experiences that companies generally look for? 
I was contemplating doing a college course again but I feel like a lot of it would be obsolete or unnecessary for the modern world in the next 5-10-20 years. What is in your opinion the most efficient way to become a dev? And not just any dev I want to become a front end dev/lead programmer. I’ve been using Mimo and just learning JavaScript & HTML for fun and enjoy it. I’ve seen languages like Ruby that look so challenging but I’m so up for it, just need direction/guidance. 

(More background Info: I have great leadership skills, I’m a very good public speaker, I’ve done just about everything from scrubbing toilets to leading a team of chefs/front of house to successfully serve a great customer experience start to finish to becoming a barber and doing the best fades to teaching barista classes & creating tailored plans to grow a business, setting goals and smashing them every time. Good at maths & have a unique way of queuing my memory to smells & songs. I’m very obsessive about everything I do whether it was fighting competitions, work or projects (only thing I wasn’t so passionate for was school lol) and need it to be perfect,  I have a lot of energy and have never found someone who rivals my workflow)

I’ve seen online Google has their own courses now where you don’t even need a degree? Is this true? I have time (from 1-5 years) before I can sell my sought after business (which makes me decent profit but is time consuming and not what I wanna be doing when my kids are 10 years old)  Any advice on this is much appreciated! 
I also don’t mind leaving ireland in future if it’s for a much better opportunity (Although I do consider it my home and leaving would be painful, at least I could leave my parents my house so they are better looked after)",2022-10-12 11:43:11

kjdu66,"Selling GAA App (Hopball), anyone interested?","So back in 2018 - I did a hobby project called [Hopball.ie](https://Hopball.ie) ([https://www.hopball.ie](https://www.hopball.ie)) - mostly to learn React Native back then. The idea behind the app was crowdsourced GAA live scores from members attending matches. It seems to fill a need with GAA fans as of today it has got just under 2k registered members (1957) and downloads I estimate are 3x-5x that.

As well as community-provided data, we retrieved the fixtures/results via the GAA fixtures/results API so that it would populate score/fixtures every night around 7 pm. However, that access was initially halted whenever the company behind the fixtures/results API went bankrupt and now since requires our IP to be whitelisted. So to get this up and running again you'd probably have to explore writing individual scrapers for county board websites. Most of them are the same format but some are custom built.

Anywho, the project is super cheap to run but it's dying a death as there's no time investment being put into it from my side. 

I'm looking to offload the project to another passionate Irish developer who loves GAA who can devote time to the project. For it to be done right - the project needs time investment and probably money investment to reach scale. 

Unfortunately, my own work/projects mean I don't have the time to devote to this so if anyone is interested please shoot me an email at [sean@hopball.ie](mailto:sean@hopball.ie) and we can chat more.  

Note: I'm looking for financial offers to take it over but open to alternatives if anyone suggests. Not looking to open source the code.

**Tech Stack**

Mobile: React Native 

Backend: Python, Flask

DB: Postgres

Hosting: Heroku

**Monetisation**

Played around with AdMob back in 2018 but it was pennies. I believe it is possible for this to be a viable business but likely the app will need to be expanded to include News, Newsletter, Community Discussion etc. Then once it's grown to a large enough user base, possibly sell localised advertising to Irish businesses or have premium newsletter content.

Completed my Level 8 in Software Development last May and Considering going back to do a Masters since my employer will pay.

The one that caught my eye is a Msc in Artificial Intelligence https://www.mtu.ie/courses/crkarti9/# and just wondering if anyone did the part time version of this at MTU/CIT?

I see other ones available such as https://ictskillnet.ie/courses/msc-in-computing-artificial-intelligence-online/ which is a collaboration between NUI Galway and DCU, I am not too keen on having to do exams though, which I wouldn't have to do at MTU since its all assignments/continual assessment.

The program has a cost of 10,000 Euros annually, which can be a bit pricey, but it's worth it.

I am from india 38M, having 16+ yrs experience and working as principal architect/pse and making around 75k euro in india only.(the pay is great, the job interview was similar to fang companies). I am single worker with wife and 2 kids, got an offer for 70k + 5k insurance similar to indian salary in galway, role wise its a downgrade.

The thing pushing to Ireland is its difficult survive in India as one gets more and more experienced with high pay, as huge number of juniors or mid experienced people are entering the job market , where as in other developed nations one can retire more or less in same job, its not possible in india due to age demographics otherwise one needs  to move up in the ladder and making more risky job. The avg for my exp in India is around 35 to 45k euro (90% avg joe fall in this bracket)

My question is this good pay to start in Ireland? Can we get back to 120k after a couple of yrs?

How is the market for temporary work for spouse in cake industry? (She is probably a good self made cake artist) -- cant depend on this for sure.

Savings in india: 2400 to 2800 euro per month (soon to finish home loan and if bonus components included etc..base tax starts low here due to that take home is around 3k euro only per month plus yearly bonus)

Is it a stupid idea to come to Ireland ?

Note: i know some 17+ exp in India fang making 220k+ euro(total ctc), why are the salaries are low in Ireland/EU compared to other nations?

I have tried for US couple of times and got wasted once for 2009 crash and once did not select in lottery, its extremely difficult to emmigrate with job in hand(unless one is lucky but not me ☹)

zatnob,Looking for people to start a company with,"OK a bit of a weird post (maybe), feel free to hurl abuse/disdain or whatever if that's your style. 

Here's the thing - I'm a software engineer living and working in Dublin, working for a large company. My ultimate goal would be to quit my job in 3-5 years and work on my own thing. I'm currently working on a project but I think that  
a) working alone is not the most optimal way to get to where I want to go.   
and   
b) there are likely other people who are in a similar position to me who want the same thing. 

So I thought I'd write here in case there's anyone who would be interested in joining forces to put something together. Ideal people would be

* highly motivated, i.e willing to put in a few evenings each week (probably working 7pm to 10) and roughly 8-12 hours each weekend with a view to putting together an MVP quickly.

yxsi7f,Computer Science Graduate,"I’m a CS student, and my course has two options:

1. 4 year bachelors degree in CS
2. 5 year integrated masters degree in CS

If you choose the 4 year bachelors degree, there is no internship and you do a final year project in 4th year.

If you choose the 5 year integrated masters degree, you do one semester of normal modules and then for semester 2 you do an internship (which can extend past the end of term up until September of the next academic year if you wish) instead of a final year project. Then, you do a dissertation for your 5th year. When you graduate, you get both a bachelors degree and a masters degree separately.

However I have recently found out that we have the option of exiting our course after we finish our internship if you are enrolled in the integrated masters program which mean I don’t have to continue on to do the masters and I don’t have to do a final year project but I still get my bachelors degree.

Do you think not having a final year project will affect my career in the future? Or is work experience more important?",2022-11-17 15:01:30

17gtshz,Sky FTTH broadband WiFi issues,"This might not be an appropriate question to ask here so mods feel free to delete it if it's not allowed. 

I'm basically fully WFH now and I was finally able to switch over to FTTH with Sky (I was already with Sky too). Networking was never my strength. It got installed yesterday, and the only place they could do it was further away from where my office/gaming setup is.  

&nbsp;

At first glance it seems to be fine. The speeds are good. The latency seems good. However, I currently cannot have a wired connection to my PC or console. What I've noticed is that when playing games or downloading (this one is hardly an issue and maybe that just happens) sometimes It'll jitter for a few seconds and then be fine again. 

I assume this is because I am on WiFi. Few things I've done is changed the DNS settings, and port forwarded some ports for the console which made no difference. Granted I think maybe it's to be expected given that it's slightly further away but a little annoying nonetheless. Switching to 2.4GHZ frequency didn't help either, just slowed the speeds down significantly and didn't improve the issue at all (actually seemed worse but that might have just been by chance). 

I can't wire to an access point unfortunately, but it used to work slightly better before in terms of that (not the download speed though obviously). 

&nbsp;

I just basically thought I'd ask for some suggestions. I'll leave some of the speedtest results and anything else that would be useful, I can provide hopefully. When researching I read about a lot of people using mesh networks with this stuff, is that something I should look into? It doesn't seem like a good idea on the surface since it'd probably add more latency, although I'm not convinced that's the issue anyway. Cheers!

- Where do I fit as an analyst? Is someone with excel only hireable? 

- What should I learn? I follow alex the analyst on youtube but just don't have the time right now to get into it. 

- What salary would you say my description below commands? It's a large MNC in dublin. (in short, I don't know if I'm well paid or not and I feel like I wouldn't get any job if I left, though I get praised for my work a lot by my manager who is not an IT person)

- What salary would be achievable if I learn some recommended skills to add to my current skills. 

I have a mechanical engineering degree but work as what I would call, an operations analyst.

In short, I am the point of contact for all things related to two management systems for a group of clients. One system my company owns, the other it doesn't. 

For these two systems I am responsible for determining how best to use the system to improve things, training, assisting with loading data from some end users, running reports, creating automated reports, troubleshooting issues and more. 

One of the systems I have more admin rights and get requests from customers and team mates to modify the system contents, options etc. Some of these I can do and others I have to go to our support team. 

I spend most of my time in excel, running reports and manipulating data to provide what is requested..pivot tables, charts, xlookups, index/matches, conditional formatting, if statements, countifs, data validation (dropdown lists).

In one of the systems I can use SQL to run queries. Now I don't really know SQL but I've needed it to run reports from the system so I went to google and learned how to do it, such as ""display all items submitted last month""

There are a number of data analysts on the team. They seemingly use SQLServer for quick lookups and verifying data and they use alteryx with tableau to create dashboards. They get data from a data warehouse as well as other places like google sheets. I hear them talking about macros and workflows a bit which I have a vague idea what they mean but not so much. As far as I have heard, alteryx is like a more visual way of writing queries compared to SQL. These dashboards are obviously all refreshed automatically.",2023-03-04 23:19:24

x7kmd3,I have a bachelor's in Business and Information Technology. I have two years experience in Support. I'm trying to figure out how to maximize my income over time.,"I'd appreciate any advice that anyone can offer on what direction to take my career.

So it's pretty much as the title says. I have a Bachelor's in Business and IT from TUD. In which I learned mostly about development in Java, Python, C#, webservices, android ect. With some business subjects sprinkled in like management and accounting.

I'm currently a product support engineer, and I'm on the job hunt. It's been going well, and I've gotten a few offers in the 55k range. But I want to make sure that I'm going in the right direction to make the most of my degree and time.

I was speaking to a recruiter who specialises in tech a while ago, and she said that the salaries for different areas in tech average out over time, so if I stay in support, I'll end up earning the same as people who took the Dev route. But from what I've seen, I'm not entirely sure this is true. It seems Devs earn way more.

Can anyone offer insight into what path would be best to take to maximize my returns? And what I would need to teach myself to be able to pivot in that direction? I applied to a few java Dev jobs, but never heard back even though I have java on my CV. I imagine this is because I'm not currently a developer.",2022-09-06 20:16:48

I lived in Ireland years ago and I am planning to go back around 2023 (or 2024 in the worst-case scenario). I am a European citizen and I have been working as a Digital/UI Designer in Asia for about 2 years. I would like to know how is the market for UI/UX design in Ireland, where are the opportunities and how is the competition to get a job.  Also, how about the salaries? I wouldn't move to anything below 40k/year, is that reasonable? And, usually how is the environment in the office? A lot of pressure and competition between colleagues or a more cooperative and respectable vibe?

I'm only after creating my own CV and I have no idea whether there's anything I need to be doing to improve chances to getting a position at any high companies/advantage over other students.

How does the process go?

As far as my knowledge goes, all you need is:
- Good CV
- Leetcode practice
- Good social skills

y2yswf,My partner wants to get into tech. Any advice/experience?,"Hey folks. 

My wife wants to move into the tech field. She was involved in marketing and corporate communications back at home, but she's been pretty disillusioned since we moved here in Ireland. She feels there just aren't enough opportunities in those fields, and to get by, she's worked in a small travel agency and as a designer in a technical writing team. She's quite unhappy at her job, and wants a career change. She seems to be interested in tech (I am a software developer myself), and was browsing at courses online. 

She found a Professional certificate in Python course from UCD which looked interesting. I know Python is a good language to get started with, but I also want her to get some job opportunities in companies which hire grads and inexperienced people, so I was wondering if Python was the best choice here. 

Another direction we were looking at was something like project management (but honestly, I have only seen engineers level up to project managers in most orgs) or even tech support (but don't know where to start here). I suggested tech sales but she seems hesitant to go in that direction. 

Does anyone have any experience or advice in this matter?",2022-10-13 13:29:53

I am a recent grad working in my first software engineering role. However I have also been moved I to a SCM role (creating release branches, code deliveries, builds etc). I was under the impression this is more devops related. Also is it normal to have multiple roles on top of software engineering role? The company I'm at is getting more and more short staffed so I feel they're putting multiple roles on individuals. Bear in mind I've only started the SWE role in June.

102hj8u,Stock Options - Are they a scam?,"Hear me out...

Assume I start working at a start up and am given a 1 euro option which I can exercise after 2 years.

Fast forward 2 years, the company has unicorned but still isn't publicly traded. I exercise my option for 1 euro and buy one share which is worth 100k. Great deal, right?

The problem is the tax liability. According to revenue:  

>You must pay on any gain you make on the exercise, assignment or release of a share option:  
>  
>\- Income Tax (IT)  
>  
>\- Universal Social Charge (USC)  
>  
>\- Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI). ""

Aka... 52% of 99,999 euro! 

Now you're in a position where you owe revenue 52k and all you have to show for yourself is a 100k share which you can't even sell to pay your tax bill!?

Are they a false incentive? Used by employers to appear to offer a generous package, meanwhile they know that no employee can ever afford to exercise their options... making them worthless. 

All you can do is hope that the company gets bought out or floats itself on the market and then exercise your options then. A pipe dream. A Scam. Trapped in employment by a fictitious carrot.",2023-01-03 19:51:33
qc8vwo,Is LC Computer Science any use for jobs or is it just to get an edge in college?,"I was looking at Leaving Certificate Computer Science in regards to using it for getting jobs. I am very good at maths and you can sit the exams any year you wish to pass them, but they will not count for CAO points. LC CS is basically a level 5 course so that translates to a (1 year) level 5 qualification. Could you get any CS job with a level 5?. I was wondering if I could pick this up as an extra subject as I am very good at maths and most likely going to do Physics and App Maths for the LC. College students mainly get rubbish miniumum wage jobs as they don't have any qualifications at the time. If I got a level 5, that would be a qualification, and presumably you'd get a better wage, be able to flexibly WFH and also get a foot in the door. I think I read somewhere here that getting a job in CS could usually be done with a goood portfolio and then you can work your way up with experience. Obviously a degree would be a huge help, but that takes four years and i'd rather earn 15 quid an hour writing basic code than 10 quid an hour stacking shelves in Centra. This is probably a strange idea and a little stupid and naive but I'm here to learn.

lqjqvy,Thoughts on my alternative version of the CV skills section?,"I'm tuning up my CV at the moment, and thought I'd play around it the format of the ""Languages & Technologies"" section. I've always despised the traditional format (actually I despise the limitations of traditional CVs in general, but they still seem obligatory for getting past recruitment agencies).

Long lists of disjointed technologies are little more than ATS appeasers, but this CV will definitely be read by a human – I wouldn't use this format if an ATS was involved.

The idea was to group the technologies in a semi-logical way. Is this graphic readable? Is it better or worse than the traditional format? Is it cluttered garbage? Would love some feedback. If you like the approach, feel free to steal it.

tz3sra,Why am I getting rejected for summer internships,"I've applied to countless summer internships over the past few months and have been rejected by every single one, didn't even get a single interview. 

I don't know what is wrong with my applications or maybe, could it be that I have a foreign name and that's why companies are put off with offering me interviews? If you have any tips to improve one's chances of securing a summer internship, or if you want to share your experience, please feel free to share your thoughts below. I would appreciate any feedback! 

A bit about me -
I'm a 2nd Year Computer Science student, female, POC, Irish national. 
My grades are all first class honours, average 83% and 88% for 2nd year and 1st year respectively. 
Work/Volunteer experience-wise : I was hired as lab demonstrator by my university, I have done voluntary work as a web designer and I have a retail part-time job. I've been recently awarded a scholarship and have also won awards related to IT/Science in past years. 

It's really disheartening to get rejected by so many companies but then seeing my friends get interviews...despite the fact that my CV looks very similar to my friends in terms of grades and experience, which makes me question whether companies just don't like seeing foreign names...?

The companies also seem really desperate to find interns because they keep emailing my friend who already secured an internship, while on the other hand, I got rejected by that same company - I didn't even get offered an interview. It makes me wonder what makes or breaks a candidate because I'm not that much different from my friend.

Apologies that this is kinda long and thank you for reading to the end.

1az42xx,Non-technical (hands-on) career change from dev.,"Hi all. I have 24 year of experience in IT, in many different roles, but never management / leadership (as I usually say: I’m not old, just started early!)

It’s been many many year I don’t enjoy it anymore.. I like to read about trending tech stuff, talk about it, etc, but really dislike the hands-on, the pressure (even little pressure) of the day to day job.

What could I try to move onto? (Not management..)

The usual answer is Product/Project Management, Tech Pre Sales, etc..

Even other areas of a big company that could avail of my general experience..

I’m just sometimes a bit envy of other orgs/people/teams that are so laidback (apparently)…

I had initially planned for bachelors in Finland but now I'm confused about where to study and move to in Europe as I'm exploring other countries like Ireland.

Following are my considerations:

1. Affordable yet quality education

2. Employment Opportunities in part-time during the study and also in the long term in companies like Airbus, Lockheed Martin, Boeing or another other Engineering companies out there.

3. Student satisfaction 

4. Ability to survive(Weather, Costs, etc)

5. Overall life stability 

6. Which city is generally good for students 

7. I am looking for a university that is more oriented on the practical side of teaching and less on theory and research

181gjnf,3rd year,"Hello,

yes this is another college student crying about how they are finding programming difficult.

I am a 3rd year computer engineering student completely burned out. I see people around me figure stuff out in minutes that took me hours upon hours. I think my problem is I find it hard to come up with my own solutions and I know this can be fixed with practice.

However at the rate it is going and this could be just because I'm comparing myself to others, I know I figure out problems much, much slower than others.

I've had massive problems with concentration, listening and addictive tendencies so I went to my GP and let's just say I'm halfway through an ADHD assessment with a psychologist which may explain things.

Excluding all this, my dad passed away in October and my mom isn't financially well off. So I really need to succeed in this (saying this as Ive been scrolling reddit for 4 hours).

Unfortunately I spilled liquid on my 8 year old Mac. It's not covered by applecare so I really don't think it's worth repairing given it's age as other parts my break soon too. Total repairs over the next year might be large percentage of the price of a new laptop. 

As i'm job hunting I really just can't afford to pay up front for a new laptop, but in the US I can pay it off over 12 months with 0% interest.

However they will only ship it to my US address, so Id have to have my friend ship it for me, obviously given the price and fragility Id have to have it packed so and also declare the value for insurance purposes. Which means it's very likely to be stopped by customs and they will want VAT and potentially other inport duties, which will be at least 500-600.

I'm going back to US as soon as I'm required to be in office or around mid february, which ever occurs first. Paying an extra 500-600 for an item that I'll only have in Ireland a month or two.

Has anyone experienced this? is there any work around? If I had a working old laptop I'd just wait but I can't, also I don't even have the mobey to just pay full price upfront to their Irish stores.

Original Post:

**My Education:** I am currently in the 3rd year of a Higher Institute of Technical Education (Austrian specific) where I specialise in IT and Management and which I believe is roughly the equivalent of 5th year of Irelands secondary school in where you are around 17 years old.

**Now to the core of my question:** Do you guys have any recommendations for ways to look for a summer internship which only requires 3 years of secondary school CS classes and not an ongoing Bachelor's or Master's degree? I also once heard that ""non degree"" internships are not really a thing in Ireland, I wanted to ask if this is true.  
A friend of mine and I have been looking for these kinds of internships in Ireland for quite some time now, and we just couldn't find them on LinkedIn and other similar sites.  
We have to do an internship for school and also wanted to improve our English, so we found out that ErasmusPlus (our School has its own kind of connections) would sponsor us if we'd go to a country which is in the EU and then concluded, that we want to go to Ireland. Our goal is to find internships for both of us in the same city in order for us to share a room and also do stuff together on the weekends. Also we heard that the cost of living in Dublin is currently pretty high, so we have been looking for internships in the different not ""as big"" cities, like Limerick.

So I wanted to ask if you guys would maybe have some tips for us, where to start looking for internships and some accommodation recommendations.

Thank you all in advance :D",2022-02-14 14:23:07

zqnfcf,Salary expectations for developer with ~5 years experience.,"I know this topic has been done a death, but I'd appreciate any advise.

I'm a software engineer with around 5 years experience and I'm currently working at a mid sized firm. It's a great company, and I really enjoy being a part of it. I'm there around 2 years and I'm making 57K a year.

All my performance reviews over the last two years have been exceptional. I suffered with imposter syndrome until recently, so the positive reviews really went a long way to me overcoming it.

I'm expecting to be promoted from a Software Engineer level 2 to a level 3 in January. That hopefully comes with a significant pay rise.

I'm wondering what I should be looking for. I'd be hoping for between 65K - 70K. If it helps, my tech stack is React, Node, Next and Typescript and I'm based in Dublin.",2022-12-20 12:40:27

How hard will it be for someone who just graduated from University with a CS degree to find a junior position in Dublin and be able to start a career/new life?

What salary should I expect? I am asking this so I can get an idea on my budget for housing.

Do companies offer relocation packages?

I am interested in Machine Learning / Deep Learning but due to my small experience in the field I don't think I will be able to land a job in that sector yet. The only experience I have is from my thesis and internships.

I have been looking at a lot of jobs on Linkedin and it seems like they all require you to have a visa already or to already be there in the US. On all the applications they ask if you are eligible to work or if you need a sponsorship and answering those instantly voids you.

u9ht41,3rd year Study Abroad?,"Hi there, I am a 1st year UCD student in cs. I was wondering if it would be a good idea to do a study abroad in autumn of 3rd year. The reason I am hesitant to do it is because I might need to be in the country when applying for internships that will take place in the following spring. If there was no issue, I would love to study abroad just for the experience.

I have a 3.9 GPA so I should be eligible for some relatively good US unis (cali, ny, texas etc.).

So my question is basically, Would being in the US (possibly europe/australia if not US) for the first half of 3rd year, during prime internship application season, affect my ability to get good internships compared to what I would possibly get if I was available in Dublin for in-person interviews & applications?

14xorwg,validating a side project idea,"Im a junior dev and have an idea for a side project, it's a tool for developers to use inside their IDE that would let them annotate/document code better than just leaving a comment.

You can select a snippet of code and assign a comment to the snippet. Over time as the codebase changes, if the content of the snippet gets modified, you'll be forced to edit the comment, leaving behind context of what you did and why. What goes into the comment can be decided by each individual team, whether it be the Dev's thinking process behind the code/ info about what is already done relating to a story/task and work left to do.

A new developer comes along and starts looking at the codebase, they'll see all the ""snippet : comment"" mappings and won't need to ask the team for context as much, and won't have to reverse engineer the trickier business logic, provided the dev that worked on that logic annotated it using this tool.

Pretty much, the point is that context is kept close to the code, it's version tracked and doesn't exist only in your senior colleagues head, also documentation is done bit by bit rather than all at the end in a separate place, or god forbid never at all. That isn't the entire scope of this project because I don't want you to steal it, but I think it's a good enough taster to get your opinions, so, would you try this tool / benefit from it, please let me know :)",2023-07-12 13:34:48

188pn8v,Nuphy Air75 v2 Keyboard,"Bit of a long shot, figured this might be the best sub to ask this question. 

Anyone have a good website to get this keyboard shipped to Ireland at a reasonable price ?
Best I can find is the actual Nuphy website, which charge $119 for the keyboard minimum and $25 to ship to Ireland (about €137 total). Not the worst to be fair, but wondering if ye have any suggestion, whether it is a specific website or an Irish/UK store I don't know about ? Maybe even a European website that would ship for cheaper ?

For reference this same keyboard is at €250 on Amazon UK 😮 which I find nuts compared to the price on the Nuphy website.

17v0gxi,Seeking advice on entry-level opportunities for front end developer,"Hi,

I moved to Ireland a year ago, and I'm actively seeking a job in front-end development. I've 4 years of experience in front-end development but lack professional experience in specific front end frameworks, though I've self-taught React. 

I've encountered challanges in finding entry-level positions or internships as many companies seek professional experience in specific frameworks. Additionally, I'm not eligiable for social welfare payments, limiting my access to some training programs.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or recommandations regarding:  


1. Companies in Ireland offering internships or entry-level positions
2. Traning programs that are accessible to unemployed individuals without social welfare payments, as many programs seem to require this.

P.s. I've applied to FIT program but haven't received response.

Apologies if this isn't the suited forum for this but I thought maybe there is some people here that have experience and could advise me!

I run a small business making handcraft items on Etsy. I sell a lot of items internationally - mainly USA. My items are 50-100g and sent in small 4\*7 inch bubble envelopes. I am currently just buying Click and Post labels from An Post - it cost 2.20 for a letter 100g or less. But to send to America, I need to manually type in addresses on the Click and Post website, because of the customs declaration stating what's inside - they told me there's no way to automate it. I could have about 30 orders a day so that means manually typing 30 names and addresses etc and then getting my post labels. The items are not tracked - they can be tracked until they leave Ireland so it would say ""left Ireland on 8th March"" for example and then no further tracking which is fine for the price paid, I don't expect it.   


I was just looking for advice on if anyone else is in a similar situation and what postage route they choose? I saw some small business sending international orders with Deutsche mail but cant seem to find any info about it. They don't need to be registered or tracked and I would like to spend around the same price of 3€ per postage label. Any other couriers or delivery service advice is welcome and would be greatly appreciated!

I created account specifically to interract with you and I am VERY GLAD that community like this EXIST, I was afraid all awesome developers in Ireland just stick to their small local groups.

I promise to behave as good as in real life - for a matter of fact I dislike reddit style of constant fighting and people trying to attack each other and put each other down. So I am glad this reddit has rule ,,behave like in real life"".

**So short about me - I am from Eastern Europe (NOT RUSSIA) used to live in Ireland, I am graduate from MTU in Cork, have Bsc in Software Development and Fetal lvl 5 also in Software Development. On Top of that I have 5 (6 by calendar cause first year was part-time) years of experience as a PHP backend developer in both smaller companies and local (to my EE country) branches of big corporations (not the tech ones, no Google, no Microsoft, but at least once will ring a bell).**

**I have decided to move back to Ireland, I have to live around Cork so either Cork companies or Dublin/Galway ones remotely are on my radar. For the last 2 months I keep applying. I redid my CV with a possible looking template, based on a CV that was done by professional, I made it EXTREMELY LAZY HR/RECRUITER friendly and did my best to present myself as positively as I am capable off.**

**\*\*I applied to 70 job offers of which around 20 were a 90% match to my skill and experience. Of course all of them through recruitment agencies since that was all I could find (pretty much everyone except big corporations uses recruitment agencies in Ireland it seems. If I am mistaken please correct me - tell me where to look) on Linkedin/\*\*\*\*jobsireland.ie/\*\*indeed.ie.**   


**There was some minor interest in my profile initially but recruiters in Ireland seem to be very good at being kind and nice and then... they ghost you. I understand - I am not entitled to anything but the pattern kept repeating. I send CV, week later recruiter calls, asks me things that are already in my CV, then we talk. Then NO INTERVIEW for weeks. Then either bad news or silence.**

**I want to understand Irish IT jobs market better. Could you help me? I am not a genius or something, but in my country well sooner or later I am able to land job interviews, got even some offers. So its not a recession thing, my country is poorer than Ireland. I just don't get why I get nothing.**

**Am I too expensive (I ask 70k but always tell recruiters its negotiable) or is it because only my education is in Ireland but experience is from abroad? Also I have full right to work in Ireland, I have PPS, I have Irish bank account. I am job ready in a month (notice period since I still work).**

**Please any bit of advice is PRICELESS to me. Thank you, I wish you all to be happy.**",2023-02-22 22:34:06

I should have went for an internship/graduate programme at the start of my IT career because it is even more difficult to get out of Application Support when I have the money and I'm supporting my family. While my wife is happy if I even took a small cut to get in a Junior Dev role it is hard to find anything on LinkedIn or elsewhere. Would I be best to look for full remote roles with a company based in mainland Europe or the States? The problem is, will they hire somebody with no (commercial) dev experience. I can try and sell what I've done with scripting in various roles but would that be enough?

17hmkyi,Somewhere to start learning,"Hi Guys, 

Ive been subbed here for a good while, I enjoy reading the articles posted and the odd meme that I actually understand lol. 

Whilst I know a lot of people are motivated towards a career in programming or IT due to the so called ""Decent Money"" involved. This isn't another one of those posts. Whilst money is important, enjoyment and competency is FAR more valuable to me. 

I've loved technology and computers since I was about 12 years old. I would've had a ""Knack"" with them. I wasn't taking them apart, but I really enjoyed fixing problems. To this day, My favourite days are when a computer starts throwing up errors, which cues me to troubleshoot and try and find a solution for the rest of the day. I would say 50% of the time I fix it, The other 50% I have to refer to the actual IT department, which observing them work with the problem and fix it is another fascination. 

I don't have a 3rd level degree. I struggled ALOT in school. I had no passion for the books but I did have passion for Rugby and making friends. All the brainpower and motivation I had were consumed by those two things. I wasn't great at maths. I enjoy the mathematics part of my job currently (Accounts, invoicing etc) but in School, I was pretty bad at it. 

I am presently at a junction in life. I'm quite awful at my current job. There are exterior factors as to why I haven't been given the boot but I do my utmost to make sure my shortcomings don't fall onto my colleagues in any shape or form. 

There's two things I would admit to having ability for, Talking and technology. 

Whilst I could become a sales person I just don't have it in me. 

What I would like to know is, Where can I start to uncover whether my ability is a true capacity for technology/programming/IT, or is it base level competency expected of someone my age (31). 

I am open to reading books or time-relaxed courses that do not require sound (Ill be doing them in work when its quiet)

19c60ow,Data Engineering Hiring Managers: what kind of personal project would get a candidate an interview at least?,"I am currently working in plain old data science. 4.5 yrs experience.

I'm tired of bashing my head against the wall trying to ""do AI"" on every dataset, but it's mostly just data analytics anyway. My current company does not even have even one model in production.

Thinking of a move to data engineering. I think I would much prefer getting out of the spotlight and tinkering with data pipelines and systems in the background, with no expectations of doing Harry Potter predictive magic on some random customer data.

However, my company doesn't really have any opportunities for me to incorporate the ""modern data stack"" into my workflow. I can't just start trying random third party solutions on our internal data.

I want hands on experience in tech such as Airflow, Docker, Kafka, AWS, dbt, Fivetran etc. basically all the tech I see in data engineering job specs.

But I need to learn it myself.

What kind of end to end project(s) would allow me to apply for a data engineering role without getting my CV thrown into the bin?

Could you give us a rough blueprint of a project I could showcase?

Maybe something like grabbing data from the CSO website, and moving it around and transforming it through a few services, and finally displaying it in a dashboard somewhere in the cloud.

Would one of those projects be enough, or would you want to see a good few?

Bonus points if you can describe some of your real life data engineering pipelines (anonymously as possible of course).",2024-01-21 15:38:36

181jaod,AI Coding Assistant Opinion,"I’m a software architect working in a large multinational company. We’ve recently been asked to evaluate coding assistants. There were two, GitHub Copilot and another. I was “randomly selected” to be part of the evaluation and worked with Copilot. 

To be honest, I was impressed with how useful it was. Particularly the /explain feature. As you might expect from the name, it analysed the code and output in plain text with examples how the code worked. I regularly have to get up to speed with code bases I haven’t seen before, so could see this helping me out big time there. 

Code generation worked ok, but the time you spend tweaking your prompt could just as easily be spent tweaking the code. I could see it being useful for knocking out POCs quickly. 

One concern I have is that it will really dilute the ability of junior developers that may become reliant on it without fully understanding the code it generates. It really should act like an assistant making suggestions rather than taking responsibility and ownership for the code’s structure and function given the context of whatever project you’re working on. 

I’ve already seen a case where a developer was asked why they structured their code like a certain way in a PR. Their answer was Copilot told them too…

Just wondering what other people’s opinions were? Apologies in advance if there are already similar posts.",2023-11-22 20:48:47
17qqho8,Stripe - Intern,"Hey there,

I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student with big ambitious goals within the tech field in Ireland.

I'm currently looking to secure an internship with a company that's quite prestigious - Stripe.

Fortunately I was actually able to reach the final interviewing stage with the company which is a behavioural interview(Manager Chat).  

I read up on Stripes Operating Principals and it seems like a place I'd genuinely fit in with.

But Manager Chats are generally scary and give a bit of anxiety. I would like some advice on possible questions from people with experience and people within the Irish tech field themselves .I feel like this is the best place to ask it. 

A wide scope of questions and what way they'll be looking for in us interns.

Looking forward to the great knowledge and insight

Bit of background, 4 years exp with same company out of college, done some remote work abroad during last 2 years without advertising it, loved it. Back in Ireland enjoying summer. Thinking to take a period of time out  and just focus of the best certifications in my area of expertise, very backend focused living on SSMS, Snowflake daily with front end development mixed in but not my strength. My team is so under resourced it's a joke and communications are that cost cutting is to continue of course, technical skills stagnating with all the extra work and meetings I'm involved in, senior people keep leaving, more work and responsibility for me, learning lots of course, but stressed to the max now. Working in med tech so dealing with a lot of non tech people and it is completely breaking me now!

Obviously can advise to get another job, I do have an interview next week for data engineer role (80% remote), but Ireland right now not super appealing so not even sure I want it. So any good stories out there of career breaks and using the time beneficially? Have a 2 year budget to hang out in a place like Chiang Mai, Thailand and try and take in the good energy out there from digital nomad types (obviously if not productive not working, I'm not staying for 2 years). I have no commitments, single, etc, why am I still here is what my brain is screaming at me, take a chance, etc.

So I've finished my Code Institute Diploma and I'm happy to say that I passed! I could go on about the pros and cons of the course but that's not why I'm here.  
   
I'm looking to figure out what's next, the career section at the end of the course recommends working in IT and I feel the diploma that I got doesn't really carry much weight when applying for junior roles. I'll need to work on more solo projects, do hackathons and even then I feel it doesn't carry much weight.  


I have extensive experience in SaaS and this is a career change for me. So I'm wondering if a full time course to bolster my certification is probably the best next steps. One that includes internship as I feel that experience would be invaulable. What courses are even an option to me and what would people recommend.   


I'm also thinking of just moving into Tech Support completely and work my way up from there. I have realised my passion is specifically with problem solving, troubleshooting issues.

17hv9pp,6mo in and loving new SWE Role - Need Advice on Finding Balance!,"
About 6 months ago, I started a new job. First few months were just finding my feet both in the job and in my new city since I relocated. A few weeks ago our team started a new greenfield project, and I’ve been given a lot of the tickets for building out the backend logic for the business tool. I find myself constantly thinking about the code and the project's implementation. I’m really thrilled to be deep in problem solving mode and finding a flow writing code.

That being said I'm finding it incredibly hard to slow down. I've been working late evenings because it feels like now is the time when I'm learning a lot. This includes diving deep into database migrations, setting up ORMs, writing tests, and improving my understanding of good engineering practices. I didn't have this kind of exposure the last few years of my career.

While I'm loving the challenge and the steep learning curve, I'm worried that I might be pushing myself too hard. I don't want to burn out or neglect other aspects of my life.

I also keep convincing myself that this is only temporary and it’s a critical moment to immerse myself in this to learn and advance my career.

Hi there,

I'm relocating to Ireland next month, and getting some information about the job market practices I've seen there is a limit hours per week a person can work in total.

My point is: If you have a full time job in tech, and you would like to get another extra, sidejob, (Freelancing, retail, another part-time in tech) to work on weekends or evening.  are you allowed to get this extra job?

Does your company allow that on the contract?

&#x200B;

PS:

Personally, I think it's sad that the State gives a limit for someone who wants to work a bit more. It is a kind of freedom I was expecting... haha but, OK!

I try to Imagine a professional who works full time and would like to be a teacher of something in the evening or weekend. (a very common situation in my country)

How would this work in Ireland?

I know the market is tough at the moment but I also feel that I'm at a disadvantage compared to other recent graduates. Because my course was only one year and I didn't have any internship experience (neither part of the course curriculum nor a summer placement).   
I wonder if I will see any intern positions open during the rest of the year, or are they usually run only over the summer when students are on break from college?  
Any advice is appreciated. tks

Would it be appropriate for me to directly reach out to someone in the software development department on LinkedIn and explain my situation then express I am searching for placement as part of my course?

I got sent all the documents by the HR (staff ID Card form, company booklet and all that shite). I gave them all the documents but I just got a call saying that my offer has been revoked because I am on visa stamp 1G and they only take people with an EU passport. Now, this was never communicated to me at all. They didn’t mention it in their LinkedIn (I applied for that job on LinkedIn). I told the interviewers and the HR on the spot that I am on visa stamp 1G and they said to me that they’ll have to check if they can give me sponsorship or not but apart from that, no one ever said anything about my visa being a problem for the job. 

This is highly unprofessional from their side and I am completely heartbroken, needlessly to say. This has happened to my twice now that a company has told me that I got the job but the offer later on got revoked (the first time I got an offer from Tesco and later on they said there was some misunderstanding and that the position has already been filled). I have no experience in Irish job market but I have never seen this happen to anyone else but me. Is this common in the Irish job market?

I'm a third year student in the field, struggling to get a work placement as I know many are.

I love software dev more than anything. It's what I want to do long term;  I am anxious that without an internship I will struggle even more mid term trying to get a grad position.

So my question is, would anyone happen to have advice of how to obtain or know of any positions available.

Some info about me -

* I live in Dublin (Willing to to travel/relocate)
* I have experience in
   * Python (experience making stand alone applications, creating api')
   * JavaScript (experience using React to make Dynamic SPAs, working with API's)
   * PHP (including using the Laravel Framework to make dynamic web apps )
   * SQL+noSQL
   * CSS,SCSS(including bootstrap, tailwind and other design frameworks)
   * CISCO Network Essentials certified.
   * Competent at using Azure + AWS.

181d8ya,Useful certs to switch careers?,"Hey so me myself I'm a dev with about 4 years experience since graduation, but my partner, she's basically been in call centre hell for the passed few years. She's been at a few now, and at her previous one she managed to become a team lead after only about 8months to a year (this with English not being her first language). That place has since been absolutely crumbling and she was genuinely miserable there so she handed in her notice a few months back.

Since then she's working at a much better company (large multinational), this time with benefits, much nicer hours that allow us to actually spend time together, and just a much more competent company altogether. It still has its problems, the main one being compensation. Its genuinely just not enough for her, and while she has benefits, her monthly take home pay is not much above minimum wage.

All that in mind, she's wondered at how best to get into a tech field. Given her vast experience in call centres, I figured that maybe IT help desk would be worth a shout, and she seems to be interested in cybersec too. What I'm not sure about is what is the best way to go about getting some qualifications to get her foot in the door. My suggestion was maybe picking up a few useful certs and then checking if there's any openings internally in her current company. I feel like then at least her current company will know what she's like as a worker and be more inclined to take her on without a degree but with some certs.

Are there some certs in particular that very worth doing? I've heard of some from comptia and from cisco, but if there are any recommendations I'd gladly hear them, for certs or any other courses that might be of use.",2023-11-22 16:29:40

Expecting negotiations to happen soon, if theres no more rounds, as I've only heard excellent feedback. I don't want to get my hopes up too much, but... I have a burning question that I REALLYYYY should've asked the recruiters.

Anyways my main question: What the hell is 'MTS'? It appears to be a Software Engineer level.. but I don't know what it is. It doesn't seem to be grad, as I can see Associate MTS. So I'm assuming its like a mid-level engineer (not senior/not junior)? I have 4 years of experience, so I figured this is fitting for me.

Also, if there is any Salesforce people here who worked as an MTS in the past or present.. can you give me an idea of what the total comp or salary range was like for your position so I know what numbers I can try push them to, and what your position was + years of experience at that time? I'm seeing huge differences online (but few reports so they could be inaccurate anyways) from 50k up to 150k.

16ykstv,Level 5 Software Dev vs Game Dev & Design,"Hi, I'm currently doing a level 5 Software Development course but i have the option to potentially switch to a Game Dev & Design course.

I'm a lot more interested in game development but want to keep that more of a hobby, but was thinking maybe doing a year of game design couldn't hurt? I was told i could easily apply to any tech related course with that.

Some downsides: less programming, currently we have 3 different classes that teach you some sort of programming and database methods (Microsoft Access). Meaning if i go with game dev and when i do go to a level 6 or start college i might be lacking in some knowledge.

Some positives: I get to actually see how game dev is taught, maybe it convinces me the grueling jaws of the games industry is worth it. Plus there's more creative modules that I'm interested in. I get to explore something i probably won't be able to in my later education, as I'm probably sticking to software development.

Game dev is more creative so i might as well use this opportunity to do something different and something that will help with my hobby, I'm already thinking of pursuing software dev for level 8, which is kind of more or less the same thing down the line but more complex.

Would love your input!

16f5q7e,"Choosing a Degree — Computer Science vs. Computer Science, Linguistics, and a Language","Hi! I'm a current sixth year student looking towards computer science at Trinity (and elsewhere) for next year. I'm curious about the different course options, and interested to hear from current students/grads. My main conundrum is between Integrated Computer Science or Computer Science, Linguistics, and a Language (in my case Spanish). I don't mind about CAO points — purely curious from the perspective of course quality.

Looking at module listings for first and second year, CSLL appears to miss out primarily on some of the more architecture-focused stuff (Electronics & IT, Microprocessor Systems) as well as some of the more statistics-based portions (Stat Analysis and Applied Probability). Would I be substantially missing out? I've had a passion for linguistics & language for years now; the idea of getting to study it in a more formalised setting (and getting a degree out of it) has a real appeal to me. I also like the idea of having a degree in a foreign language, both for professional purposes and for living abroad in general.

Aside from content, there's also structure — ICS offers both an internship and, obviously, a direct track to a Masters. Having an experience component incorporated into the course itself seems like it would be great, but at the same time having to search for internships in the future myself doesn't seem too daunting. The Masters is the other big plus, but I would almost prefer having more flexibility there (e.g. going elsewhere / pursuing a different focus etc.). CSLL's major thing is the mandatory Erasmus in third year; I would be hoping to head abroad for (at least part of) that year in ICS regardless. Do these components feel like they make much difference / have a massive impact on experience?

Beyond college, I've no real strong direction I want to head in; industry and academic research both have their appeal, but I'd like to leave myself open. Would a CSLL degree make any large difference in software opportunities vs. a mainstream CS one? 

Thanks to anyone who responds.",2023-09-10 17:14:13

But recently, I got into a call with one of the recruiters and they told me to rewrite my CV and make it 2 pages. They said that I should also list all my subjects and projects in my CV under education so that the HR would get a great idea of why they should select me and what I have done in my Master’s degree.

18blgup,DevOps vs early morning stand ups ha!,"Hi guys!

Propably that will get down voted but just for the laughs I'll write it for discussion anyways!
So currently on my new company that I have joined like a month already as DevOps engineer (middle level) everything is great.
It's full remote role and the tech stack so far isn't bad as well.

(Azurite DevOps etc)

The issue is that always I have been a hardcore night owl and even in my previous jobs somehow I managed to push early morning meetings for way later in day or start anyway later than the others but of course work as well till late evening.

Honestly I don't mind and I am okay even working sometimes a bit in weekend unpaid if it's needed on my own pace.

Yes you can tell I don't like very structured 9-5s.
The thing is that currently the tech lead if our current company isn't happy about it however he seems open to discuss it after sometime without though specifying when and how we can make it work.
I have found my self totally unproductive the days that I have to wake up earlier morning or finding my self sleeping for a lot hours during the work day because this classic annoying and imo not so useful dairy stand up.

I tried the last days to give updates in the team in a asynchronous way via chat and suggested some ideas how we can make it work as the same time informing them that I won't be in the daily stand up due to be rested and productive but today I found a very strict email from tech leading saying that we should address that.
Calling me also to comply immediately to their 9-5 but implying that in time we can discuss changes in working hours in initial time.

He suggested a meeting also in two days.
How can come about this?

Imo I shouldn't back off. I should be still assertive about the issue and try to make them come with a solution on it and not a vague promise for the nearby feature.

I have as well a medical card under my belt that causes me to have bad sleep sometimes the nights but I don't want yet to use it",2023-12-05 20:28:45

I have a 1 year diploma in Full Stack Development (pending certification) and plan to continue studying for software development. I want more projects under my belt before I start applying for jobs. I like to be more prepared before I start applying for junior roles (Slim pickings at the moment). I have worked years in SaaS companies doing support for applications but never Tech Support.

1987cjq,2 years as a BDR with a technical background. Advice needed.,"Hello everyone, hoping for some advice.

I bring 2 years of BDR experience from a prominent tech company, holding an undergrad non-technical degree from a top university and a 1-year MSc conversion in Software. I acknowledge a technical gap compared to those with 3/4 years of pure computer science backgrounds. Truth told the degree itself hasn't been worth the paper it's written on beyond some very basic java and kubernetes. 

Currently earning just under 100k as a BDR and I have considered a transition to a more lucrative sales role if possible. On the other hand I would like some advice on a potential pivot into a technical position. I'm thinking either another BDR role with a possible progression to AE in 18 months or leveraging my MSc through self-upskilling.

Despite potential criticism, my primary motivation is financial, driven by family responsibilities. With 15 hours a week available, I'm seeking recommendations for new skillsets. In essence, my focus is on compensation due to life circumstances. I'm aware of the passion vs. compensation debate, but providing for my family is my priority at 30 years old. What would be more financially rewarding long term and how might this path look?

TL;DR: With 2 years of BDR experience, a non-technical undergrad, and an MSc in Software, I seek advice on transitioning to a more lucrative sales role or a softer pivot into a technical position. My primary motivation is financial due to family responsibilities. I have 15 hours a week for upskilling and welcome recommendations.",2024-01-16 16:44:42

1amrscz,Choosing between roles,"Hi all, 

I follow this subreddit often but I never contribute. But I felt like it would be a good place to come for some advice. I've been placed in a fairly fortunate situation where I have several roles on offer to me. With that said, I am very conflicted on where I should go.    
    
My background is I have a BSc. and about 7 YOE. I am currently working in a staff role for 125k base with zero other benefits (smaller company). I started to interview around because this current company I am with I felt didn't really appreciate the effort I was putting in. I am basically killing myself working at this place to a degree and I just hate the work. It's so difficult, only I can do it and no one else is of any help. I mean that in a nice way. I have a bit of a background in AI / ML and I am the only person here who can do it, and we need a LOT of it. It's very applicable to the business model and I am being torn 12 different directions at any given moment. Another issue is we have no CTO so I'm having to lead from the bottom which is fierce difficult when the people you work with are almost twice as old as you are. So, all of that decoration in there, it's not sunshine and rainbows despite the hefty salary, and despite my genuine like for the people, I wasn't so sure of the business model. So I started poking around to protect my own interests. Now here's the score:    
    
    

Offer 1    
* Principal role for the same money    
* There's a bonus on top (10%)    
* The workload will definitely be a lot less as I will not be the highest paid person in the room, and there are more engineers there.    
* It is based in an area more local to me    
* It's more remote than my current role (1 day in office per month, vs 1 days per week at current job)    
* Downside is the tech is far less interesting.     
     

Offer 2    
* Senior engineer role (title step down)    
* 120k instead of 125k, 80k in RSUs 4 year vest period    
* Full remote, no office to speak of    
* Not the greatest culture from the sense of it. Very American. I've worked for American places before and I liked it but this gives me the bad kind of American vibe.    
    
    
Offer 3
* Tech lead role
* 110k base, lots of extra benefits healthcare, pension, etc etc     
* Size in between Offer #1 and #2 which is more ideal to me 
* Much more interesting tech stack than the other two at least to me   
* Seems to have better glassdoor reviews than #2    
* Hybrid in office 2 days per month in south Dublin (far!)   
    
    
And originally, if I had just choosing between these, I probably couldn't have gone wrong. But now the big upset is that the company I am currently working for has made some money. They're financially stable and it's going to stay that way. The workload is definitely going to skyrocket. I mean, it was already difficult enough choosing between 1 2 or 3 there because there's loads of smaller impressions I am not getting across on this post. But now if I select any of them I will be utterly fucking destroying this company that I currently work for.    
    
The kicker as well is I have some kind of equity deal with them. It's in my contract but I haven't directly been given it yet. So I could be walking away from a very big pay day but it will kill me to get there. One other thing that kind of holds me back is I haven't been with these guys a year yet and it will probably look like a blemish on my resume if I leave now. 
   
Any advice? I appreciate this might come across as not cool due to the amount of posts on here complaining about the job market, but my experience with it has been just fine at least for my experience level and background.",2024-02-09 16:15:59

I recently passed a Level 7 in Software Development with a Merit 2, I realize this probably isn't a great result. I did lose interest due to some personal issues but returned to repeat my project module, but the repeat result was capped and ended up bringing my GPA down.

I am on a gap year (or two) in Australia at the moment and the type of visa I am on does not allow me to work with one employer for more than 6 months, so pretty much rules out any software related jobs (bar maybe contract it support, which I am looking into.)

So I'm in the middle of developing a SaaS in the health and fitness niche. I am currently creating a prototype after doing a small amount of early idea validation. With the prototype done I will do more extensive validation and refinement of the idea before developing the MVP (if the potential customers are receptive) or if the next stage goes badly (ie. people just aren't willing to pay for my solution) potentially scrap the idea.

I have a 2 hour meeting scheduled for today with a business consultant assigned to me by my LEO.

I want to get the most out of this meeting but honestly I have no idea what to prepare and what to ask him. What kind of information should I have prepared for him to give him the best info he needs to help me? Does he need financial projects and a business plan? (I have both - but just want to know whether I should be able to talk over them). Maybe I'm overthinking it but it's two hours and could be very valuable to me in the future and I just want some advice on what I should prepare so that I get the most out of it!

I am a Canadian Cloud Engineer with around 15 years of full-time IT experience (7-8 years as Cloud Engineer and the rest as Software Developer). I have worked mainly at big Canadian Banks in my career.

I am interested in exploring the job market in Ireland and thus have questions:

How is the Cloud Engineering job market and demand in Ireland? Do companies in Ireland hire Cloud Engineers from Canada or do they prefer from some other part of the World?

Should I start exploring and applying for Cloud Engineering roles in Ireland or should I first upskill to a Cloud Architect here in Canada and then apply for Cloud Architect roles?

16uff0f,Moving into UX from software engineering,"Perhaps an unusual career shift, but I am finding myself interested less in software engineering and more in providing a better user experience as of late. I started poking around Figma and there's a very good UX culture within my company, but I haven't spoken to anyone about it yet.

This is mostly motivated by being in a team with a poor structure with lots of tech debt and inability to get anything done quickly, all while product keep piling on feature work. I tried to battle this, but the rest of the team seem ok with it, so I wasn't able to influence that much change. I think I have developed a bit of a fatigue to coding because of it - time to pull the plug and change teams.

Has anyone managed this kind of change in their career? I know there's a big learning curve to UX and I wouldn't have had the same education as junior UX designers, but it is something I find really interesting.

I'm currently in 4th year of Software Development and I was hoping to have college done and dusted by now but I'm after finding out I failed a repeat exam. I have already had to repeat a year in 2nd year and I really don’t want to repeat another year and turn a 4 year course into a 6 years. I currently hate college, I enjoy coding in my own time and working on personal projects but everything to do with college I hate it. I feel like I've learned very little from college as I have never been able to concentrate and take in information in a class/lecture. Anything I have learned is from online courses and YouTube. I done the level 8 solely to make the job hunt easier after college but now I'm wondering is it worth it anymore? Even If I pass the repeat next year it would still just be a pass degree, nothing higher where as I have a level 7 First class honours and I was thinking of just focusing on online courses/personal projects but how would I explain the last year on a CV or to an interviewer? Any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated as my head is scrambled.",2023-08-15 15:56:01
15ngrip,What is the standard redundancy packages are like in IT in Ireland?,"The ""Inside Business"" podcast was discussing the recent Accenture redundancies and one of the speakers mentioned that Accenture offered 4 weeks pay + statutory minimum per year of service as redundancy package in the last round of redundancies some six months ago - and in his opinion, that was below the industry norms / standards.

This got me thinking. What is the industry norm when it comes to redundancies? Employers don't like us discussing salaries, and there seems a thing against discussing redundancy terms as well now, and you can't find much on Glassdoor / equivalent about something like this either.

I know that not too long ago my own place of work let a small number ( < 30 ) people go, and they were paid just the statutory minimum - that is €600 per year of service. Absolute pittance given the folks let go were probably on 100k+ with 10+ years of service. And of course,  the management won't disclose it or own up to it, and I suspect there will be more redundancy announcements in future.

I am a new developer and not with many years of experience. I just want to know if this is regular?

Our tech lead merges stuff into master branch sometimes without any one reviewing his code. Which sometimes lead to bugs etc. 
also he doesn’t write tests for the front end. it’s like no one can tell him what to do. 

Not sure how to approach this as he is a bit hierarchical and has years of experience.

I know theres been many posts in the past asking about this 1 year Hdip but haven't seen any in a good while. 

I have been a Tech Recruiter for 9 years and in December wrapped up the Full Stack Diploma with Code Institute. It was a shockingly poor course but confirmed for me that I would love to transition into a career in Software Development. I live in Maynooth and have heard positive things about the Hdip and as a Recruiter I know MU is well regarded. I want to learn more but also become more employable. Codacademy and Udemy have been great but employers pay little attention to certs etc from there.   


I finish my current Recruitment contract this August and thankfully have a partner who could support me during the semester. I understand the market is very turbulent and roles are hard to come by, but to be honest, it's even worse for Recruitment. I do have an opportunity to apply for a Customer Support Engineer role at my current company but it doesn't feel like it involves much actual programming and I also do want to improve my skills/learn more.

I’m currently a Senior DE.

Considering also approaching current employer with the idea, as my brother successfully did this (although his was a DA/BA role, and my company is a consultancy (small)). ",2024-02-27 10:09:36
1b19dxk,Advice on my current job situation,"So some context. TLDR at the end.

I've been in my current role for 3 years now. I work for a mechanical engineering company basically but they have started to automate some of their products and this required mechatronic/software Devs to do this. It's a small team of 5 mechatronic engineers and 3 software Devs.

We are responsible for up-keep and development of a REST API which our customer uses to integrate their current WMS into so they can control these automated products.

The first year of work wasn't so bad, was literally me, another mechatronic engineer and a remote engineer from Canada doing pure R&D on this product. Sat in a room testing over and over for a whole year. Was a very easy job back then to be honest but pay was poor (€26,500) but was my first job out of college in my local area which I didn't think I would ever find and was easy enough that I was happy to get experience. My boss was super chill also and gave us alot of lee-way and freedom to both develop the project whatever way we saw fit and personal freedom for time off etc. As long as work was done, it didn't matter if we did it in 1 day and did nothing the rest of the week. Overtime was probably an hour a day but didn't really care as I enjoyed the work. Also after 6 months I got a raise up to 35,000. At the time I was amazed but obviously was below market for a dev but for context my county isn't the most desirable in this old green country of ours to live or work in so prospects were slim outside of moving to one of the big tech centers.

Year 2 they decided to try shipping this to the customer. The product was not ready but thankfully the customer was understanding of this and knew it was an R&D product and didn't pressure much and were just happy to make progress. The customer is in the US so my boss and the mechatronic engineer went out and I supported them remotely(at the time I was annoyed I didn't get to go but oh god how I long for 2 weeks at home just answering support questions for them now). The problem started about halfway through my second year. I was asked to go to the US to assist in the customer install. I obliged and went. 1 week in the customer had to pause the project due to another product they bought malfunctioning. With this, in the background our company had sold a second customer this product so myself and the other engineer were asked to drive 6 hours to the new customer and start their install. We did and I ended up spending 8 weeks out there(boss only spent 2 weeks at a time and at this time he only did 1 week, the other engineer did 3, home for a week, then 2). I was annoyed as previous to leaving I had asked my boss for a raise up to 50,000. Just looking at jobs in other places which would be similar job wise to mine like Dundalk I could easily see graduate jobs for 50k. I was 7 weeks into my stay before my boss came to me to say he got me a raise to 45k. Great but still a bit miffed I was putting in all this work.

So this next part is basically year 2.5 -> present.

After that the job started to show it's cracks, the team didn't expand at the rate it should have(I was doing full stack Dev at this point using the MEVN stack and got a friend a job to assist me after 4 months of that) and the other side of the team(mechatronics) got 1 new person. Yet we had jumped from selling 1 of these things to a customer who was involved in the R&S process to selling 25 of these things, the 1st original, the 2nd machine I went to(which is the only machine to be running in production with *minimal* issues), another 3 to a big US customer who put 2 in one place and 1 in another all done with piss poor site visits if I do say so myself, and 20, to one customer, in one bespoke built site just for these, because they were happy with the successful install I had did(the second customer site is the same customer who bought this 20).

I've rambled enough so to cut a story as short as I can, we didn't have the manpower to cope with these, 3 machines have been pulled by the customer as they couldn't perform what they were told it could do(damn salesmen), 1 was kept due to my relationship with the customer I convinced them that after visiting another one of their sites it would be a perfect fit for there and so far it's working. I quit this time last year and I went from 45k to 80k because and I quote the CEO *I would have to pay 2 men 40k to replace you so I've no problem giving you 80k.* This pleased and pissed me off because it showed I was being underpaid and that I'm doing the job of 2 people **a year ago**.

Since then I've taken on basically the project manager role of organising everything. My boss got promoted to head of R&D, but no one was promoted to lead our team and he had too much to manage it. He also had some personal things happen which caused him to take a lot of time off which is understandable. That's when I basically took on defacto manager. The team, their flight schedules, I meet with C-level both internally and with customer C-level to promote, sell, put out fires etc. I still manage the software side, trying to have weekly meeting if my schedule permits, actually writing code when no one is in the office to do it(which is the part of the job I actually enjoy), remote support. We close for 2 weeks over Christmas and I ended up pulling a 2pm - 2am shift to remotely support the customer because the project is 6-8 months behind and they have a business to run. I took a holiday to London and ended up taking a very heated meeting in the middle of the street on my phone with  C-level from both our side and the customer, and the only one to speak in the meeting was me because neither side had any clue how the business ran over Christmas because they all took the time off.

Basically I'm burnt out doing my monthly hours in a fortnight. I didn't do a single full day in the office for the past month and I still come out with 10+ hours of overtime from phone calls in the evenings or late emails or meetings.

I've talked to the CEO again and handed in my notice. I said I would give 4 weeks of notice and explained everything to him(mostly the customers are too demanding and there are 2 people on the team who don't pull their weight or are just too hard to deal with) and he's given me a month vacation and a cash bonus. He also said it doesn't matter if I still want to quit when I come back but he would rather I took the time off. We spoke in depth about all the issues for 2 hours before I left and he does seem committed to fixing the problems and getting more of a WLB.

My question is: should I stay until I have another job secured? I know the job market is slightly rocky these days and what I've applied to on linked in I've only gotten rejections(granted I haven't put my all into it, just half assed it.) Or should I even stay and set out the reasons I'll stay if X,Y,Z changes which the CEO is willing to do it's just wether it's filled through on. Just would like to know other people opinion as this being my first job I don't know what else is out there!

Anyway thanks for listening to my rant. There's so much I've left out but don't want this getting really long winded.

TLDR: First job out of college, went from junior to PM in 3 years because the job required it. Working 50-60 hour weeks for the past 2 years. Quit my job and wondering if I was wise doing so.

Edit: Spelling and also I would like to clarify that my ""salary"" is actually hourly. So I make 80k a year for my base and everything after my regular 40 hours is 1.5x my hourly rate(so 38.50/hour)",2024-02-27 11:13:03
1b0r6pk,Switching jobs 5 months in as a junior,"I made a post ages ago about how my project manager essentially ruined my first project by telling me to do stuff wrong, refused to communicate with me and a bunch of other stuff. Reddits general consensus was, it’s my responsibility but not my fault my project manager wasn’t up to scratch.
It is worth mentioning this person no longer manages projects after what happened with me, in fact they now work under a project manager.


Turns out a new “hierarchy” at work was implemented and this ex project manager ended up writing my performance review. I tried to rebuttal (with all my proof, emails etc) and I essentially got shouted at, publicly, in the staff kitchen (very embarrassing, still very upset, although very proud of myself for not crying, I’m literally just a girl trying her best here). 


Anyway, I tried not to let the above get to me until I started working with another project manager. Seems word gets around and this project manager essentially hinted at the fact that I’m “known” to struggle. 


Some days pass, some code wasn’t up to scratch so I revamped it completely and produced it for my next meeting. It’s essentially something that makes my life easier but will also make my whole teams life easier. New Project manager looks over it and is genuinely perplexed? “I didn’t know you could code this well?”. Said code is now implemented and used throughout my team.


So, my ex project manager has definitely been chatting shite about me. The above instance has happened a further 2 other times with even higher management, looking at me shocked I was actually able?!? To do my job?


Ex project manager said as a result of how bad my performance review was management is thinking of extending my probation. Honestly, I’m absolutely devastated. I don’t know if they’re even telling the truth or not because no one else has said ANYTHING about it to me and my probation is supposed to end in like 2 weeks. I also just want to leave, my character has been tainted and a possible probation extension is never good news.


Do you think it’s possible to get a new job after only being employed in your area for 5 months? I’m so scared of jumping ship and it ending up going badly for me. I used to adore coding and this job really makes me miserable and hate it. I feel like I’m in school again, every morning I wake up feeling sick at the thought of going into work :(",2024-02-26 20:05:02

however, its poor on SEO and i can't figure out how to improve it.

Would anyone know if i hired an SEO optimization expert, would I be able to fully offset this cost in my tax return this year? 

I know my accountant can probably answer this, but he charges per email so hoping for some friendly advice here.

Advice sought.

Little bit about myself.

-> I am a computer engineer who passed out in 2014.

-> Due to family commitments, I was looking for part time jobs only at that point.

Could not find many options back then in Dublin, so finally landed a customer Support role part time role. The job was highly flexible, paid good hourly rates when compared to other competitors , could not complain.

-> Finally last year I reached a point where I can finally work full time (remote). Gave couple of interviews and landed a Support grad role in a Fortune 100 Product based company. Pay is 42K.

Now this product is inhouse, there are virtually no other openings in Ireland; there are some in mainland EU, but don't want to relocate. 
Also the pay increases here are very minimal. I do not expect reaching 60K base even after spending 10 years here. I must add that there not much work pressure. The company also laid off some staff recently, so if I out in the job market, it would be tough just with this product knowledge.

-> I would like to get into some area where there are more job prospects. Don't want to go into development at all.

Are there any areas where I can make a move to, don't need Development/ coding and there are better job prospects? How to proceed here? Maybe there are some courses?

It seems like I’ll need to be on campus 9am to 4pm M-F for fall and spring semesters based on the current couse schedule. Is this the same for the summer term? From my understanding, the summer term consists of a group research project. Do you still end up spending the typical 8 hours a day, 5 days a week on campus, or is there more flexibility during this term? Can people intern internships or work part time as well?

1avjzlr,Bored. Came up with a new Dev paradigm ie. The D.C. Ratio :-),"Kinda bored in work today, reading docs. Got me thinking about the web programming process, much of which revolves around reading docs and coding, of which you'll be already aware. I came up with a new theory; feedback welcome.

When I'm stuck in a bug for more than 2 hours, inevitably the solution involves reading the docs more carefully. It's hard to pull yourself away from the code editor though and I always believe the answer is just around the corner if I stick with it. Coding is a drug.

My latest theory _du jour_ posits that your DC (Docs / Coding) Ratio should be something of which you should always be aware. Although it'll vary depending on your experience, platform, task, issue, familiarity with your tech stack and job etc. If your DC Ratio falls below a certain lower threshold, you're probably going to run into blind alleys and time-consuming bugs.

If your DC Ratio goes above a certain upper threshold you won't be racking up those KLOCS and your productivity might suffer.

Long story short, in the planning and project management phase of a project. Should you be estimating your optimal DC Ratio for the new project ahead?

I'm about to interview for a first line It support role at a small company (only employs around 40 people). The thing is it  requires experience administrating using Windows Microsoft Office 365, of which I have absolutely 0 experience. 

Wondering what would be the best place to undertake a course if anyone has experience administrating with windows and 365? And is it something you can pick up quite quickly?

The role states that it is a ""fairly junior IT Support role but it is standalone and you will report directly to the Office Manager (non-technical) who is able to provide assistance alongside the business's third party IT Support provider"", so I am worried if I did get it being on my own would be quite tough. 

I have been a hardware technician for the past year and a half and dealt with other software issues when they arose along with that, but I recently got laid off.

1artmbr,Seeking Advice : transitioning into Cloud Computing Roles in Ireland.,"
Hello r/DevelEire,

I am a recent  Master's in Cloud Computing graduate from the National College of Ireland (first-class honours) and have a background in web development (3 YOE - RESTful API’s in Django and learnt a little about Database Optimisation, No cloud experience prior), also pursuing the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certificate at the moment. 

I am reaching out to this knowledgeable community for advice that could help me transition into cloud computing in this slow market. Here's what i want to know:

1. What are the typical entry-level or junior roles in cloud computing that I should target, considering my background? How best should I approach my job search for these roles within the Irish tech market?
2. To qualify for these roles, what additional skills or knowledge should I focus on acquiring? Given my pursuit of AWS certification (also looking into linux, docker, Jenkins, Iaas), are there other technologies or certifications that are highly valued in the industry?
3.Since I have no cloud experience,  I understand the importance of demonstrating practical skills through projects. Could you suggest types of projects that would be impressive to include in my portfolio.
4.Finally, I'd appreciate any job search strategies or tips specific to the cloud computing field and the Irish job market

Thanks, and I am eagerly looking forward to the responses.

1ar158k,Shifting from Design to Dev full Time after burnout,"Hi all, I recently moved back to Ireland and am looking for a new job. I have been working as a designer for well over 10 years; however, 50% of my day-to-day work is now dev work.

I’m always reluctant to call myself a developer. I can hold my own in conversations with other devs on calls and have easily slotted into more complex projects, but I can never shake the self-taught imposter syndrome that I carry around. Luckily, my design background typically comes into play, and I’m back in my comfort zone. I find myself most apprehensive at the start of a project when I’m introduced to an in-house dev who often scoffs when I refer to myself as a designer who codes.

After so many years of working with multiple clients at a time and shifting roles, I am completely burnt out and exhausted from deadline fatigue. I can’t do anything in my personal life without another deadline hanging over me.

I’m thinking about making a career shift to a more product-focused role (which is new to me). I’m undecided if I should focus on UX/UI or if I should properly invest in my dev skills. My aim is to have more space in my work and find a better balance with fewer deadlines.

I’m looking for any advice on making this shift. Can my background in design help me? Are there any industries I should consider if I want an easier life? The idea of working in-house is completely new to me and terrifying if I’m honest.",2024-02-14 23:30:06
1aovy2p,RecruitSafe Pre-Screening - should I be worried?,"So I recently applied for contracts which would pay for me to get a degree - they're quite competitive and hard to get. I got accepted in one, that started a few months ago, didn't require any background check or anything. 

But I now have offers from two places that pay >50% more, so I want to take one of those. Those don't start for another few months. 

However, both require pre-screening background checks. One of the jobs uses Sterling, which should be alright - it makes you submit documents yourself, and you can tell them not to contact your ex-employer.

But the other one, which pays a good bit more, uses Recruit Safe. And that has me worried. Their website specifically says they don't ask for applicant input as they don't want anything omitted, and that while they understand employers can be reluctant to provide information as to performance etc, they try to get as much as possible.

This could be a problem, as in my last job, the HR person was pretty toxic, took a dislike to me which led to me getting written up constantly over trivial things until I got fired - at which point they tried to breach my contract by firing me without warning on the spot with no pay. Had to go through a lot to get it all sorted.

I have no problems in my current job, and they would say I do good work, but Recruit Safe won't contact them as they weren't on my CV when I applied for the other jobs.

I'm very worried that when Recruit Safe contact my last employer, they will give me a terrible reference that may result in my offer being revoked.

This is an issue as I need to leave my current place very soon, before they pay for my degree. But I'm really worried about leaving this sure thing for a much more attractive option that might be pulled out from under me because of a bad reference, and I'll be stuck with nothing.

1ageh4n,Career Change or Company Change,"Hey all, thought I might be able to get some advice here about finding an interest in my work again or if I should just change career.

I’m currently a backend dev with ~3 YOE, been with the same company that whole time and am generally well liked (that I know of). Recently I’ve felt my work slipping, and my motivation even more, to the point that I could be at risk of going below the new higher standard for minimum expectations, and dealing with the consequences of that. Up to this point, I’ve consistently gotten scores for my performance that were just above expectations, but nothing exceptional, and I’m not confident that the upcoming review will be very good at all. Some of my colleagues who started around the same time as me, in similar or the same roles, seem to be excelling and I keep feeling like I’m constantly out of my depth, while the expectations for my ability understandably rise with time.

I’ve been considering a move for a while but I really have no idea what else is out there that will actually interest me or that I’d be especially suited for. I don’t think I’m a particularly noteworthy dev, but if I can work on something that really grabs me, I know I’ll get good work done. I believe I’m good with people, and would probably do well in some kind of semi technical role, but with a bit more focus on the people than the code. I can’t complain about the company at all, there’s no requirement to be in the office, the people are nice, and the salary is pretty fair (based off the Morgan McKinley calculator). Just worried that changing out of a dev role will come with a drop in salary that could affect my living situation.

I guess I’m just looking for opinions from anyone who’s been through this before, or at least some ideas of any career change that sounds a bit more up my alley. From some research, I really wasn’t able to find anything that jumped out at me.

Cheers!

TLDR: feeling burnt out but don’t know if I should switch things up and ruin a good setup.",2024-02-01 16:07:08

So far, all of the 18 months I have worked as a dev have been with the same agency - really enjoy the work and the company, no major complaints. Am looking around now to see if I can find a better-paying role, and am in talks with a recruiter about a job at a large (non-software) company as an in-house dev.

Those of you who have worked at both - which do you prefer, and what are the pros and cons of each scenario? I enjoy changing projects & teams every few months or even weeks, and worried that I might not find it as interesting working for a large, non-tech company, but am interested to hear your perspectives - thanks!",2024-01-26 22:41:38

19d1bfr,IT - Only Diploma," 

Background . I am 48 and want to relocate from South Africa to Ireland. Will be getting our EU passports from my wife’s side she is Italian. I have a Master Computer Diploma with a few IT related courses under my belt like A+ N+ MCSE, VMware, Exchange, Server, Office 365 but no certifcation, because all the companies that I worked for never chased technology and they stagnated on one or the other platform for e.g Server 2016 and was never planning to upgrade to never versions. So why would I do any new certifications if I am not going to use it and most certification expires every +- 3 years.

I would like to stay in the company if possible for obvious reasons, so what would you suggest me to do?

17gte5y,Advice on living arrangements for graduate position in Cherrywood,"Hi All, 

I have a graduate position for next year lined up based on my performance in my third year internship placement. My internship was completely remote, however the grad position is not (3 days is suggested). I don't have any assigned team at the moment, so I'm not even sure if they will be in the office (my internship team was completely remote). Some other tech interns did have their team in the office. The office is located in Cherrywood. 

I live with family, the nearest bus stop is 5k away (I don't have a license) and the trip is about 2 hours each way. I'm fortunate enough to live on the Cherrywood side of the route so I can get there before the traffic gets real bad. The starting salary is €45000, if everything goes well I expect one significant increase once I'm not ""junior"" anymore

I would like to move out, as I'm 30+ but I'm also aware that I could make some significant savings by staying in my current position. I can see studio apartments which take about 60% of rent, so that seems like a no-go. There are some sharing opportunities that don't seem terrible but still not ideal. I've tried to look at places on the commuter belt (Rosslare-Dublin) but currently there seems to be nothing really available (granted this could change closer to the date).

I would like to be in/close-to Dublin for other social reasons as well

Apologies for rambling, basically, any advice for a grad starting out?

17fqs00,FE dev certifications,"Had a meeting recently with my team lead and with budgets being reworked it was mentioned that if I want to get any certifications I should raise it as there will likely be funds to do so. My question is, being a mainly FE dev (Vue), other than the official Vue certification what kind of certs do people go for and is the official Vue cert worth doing ? Or are certs not really worth a whole lot as a dev ? Might be totally off but always thought certs were more for the Azure and maybe dev-ops fellas, not so much devs.",2023-10-24 23:30:40

xfj9ay,Computer Science is hard.,"I see lots of posts here with people asking for advice about learning cs and coding with incredibly unrealistic expectations. People who will say ""I've been studying cs for 2 months and I don't get Turing machines yet"", or things like that.

People, computer science is Hard! There are lots of people that claim you can learn enough in a 4 month crash course to get a job, and for some people that is true, but for most of us, getting anywhere in this field takes years.

How does [the internet, Linux, compilers, blockchain, neutral nets, design patterns, Turing machines, etc] work? These are complicated things made out of other complicated things made out of complicated things. Understanding them takes years of tedious study and understanding.

There's already so much imposter syndrome in this industry, and it's made worse when people minimize the challenges of this field. There's nothing worse than working with someone who thinks they know it all, because they're just bullshiting everyone, including themselves. 

So please everyone, from an experienced dev with a masters degree in this subject. Heed this advice: take your time, don't rush it, learn the concepts deeply and properly. If learning something is giving you anxiety, lower your expectations and try again, you'll get there eventually. And of course, try to have fun.

Edit: Thanks for the awards everyone.",2022-09-16 06:04:00

jbpylo,The advice I wish I would have recieved a few years ago,"When I was first starting my undergrad in CS, I came to this sub in utter frustration.  I had learned java, and was being asked to learn other languages, too. I struggled to adapt.  I knew the concepts, but I didn't know how to translate that into another language. I didn't even know how to start learning C or C++.  I came here asking for advice and reassurance, however I received anything but.

""If you can't learn another language, you shouldn't be in the field.""""You should switch majors now before you've gone too far, because you're going to be worthless in the field.""""What did you expect when you signed up for CS?  Of course you're going to have to learn another language. Get over yourself.""

These comments on a long deleted post stuck with me.  The people who posted them have probably forgotten what they said.  They have no idea how hard it was for me to read those words, and how their words made me genuinely think that I wasn't cut out for this area of study.

They were wrong.  I'm now about to graduate, am in the top 10% of my class, and have overcome the struggle of adapting to new languages (mostly!).  I'm still far from being an expert, but I've come a long ways.

I'm now here to give the advice my younger self was seeking, in the hopes that it'll help some of you who feel discouraged in the same way I was.

1. Learning a new programming language gets easier over time.  Of course you're going to struggle when you learn your first or second language! That's fine! It's normal! It's a new concept for you! Don't give up!
2. Focus on the big picture!  Learn about efficiency, data structures, and theories.  Explore data science and machine learning.  Don't be afraid to take a class just because you don't know the language that'll be used!  Computer science is more than learning the differences between python and java.  So much more.
3. Just because you know a lot of languages doesn't necessarily mean anything.  It's more important to know the concepts and how to apply those concepts in your code.  You can always google for the specific implementation!
4. Reading all the documentation about a language doesn't mean anything until you sit down and start coding.  I know it's anxiety inducing. I know it's tough to get to that point.  Start off learning how to print, how to make lists/arrays, and how to iterate.  Implement those concepts.  That'll give you a good idea of how to begin.  Your compiler or IDE may give you errors. That's fine!  You can learn from them.  Just start at the first error you get, and work your way through.
5. Everyone struggles in the beginning.  You're not unusual for crying out of frustration.  You just need to take a deep breath and ask for help.  If you're struggling, you should seek out people willing to help you.  There's no shame in it.
6. Don't listen to miserable people on the internet.  You are good enough.  You chose a hard field, but you got this.

And my final bit of advice goes to the people on this sub:

Be kind.  Your words have meaning, even if you comment in a hurry.  The person on the other end may genuinely be affected by what you say, so make sure they're affected positively.

8xzwet,"As a CS person who hires both developers and CS kids, here is some advice","(This is going to be enlightening to some and very brutal to others. I dont apologize for anything as this is reality.)

Edit 2: will be away for a bit bit will return to answer questions later. TLDR: To me, CS is a beautiful art. The blend of CS and Math and other disciplines makes it imo one of the best skillset to have! I hate seeing the new javashit.js bloated pushed around so much and not enough promo is being made for CS. Keep CS beautiful!

PLEASE DO YOUR MATH AND STATS! This is the best advice i can give anyone out there! I see many questions on here about how relevant is calculus and linear algebra in the workplace. Let me answer that with a simple statement: You can work for me or you can work with me.

Ive hired quite a few people that went to some school for Web Programming/Angular.js/blablabla framework bootcamp/shortcourse and yes ive hired them for the going rate of what a web developer but the problem is they remain right there, with no chance of moving up. Ive heard all the complaints about ""Not progressing, not going up, not being given enough opportunities to do more serious stuff..."" All they end up doing is converting excel spreadsheets into databases and make front end forms to fill the data.

CS is definitely not programming - get that out of your head! At some point, every business/workplace has some challenges that need those special CS skills to solve. And people with CS are very hard to find usually only 2-3&#37; of the resumes i go through have proper CS in them.

At my previous job I was work in metal mining and I had hired a CS kid for his co-op term and he didnt even know half of the programming languages out there but he said he was OK with Python. What was really impressive was his background in computer vision, algorithms, linear algebra, calculus etc. We had to de-water a lake up north in the north west territories and we had to estimate the number of fish in that lake that would be afected to report back to the RCMP, the local government, fisheries etc.

We brought in ""experts"" and nobody seemed to offer a good solution. This kid and I were going to work together on this project. You can imagine the massive backlash from our web developers. They tore me a new asshole, they brought the fury of the god of war on me. But my superiors knew the reason i chose this kid over our existing developers - they did not have the skills needed for this task and we are not a college that can teach them these skills. We tried to explain to them that they need a different set of skills for different tasks, we've even offered them paid training on some topics to get them started however they declined because of the math prep work needed. Unfortunately you need that 4 years of college education for that and we as a company cannot do such a thing. So naturally the developers hated him, excluded him out of their inner circle, would crack jokes at how he didnt know MVC and made fun of him when he was using python.

So we developed an underwater camera system using a few cameras placed in some spots in the lake. Kid wrote an algorithm that could identify fish in the video frames and he used his statistical knowledge and gave us a good solution on how to estimate the population of fish in that lake. We then spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to catch each fish and tag them so they could be transferred to another lake. His estimate was about 94&#37; of the total fish we caught, a very impressive number! After that, all the other developers calmed their rage and they knew there was a clear distinction between them and this kid. This kid didnt know shit about MVC or angular or node and shit but he had what we really needed for us to get our environment permitting completed!

We worked on a few other interesting math-inspired projects until he got caught up by some oil company who was really impressed with the work he did for us and their office was close to where his parents lived so he relocated to the US.

So please, do your math! Ive been through calc and i hated it, but i pressed my nose and just went for it. I even went for the full specialist option in CS, it sucked balls, my life was spent in books and tears. I didnt really know what I was going to do in life and where I was going with all this math but I am so glad i did it even though i didnt get all A's in them lol. It does really pay off especially statistics which will open up a huge array of opportunities. Take up every opportunity you can: teachers office hours, TAs, workshops and anything you can. Math is not hard, youre just doing it wrong. People who are good in math are good at it because they figured out how to elarn math. Take the time and figure that out. My reason was simply i was overthingking math and that was making me panic often. Do it, because that math and stats skill will make you shine exponentially brighter during interviews! Ive known people at other companies offer a bonus cheque and RSU options if their CS candidate would take the offer.

\###Do not underestimate CS!

Couple of other things i see on here and I can help answer:

\##Do grades and GPA matter?

No not really, unless we have doubts during the interview then we would want to see how you perform academically maybe youre just the type of person shy in interviews but when left alone you can do the job or at least be able to do the research needed to get the job done. However some companies put in a minimum GPA which i think is stupid as it shows they dont really know what they are hiring so they use the GPA system as an indicator when hiring people - watch out for these companies! Unless they are intern/co-op positions which will use GPA as method of filtering out thousands of applications.

\##What programming languages to learn?

Shouldnt matter. The programming language used varies from company to company and if you are real CS, you shouldnt worry about that because the monkey coding is usually offshored or sent to contractors/consulting companies. We want to hire you to solve our problems and usually that just requires paper and you can prorotype in python or anyting and nobody would care.

\##Unix or windows?

Again for a CS position we dont care. Leave that to the monkey coders to figure out

\##How much math do you use everyday?

Quite a bit! I recently developed an algorithm that categorizes hazard and risk levels of contaminants (Arsenic, Asbestos, Beryllium etc) for underground workers in mines/excavation sites/drill rigs etc and it is almost purely based on statistics. That lower and upper confidence limits and the markov model do come in very handy!

\##Do you use proofs at work?

This is going to be probably one of the biggest points ive ever made. I hated proofs, i hated proving that fucking epsilon lies between whatever... I hated induction.. HOWEVER when i was first hired for my previous job as a CS kid, i had immediate and fierce reception from older self taught employees who have been ""programming"" for 10 years in their basements and were eyeing my position. I didnt understand until years later. Whenever i would create something, a simple algorithm for something, they would attack it and say they can do better or faster. This is where your proofs come in and you can also prove that their solution is faulty. This is where runtime algorithms and other proofing techniques (fucking induction) come in useful - you can PROVE that your solution works and if theirs is better, then they have to prove it using the same notation and technique - because this is what is required when you write published papers. The moment they see the Big-O notation is the moment they will scurry away and say ""sorry were too busy, go ahead with your project""

Because that proof is your defence and your CS degree is the biggest supporter of your claim. That is the fastest way to make your boss feel safe in hiring you for the job. Your boss might not (and shouldnt necessarily) know shit about CS but with that proof document, they can use that to defend you and use that for auditing purposes etc.

\##Can i use university lectures from course era and other online resources?

Yes by all means do it. You can even get certifications for these online courses and they are definitely better than those angular bootcamps. If i asked you to explain the normal distribution and how it can be used, then we're talking!

\##Do i need the certifications from these online courses?

Yes. Let me explain why, if I were to give you a task that would affect the health and safety of people, environment etc, then you need to have that certification because if my ass gets audited one day, that cert will show that you are certified by an issuing authority (the college) that you know this field and you know what you are doing.

""Computer science also differs from physics in that it is not actually a science. It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something""-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation.  


I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures.

This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

146av03,/r/ComputerScience will be going dark starting June 12th in protest against Reddit's API changes which will kill 3rd party apps & tools,"## Update (June 16th, 2023):

This subreddit remains closed to new submissions and comments as part of the ongoing protest over Reddit policy changes. However, we've chosen to switch the subreddit to read-only, so that existing user contributions will not be censored.

# What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader to Sync.

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

# What's the plan?

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

1. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at r/ModCoord - but please don't pester mods you don't know by simply spamming their modmail.

1. **Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

1. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.",2023-06-10 20:56:13

v4jezp,Research: Beating Google Recaptcha with 19 virtual machines for 10 hours straight,"&#x200B;

[Captcha destroyer in action](https://i.redd.it/htxodrx0wj391.gif)

I had this research project of developing my own captcha based on how you lose on this (deceptively easy) game. The idea is that a human would struggle to keep a finger in each dot since they move in random directions. It's INCREDIBLY hard.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lw1pizb4xj391.gif

Anyhow I set to beat the state-of-the-art captcha of the time (2020) which was Google Recaptcha. I used 19 virtual machines as proxies and one all-powerful main VM running a VNC server(VNC is remote desktop). The logic is that you attempt only once per IP. When you switch an AWS instance on/off, you get a different IP every time, from a pool of around 1000 per region. The main machine turns the others on/off via AWS Cli commands, then makes an SSH tunnel to each, so that Firefox ""thinks"" it's running from one of the proxies. The image recognition is done with AWS Rekognition. Clicking is done with xdotool and screenshots taken with Maim. It has to run on the cloud because screenhots need to be uploaded to S3, then processed in less than 6 seconds. 

I made several videos, each 10 hours long, that show the system working on various websites, including Stack Overflow, Reddit, HackerNews and the Google Vision Api website(as a joke that Google didn't find very funny)

Here are some videos of it working on different sites:

Google Vision API(Google was angry at this one): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d\_hnom0cLIU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_hnom0cLIU)

StackOverflow: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o8QHxy0ozo&t=2443s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o8QHxy0ozo&t=2443s)

Reddit: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhPqZk8v6y4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhPqZk8v6y4)

&#x200B;

I ALSO beat that captcha with the Animals AKA FunCaptcha(I think Linkedn uses it). As a comparison, Recaptcha took me like 2 months of hard work to beat, FunCaptcha took about a week and I had to use Google Vision API instead of AWS.

1an1pon,What's stopped hackers from altering bank account balances?,"I'm a primarily Java programmer with several years experience, so if you have an answer to the question feel free to be technical.

I'm aware that the banking industry uses COBOL for money stuff. I'm just wondering why hackers are confined to digitally stealing money as opposed to altering account balances. Is there anything particularly special about COBOL?

Sure we have encryption and security nowadays which makes hacking anything nearly impossible if the security is implemented properly, but back in the 90s when there were so many issues and oversights with security, it's strange to me that literally altering account balances programmatically was never a thing, or was it?",2024-02-09 23:19:18

1apz23m,Criticism of How Computer Science is Taught,"Throughout my computer science undergrad, I am disappointed by other students lack of interest and curiosity. Like how most show up to work with only a paycheck in mind, most students only ask, ""Will this be on the test?"" and are only concerned with deliverables. Doing only the bare minimum to scrape by and get to the next step, ""only one more class until I graduate"". Then the information is brain dumped and forgotten about entirely. If one only sees the immediate transient objective in front of them at any given time, they will live and die without ever asking the question of why. Why study computer science or any field for that matter? There is lack of intrinsic motivation and enjoyment in the pursuit of learning.

University has taken the role of trade schools in recent history, mainly serving to make young people employable. This conflicts with the original intent of producing research and expanding human knowledge. The chair of computer science at my university transitioned from teaching the C programming language to Python and Javascript as these are the two industry adopted languages despite C closer to the hardware, allowing students to learn the underlying memory and way code is executed. Python is a direct wrapper of C and hides many intricate details, from an academic perspective, this is harmful.

l2rnul,Good CS books that explain stuff clearly,"I really enjoyed these books so far:

* *Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software*: The author builds an imaginary computer from telegraph relays, chapter by chapter he explains everything clearly. Telegraph relays to logic gates to binary adders to RAM and a CPU and even a barebone assembly language. Very neat stuff!

* *Writing a Intepreter in Go* and its sequel *Writing a Compiler in Go*: The author starts from scratch and explains every little part of making a programming language, from the lexer to the parser to the interpreter with a REPL. In the second book he codes a VM and compiles the language to bytecodes that run on the VM

These books are nice in that they're not heavy with literature and math like most textbooks, they explain stuff clearly step by step and I feel like I learned so much from them and I want *more*

It just pisses me off that there are 26 letters in the alphabet and 325 pairs of letters you can choose and for some reason the pair that we all seem to use is (i,j).  
There are literally no two letters that look more alike and that could get more easily mixed up but for some reason whether it be in code are in my case here in proofs and papers these two letters are always used together.  
Why should I have to use a magnifying glass to read a damn proof from a paper that couldn’t have the decency to at least use a better font?

And it doesn’t stop at (i,j). 
We also love to use (m,n), (p,q), (u,v).

Now, my question is: from an algorithmic point of view, how can that be even remotely possible? I kind of understand how that would work when you are searching for a song title (a very efficient search algorithm operating on pre-sorted data on a server with a lot of computational power), but how can that work when looking for something like lyrics, where what you input is just enough words to make the result unique? 

(Of course, the Spotify example is just an example, and I’m sure lots of services offer similar and even more impressing features.)

1beov20,The Realities of the AI Developer,"Ever since Turing the idea of human-like machine intelligence floated around, but with recent advancements in computing power neural networks have deepened. The inclusion of GPT techniques have allowed the pushing of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) to heights never before seen. And now with the announcement of [Devin, the AI Software Engineer](https://www.cognition-labs.com/), the nails in the coffin of the profession that nearly all CS majors end up in is finally being hammered in. I hope to convince you of the opposite: many of the companies behind the push aren't the humanists they claim to be, and their claims are exaggerated or even completely fabricated.

Neural networks have been around for quite some time, [the idea dates back to the 1950s](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400882618-002/html). But the fundamental concept hasn't really evolved since. Sure, the techniques have gotten more clever, but essentially we're still relying on the fundamental perceptron design. Which, *if it works it works*. And it does quite well as a statistical learning technique. However, the important distinction that a while these are called neural networks they are massively different than human brains, both in operation and fundamental structure. [You don't have to take my word for it, though](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/03/1020247/artificial-intelligence-brain-neuroscience-jeff-hawkins/).

In 2021, Dr. Melanie Mitchell published a paper titled [*Why AI is Harder Than We Think*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12871)*,* in a direct challenge to the AI researchers of today. While I wholly endorse reading the paper in its entirety, Dr. Mitchell brought up four fallacies that AI researchers fall for (and as a consequence, the population that listens to them).

1. Narrow intelligence is on a continuum with general intelligence
2. Easy things are easy and hard things are hard
3. The lure of wishful mnemonics
4. Intelligence is all in the brain

Dr. Mitchell further argues that AI springs are common and followed by an AI winter. We are presently in an AI spring, and an AI winter is coming. It's powerful logic that's mostly been ignored by the larger AI community, who insist that [AGI is right around the corner](https://www.marketingaiinstitute.com/blog/sam-altman-ai-agi-marketing).

But [self-driving cars are still not a reality](https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/transportation/2024/02/14/waymo-issues-voluntary-recall-for-self-driving-car-software), and they were promised as early as 2015. We were promised by Elon Musk that they were going to take over. Ten years later we're still waiting and trillions of dollars have been spent on what seems to be the new fusion. So maybe it's time we stop listening to billionaires and start listening to real computer scientists, like Dr. Mitchell.

But truly these companies have made some very great advancements in the field of AI. And it's true, but i has come at a massive cost. The [electricity demands are massive](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-ai-boom-could-use-a-shocking-amount-of-electricity/) in a time when power consumption should be optimized on the dangerous precipice of a warming planet. The datasets used by OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft were hardly ethically obtained. And so we're left with a troubling realization that it certainly seems like this is just the new business craze (remember NFTs? Blockchain?) instead of a truly humanist pursuit. And those that cheer on them on hoping for the tech utopia of their dreams is just another form of wishful thinking.

So no, AGI isn't upon us, no matter how many times the [company who tried to trademark GPT](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075304/trademark-pto-openai-gpt-deny) tries to will it to be through marketing materials. An [Apple esque-bar graph](https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/devin-performance.png) is hardly scientific, and these companies are not ethical. They are out to make money, and have an invested interest in making the grandiose claims you see plague the news.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk, I'll have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And no, I'll make it myself, the AI keeps confusing the marmite with the jelly.",2024-03-14 16:10:40

8ciy5u,I love computer science. I hate my fellow computer science classmates.,"I need to get this off my chest, so please read my entire post instead of downvoting me based on my arrogant title. 

I am a computer science undergrad myself. I've always been fascinated with computers and the Internet ever since I was young. I simply cannot see myself working outside of this area - the incredible space for innovation and the power of exponential technologies is, to me, simply the most exciting thing I can think of. I constantly read about future technologies (shoutout to /r/Futurology) and find it disappointing that not many people share this admiration of mine, especially in this fantastic time period in which we live.

I could spend hours talking about why I chose to study computer science, but I'll leave that for some other time. I need to talk about why I dislike my peers.

I am definitely an introvert, but in my class of initially 50 people* I was probably the most outgoing. I haven't made many friends in college, which truly made me sad in the beginning because I could see myself making more (and better) friends if I were to study pretty much anything else. The only thing that me and 90% of my classmates have in common is that we, for different reasons, chose to study CS. Most of these people are your typical anime-loving gamers, which is of no interest to me. Most of them plan on focusing on game development, which is fine, but they simply don't have an open mind for other ideas an technologies. They play games and want to make games, as if that is even a realistic scenario. 

I don't even need to mention most of them are awkward as hell. This is no reason for me to dislike any of them, but it definitely makes it more difficult for me to bond with them. I have one good friend who shares common interests with me and doesn't act awkward at all. My other friends are nice people and (sometimes) good to hang out with, but they are definitely weird. I almost forgot to mention there is only one girl in my class, which really disappoints me, but I can't say I don't comprehend.

I feel like we need more people in CS who are also interested in the arts and humanities, as I see this as an important trait for understanding the power of the technologies we deal with. As Steve Jobs said it, ""Edwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science, I like that intersection. There’s something magical about that place.""

I think it is important to note that I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and this is based on my point of view, I don't want to generalize CS students. I guess in a more developed country more people would be interested and open to the possibility of studying CS, and therefore providing more diversity among students. And that is exactly what I would like to see.

I hope I haven't offended any readers in any way with my personal thoughts. I'm just very passionate about technology and can't seem to get the same vibe from the people I deal with on a daily basis.

*I would say 50% of the people who started college with me already quit. Every semester some people leave, and we only had 2 (TWO) people graduating in CS last semester. But CS is hard, nothing new here.

🔵 Eigenvectors 🔵

🚀 An eigenvector is a special vector associated with a linear transform. It's special in the sense that after applying the said transform it does not change direction but only gets scaled (multiplied by a scalar value) by the eigenvalue.

🔨 Each eigenvector comes with a corresponding scalar called the eigenvalue. Breaking a matrix M into its eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors is called eigendecomposition.

🔭 The word ""Eigenvector"" comes from ""eigen"" in German where it means ""its own"". It was originally used to study rigid body motion and in the discovery of principal axes. However, nowadays it has found its way into a wide array of applications from my favorite: principal component analysis, differential equations, and problems in physics and chemistry relating to wave transport and molecular orbitals.

🎭 Another one of the classical applications is the Eigenfaces project for facial recognition. Eigenfaces decompose a face as a composition of face templates (basis) called eigenfaces. Imagine N eigenfaces E\_1, ..., E\_n when given a new face F it can be written as a composition of each of these N eigenfaces for example: F = (10% of E\_1 + 55% of E\_2 + 35% of E\_3). Each eigenface would represent a meaningful feature in the high-dimensional space of faces.

Brief summary: We used the Semantic Scholar Corpus and filtered for CS papers. The corpus has data on papers' citation network, so we trained word2vec on those networks. We then used these citation embeddings as a label for the output of Bert, the input being the abstract for that paper.

We are in the middle of developing much more improved versions of our model; more accurate models which contain more papers (we accidentally filtered a bunch of important CS papers in the first version), but we had to submit our initial project for a Tensorflow Hackathon, so we decided to do an initial pre-release, and use the opportunity to perhaps collect some user data in further qualitative analysis of our models. Here is our hackathon submission:

I showed interest in going to an online school for a degree in computer science. This morning at 10:00 DeVry University called me and talk to me for about 45 minutes before they offered me a chance to join their upcoming computer science program for a associates degree. I am 44 years old, I basically was the biggest a****** in high school and did not do any school work didn't do anything though somehow ended up graduating only by myself not with my class (Long story lol). Anyway I love building computers I love learning about computers I love everything about computers I've been doing masonry and construction work since I was out of high school. I cannot take it anymore. I have an 8-year-old daughter and I want to be able to do better for her so I figured this is my next step. I'm already at the end of the process for the FIFCA(something like that) student loan process. Right now I am unemployed and I figured it is the perfect time to start something like this. And then possibly move on and get my bachelor's. I live in a pretty big area in between New York and Philadelphia and thought about making my own computer repair business where I would travel to people's houses and fix any issues they have with them. And also I would build computers if people wanted a certain kind of computer I would build it for them. I've had many people ask me to already. I just really want to get into knowing the technical details and really learning about computers. I'm leaving my options open I'm just going for an associates In computer science with an open end I suppose from what I was told there are three different routes I could take after that to get a bachelor's degree. Just wondering if anyone had opinions? thoughts? I start and just over two weeks and I have never been excited for school in my life and now I cannot wait. And I'm at the age of that and there's no such thing as too much information. Thank you for your time reading this, hoping it was coherent enough for you to get an understanding where I want to go with my life and maybe some perspective from some people who are there or have been there.",2020-04-18 04:16:41

I know how intimidating this topic can be, so I've been intentional about breaking it down and making it as accessible as possible. If you're new to the field or someone who needs a refresher, this is for you.

# Part One: Expression

Cooking a delicious meal, baking a cake, and brewing the perfect cup of coffee all require one key ingredient: a recipe. In the field of computer science, that recipe is an algorithm. Like a recipe, it lays out step-by-step instructions for achieving a specific goal. You can write recipes in many different languages, and you can express algorithms in a variety of ways. Their primary methods of expression include flow charts, pseudocode, natural language, and programming language. Read on for a brief, memorable introduction to each one. 

>***algorithm*** *(n.) — a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.* 

Imagine you are a busy executive with rules to determine whether you are available for a meeting. There are two parameters at the heart of your rule system: (1) the day of the week and (2) the distance. Given this information, can you generate an algorithm to filter potential meetings? Absolutely.

[availability algorithm expressed as a flow chart](https://preview.redd.it/soaxpqturmga1.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb4524a5299d34bd8267ffda49c6c96cf90f1b87)

This algorithm ultimately assigns a value of *true* or *false* to the Boolean variable “available” based on your rules. It can help you or your assistant make a decision quickly and easily. If the value of “available” is *true* at the end, you will accept the meeting. Otherwise, you will decline. 

**Flow charts** provide a visual representation of the algorithm’s logic and flow. Creating them forces you to think carefully about sequencing and selection. *Which arrow goes to what node? Are there missing arrows?* These are invaluable questions that can arise when translating an algorithm into a flow chart, and answering them can lead you to identify potential errors.

Now, let’s move on to a similar algorithm expressed in **pseudocode**:

[availability algorithm in pseudocode](https://preview.redd.it/l0tma0f1smga1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c7d29a3554ba24cd9ed5ba9139b4e372c699287)

This algorithm is slightly different, but it accomplishes the same objective by assigning a value of *true* or *false* to the Boolean variable “available” based on your rules. Despite its minor differences, it is just as effective as the algorithm depicted by the flow chart.

Pseudocode acts as a bridge between natural language and programming language. It allows you to express an algorithm in a way that most people can understand and lets you lay out the algorithm’s logic and flow without worrying about the specific syntax of a programming language — which makes it easier to test and debug an algorithm before implementing it.

Can we also express this date-availability algorithm in **natural language**? Of course.

1. Create a Boolean variable “available” and set it to false.
2. Check if the day of the week is a weekday. If it is not, end the algorithm.
3. Check if the distance is greater than or equal to 20 miles. If it is, end the algorithm.
4. If steps 2 and 3 are passed, set the Boolean variable “available” to true.
5. End the algorithm.

Using natural language to express an algorithm makes it relatively easy for people to understand. This advantage is significant because it makes the algorithm easier to share with others, regardless of their technical background.

How about **programming language**? Definitely.

[availability algorithm in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/iqwjmssasmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=df5810616c1551688d1b89ba4088a73473fe9f85)

Expressing algorithms in a programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, Rust, etc.) allows a computer to execute them directly. There is no need for any interpretation or translation. It also lets you take advantage of the tools and constructs provided by your favorite language. Another advantage is that it allows for automation and performance optimization, which is particularly useful if the algorithm has to be executed frequently or on large data sets.

# Part Two: Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration

You’ve learned the basics of algorithms and their modes of expression, but have you ever wondered how they make decisions and control the flow of a program? The answer is **sequencing**, **selection**, and **iteration**. In part two, we’ll delve into how these fundamental concepts shape the functionality of algorithms, making them adaptable, efficient, and powerful tools for solving problems. 

**Sequencing** refers to the order in which you execute instructions. An algorithm is a step-by-step process, and it must take each one in the proper order to achieve its goal.

https://preview.redd.it/ejylwfa2tmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8e88afa8f4ecfa6232e1b8d2909a0843fb18e0

**Selection** refers to the ability to make decisions based on certain conditions. An algorithm may need to choose between different options based on a given input.

https://preview.redd.it/t1ced5j4tmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f8535992ab79d5e81630b2a7160b6e9ba817178

**Iteration** refers to the process of repeating a set of instructions. It is a part of many algorithms, especially those that involve processing large amounts of data or repeating a task until a condition is met.

https://preview.redd.it/a9hlp2p6tmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e524ddd7da20fe0e2b8c109ca51d118f35772aa

**An Example of Sequencing**

This algorithm designed to calculate the area of a rectangle offers a clear example of **sequencing**.

[calculating the area of a rectangle in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/yxowixhmtmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=742c7a7e11d5686f1388e5264e9f025800e49f75)

Note the importance of order (a.k.a., “sequence”) in this algorithm. First, it assigns a value of 3 to the variable *width* and 11 to the variable *height*. Next, it calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying *width* and *height*. Finally, it prints the result to the console. If you re-arranged these steps, you could stop this algorithm from producing the expected result.

Sequencing is vital because algorithms must execute their steps in the proper order. Otherwise, they will not work correctly. Remember, computers can only do what they are programmed to do. So if you program a set of steps in the wrong sequence, a computer will execute them in that sequence — even if the results are disastrous.

**An Example of Selection**

An if-else statement to determine whether a number is positive or negative is an example of **selection**.

[a simple selection algorithm in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/yrcuncfutmga1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f361b3d72738e1903bc14d87f1d9f62e43a2d)

In this example, the algorithm uses an if-else statement to make a decision based on the value of the variable, *number*. If it is greater than or equal to zero, the algorithm executes the first block of code and prints “the number is positive” to the console. If it is less than zero, the algorithm executes the second block of code and prints “the number is negative” to the console.

Selection is important because it allows the algorithm to make decisions based on conditions, which makes it more flexible and able to handle a wide range of problems, exceptions, and errors.

**An Example of Iteration**

This algorithm designed to print the numbers 1–10 to the console is a perfect example of **iteration**.

[printing a sequence of numbers in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/gjzhz4j0umga1.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf9f526632f1bd391d279f558b5a8a050e6d119a)

In this example, a for-loop repeatedly executes a command that prints the value of the variable *i* to the console. Before it does, it checks a condition \[\[ ***i*** **<= 10** \]\], and then executes its one command if and only if that condition evaluates to true. As soon as it evaluates to false, the loop will exit, and this simple program will finish running.

Iteration matters. It matters because it allows an algorithm to repeat a set of instructions multiple times, which is helpful if you are processing large amounts of data, repeating a task, or generating a sequence of numbers.

# Part Three: Efficiency && Big-O Time Complexity

Now that you’re familiar with sequencing, selection, and iteration, it’s time to take your understanding of algorithms to the next level by exploring the idea that **not all algorithms are created equal**. Some complete their task in a matter of microseconds, while others seem to drag on forever. In part three, you’ll learn about Big-O notation and the difference between reasonable and unreasonable runtime. You’ll also take your first steps towards assessing relative efficiency with an example: linear search versus binary search. This knowledge will lead you to write more efficient algorithms that will set you apart as a developer.

>***Big-O Notation*** *(n.) a formal expression of an algorithm’s complexity in relation to the growth of the input size. It is used to rank algorithms based on their performance with large inputs.*

**Reasonable vs. Unreasonable Runtime**

Runtime is the execution time of an algorithm. In other words, the amount of time it takes to complete its intended task. We can break it into two distinct performance classes.

1. **Reasonable** (a.k.a., “polynomial”) time describes **any runtime that does not increase faster than n\^k**. Examples include: constant time (*n\^0*), logarithmic time (log n), linear time (n), and quadratic time (n\^2)
2. **Unreasonable** (a.k.a., “superpolynomial”) time describes **any runtime that increases faster than n\^k**. Examples include: exponential time (2\^n) and factorial time (n!)

The ability to scale effectively with the size of a given input determines this distinction between *reasonable* and *unreasonable*. Algorithms with *reasonable* runtime have predictable, limited growth in execution time as input size increases. On the other hand, algorithms with *unreasonable* runtime have exponential or even faster growth in execution time as input size increases. It’s crucial to understand the complexities of the algorithm(s) that you’re working with and to strive for reasonable runtime whenever possible so that your programs perform well and scale effectively.

Now, let’s take a closer look at how some of the most common Big-O runtimes compare in terms of their scaling behavior.

https://preview.redd.it/jetr6bvjumga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=45a895cf5a7b2bede0b101412762a6df234347ce

This chart goes beyond *reasonable* and *unreasonable*. It analyzes seven different runtimes and rates them from “horrible” to “excellent”. Note that quadratic time — **O(n²)** — is “horrible” despite its *reasonable* status in traditional computer science circles. This example indicates that there are levels to time complexity analysis and that even if your algorithm is *reasonable*, there may still be room for improvement and optimization.

**Linear vs. Binary Search**

[a linear search algorithm in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/y85mgvmpumga1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed36f259145f59480f575153ceea175336b984be)

Linear search algorithms run in linear Big-O time: **O(n)**. Their execution time is directly proportional to the size of the data set they’re searching.

Imagine you have a list of 100 numbers and a linear search algorithm to help you find the one you want. Unfortunately, it’s at the end of the list. So if it takes one millisecond for your algorithm to evaluate a number and determine whether it’s the one you want, you will have to wait 100ms. If you think about it, 100ms is only 1/10 of a second. So your algorithm is fast. Right? Wrong.

Replace your 100-number data set with 1,000,000 numbers. Now how long will you have to wait? Worst-case 1,000,000ms, which is more than 16 minutes. Now we have a problem. The good news is that we also have a solution in binary search.

[a binary search algorithm in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/yb5stpzuumga1.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=decfc6fa9a8b63783486465b52c547e5317cfbed)

Binary search algorithms run in logarithmic Big-O time: **O(log n)**, which is exceptionally fast. The catch is that they only work on sorted lists. If you read the code carefully, you’ll see that they work by establishing (*and recursively updating*) a low-index and a high-index in a given array. They find the element halfway between those indices and check to see if it matches the target. If it does, they return the index position of the target. Otherwise, they update the appropriate index and repeat the process.

This method is remarkably similar to searching for the word *iteration* in a physical dictionary with 960 pages. You would first open it to one of the middle pages and evaluate the words. If they follow *iteration* alphabetically (i.e., they all start with the letter “m”), you know that your target word is in the first half of the dictionary. So, instead of searching through 960 pages, you are only dealing with 480. Remarkable! Now, repeat this process until you find the word *iteration*. This method is a brilliant example of logarithmic time complexity because the amount of time it takes to find the word increases logarithmically with the number of pages in your dictionary.

[ This graph depicts the worst-case execution time of linear and binary search algorithms, assuming \(arbitrarily\) that it takes 1ms to evaluate each element.](https://preview.redd.it/54tgt660vmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=68dc7ca52d8aad27cc784285ead43786f9b2b241)

If you look closely at the graph, it’s clear that the binary search algorithm is significantly more efficient — even when dealing with a data set that only contains 100 elements. But what if we were dealing with a data set of 1,000,000 elements? Remember that (worst-case) a linear algorithm takes \~16 minutes to find its target. On the other hand, a binary search algorithm will only take 19.93 milliseconds. That’s an extraordinary difference! Let’s run one final scenario with 1,000,000,000 (one billion) elements. Working with this massive data set, a linear search algorithm would take more than 11 days to find its target, but a binary search algorithm would only take \~29.90 milliseconds. Unbelievable. This extreme disparity is why it’s so important to write efficient algorithms.

jsj2e4,I'm feeling overwhelmed,"Hello everyone, first post here.

I need to get something out of my chest, I hope this sub allows that...

I have been a CS student for 4 years now (one subject left to get my diploma) and I consider myself an average student. I study very, very hard, I give my all to this course to the point that my social life has become pretty much non existent, yet the results are....*average*.

During this four years I feel like if I get good at a certain topic (by studying for a test or doing a particular project) all the other stuff I learned before fades away, I either forget them completly or they revert to a very basic state (Sorry if this doesn't make any sense but I'm trying my best to explain). For example, lets say that I would refresh my memory on a topic that I learned two years ago, lets say *Python*, after a few weeks I would be very confident with the language and at the same time my knowledge on stuff like Java, C, C++, Linux fundamentals, etc, would revert to a primitive state, and if I try to do the same with one of those forgoten concepts, the cicle will repeat...

I honestly feel that if this continues, the course (even completed) would be for nothing. Which company would hire someone like me?...",2020-11-11 23:22:31

I'll be starting my MSc Computer Science degree in September, and wanted to put together a list of resources that cover the content I have learnt during my BSc. Furthermore, I didn't take any web dev electives, so this lockdown I've been taking the opportunity to teach myself, and this website is kind of a showcase for that too (*please rate my design?*)

* Programming
* Maths for CS
* Algorithms & Data Structures
* Systems & Databases
* Architecture
* Internet & Networking
* Elective Modules

For some modules, I've included a (not exhaustive) **Key Topics Checklist** or a **Starter Projects** infobox, as I know complete beginners can be a bit overwhelmed when first starting out.

I've also included a **Recommended Book** for certain modules -- full disclaimer -- with clear Amazon affiliates links, but they're reasonably priced and I personally recommend them as good general reference guides!

&#x200B;

\#Rule 1.

\*You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time.

Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and

put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.\*

&#x200B;

\#Rule 2.

\*Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even

then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.\*

&#x200B;

\#Rule 3.

\*Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is

usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know

that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n

does get big, use Rule 2 first.)\*

&#x200B;

\#Rule 4.

\*Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and

they're much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as

well as simple data structures.\*

&#x200B;

\#Rule 5.

\*Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data

structures and organized things well, the algorithms will

almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not

algorithms, are central to programming.\*

&#x200B;

\*Pike's rules 1 and 2 restate Tony Hoare's famous maxim

""Premature optimization is the root of all evil."" Ken

Thompson rephrased Pike's rules 3 and 4 as ""When in doubt,

use brute force."". Rules 3 and 4 are instances of the

design philosophy KISS. Rule 5 was previously stated by

Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month. Rule 5 is often

shortened to ""write stupid code that uses smart objects"".\*",2021-12-28 03:54:42

I’m all honesty I wouldn’t consider my math to be full on calculus since it’s pre calculus and is simply preparing me for the real thing. I’ve never struggled so hard at a subject in my life. When I look at it, it’s like a completely different language; I understand with time that it’ll get better but does anyone have any words on how impactful math was to their education or computer science career. I guess I need a little inspiration and actual input to those who have made it. Also if anybody has any advice on how I could learn pre calculus and calculus on a college level by my self since the teaching style my professor has doesn’t match with my learning style, that’ll also be appreciated.

Thanks for the advice and time.

These things are likely a luxury of the era that we live in


Also, this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox

> In economics, the Jevons paradox (/ˈdʒɛvənz/; sometimes Jevons effect) occurs when technological progress or government policy increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the falling cost of use increases its demand, negating the efficiency gains.[1] The Jevons' effect is perhaps the most widely known pitfall in environmental economics.[2] However, governments and environmentalists[needs update] generally assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the possibility of the effect arising.[3]

In addition to my original point, I think the current state of technology is allowing deeply inefficient code to ship. I wonder if the inefficiency is encouraged by use of certain technologies and frameworks and if they are ""long for this world?""

I'm curious as to what your thoughts are about this and how this would play out over time. Personally I can see low level languages becoming popular again but with heavy abstractions over it, something like a gui app that makes programming very easy but all the real, highly optimized work is done by an expert system (or an 'AI' if you wanna call it that)",2022-08-03 13:27:57

Software development - it is just using high level frameworks like react or flutter to make apps or express to make a backend.

  
Software engineering - is building solutions to complex problems. Like building react or building a os or kernel something like that.

And 

Computer science - is the science behind working of stuff like the compilers, like how computers work. This would include hardware and software both.

du1vgf,Code is magic,"I just had a wonderful realization and I thought I might share. To preface this, I always wanted to go to Hogwarts as a kid and learn magic. I became somewhat disenfranchised with the world as I grew older, but I have recently begun to rekindle a sense of wonder and excitement for the world.

A big part of that has been learning to code. I was thinking about this the other day, and I realized that I have essentially been learning magic by any standard throughout history, and for some reason I take that for granted!

Through a high-level language, we manipulate electrons in order to create symbolic information patterns that can accomplish real tasks - to anyone from any other time in history, if they could see us they would think we were literally witches and wizards.

At Hogwarts the students learn to predict the rough future through magic. I can do the same with data analysis, game theory, and machine learning networks. They can see things from the other side of the world - I just finished coding a security cam for my dorm. They can imbue non-living matter with sentience - robotics. They can manipulate life - bioinformatics - if I had access to the right tools I could literally breed glowing animals. Artificial intelligence adds an even cooler aspect to this given we might soon be able to create sentience from non-sentient matter! Even the bad powers, killing people, controlling people etc are real - consumer programming, psychometric targeting through the internet, drone strikes, malicious hacking, etc.

By extension, everything we are exploring in modern science is really magic. We don't really know how this stuff works or why it works - if you look at the physical constants of the universe they seem somewhat arbitrary. While we do have a good sense of the relational properties between things in reality, we don't know why they are what they are - like electrons! We know the rules that dictate their interaction with other things in reality, but we don't know why they exist the way they do, where they came from, or for that matter where any of this really came from! Somehow through all these layers of abstraction, from basic properties of atoms and forces, to high-level symbolic computation, we manage to actually do stuff, and that stuff is no less absolutely amazing! I don't think it's hyperbole to say that we're all doing real magic.",2019-11-09 21:17:03
aucokn,An infuriating story I would like to share,"I (f,18) am a senior in high school hoping to pursue a career in CS.

About two weeks ago, there was a substitute in for my Calculus teacher. He began talking to me about college and what I wanted to study. I said I was very interested in CS and programming. 

He says to me, “CS is a very difficult major. I don’t know many females who make it through all four years.”

I was dumbfounded. I did not say another word, but I wish I would have. How could you say that to an aspiring student? I would love to have another chance to chew this guy out. 

I knew I wanted to be a CS major since freshman year, and I’m not going to let some misogynistic loser tell me that I don’t have a good chance succeeding in my dream because of my gender. 


For some more context, this guy graduated with a mechanical engineering degree. I don’t know how he has any room to talk about the difficulty of CS.

The flaws in each language, library, technology, environment. What is better, C++ or C#? Unity or Unreal? Custom engine? In which language? Which libraries? All custom code? Which platforms? Ruby or python? javascript or php? or typescript? or wasm?

Just when making a choice on the stack to use, it is like a huge tree branching out indefinitely with issues and compromises.

The more optimistic programmers will say, just choose the right tool for the job! Every things has its place. But it is not that simple. What if you will need something different in the future? Do you rewrite all the code? Or do you just accept that you can't have it?

In my experiments and the search for universal language/environment to do different things, I have realized that it does not really exists. But the further realization is to why it doesn't exist. And that is due to how all the technology that exists is tied together. Different ideological reasonings and believes to what is right, sometimes cult-lite following of language of a technology, is all that I did not realize WHY it matters and WHAT are the consequences of it all.

A bit of a ramble, I love programming, but my little utopia has been damaged. Didn't realize what I will have to deal with and no one really talks to you or prepares you for it. You only hear ""this is the right way"" again and again from people with opposite views, thinking that there is the right way somewhere, you just have to find it. But there isn't.

I have just stumbled upon this, and it is what inspired me to write this post. Because with everything I already knew, I still didn't know it goes THAT deep:[https://gankra.github.io/blah/c-isnt-a-language/](https://gankra.github.io/blah/c-isnt-a-language/)",2022-03-27 12:34:21

1bdxqmg,Is a memory address an actual physical location in RAM?,"Not sure if this is a silly question but I guess it will help me understand more intuitively how memory works… 

Let’s say I have a variable stored to some memory address.  And I want to alter the value at that address.  Would it be theoretically possible to actual look at my physical RAM chip and locate where this data actually is? For instance, if I have “64k” of RAM, there are 65,536 bytes,  would the first byte be physically located at a an actual location “1” on the hardware chip or some general region? And then the last byte would be at the end of the chip or something…Or is this a more dynamic process and the bytes are reassigned every time memory is allocated?  

If this is the case, is it also theoretically possible to alter it via some other means (example maybe I can access my RAM physically with another device even outside the OS and write some data to it or some kind of malicious instruction) rather than having my program access the memory address and alter the value? Or does the OS allocate a chunk of memory and then assign each byte “virtually” in some sense, thus the address doesn’t actually truly exist and only exists within an abstraction layer? 

Thanks guys for all the responses !",2024-03-13 17:46:34

nj138v,"ELI5 if there is any technical barrier preventing Microsoft, who owns GitHub, from looking at the codebase of a potential competitor/acquisition target, if the latter uses GitHub for hosting their entire codebase?","ELI5 = Explain Like I am 5 (years old). Sorry if I am asking this question in the wrong sub, but this sub felt like the one best poised to answer it.

This question is about private repos only, not public ones.

My background: I know basics of programming, but have never worked with other programmers to use GitHub or any other kind of version control with multiple people. You can say that I am a casual programmer.

Suppose Microsoft wants to acquire company A, who host their codebase in GitHub. What is preventing them from looking at the codebase of company A? If the acquisition target refuses to be acquired, can Microsoft simply look at the backend code of the company, copy crucial portions of it and slap a similar UI to it while adding a few more features? If they do so, will it ever be possible to verify for company A to even be aware that their codebase has been peeked at or more? Or is it technically impossible for Microsoft to look at it (due to encryption, etc)? 

My question is generic. As in, I am not just talking specifically about GitHub, but online Git websites including Gitbucket, SourceForge, Bitbucket, etc.

Also on a related topic, how do companies like Apple, Google and others use version control? Can their employees look at the entire codebase, to be able to find inefficiencies and improve it when they can? If so, what is preventing a rogue employee from stealing it all? Or it is compartmentalized with limited visibility to only the people working on it? I would love to understand what tools they use and how they do it. If it is a lot, then links to articles/videos would be appreciated a lot.

hzkbhc,How do programmers find the right tool for the job with so many tools out there?,"To be more specific, the tool in this case does not reference a language but rather built-in methods, third-party libraries, or modules.

I try to do some research and extensive Googling before I start a writing a program but I find nothing relevant. However, an accidentally misclick or a random tutorial video shows me some miracle module that I missed that would've made my code (and my life) so much easier, but I'm already too deep in the program to do anything without completely changing the algorithm. It can be pretty frustrating.

For example, I wrote a bunch of complicated classes to try to store values for a statistics program, turns out there was a library called derby that I could've used instead. A script I created with a complicated algorithm to extract numerical data from files using certain keywords became obselete because I forgot regex existed. Hell, I just learned what ternary operators and it's made my life so much easier for the current script I'm writing now.

How do other programmers find what they need? I am I missing something? Or do I just need to suck it up and read through the official documentation and/or module indexes?

gqmllx,How to talk to my professor about my unintentional code plagiarism?,"I’m a college student and I just finished the semester. In my CS class, we had a final project, which my professor has contacted me about regarding its similarity to a previous student’s submission from a previous year. The truth is, during spring break I researched this project in order to prepare and know what to expect, and I did end up finding the code that my professor is talking about. At the time, I thought it would be a helpful example of the questions I might be asked to answer later on. When the final project was released, I started working on it and only used the resources provided by the course (virtual office hours, piazza, etc), and didn’t think much of it. But I now realize that the code I had seen earlier on had influenced me to an unacceptable degree, as the design approaches are similar and some parts are nearly identical.

I feel that I did not have the intention of cheating and the shift of the class to online led me to make misjudgements in using online resources. I looked back at my professor’s syllabus and it states that plagiarizing code has caused students to have to withdraw from the college in previous years. I’m terrified about this, and am devastated that my professor might fail me (at my college, a failing grade cannot be made up) and that this will be on my record in some way.

q50xlp,I don't get password hashing and salts.,"Ok, so I understand that storing passwords in plaintext is bad, and encrypting passwords just means that now we have to keep a secret safe, and that isn't ideal either.

So the answer is to hash password values to some fixed-length value using a hashing algorithm. 

A frequently cited problem with just hashing a password is that a hacker could use common passwords and employ the same hashing algorithm and essentially dictionary attack a resource. 

But something I don't understand is this: if hashing algorithms are deterministic, that is, given the same input they always produce the same output, and the algorithms themselves are known, then couldn't a hacker essentially reverse the steps taken to hash values and produce the original input? Why is the rainbow attack method even necessary?

That's my first question.

I also know that salting hashes introduces randomness into the hashed values. I get how this means that an attacker can't carry out a rainbow attack using common hashes to guess passwords - but then how the heck is the password later verified? If I've randomized the hashed password, how can I check it against credentials I get from the user which will also be salted randomly and hashed?",2021-10-10 04:17:38

ngwqy6,An interesting interview problem,"I recently interviewed at an organisation.
The technical round was a normal DSA round except for one problem I couldn't figure out ( and I still haven't ).

Statement: 
Suppose you're a software engineer at Spotify and you want to implement the music shuffle feature.
Given a list of song ids in an array of size n, randomly select a song and play it, each song must be played once only.

Eg-> array = [4,3,8,98,7] 
All elements are distinct

Imp: Each song must be played exactly ONCE.

My solution : maintain a frequency array (or a map data structure, I was coding in c++) and repeatedly generate a random number between 0 and n - 1 and check in the frequency array whether this has been played previously or not. 
If it has been played, generate random numbers until you find a song that hasn't been played.

Interviewer countered me on this by giving the following situation:
What if there are 1 million songs and all of them have been played once already EXCEPT one.
The probability of getting that number through the randomised approach is 10^(-6). 

This is where I got stuck and couldn't move forward.

He also suggested that the optimal solution does not use any auxiliary memory.

I'd really appreciate your help on this problem.",2021-05-20 10:37:04

> happening, existing, or arising at precisely the same time

However, in the context of programming, synchronous programming usually mean that instruction are executed one at a time(so not happening at the same time). 

Conversely, the word ""asynchronous"" in English, according to Merriam Webster, means:
>  not simultaneous or concurrent in time 

Again, in the context of programming, asynchronous usually means that instructions are executed in parallel, which is the opposite of what the word means in English.. 

My burning question is, why is this the case? I'm I just bad at English or do you guys find this weird too? Thank you.

je518j,"Motion to Make a Pinned Megathread for ""I'm new to X, where should I start?"" Posts, and a Rules Update.","Obligatory notice that I'm writing on mobile.

I get that everyone has to start their journey somewhere, but the number of posts in this subreddit of the form ""I'm new to [insert technology], where should I start?"", or ""I'm just learning programming, but I feel like I suck / feel lost / don't know how to practice / etc."" drown out all other conversation in this sub. 

That is on top of the ""I've just finished my freshmen year of college and read a paper on X. Has anyone thought of using X for Y?"" (the answer is always yes) or the even worse ""I don't know much about computer science, but can't we use [obvious technology] for [obvious application]?""

Which are all in addition to the generic ""how do you think [generic technology]/ [computer science]/[machine learning] is going to change [obvious field of application]?"" 

My issue with these posts, and the issue which I am certain drives away other experienced computer scientists or people willing to contribute to productive conversations, is that all of the above posts are very low effort, very high volume, and require a disproportionate amount of time to answer well (the computer science field is the study and defeat/exploitation of complexity, and with that comes complex answers).

Most of these posts could be answered by reading through this subreddit, reading stackoverflow posts, or even quora answers or the litany of other resources unlocked by a single google search.  I'm not writing this with a hard heart (mentoring is one of the most rewarding parts of my life), but there is a difference between mentoring and being taken advantage of by those unwilling to put in minimal effort.

It is admirable to help newcomers to the field, but we should, at the very least, require directed questions, and optimize our resources (that's our profession!) by not answering the same posts ad infinum.

I motion to make a pinned megathread on ""I'm new to programming/computer science, where should I start?"" posts, and ""I feel so lost and l struggle with programming, what should I do?"" posts, and disallow these posts in main.

I also motion to add to the subreddit rules that posts must be directed and exhibit reasoning and research. If someone wants to know how computer science is going to change healthcare they can read a buzzfeed article. If they want to discuss how a specific algorithm with a specific use case, we can have a conversation. Perhaps a rule along the lines of ""Posts must be directed and demonstrate research and reasoning. Vague or general posts are not allowed"". Then we can at least report the came-to-r/computerscience-after-reading-two-buzzfeed-articles-and-a-towardsdatascience-blog crowd.

Five days ago the mods updated the rules to exclude job advice, and this is a good step in the right direction for reviving the conversations in this subreddit, but I think we need to go further to make this a place where actual computer scientists want to spend their time.

n6oenk,Is Cybersecurity Really in Demand?," I (mid 20s F) am about to graduate with my master's in cybersecurity, and I start a great job in this field next month. That being said, I am ""one of the lucky ones"" in a graduating class of \~15. Nearly all of my peers are employed (software engineers, network analysts, etc.), however just 1-2 of us have been able to find work specifically in cybersecurity.

I constantly hear the statistics about unfilled jobs, growth in demand, increasing cyberattacks, and so on. When I tell people what my major is, they invariably say that cybersecurity is in demand. Even my current and previous employers have talked about desperately needing cybersecurity people.

Why is it that cybersecurity seems to be in demand, yet so difficult to get a job in? I know plenty of smart people who work in technology-related fields, but have yet to break into cybersecurity. What gives?",2021-05-07 02:39:57
hwqllu,How do bits turn into something meaningful enough for assembly language to make use of?,"I have been working in IT for half a year now and understand general computer hardware but understand little of the low level OS side of things. More specifically assembly/machine language and mid level languages like C.

Some questions I have are:

1.How does assembly language make sense of bits of data? I understand that you have 32 bits and 64 bits based off registers that contain either a 0 or 1. These calculations are done extremely quickly by the processor(3 GHz) where multi-threading/hyperthreading/cores come into play. But what the heck do these calculation mean to the assembly language? Is it as something as computer calculating in a certain pattern = function

Example) If the Calculations of these 64 bits = 100, 100, 200 then perform this OS task. If the Calculations = 200, 200, 100 do this other OS task?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

2. These calculations/bits of data are also being temporarily stored on RAM? More applications/data processed = more that has to be temporarily stored on the RAM, right?

3. Is POST test a low level/machine language programmed onto motherboard?

4. Is there a difference between machine and assembly language?

5. Chicken or Egg? Assembly language requires bits (electricity) coming through to do work? How are bits created? Where are they coming from? Electricity, right? How does the processor/motherboard/psu know how to turn electricity into these bits of data (0's or 1's)? Using circuits/transistors on the motherboard or code on the motherboard/processor cache?

Maybe I just need to go to college for 4 years to learn computer science and electrical engineering lol

**I'm looking for youtube explainer videos, websites, and books, even college level textbooks for stuff like CS 101 Intro to Computers or CS 300 Assembly/Machine Language, that I can read/watch to learn more about. I understand it probably takes a lot more than a reddit post to fully explain. Just looking for someone to point me in the right direction on where to go to learn more about these topics.** ",2020-07-23 23:25:59

It's based on the Twitter API and shows the 100 most recent tweets around you. Irrespective of who is tweeting and whether they are your friends or not it drops the last 100 tweets depending on your location on a map. I even posted on the r/androidapps subreddit for feedback and promotion and got some great responses. [Here's the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/eytmjo/dev_i_made_an_android_app_that_shows_the_most/)

Now the scary part:

The traction died down after a couple of months. I expected it to honestly, as it was just a hobby project for me. And I wanted something nice on my Resume to get a job. And I did. But in September 2020, I started getting like a couple of downloads a day at least, from Russia. A couple of downloads turned into 4 the next month and now I am getting 5-7 downloads at least every day, all from Russia. Yesterday something ticked off and I got 33 downloads in a day. Today, I got 50 downloads. All from Google Play Search in Russia.

I tried looking everywhere but I can't find the source of it. No post on Russian forums or youtube videos seems to exist where any sort of promotion might have occurred for my app. I am not promoting the app anywhere. No social media, no mass marketing, nothing.

I am just concerned that people might be misusing it? How? I don't know. The idea in itself poses challenges to people's privacy and I am aware of it. Because people don't need to download my app to appear on it. They just need to use their regular Twitter and their retweet/post will just pop up on my app, being used by someone in their immediate vicinity. And this whole Russian downloads thing seems fishy to me somehow. Maybe a bad feeling.

Should I be worried? Thinking of shutting down the app.

13gc8jm,A Visual Introduction to the basic concepts of Graph Theory.,"Hello there!

Today we will be diving into one of the most common ways of representing data and modeling problems (and solutions) in Computer Science. We will be talking about **Graphs**.

This will be the first of a series of posts introducing graph theory in a very visual way.

It will consist of some basic definitions of graph theory that will lay the basis for us to be able to explore more complex topics in future posts. The idea is to present the definitions along with visual representations, to help in the process of learning new concepts.

**This is a summary version of the weekly edition of the Algorithmically Speaking newsletter. You can read the full article here:**

[Algorithmically Speaking - #3: Nodes, Edges, and Connectivity](https://albexl.substack.com/p/introduction-to-graph-theory)

Let’s begin!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Nodes, Edges, and Paths

A **graph** consists of **nodes** and **edges**. We could see the nodes as the fundamental entities of graphs, and edges represent the relationships between nodes.

One good thing about graphs is that, even if they represent an abstract mathematical definition, we can visually display them using the most simple drawings of circles and lines.

Here’s a hand-drawn image of a graph with 5 nodes and 7 edges that we will we use to help us understand some basic definitions:

https://preview.redd.it/0a1y8llz8kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=e13eb20bb4d163185d0b754ce8a619c2c6abd44a

A **path** leads from node **a** to node **b** through the edges of the graph. The length of a path is the number of edges in it.

The highlighted (red) path between the two green nodes in the following image is of length 3:

https://preview.redd.it/a36yrzy09kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc22c26073857a8d5a773e081e7929af429c67f3

>***Note****: The highlighted path is just one of the possible paths between the two green nodes. Try to identify every possible path between them.*

A path is a **cycle** if the first and last node is the same. On the other hand, a path is called **simple** if each node appears at most once in the path.

The highlighted path in the previous image corresponds to a simple path, while the one in the following image is considered a cycle:

https://preview.redd.it/hpnn0bz39kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=c981d45b507ec9cddf18e3dbd1f445da167b9ff3

## Connectivity

A graph is **connected** if there is a path between any two nodes. For example, our initial graph is connected:

https://preview.redd.it/aldp6s2o9kza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=315fd6168db76955c5f7469e63246228dd829857

>***Try it yourself****: take any pair of nodes in the previous graph and check that, indeed, there is a path between them.*

On the other hand, the following graph is **not connected** because there is no path between the highlighted nodes:

https://preview.redd.it/u1wp2s2lakza1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=7684d57bebc41f14bfaf7b48cb67bb0284610563

In fact, there is no path between any node located in the right-bottom corner and any node located in the left-top corner.

The sets of connected nodes in a graph are called **connected components**. Here are the connected components (nodes with the same color) of the previous graph:

https://preview.redd.it/h049y5nnakza1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0495b2e55586068ba40a158dcd11fcbf9ccbd8

We can clearly see that this graph has two connected components.

A **tree** is a connected graph that consists of **n** nodes and **n−1** edges. There is a unique path between any two nodes of a tree. You can also think of a tree as a connected graph that doesn’t contain any cycles.

The following graph is a tree:

https://preview.redd.it/b29o042rakza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=2158bdac8f4013ed1f327e7a8129dc111dae5171

>***Try it yourself****: take any pair of nodes in the previous graph and check that, indeed, there is a* ***unique*** *path between them.*

## Direction and Weights

A graph is **directed** if the edges can be traversed in one direction only. For example, the following graph is directed:

https://preview.redd.it/qduyg4btakza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bbd5eecbd306c9b5e207feab5fea676ed1bfc9c

Notice how in the following image there is a path (more than one actually) between the green node and the blue node, but the opposite is not true. You cannot find any path starting in the blue node and ending in the green one:

https://preview.redd.it/x04bpvlkckza1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5a8f97b1f4d4e3610ce17aa6433008f7eeb7dd6

As we can see, the fact the graph is directed affects the concept of connectivity, which is called **strong connectivity** when we are referring to directed graphs. We will learn more about this in future posts.

In a **weighted** graph, each edge is assigned a **weight**. The weights are often interpreted as edge lengths.

The following graph is weighted:

The length of a path in a weighted graph is the **sum** of the edge weights on the path. For example, in the following graph, the length of the highlighted path between the green nodes is 13 (8 + 5):

hdocy8,Feel like I'm not doing enough.,"I am currently a 3rd year CS engineering student. I am passionate about what im learning. I enjoy most of the subjects taught in college.

I feel like I'm not doing enough.

Should I build my profile according to what the industry is expecting or by working on things I like?

Should I focus solely on the basics like DS, ALGO, OS, DBMS etc or upscale to the current trends like DATA SCIENCE, AI, ML, UI/UX?

All the material, courses on online platforms for the current trends seems like a shortcut to get to these subjects. 

Until now I have worked on one DBMS project, one DATA MINING project, studied a little bit of statistical learning, sometimes work on DS, ALGO problem solving questions. But I feel like I am not concrete on anything. I haven't done any internships either. 

Since I like most subjects I don't know how to just pick one and build the relevant skills in that?

At the moment I don't think I have any ""skills"", I just know a little bit of most things.

I am scared that I won't survive in this field. I am so confused. I have no idea if what I'm doing is right or enough.

Any advice/tips to figure this out would be appreciated. Please help.",2020-06-22 08:26:58

b7coyy,I Built A Site To Provide Better Explanations To Coding Interview Problems (X-Post r/learnprogramming),"Hi all,

Late last year, I did a round of interviews with big tech companies. During preparation, I realized that there were tons of sites with whiteboarding interview questions, but not a lot of well-explained ones. I decided to build [https://algodaily.com](https://algodaily.com/), intended to be the easiest place on the internet to prepare for technical interviews.

Every challenge is walked through step by step, and includes quizzes that help with recall. Every challenge is written in JS, which is IMO the best language for new programmers since it can easily be run and tested in the browser. I also recently wrote [this article about technical interview prep](https://www.algodaily.com/lessons/how-to-prepare-for-a-technical-interview) and [this article about how to approach technical interviews](https://www.algodaily.com/lessons/the-definitive-guide-to-approaching-tough-coding-interview-problems-when-blanking-out-or-stuck).

I encourage you guys to check out the site and leave feedback. You're able to view 5 challenges before it prompts you to either accept ads or go premium. It would be greatly appreciated as I try to build a better resource for web developers who want to level up!",2019-03-30 15:50:03
b3w1sp,How to get a software engineering internship in 2019,"So you want a coveted internship? This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.

I’m have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.

Whether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.

If you prefer video format, here’s a video I made covering these topics:

YouTube channel: Matt Upham

Video: How to get a software engineering internship in 2019

The first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.

The second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \[Insert college here\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.

The best people in your network to reach out to are:

\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at

\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company

\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company

\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - “friends of friends who worked at \[X company\]

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don’t send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples’ work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you’ll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:

\~\~\~

Hi \[person’s name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and I’m an  \[type of engineer\]  in \[location\].

I’m reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]?

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after they’ve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don’t respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.

If you’ve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them “How can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?”, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you’d be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn’t absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you’ve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won’t make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you’ve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you’re ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There’s a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name
2. Position Name
3. Contact Name
4. Contact Email
5. Contact LinkedIn
6. Date of Last Contact
7. Job Source
8. Job Posting URL

If you’re not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That’s what will ultimately start you on your journey.",2019-03-21 21:08:48

lnd4a9,Is OpenAI's GPT3 good enough to fool the general population? / The world's largest scale Turing Test,"I finally managed to get access to GPT3 🙌 and am curious about this question so have created a web application to test it. At a pre-scheduled time, thousands of people from around the world will go on to the app and enter a chat interface. There is a 50-50 chance that they are matched to another visitor or GPT3. Through messaging back and forth, they have to figure out who is on the other side, Ai or human.

What do you think the results will be?

[The Imitation Game project](https://www.theaicore.com/imitationgame?utm_source=reddit)

A key consideration is that rather than limiting it just to skilled interrogators, this project is more about if GPT3 can fool the general population so it differs from the classic Turing Test in that way. Another difference is that when matched with a human, they are both the ""interrogator"" instead of just one person interrogating and the other trying to prove they are not a computer.

11lyex3,How would you teach genetic algorithms to CS students ?,"Hey,

I hope this post is allowed here. I understand that generic idea-seeking posts aren't allowed due to duplication, but I believe this is more of a discussion and not something that's well covered.

I'm trying to figure out a good method of teaching genetic algorithms to second year university CS students, as part of their AI unit. It will probably take up a few weeks of content at most.

At the moment, I'm considering building an extendable genetic algorithm whereby the students can add their own methods for things such as selection (e.g., adding roulette).

The idea is to introduce GAs visually first, and so I am hoping to rely on something entertaining and intuitive (but somewhat abstracted away from them) for the GA itself. Something like this [genetic cars algorithm](https://rednuht.org/genetic_cars_2/) comes to mind.

Essentially, my thoughts are that they will be learning by observing the baseline GA I provide to them, and then they will investigate and compare with each other by implementing their own mutation, selection, etc., and also tweaking factors such as the population size and number of generations.

I thought it would be cool to provide some sort of history of the fitness graphs, so they can easily see how making such changes impacts the effectiveness of the algorithm.

These are just my ideas so far, but I would really appreciate any insight or suggestions.

Thanks :)",2023-03-08 14:56:38

ewa5vv,"Why ""Introduction to Algorithms"" (ie CLRS) is a great book for a beginner","Hi guys,

If you search the book ""Introduction to Algorithms"" by Cormen, then you will find a lot of people saying that this book is not a good book for beginners.

You probably won't care, but I would like to say a bit about why I disagree.

A beginner, to my mind, is someone who probably has not acquired patterns associated with imperative programming, e.g., nested loops, looping over arrays. In other words, not much experience programming with basic built in programming constructs. It could be someone who is coming from a functional programming language with no imperative programming experience.

If you understand the algorithms in CLRS and implement them in an imperative language, such as Python, then you will develop a library of models or chunks. These models or chunks, in turn, will help you solve future problems.

Solving a problem you haven’t seen before requires you to link existing chunks. So, the more chunks you acquire, the better problem solver you become.

From a problem solving point of view a chunk can be seen as a solution. It can also be seen as a model.

By doing this you will become a better python programmer and since many imperative languages share the same programming constructs you will become a better programmer in general. In addition, you will learn how to analyze algorithms, which is part of the essence of programming. I read a research paper about what distinguishes great software engineers. One of the things these researchers learnt was that great software engineers pay attention to details; for example, they are attentive enough to implement efficient algorithms.

So, I think, if you have some mathematical sense, and you are willing to think hard, and lack imperative programming experience then I think CLRS is great book to study.",2020-01-30 18:46:26

# Introduction

Since I have studied how computers, hardware and system work on the low level, I have been wondering why current systems that run user applications, even in 2021, have the design they have that is so inconvenient and dangerous IMO.

I am an IT person with IT as a hobby since I am a kid. I may be naive about the business aspect or even technical aspect of all of this. I don't think I completely am, I would like to know otherwise.

I am not pretending to give lessons to the people who designed Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux... I don't think I have the technical level nor the business understanding for that yet.

I am however wondering why :

Why aren't desktop applications - in particuliar - properly containerized and restricted since the earliest days of modern OSs since it is technically possible ? Most of desktop apps don't require all the access they have at all.

The purpose of the post for me is to understand why *application engines* are, how they can be, how they can evolve, what they could be.

I am open minded, so please be before reading. Also please be well aware of the technical aspects and or the business aspects of all of this. I am also mostly a Windows and Android User (I know already I'll get down votes for that...). I have at least a basic knowledge of Linux systems to. So therefore, I will mention *Windows*, *Linux* and *Android Linux* Often.

(edit) I may sound arrogant with ""... since the earliest days of modern OSes"". I do not pretend to give lessons to people behind OSes, as mentioned in the original version of the post. The reason I wrote this is because the *protected mode* of Intel is used extensively by apps and OSes since 30-20 years and - I assume - could allow a much better isolation of apps (see bellow)

# Technical facts

* In a regular OS, an application capacities are the following :
   * Use its non-special **CPU registries**
   * **Access, read, write** its allocated virtual memory space (and never outside of this).
   * That's it. They cannot ever do anything else (I/O: Network, Display, User input). Except by doing **system calls**.
   * **System calls** are completely managed by the host OS. And therefore the host OS controls everything the application/process, sees outside its own memory.
   * **Privilege levels** of a CPU (*^(it has nothing to do with privilege of users in Windows or Linux here)*) prevents any code to execute some CPU instructions, or to access some special registries like the registry that defines the virtual memory to physical memory mapping.
   * System calls, virtual memory, privilege levels (not in the common meaning) are **CPU features**.
* Of course exploits can be exceptions to all of this above.
* Those CPU features are nothing new. [The first CPU to support such features was released in 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286#Features).

# More technical assumptions

* The OS is responsible for providing the API to applications.
   * Therefore, a proper filtering of the system calls, could in theory, prevent any application to do harm to the rest of system.
* It is easy to run containerized applications. CPU features of virtual memory, privilege levels and system calls have been allowing this since more than 30 years.
* Those ""containerized"" applications can be arbitrarily restricted in using the OS features by filtering the system calls.

# Current UI application engines flaws ?

Under Windows 10 for example, here is how to works :

* Applications running with minimal privilege can :
   * Access read / write my entire user folder at least
   * Take screenshots
   * Read my keyboard activity even when I do not have the focus on it.

There are only a access few fine tuning capabilities for Camera, Microphone, ect...

**Why should any Desktop application with guess privilege users requires access to all of this ?** This is absurd.

Of course some applications like CCleaner, a file explorer will need more special access, but these are more exceptions than common.

Case of an application requiring to open a file or a folder are common but can very well be addressed without giving access to entire folders. A web app for example can ask for the browser to prompt the user for a file or a folder so the web app can access them.

Examples of applications that do not require ""special"" rights to operate :

* Web browser
* Games
* Multimedia streaming and player
* Office applications
* Messaging / Communications

# So why aren't things like that instead

**Given :**

* The technical facts and assumptions above.
* The advantages it would provide (UX, Security, Privacy)
* That this do not look impossible at all to adopt in practice
* This is technically really doable and rather easy (or it is not easy ?).

**Things could be like that :**

* Applications have their own dedicated folders. For example : (one for binaries, one for data/settings, one for cache so the system knows what can be cleaned up).
* They cannot access or even see other folders except if an application requires its.
* The OS is in charge of installing and updating the applications by fetching on the applications  repositories.Yes, it just works like that in Linux. But on Windows, it is a mess and rather looks like this :
   * Applications check themselves for updates sometime running their own daemon for that.
   * Applications have their own installer with UI ( sometime an .exe or an .msi file which is similar to package ?)
* Any rights outside the above will be explicitly prompted to the user upon installation or on execution when requested. Android and iOS do this but sometime are not very specific IMO. They include :
   * Use camera / microphone
   * Use speakers
   * Taking screenshots
   * Using Network
   * Automatically start at boot
   * Read system information (Processes, Memory, Drivers, Storage, Devices...)
   * Modify system settings
   * Read data of X or Y application
   * Interact with X or Y application
* To import a file / folder, an application will send a message to the OS and the OS will prompt the user for a file / folder to import.Just like the web pages do it for the browsers.
* An application may allow to be accessed by other specific applications without prompting the user.
* Limit of resource usage (CPU, memory, storage, network throughput)

**Advantages**

* Better security against malwares
* Better privacy
* Better UX regarding application updates. Messages box like ""*A new update is available, would you like to...*"" at least would not happen for applications.
* Such standardized containers could ease the use of saving your application settings (or even entire state ?) online, using the provider of your choice, potentially with zero knowledge.

**Disadvantages**

It might be a challenge for OS editors to define a proper application-to-system interface that :

* Provides security for the system
* Do not limit the possibilities of an application

... and actually I can't see why how this is such a challenge.

# But, what about : Web applications

The web (pages) is after all some kind of virtual machine, running on a specific interpreted language (HTML/CSS/JS).

This is already a well established solution to what I proposed above. Plus it runs on any CPU-platform because it is not machine code.

They run on a near-perfect isolation from each other and the rest of the system.

Most applications nowadays are SaaS applications with a Web front-end.

However we will still have need those non web applications. Web applications are also more resource expensive than non web applications.

# But, what about : Docker

Docker is a wonderful containers technology and is well established now. But is mostly used to run server side applications.

It is unofficially supported to :

**Run UI applications with proper isolation**

There is an interesting article about running firefox on docker on linux. But it involves sharing the X11 socket with the container. That access can be harmful ?[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/running-gui-applications-on-docker-in-linux](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/running-gui-applications-on-docker-in-linux)

**Run untrusted code safely**

Docker is NOT official capable of running untrusted code safely[https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/107850/docker-as-a-sandbox-for-untrusted-code](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/107850/docker-as-a-sandbox-for-untrusted-code)

There are however some attempts (unchecked) :[https://blog.remoteinterview.io/how-we-used-docker-to-compile-and-run-untrusted-code-2fafbffe2ad5](https://blog.remoteinterview.io/how-we-used-docker-to-compile-and-run-untrusted-code-2fafbffe2ad5)[https://github.com/glotcode/docker-run](https://github.com/glotcode/docker-run)[https://fn.lc/post/docker-scratch/](https://fn.lc/post/docker-scratch/)

To build what I propose above, Docker might be a vert good start thou.

# (Edit) More existent solutions

Some comments mentioned a few interesting, existing techs :

**iOS**

Does a really good a job in the permission of apps it seems. You may not like iOS for other reasons though

**Snap package manager for Linux**

An attempt to containerize apps better. AFAIK it creates a real mess in the host OS file hierarchy

**Qubes OS**

Interesting

An OS that runs multiple VMs to isolate your apps

Pros :

* You can run any app from any OS
* More secused than containers

Cons :

* But probably eats RAM and CPU for breakfast

**BSD jails**

**Universal Windows Platform**

# Exploits ?

Exploits are potentially everywhere.Any hardware.Any OS.Any application engine of any type (Web, Container, native/traditional).

Is it so obvious that a container running machine code in complete isolation is more likely to have dangerous exploits than a web engine ? Might sound like a stupid question but actually I don't think it is such an easy question.After all, an application engine with a full interface to run UI applications that runs machine code may not be as complex.",2021-05-27 19:19:30

aeghls,CES 2019: Moore's Law is dead says Nvidia's CEO,"RIP Moore's Law; you had a good run. 

At least that's what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes. The executive, who co-founded graphics-chip maker Nvidia, on Wednesday declared that ""Moore's Law isn't possible anymore.""

A key part of semiconductor manufacturing is shrinking the components called transistors, the extraordinarily tiny electronic switches that process data for everything from the clocks in microwave ovens to the artificial intelligence algorithms running in our phones.

Video: Nvidia CEO demos next-generation computer graphics at CES 2019

Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 predicted a steady, two-year cadence of chip improvements that would double a processor's performance every couple of years. Moore's Law became more than a guideline for computer processor manufacturing. It's instead evolved into a shorthand definition for innovation at regular intervals, and has become a self-fulfilling prophecy driving the tech industry. Those regular improvements in iPhones, Samsung Galaxy smartphones and various other devices are thanks to Moore's Law. 

But as the scale of chip components gets closer and closer to that of individual atoms, it's gotten harder to keep up the pace of Moore's Law. It's now more expensive and more technically difficult to double the number of transistors -- and in return, the processing power -- for a given chip every two years. 

""Moore's Law used to grow at 10X every five years [and] 100X every 10 years,"" Huang said during a Q&A panel with a small group of reporters and analysts at CES 2019. ""Right now Moore's Law is growing a few percent every year. Every 10 years maybe only 2X. ... So Moore's Law has finished.""

vkfvh6,What do you use when your scientific (Python) code isn't fast enough?,"Hey all, Machine Learning engineer here. I've been working as a machine learning engineer for almost 2 years now, working on almost exclusively deep learning problems in vision and signal processing. One skillset I've recognized that I would really like to pick up is how to write *fast* code when whatever algorithms I've written up just aren't fast enough. Examples of this are computing IoU for object detection problems, training a model which can have parallelized updates, Non-Maximum Suppression, etc. I've learned that my ability to write fast code is really limited by whatever is available in Python: multiprocessing, asyncio when appropriate, standard scientific packages, or relying on others to write bindings to their custom cpp/cuda code.

I would like to start building up my confidence to be able to know how to learn how to write very high performance scientific code, but I haven't been able to find many resources that exclusively focus on this. Could anyone help guide me in the right direction? I'm unsure if I should jump right into trying to use OpenMP to write some highly multithreaded algorithm, if I should focus on learning how to program with Cython, or just get more comfortable writing standard C code with python bindings.

g4qewk,Amazon Rejected my Software Developer Internship Application,"So I recently applied to Amazon's 2020 Software Developer Internship program, however I was rejected at the first stage (didn't even qualify for technical interview).

The reason why I am posting this is because I applied the previous year, with less experience and worse grades and I managed to score a technical interview, which I then didn't get past.

I apply again this year, with one internship under my belt from another company and a better GPA, but this time I didn't even qualify for a technical interview?

I am not sure the reasoning behind this as I am now in my final year of university (which is a preference for this program), I have more experience, a better constructed CV and better grades. I'm not sure if Amazon does a darts approach to selecting applicants, but I just don't understand how I don't even qualify for the technical round.

I'm not trying to bitch or complain that I didn't get in, it's just that I am far more qualified and arguably a better candidate than I was the first time round yet I don't even get a chance to prove myself AND I applied early.

If anyone has experienced this, is there a reasoning behind this? I don't think this has to do with Covid-19, since they did not explicitly state this in their email (plus why would they even advertise the position).

*Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Russell and Norvig* is the only book I have been able to find that is properly AI as opposed to just ML, and I've been enjoying it so far, but it's just one book and I'm sure there are topics it misses.

I moved to the States not so long ago and ever since i started my full time job here I've been thinking of teaching programming again. Ideally I'd like to teach beginners and intermediate folks separately - focusing on fundamentals for beginners while maybe building a full blown app with dev ops and what not for intermediates. Given the pandemic and delta variant I'd like to do it virtually but hit me up if you'd be interested. 

I've always seen programming as a welcoming discipline and this is my way if giving back! 

Cheers!

hrv3ov,Suggestions for starting out in computer science (is it too late?),"Hi!

I'm a senior in high school who just applied to and got accepted into college. I have no coding, robotics, or really any comp sci related experience. My major isn't anything related to comp sci (it's probably on the FAR end of it actually) but I think it's so crucial to today's world to understand as much about comp sci as possible. The college I am at has an extremely difficult computer science major and honors program that would be very difficult for me to take courses in so I'm kicking myself for not have learning about coding or other computer science related things sooner. I honestly think that even if I find out that I love computer science and want a job in it that I would not be able to pursue it at the college I am at.

Are there any beginning courses or classes you would recommend that could get me started in learning computer science so I can learn more about it? Or just so I can learn more about a field that is so important to today's world? Is it too late for me to want to learn now?

acqz1x,Any other CS students intimidated by internships?,"So I'm a junior who recently transferred to a school with a well-respected computer science program. Now that I'm somewhere with a bit more recognition and more advanced computer classes, I'm starting to apply for summer internships. However, I'm *absolutely* terrified and feel like I'm not cut out for any of them! :( I lost a bunch of credits when I transferred and will be doing an extra semester most likely, so I'm planning on applying to local internships for this summer and more prestigious  internships for next... But even the local internships scare me lol

I've done well in all of my comp sci classes so far (although one or two of the prereqs like physics, etc were roooough), and up until this semester I *thought* I had amassed a decent amount of experience programming my own neopets-esque site in middle school/high school. 

But also, as I've advanced to upper level classes I've started to realize how much I *don't* know + how much my code sucked then/sucks now, and it's mildly terrifying lol. And so the idea of actually working in computer science terrifies me, to the point where I've debated not working in programming despite the fact that it's something I'm obviously interested in :/ I'd like to think a lot of it is because I'm a woman in STEM, but at least 45% of my school's comp sci department is female so eh lol 

Did anyone else feel the same way or is currently feeling the same way? Any words of encouragement? :(

tz9bxt,New COBOL Compiler,"A few days ago the gcobol project was released, whose goal is to create a free compiler for the COBOL programming language and which is on the GCC compiler set developers mailing list.

In its current form, gcobol is being developed as a fork of GCC, but once the development is complete and the project stabilizes, the changes are planned to be proposed for inclusion in the main GCC composition.

The reason for the creation of the new project is the desire to obtain a freely licensed COBOL compiler that will facilitate the migration of applications from IBM mainframes to systems running Linux.

The community has been developing a free standalone project that many of you may already be aware of, but for those who are new to the project you should know that this is ""GnuCOBOL"" for a long time, but it is a compiler that translates code into C language and also does not provide full support for even the COBOL 85 standard and does not pass the full set of benchmark tests, which repels financial institutions that use COBOL on work projects.

Gcobol is based on proven GCC technologies and has been developed for more than a year by a full-time engineer. The existing GCC backend is used to generate executable files, and COBOL source processing is separated into a separate interface developed by the project.

So far I know that the compiler successfully builds 100 examples from the ""Beginning COBOL for Programmers"" book, and support for ISAM and COBOL object-oriented extensions is planned to be added to gcobol in the coming weeks. Within a few months, gcobol's functionality is planned to pass the NIST benchmark test suite.

**PART 2 Entry 19/04/2022 - New Cobol Interests** 

Major corporations agreed to help pay and support a strategy to secure the open source software that supports their technology, which was submitted to the Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Threats and senior government authorities.

A white paper explaining the entire proposal has been issued by the Linux Foundation and the Open Source Security Foundation it supports. The news release includes a description of topics that need to be addressed before, during, and after the software development process.

The proposal, for example, emphasizes the need to eliminate non-memory-safe coding languages in order to increase open source security. Languages like Cobol and C++ are faster and more efficient, but they are more vulnerable to specific flaws.

Identifying and auditing specific libraries, as well as sending incident response teams as needed, would all be part of the plan, which would be made easier by tools like a standardized software bill of materials.

So when you sign up to a website like Paypal.com for example you should be generated a random anti-phishing code. When you confirm your email address, the website sends this code to you in the email. Your email client then detects the anti-phishing code in the emails and says 'would you like to import anti-phishing code', you say 'yes, I would love to'; and then the email client adds it to a database of email addresses paired with anti-phishing codes.

Every legitimate email from Paypal will include the text ""Anti-phishing code: Xh7mnO22sXiWk92k"" for example, and when scammers email to say that 'You have been locked out from your Paypal account, please log in within 12 hours', the email client can check for the anti-phishing code, find it's not there or it's wrong, and send that email to junk.  


I want to confirm that emails that contain the correct code would still need to be checked in the usual way; an email shouldn't just get green-lit purely because it contains the correct code, but those without the correct code should end up in junk.

The professor used to say we'd use that later in Compiler Theory and/or lexical analysis, something like that.

I was today years old when I learned how lazy browsers truly are. A refresh won't ensure that the browser will load all of the updates you made to your code; it will rely on cached data unless you tell it to do a hard refresh -- go check for updates: SHIFT + REFRESH.

TLDR: Browsers are lazy. **Shift+Refresh** whenever you want to run your code on localhost.

j6cp5h,CPU multitasking,"I have kind of philosophical question. I know how CPU works and how OS works, but I still don't get it why and how is it possible for CPU to do ""2 things at the same time"". Hear me out...

Let's say you are listening to the music (Spotify) and browsing the web (firefox/chrome/whatever).

So for sake of simplicity you have 2 processes (Spotify and web browser). 

Now lets say you are reading something on Wikipedia and listening to the music at the same time. So now how is that possible? I know the sound card play some role in that... But CPU still has to ""send some information"" to sound card right? If that happens wouldn't we hear pause in the music when CPU switches the process?

Or maybe more complex example.

You are watching a movie on Netflix... So there are many things happening ""at the same time"". So networking, audio, video decoding (which probably takes the most CPU power out of these 3 things)...

So how can the movie play without any interruptions? It's just hard to imagine... When the CPU switches from one process why do we not notice that and experience some sort of ""lag""?

Is that because our brains cannot ""process data"" that fast? 

So If you would have device that could somehow record how CPU switches processes and then slow it down by factor of million would you be able to see/notice this lag that happens when the switch happens? Or at least if you would have a CPU that would perform 1000 operations per second instead of a few millions would you be able to ""see"" that behavior?",2020-10-06 20:17:55
hh2f9b,Help me compile a list of the best orators teaching programming with empathy,"I have no difficulties finding answers for any question in programming or computer science. I have no problem finding hundreds of courses for any subject. But you know what's is difficult as hell? To find something that was made with empathy. Some videos, or course, or book that you not only understand, but you enjoy. Something that it feels like the creator consciously tried to put himself in the point of view of the person been taught. And succeed.

&#x200B;

The majority of the videos/courses I can find, suffers from the same problem: superficiality, lots of speech bad habits like pauses, stuttering, irrelevant comments, that famous ""ahhhh..."" before every sentence, or even injecting advanced stuff while talking about basic concepts, without explanation (just because it's easy this way)...

&#x200B;

I get more and more disappointed the more videos I watch (specially on Youtube). And I am not speaking about the low rated content. I speak about videos with 2k likes, some others with 200k views, I speak about udemy and skillshare ""top"" content, stuff that was supposedly to be well elaborated before been published.

&#x200B;

And, apart from those above, there is what I called The Main Sin that a content creator can commit.

So, one problem that I can safely say I and you will encounter in 90 out of 100 videos in your next search is the lack of empathy. It seems like it is too hard for people to put themselves in other's people shoes.

&#x200B;

However that is crucial, because the whole goal of putting up a content to the public is to be understood and enjoyed by someone else with a very different point of view of the creator (the student). Most teachers tend to explain as they were explaining to themselves not to the other. Or they explain to an idealized student in their head, such student, I would say, happens to be (conveniently) smarter and advanced than the average out there.

&#x200B;

Ok, I know I gave no real examples here, no links. However that is a bit delicate because I don't want to point fingers on teachers that are not here to defend themselves. So I will have to leave things I bit blurry here.... 

&#x200B;

However...

&#x200B;

I can point out some examples of good teachers. People who do not suffer from the problems I mentioned, and I hope after you watch some of their videos and then compare with the mediocre stuff you can easily find, then you will know what I am talking about.

&#x200B;

One example is Derek Banas (Youtube channel): I think it would be a relief for millions of souls if every youtuber trying to tech something, were able to speak the way this guy speaks. He is able to cover every topic from beginning to end without breaking the flow (something that should not be so rare as it is, it should be the standard). He covers lot of topics in programming, so, just take a look.

&#x200B;

There is also Tony Alicea and his teaching about ""JavaScript under the hood"" (""Javascript understanding the weird parts"", find it on Udemy or maybe Youtube). Let me explain why he is an example of a good teacher. Well, even though many people avoid speaking about this, deeply inside we know that most of courses offered by platforms like udemy, skillshare and others, are just people trying desperately to get their passive income. They are not talented, the are not committed to real teaching, the just want to spit out some content with minimal standards to be accepted by some course selling platform, and that is it. They love the passive income, not the teaching. However, when you watch Tony Alicea you clearly see how he is really doing his best to get out of his head and enter the mind of the student and that resulted in one of the best programming videos I have ever seen. It stood out (for me) for a very particular reason: the presence of empathy. I felt he was really explaining it TO ME, and not explaining to himself or to the idealized student in their head like 95% of teachers. Unfortunately he seemed to have stopped creating courses and videos. I hope he come back one day.

&#x200B;

Another example is a guy called Widhi Muttaqien (Expose Academy channel). I encountered him while learning blender. He just proceed with the teaching without breaking the flow, without irrelevant comments, etc, but there was one aspect about his teaching that stuck: imagine when you are watching a lesson and it seems like the teacher is floating behind your head, reading your thoughts and them the video you are watching simply starts addressing exactly the doubt the just appeared in your head or was about to appear. Yes, the guy, unlike many teachers, he ""was present"" and in sync with the mind of the student. Again, this king of power only comes with empathy and he had it.

&#x200B;

Last one: Joe Collins. Well, to be honest, I just watched one of his videos and it was yesterday. I need to refresh my shell skills, do some scripts, etc, and I stumbled upon one of his bash lessons. Again, I loved this guy just because he had that rare quality, the ""flow speaking"". Whenever I open a video and I watch a unbroken flow stream of words, I feel: ""this person respects the other"". And a format like this doesn't come by accident. One must consciously choose to to that, and it is harder because it requires empathy.

&#x200B;

Not to forget Uncle Bob of course, even though most of his videos are not specific, hands on code lessons, but a more general speech on some programming subject, I couldn't leave him out of the list since he is a terrific speaker.

&#x200B;

I just mentioned a few, but of course there are a lot more out there that I don't know (and that's why I decided to post this). So guys, I implore, help me to expose these ""good teachers"" to the world so that it would not be so difficult to find them next time some poor student look for help. It seems like those damn algorithms are not doing their job very well, we need to help these bastards (the algorithms).

&#x200B;

We have a ocean of information nowadays, but content made with empathy is rare, and algorithms are ""not working"" for this. Lot and lots of highly rated content simply fails at empathy and ""speaking flow"", that's why we need to handcraft a list of ""best orators"" in programming with our hands and leave it here for posterity.

&#x200B;

xl3f1n,What were some basic aspects of computer science that you couldn't quite understand as you were learning?,"For me, there were a lot, mainly due to the fact that comp sci wasn't my focus in college (nor my interest at the time). As a computer engineering major, I had about 2 classes (Intro to Java, and C++). I had a lot of help to get through these courses and I mainly just memorized algorithms for tests because I couldn't comprehend anything. I got by with mediocre scores in those classes.

Here were some things I couldn't quite understand, and I look back and laugh today:

# Function placement

I couldn't understand how a function was executed or called. The professor always just ""jumped"" to the function with no explanation as to how the computer just knew to jump there. What confused me even more is that he would sometimes write functions above or below a main program, and I had no idea what anything meant at that point. We never learned on a computer back in those days either (2000) and I had no concept of program flow as a result. So it was just pure random ""jump theory"" in my mind.

# Function Parameters

Often, the professor would write something like:

    int sum(x, y) { 
        return x + y 
    }

And then he'd have two variables:

    int sum1 = 3 (sometimes int x = 3)
    int sum2 = 4 (sometimes int y = 4)

Then call that function with:

    int mySum = sum(sum1, sum2) OR
    int mySum = sum(x, y)

I was so confused because I had no concept of variable scope, and I thought the parameter names had to be called x and y! But then why is he doing sum1 and sum2 sometimes? These confusions were never addressed on my end because no one could explain it to me at the time and all was lost. It wasn't until I hit 30 when I started to self teach myself, that I realized what was going on.

# Find the Sum of 1 to 100

This simple concept in college was way over my head. Finding the sum of 1 to 100 is quite trivial, and is done like this:

    int x
    int y = 0
    for (x = 1; x <= 100; x++) {
        y = y + x 
    }

But the professor never explained that the variable y would retain the previous value and add to the counter. Obviously this method is a functional programming nightmare, however this is a simple way of teaching variable scope. But this was just not taught to me and I had no clue why the above function was summing numbers from 1 to 100.

Today, I would solve that above problem in Javascript using functional techniques, like:

    let y = [1..100].reduce((a, b) => a + b)

Imagine a professor trying to explain that one!

# Conclusion

I was only 19 or 20 (today I am 41) when learning those concepts, but I do have to say the professors teaching those courses never took out a computer to show us how it was done, and it was pure theory. They assumed that we knew the proper control flow of how a computer program worked, but since I personally did not at the time, I was left with more confusion over comp sci than my calculus courses. It was just a big mess and because of the way comp sci was taught to me, I hated it for a full decade. I started self teaching myself 10 years ago, and now I absolutely love the topic, so it is a shame I was put off by this in college.

So my question: What comp sci topics gave you trouble while you were learning? Or what still does give you trouble?",2022-09-22 14:47:17
vfx6ww,Is there any computer science term that describes this analogy?,"Say I have a set of tasks, and am planning the tasks over a week's worth of time. Rather than naively distribute tasks across all 7 days in order to maximize time allotted per task, I do the following. I decide to consider that I in fact only have 6 days available, leaving Sunday open for completing any outstanding tasks due to bad time estimates, unforeseen circumstances, etc.

g50iqj,"Severe dearth of a modern MOOCs on Compilers, Language Theory & Operating Systems","I've been doing moocs since 2012. I went bonkers and spent 1 year doing  some 40+ courses from edX, coursera and udacity back then. Initial course offerings on these platforms were very (very) good and comprehensive. They also served well to kickstart mooc revolution.

However It's been 8 years since then and I'm yet to see a good full blown course on Compilers, Language Theory (Automata) and Operating System. In my experience, Compilers by Alex Aiken (coursera -> stanford languita -> edx) is the only formidable course on the subject. CS262 by Westley weimer on Udacity was one of my favorites back in 2012, but it's shallow and introductory. I don't know why this is so. Even the compiler course (By Aiken) hasn't aged well. The toolkit for programming assignment (which is 80% of learning) is outdated and very difficult to work with.

There's a similar argument for Automata  and Operating Systems. There is a course by Ullman on Automata but it's not very comprehensible (no offense to Sir Ullman). Similarly, there are a few courses on OS on Udacity, but they aren't very comprehensive either.

In my experience, MIT has some of the best, most informative and comprehensive CS courses (on edX). Most of these courses have a detailed lab component and aren't water downed like others. We need a few such courses on the subjects like OS, Compilers and Language Theory. Courses with in-depth but easy to setup programming challenges that span for at least 10 weeks and cover the topic comprehensively.",2020-04-20 20:26:49

  **Difference between a Value Type and a Reference Type**

* Value type: hold the data within its own memory allocation. Stored in the stack.
* Value types can be created at compile time and stored in stack memory.
* Value type: if assigned to another variable, the value is copied directly and both variables work independently.
* Reference type:  contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the real data. Stored in the heap.
* Reference types are used by a reference which holds a reference (address) to the object itself. 
* Reference type: assigning a reference variable to another doesn't copy the data, but instead creates a second copy of the reference, which refers to the same location in the heap as the original value.
* reference type examples: Classes, Objects, Arrays, Indexers, Interfaces

**What is an Interface?**

* an interface is a specification for a set of class members, not an implementation. 
* an Interface is a reference type and it contains only abstract members such as Events, Methods, Properties etc. 
* you can think of an interface as an abstract class that contains only pure virtual functions. This implementation of the methods is done in the class that implements the interface.

 Difference between an Interface and a Class

* A class is a full body entity with members, methods along their definition and implementation.
* An Interface is just a set of definitions that you must implement in your Class inheriting that Interface.

 Multiple inheritance in .Net

* .Net does not support multiple inheritance. This is why Microsoft introduced Interfaces - a solution for multiple inheritance.
* .Net allows you to have a single inheritance, but you are free to implement as many interfaces as you wish.

**Static Keyword**

* Static classes and class members are used to create data and methods that can be accessed without creating an instance of the Class. The keyword static can be applied to the classes, field, method, properties, operator, event, and constructors.
* they cant be inherited and these classes are sealed by default. Normally it is used to group related static methods in class.
* the advantage of static keyword is that it will make your code a bit faster since no object creation is involved. 

**Jagged Array**

* An array which has elements of type array is called jagged array. The elements cam be of different dimensions and sizes.
* AKA an array of arrays

**Namespaces**

* namespaces are containers for the classes. 
* Used for grouping the related classes in C#.
* uses the ""Using"" keyword.

**Polymorphism**

* provides the ability to a class to have multiple implementations with the same name.
* two types: static (compile time) and dynamic (runtime)
* method overloading is an example of static polymorphism. Overloading is the concept in which method names are the same with a different set of parameters.
* method overriding is an example of dynamic polymorphism.
* method overriding can be done using inheritance. With method overriding it is possible for the base class and derived class to have the same method

**Inheritance**

* Inheritance is a concept in which you define a parent class and child classes.
* the child classes inherit methods and properties of the parent class, but at the same time, they can also modify the behavior of the methods if required. the child class can also define methods of its own if it needs to.

**Encapsulation**

* a process of binding the data members and member functions into a single unit. In c#, a Class is the real time example for encapsulation because it will combine a various type of data members and member functions into a single unit.
* Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In a different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. 

**Abstract Classes**

* Abstraction is the process to hide the internal details and showing only the functionality.
* The abstract modifier indicates the incomplete implementation. 
* the keyword abstract is used before the class or method to declare the class or method to abstract.
* an abstract CLASS is never intended to be instantiated directly. This class must contain at least one abstract method, which is marked by the keyword or modifier *abstract* in the class definition.
* abstract classes cannot support multiple inheritance.
* cant be static.
* classes marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes

**Front End Best Practices**

* indentation
* semantic elements: elements with tags that clearly deifne the content included for both the dev and the web browser.
* class and ID names: using both class and ID names are practical and relevant.
* CSS reset: resets html elements to a consistent baseline
* avoid inline style CSS
* when to use inline style: HTML email, content management system content (wordPress, etc.), Dynamic content (HTML created or altered by JavaScript), older websites.
* popular javascript frameworks: Angular, React, jQuery, Vue.js
* naming variables: always use variable names that make sense. Use camelCase.
* Comments are very important
* Design for all Browsers and Devices: Responsive Web Design

**Back End Best Practices**

*  Name things well: intelligent names, descriptive, tells us what the solution is
* use properties, not public variables:  there will be intences where you wont be able to use a public variable and will have to use a public property
* methods should do one thing: separation of concern
* camelCase
* keep it simple
* concat strings using $"""" (uses less memory space)
* avoid global variables: use app.config for data. uses less memory and can be changed at runtime
* Use public modifier only when necessary: public method can be seen by other classes outside of its own class. Private modifier : can only be seen in that class. 

**Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index**

* Indexing is a procedure that returns your requested data faster from the defined table. Without indexing, the SQL Server has to scan the whole table for your data. By indexing, SQL server does the exact same thing when you search for context in a book  by checking the index page.
* Clustered index : the type of indexing that established a physical sorting order of rows. Defining a column as a primary key makes that column the clustered the Clustered Index of that table.
* Non-Clustered : an index structure separate from the data stored in a table that reorders one or more selected columns. The non-clustered index is created to improve the performance of frequently used queries not covered by clustered indexes. 
* The differences:
   * In a table there can be only one clustered index or one or more than one non clustered index
   * In a clustered index there is no separate index.
   * In a non-clustered index there is a separate index storage for the index.
   * Clustered is slower than non-clustered.

**http Protocols**

* hyper text transfer protocol
* the underlying protocol used by the internet that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.

**Difference between http and HTML**

* http is a protocol
* HTML (hypertext markup language) is a language.

**Dependency Injection**

* DI is a design pattern that allows us to develop loosely-coupled code.
* The intent of DI is to make code maintainable.
* DI helps to reduce the tight coupling among software components.
* DI reduced the hard-coded dependencies among your classes by injecting those dependencies at runtime instead of design time.

**Entity Framework**

* EF is the framework ORM (object-relational mapping) that Microsoft makes available as part of the .Net development. 
* Its purpose is to abstract the ties to a relational database, in such a way that the dev can relate to the database entity as to a set of object and then to classes in addition to their properties. 

**MVC**

* Model View Controller is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representation of information from the way that information is presented to or accepted from the user.
* used to develop web applications
* Model = application core (database records etc); View = the display that the user sees; Controller = manipulated the data gathered by the model.
* Advantages:
   * Separation of Concerns.
   * Multiple view support,
   * Change accommodation ( because the model does not depend on the views, adding new types of views to the system generally does not affect the model.
   * More Control

**SQL Stored Procedures**

* prepared SQL code that you can save, so that the code can be resued over and over again.
* you can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

**Stack vs Heap**

* Stack = static memory
* Heap = dynamic memory
* The stack is more or less responsible for keeping track of whats executing in our code.
* The Heap is more or less responsible for keeping track of our objects;
* the stack is thought of like a stack of boxes and we can only access whats on the top of the stack and then throw it away.
* anything can be accessed from the heap at any time.",2019-08-07 17:44:37

What is there to research in computer science?

From my understanding, computer science is a human construct and is pretty much just an offshoot of mathematics. Makes sense, but I see and hear so much about ""research"" in the field of CS. I'm interested in going to grad school and doing computer science research, but it seems to me like there aren't any unknowns in computer science because the entire field was created by humans. It's not like there are unknowns, like the origin of life on Earth or the fate of the universe or anything.

7k36ib,Exorcism.io - best way to learn a new programming language?,"http://exercism.io

This is a problem I've faced multiple times. 

As someone with a couple of years of programming experience in multiple languages, most websites that teach you a new language do so in a painfully boring manner.

They all follow the same basic pattern - how to declare variables, constants, how to write for loops, switch cases, structs, and then the last 4-5 chapters are dedicated to meaty stuff like Goroutines and Channels.

A chapter about, say, variables, is full of obscure specific rules you're never going to remember, as someone looking at the book/website for the first time.

This makes learning a new language a very dry experience. I've lost interest in a new language, say Haskell or Erlang, multiple times, because by the time I mow through the first 5 chapters, all I've learned is declaring variables and functions, but all my interest has been sapped out, with repetitive examples like fibonacci and factorials.

I randomly stumbled upon exercism.io, and I found it really cool!

* They have problem sets for all languages
* They have a CLI tool, which means you can fetch exercises, and upload solutions without leaving your terminal, unlike say, codeforces
* I assume there is some sort of graded difficulty, because the couple of problems I tried were 2-4 liners
* They encourage a system, where people can check out each other's submissions and see different ways to achieve the same thing. They encourage you to participate, and leave comments/suggestions on other people's solutions. No one seems to care much for the easier problems, I'm not sure how good the community support is for the harder ones.
* The problems are not algorithmic in nature. With algorithmic problems - you're only using basic primitives like arrays, loops and recursion, but the examples here require you to understand and interact with various libraries that come with the language.

Apologies if this is a fairly well-known platform, but I just came across it, and found it the best way to learn a new language as an experienced programmer.

wu122w,How do make a computer do calculus?,"The study of calculus involves continuous change, i.e. for any arbitrary function value, the adjacent function value cannot be described as a finite growth in in the function value. To put that simply, if you have a point (x, y) on a continuous curve, you cannot add real numbers (x+a, y+b) such that it corresponds to the next point. (Correct me if I'm wrong).

This is important, because in computing we do have a ""minimum value"" that can be added since infinitely small numbers do not exist. So when we work with calculus in computing, whatever value we get out is only an approximation. (Not including math programs that are made to parse derivatives/integrals to exact values). If I want to make a console app that takes f(x) = x and integrates it from 0 to some arbitrary value a, wouldn't the only easy way to do this be by creating a Riemann sum, i.e. rectangles under the curves, and get an approximation in accordance with the the (finite) limit of the sum?",2022-08-21 14:34:12

nb7wpu,In 100 years will computer bugs decrease as software issues slowly get patched or will the need for new features increase bugs over time,"It seems to me a layperson that computer science tends to slowly standardize old commonly used features while many new features get stacked on top before they too get slowly standardized. With this process standardization software continues to get debugged and modified after its wide spread adoption due to zero day exploits and edge use cases. 

This presents two competing forces in computer sciences (there might be many more I'm not considering) when it comes to how many bugs there are in software. On the one hand you have core software that carefully and slowly gets fully debugged and new software that provides new features and new bugs. 

In the future, say 100 years, do you think software will get more and more bugs in it as it needs to continuously add in new features or do you think software will eventually get standardized enough and patched/debugged enough  to decrease bugs over time.

Personally I think software will for a number of years, perhaps 50 perhaps 150, get more and more bugs as new features need to get added to account both for new tech and for new societal wants and needs. Eventually though the majority of software will be standardized and the majority of the computer science field will be spend optimizing and improving existing software rather than writing new programs.

Note: 

When I say software I mean all software in the totality of computer science

I know the line between modifying existing software and making new software is blurry but I don't have a better way of expressing smoothing over existing problems vs adding new features that make new problems",2021-05-13 03:59:28

The Wikipedia article for [ECC memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory) gives a wonderful example of what's freaking me out:

> A single bit is stuck at 1 due to a faulty chip, or becomes changed to 1 due to background or cosmic radiation; a spreadsheet storing numbers in ASCII format is loaded, and the character ""8"" (decimal value 56 in the ASCII encoding) is stored in the byte that contains the stuck bit at its lowest bit position; then, a change is made to the spreadsheet and it is saved. As a result, the ""8"" (0011 1000 binary) has silently become a ""9"" (0011 1001). 

Most consumer computers (hell, most consumer electronics period) don't use ECC memory. So how the hell do things go a couple days without breaking entirely? Sorry if it's a dumb question 😅",2022-08-09 01:01:30

pjlh5a,"How does ""Engineering a Compiler"" (by Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon) compare to the Dragon Book (Principles of Compiler Design by Alfred Aho and Jeffery Ulman)?","Hey everyone, So I have been thoroughly and religiously studying Compilers for a couple of months now. In addition, to the Dragon Book, I have been taking video lectures and exploring through slides online that have been compiled (no pun intended) by people that have worked with the compiler technology for years. So anyway, I have familiarized myself with all the basics (Scanning, Parsing (including generating parse trees and ASTs), and even code generation, as well). I have a good understanding of the complex algorithms involved in some of these stages, and I have a good intuition on the complexity involved in all this (in particular, I understand what problems are undecidable for a programmer. What are the pros and cons of different techniques and so on). 

So anyway, one of the lecture series that I watched had taken upon ""Engineering a Compiler"" as their reference book, and I have explored some portion of this book (of course, I am still at the very beginning), and my initial thoughts are: 

\- This book comes across as very beginner-friendly 

\- I like how it builds from the basics. So, for example, while constructing a scanner, we get to see the application of finite-state automata in action. So the book tells us how to go from a regular expression to non-deterministic finite automata using Thompson's construction algorithm and how all this process leads us to recognize words. We get to learn about this process within the first 50 pages of the book. In contrast to this, the dragon book jumps straight into the more complex stuff (such as writing context-free grammar, building a syntax-directed translator, and some other notions from a parsing point of view). In other words, it seems to skip a lot of stuff at the beginning that should have been introduced before we had jumped into the more complex stuff. 

\- As mentioned above, ""Engineering a Compiler"" takes a very programming-oriented approach. It is easier to comprehend things from a coding point of view, and it is convenient to map the theory into actual practice.

\- The notion of ""Classic Expression Grammar"" is introduced in a very beginner-friendly manner in that book. 

Anyways, I am still in the process of learning and exploring as much as I can, so I am not sure how much weight and value my opinion carries. I am reading up on both texts. In my opinion, the Dragon Book is very detailed, in the sense that each sentence can be a book on its own at times, but ""Engineering a compiler"" seems more beginner-friendly. One more thing that I have heard people say is that some of the optimization techniques presented in the dragon book are a bit outdated, but I am still looking forward to reading about that. 

Anyways, these were just my two cents on both these books. Now, why do I ask this question from you guys? I would love to get some insights from a professional or someone more educated on this stuff. Also, if you find any misconceptions in the above passage then feel free to correct me on that. I come here to learn more.",2021-09-07 11:47:45

Fastest form of my module is W@A\*A. The order can grow exponentially. Its calculation speed far exceeds Horner algorithm.

9g3g99,"Hey /r/ComputerScience, I made a research paper recommender for Computer Science, and I would love for you to try it out! It uses embedding representation for each paper, so you can get recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations. Easy to run in Google Colab","I made a research paper recommender for Machine Learning and Computer Science in general, try it out! It uses embeddings to represent each paper, so you can get TSNE maps of the recommended papers, recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations for that combo of several papers.

###What is it?

The dataset used is Semantic Scholar's corpus of research paper (https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/ ), and was trained by a Word2Vec-based algorithm to develop an embedding for each paper. The database contains 1,666,577 papers, mostly in the computer science field. You can put 1 or more (as many as you want) papers and the recommender will return the most similar papers to those papers. You can also make TSNE maps of those recommendations.

https://i.imgur.com/OCgp0MV.jpg


###Where is it?

Github

https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/Research2VecPublicPlayGround.ipynb

Or direct look to Google Colab

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-0ggLs2r-5nWDWb-TNWqR2osaiXqNEsL

###What can you do with it ?

You can input a paper, and see what are the most similar papers to it, though the first 30-80 will most likely be papers it has cited or was cited by. I've set it to return 300 papers but it ranks all 1,666,577 papers so you can set it to return whatever number of papers you want without any change in performance (except when it comes to developing the TSNE maps)

Now, the fun part: utilization the embedding properties:

You can see a TSNE map of how those similar papers are related to each other. The TSNE takes a while to process for 500 points (10-20 minutes). You can decrease the number of papers for a speedup, or increase the number of papers but that'll take more time.

You can input several papers by adding the embeddings, and get recommendations for combined papers, just add the embeddings for all the papers (you don't have to average them since the embeddings are normalized ). 

Finally, my favorite part, you can get TSNE maps of the recommendations for the combined papers are well. 

**A great use case would be if you're writing a paper, or plan to do some research and would like to check if someone has already done something similar. You can input all the papers you cited or would like to cite, and look over the recommendations.** 

### How important is this ?

When I was in R&D, we spent a lot of time reinventing the wheel; a lot of techniques, methods, and processes that we developed were already pioneered or likely pioneered. But we weren't able to look for them, mainly due to not hitting the right keyword/phrasing in our queries.

There's a lot of variation in terms which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times.

I've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented very similar concepts in a previous paper.

Even the Google Brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. A few months ago they released a paper of Swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it.

> ""As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough >enough literature search. My sincere apologies. We will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/dojjag2/

So if this is something that happens to the Google Brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too.

Here's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.

Word2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651

Binary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical Assessment

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07479

Exact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology.

###How do I use it ?

Here's a quick video demonstration:

https://youtu.be/tlutFm1meMs

I tried to make this user friendly and as fast to figure out and run as possible, but there's probably stuff I didn't take into account. Let me know of you have any questions on how to run it or any feedback. If you want, you can just give me what papers you want to analyze and I'll do it for you (look up the papers on https://www.semanticscholar.org/ first )

Here's a step by step guide to help people get started

**Step 1:** 

Run the Section 1 of code in the Colab notebook. This will download the model and the dictionaries for the titles, Ids, and links. 

https://snag.gy/rmoCXO.jpg

**Step 2:**

Find the papers want to find similar papers for at Semantic Scholar https://www.semanticscholar.org

Get either the title or Semantic Scholar's paperID, which is the last section of numbers/letters in the link. For example, in this link

https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Distributed-Representations-of-Sentences-and-Le-Mikolov/9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3

The Semantic Scholar paper ID is '9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3'

Use the title(s) and/or Semantic Scholar's paperID(s) with Section 2 and Section 3 to get the EmbedID from the model. EmbedIDs are how the model keeps track of each paper (not the paperID). If using the title to search, don't forget to use only lower case letters only. 

https://snag.gy/3yjx2o.jpg

The EmbedID is what each dictionary first returns. 

**Step 3:**

Insert the EmbedID(s) as the values of paper1EmbedID, paper2EmbedID, paper3EmbedID, paper4EmbedID, etc. 

https://snag.gy/AzeP91.jpg

If you have less than or more than 4 papers you want to analyze, change this line 

`extracted_v = paper1 + paper2 + paper3 + paper4`

and create or eliminate the lines of code for vector extraction

    paper1 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 

Finally, run Section 4 to get a TSNE map of the recomendations. With 300 papers, it takes 15-18 minutes for the map to be produced. 

**Ask any question you have no matter how minor, I want people to use this as quickly as possible with as little time as possible figuring out what to do.** 

### Other details

So it probably doesn't have any papers released in the last 5 months; I think the corpus was last updated in May 2018. Due to the limitation on my computational resources (Google Colab) I had to filter towards more papers with more connections to other papers in the database. A connection is either a citation to another paper in the database, or cited by another paper in the database. I filtered to only include papers with 20 or more connections because Colab would crash if I tried to include more. 

As of right now, the recommender has 1,666,577 papers. I hope to make future versions with more many more papers, including papers from other fields. 

### Feedback greatly appreciated !

I am hoping to get as much feedback as possible. I am specifically looking for cases where you feel that the recommender should have given a particular paper in the top results, but didn't. I am hoping to make an evaluation toolkit (kinda like Facebook SentEval https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval ) that I can use to tune the hyperparameters. 

This feedback will also be helpful in my future plans, where I am planning on incorporating several other measures of similarity, and then use a attention mechanism to weight them for a final similarity. One method of content analysis I would really like to use is Contextual Salience https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08493. Another was something another Redditor just pointed out is cite2vec https://matthewberger.github.io/papers/cite2vec.pdf

Using a combo like this would help in one of the reoccurring hard search cases I encountered in R&D, which was trying to look up parameters of a particular method, when the method itself is not the focus of the paper. I was just actually encountering this issue when doing my project. I wanting to know more about what optimal hyperparameters others have found when working with embedding representations. This may not be the main topic of the paper, but it may have been described in the methods section of the paper. But this is hard to search for since paper searches mainly focus on the main subjects of the paper.

Of course, I would very much appreciate whatever feedback, questions, comments, thoughts you have on this project.

wa8pd3,How does a compiler remember what data type is stored in a particular address?,"I've pondered about this for a while so I will give a simple example in C++:

int x = 65;

cout << x;

My understanding is that the compiler converts that to 1s and 0s and stores it in memory (integers take up 4 bytes, so it should be something like this - 01000001 and the rest of the bytes are filled with zeros).

When we call the variable x, the computer must find where it's stored in RAM and that's where things get confusing for me. I have asked a few people and the answer always seems to be that the compiler will figure it out but no explanation is provided about that process.

I imagine the compiler must keep information about the data type somewhere, like a data table:

address 201 - integer

address 206 - char

etc...

I would appreciate it if someone could confirm how this works because it's an integral part of how computers operate.

&#x200B;

Edit:

Just to clarify, I am asking how the computer knows that it should interpret this pattern on 1s and 0s as a number and not as a character? I understand that characters are 1 bytes but how does the compiler remember that it should check all 4 bytes and it doesn't stop at the first one?",2022-07-28 12:30:43

I know that this can be a tricky and intimidating topic, so I've done my best to break everything down and make it as accessible as possible. If you're new to the field, struggling with some of these concepts, or if you just need a refresher, this is for you.

# An Introduction to Algorithms, Pt. 4: The TSP and Heuristics

Have you ever wondered how long it would take to visit every city in the world? Or how to plan a road trip that minimizes travel time and cost? Perhaps you're curious about how biologists sequence DNA molecules containing millions of base pairs. These optimization challenges are all related to a classic problem in computer science known as the **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**. Traditionally, it asks: *given a list of cities and the distances between each pair, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point?* Answering this question is not easy. In fact, the TSP belongs to a select subset of problems classified as NP-hard because there is no known algorithm that can optimally solve any and every instance of them in reasonable (a.k.a., ""polynomial"") time.

It is one of the most intensively studied problems in optimization, and it has many practical applications in planning, logistics, manufacturing, biology, and astronomy. In your academic and professional career, you will encounter several common variations.

**First, a given instance of the problem can be symmetric or asymmetric**. In a symmetric TSP, the distance between two cities is the same in both directions, meaning that the cost of traveling from city A to city B is the same as traveling from city B to city A. In asymmetric instances of the TSP, the distance between two cities varies depending on the direction of travel -- potentially due to one-way streets, traffic conditions, or different modes of transportation. **Another way to classify TSPs is by their completeness**. A complete TSP has a direct route between every pair of cities, so you can travel between any two without stopping. On the other hand, an incomplete TSP has some missing routes between cities, possibly because of physical barriers, such as mountains or oceans. Each variation presents a unique challenge that affects the algorithms and heuristics required to find an efficient solution.

Now that you're familiar with the TSP, it's time to explore some tangible examples designed to illustrate the problem and solidify your understanding.

**TSP Example #1: Symmetric, Complete with Four Cities**

https://preview.redd.it/6fqpwnai7nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd0a0ed023a7f300355d23afb818f49c78acaa5e

We will start with a symmetric, complete TSP involving four cities: A, B, C, and D. In this instance, the distances between cities are the same in both directions, and there is a direct route between every pair of cities.

[A Symmetric, Complete TSP \(not to scale\)](https://preview.redd.it/ahmb4j1o7nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5380cf6487e2798d7e4676ccf1e54891a5a19f1e)

Given the limited nature of this TSP, we can determine the optimal solution using **a brute-force approach**. In the brute-force approach, you identify every possible route that visits each city. Calculate the total distance for each one. Then, choose the shortest. This approach is guaranteed to produce the optimal solution, but it comes at a high computational cost because the number of possible routes increases factorially with the number of cities.

In our four-city example, there are only six possible routes. However, in instances of the TSP involving ten cities, that number skyrockets to 362,880. And for problems involving a mere 20 cities, there are 121,645,100,408,832,000 possible routes. To put these numbers into perspective, even with a computer capable of evaluating one route every millisecond, it would still require over 3.8 million years to check every possible route in a 20-city TSP. That is shocking, and it highlights the limitations of a brute-force approach.

Nevertheless, it remains a valuable tool for understanding the TSP and establishing a foundation for more efficient algorithms. A brute-force approach is also appropriate for solving relatively small TSP instances. So, without further ado, here is a visual depiction of the solution to our first example:

[Visualizing a Brute Force Approach](https://preview.redd.it/1p7lcqrz7nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=58b82f046e067c76912a203dd89a2d03a7df9da6)

As you can see, six distinct routes take you from a given city (in this case, city “A”) to all other cities, and back to your city of origin. Now, let’s calculate the total distance required to traverse each one of these routes to determine the optimal solution.

[Calculating the Total Distance](https://preview.redd.it/cxxjd2v28nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a6339f31f25a3093bccb654957376024c87aef5)

The optimal solution is the tour A-B-C-D-A, or its reverse A-D-C-B-A, with a total distance of 152 km. In symmetric, complete instances of the TSP, there are always two identical, optimal solutions because the distance between two cities remains the same regardless of the direction of travel. Next, you will evaluate an asymmetric, incomplete instance of the TSP and solve it with brute-force methods.

**TSP Example #2: Asymmetric, Incomplete with Four Cities**

https://preview.redd.it/4p3l7al88nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=02a9a882bccc8b65675608582c050b15a111abe8

As promised, an asymmetric, incomplete TSP involving four cities: W, X, Y, and Z. In this instance, the distance between cities varies depending on your direction of travel, and there is no direct route between city Y and city Z.

[An Asymmetric, Incomplete TSP \(not to scale\)](https://preview.redd.it/ahegkleb8nwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=728b0700788d1ae335a49339a5e8337419969a4e)

To account for the lack of a direct route from city Y to city Z, we will approach this TSP in a non-traditional manner that allows for revisiting cities. This example highlights the complexities of real-world instances of the TSP and the limitations of its traditional rules.

Try to find the optimal route using a brute-force approach before reading my solution, and embrace this opportunity to solve a practical, tricky instance of the TSP that requires you to think outside the box. Remember, the shortest route might involve retracing your steps to ensure all cities are in the tour.

If you’re not sure where to start, answer the question: *What is the fastest way to get from city Y to city Z and vice versa?*

After you have tried to solve this problem, read my solution and compare your approach to mine. Answer the following questions as you evaluate your solution:

1. Did you find the shortest route?
2. What challenges did you face while solving this problem?
3. What did you learn from this exercise?
4. How difficult would it be to apply this brute-force approach to an instance with five or six cities?

Answering these will help you to gain a deeper understanding of the TSP and its many variations.

Good luck.

As a starting point, you may have selected city “W” and identified unique routes that limit the need to revisit cities. If so, you produced a series of routes similar to the ones depicted above. This approach is reasonable, and if you went on to calculate the total distance of each one of these six routes, you would have produced a table like this:

[Calculating the Total Distance](https://preview.redd.it/vdbpx6azwqeb1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=7063b14b3dd1d01deec0053d5de35f037dfe8530)

If you stopped there, you might be thinking that the optimal solution is the route W-X-Y-X-Z-W, which has a total distance of 105 km. But, you would be wrong. The most efficient routes can be found by treating city “X” as a fulcrum and revisiting it after every stop, which would lead you to something like **X-W-X-Y-X-Z-X**. One of the truly optimal routes, which has a **total distance of 100 km**. 

**TSP Example #3: A European Tour with 12 Countries**

In our third and final example, we have a larger symmetric, complete TSP that involves 12 countries.

[This table shows the approximate distances \(in kilometers\) between 12 European countries that form a symmetric and complete instance of the TSP.](https://preview.redd.it/9vh00h9tcnwa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df7aed11a5da4b42a7d9beb2eba8c8af3390f55)

It is unreasonable to apply brute-force methods to this example. There are 39,916,800 unique routes, and even if we took its symmetric nature into account and cut that number in half… 19,958,400 remain. But wait, what if we had a powerful computer capable of evaluating one route every millisecond? It would still take \~5.5 hours to determine the optimal solution. That is unacceptable.

Fortunately, we can leverage the power of **heuristics** when we encounter problems like this. Heuristics are problem-solving techniques that use shortcuts, rules of thumb, or practical approaches to find approximate or “good-enough” solutions to complex problems more quickly and efficiently than exhaustive methods. They prioritize speed and simplicity over optimality and often trade a guaranteed, best solution for one that is close enough or satisfactory, especially when dealing with computationally expensive problems. They are invaluable.

One popular heuristic for the TSP is **the nearest neighbor** algorithm: 

1. Start at a city (the current city).
2. Mark the current city as visited.
3. Find the unvisited city nearest to the current city.
4. If there are no unvisited cities left, go back to the starting city and terminate the algorithm. Otherwise, set the nearest unvisited city as the current city and return to step 2.

The nearest neighbor algorithm is a greedy heuristic, which means that it makes the best local choice at each step. Of course, this series of locally optimal decisions does not guarantee that the final solution will be optimal or even close to optimal. Sometimes it overlooks shorter routes because they involve visiting cities that are not the nearest neighbors at some point. Its primary advantage is that it is easy to implement and execute quickly. 

Two key variables affect the quality of the solution produced by the nearest neighbor algorithm: (1) the choice of starting city and (2) the distribution of distances between cities. We will focus on the choice of starting city because it’s a variable we control. While there is no definitive method for selecting the perfect starting city, there are some popular strategies worth considering: 

1. Start with a random city, execute the algorithm multiple times, and choose the best solution from the results.
2. Choose a city close to the geometric center of all the cities.
3. Select the city that has the smallest average distance to all other cities.

Experimenting with these strategies can help you optimize the nearest neighbor algorithm’s performance and generate higher-quality solutions.

Now it’s time to apply this heuristic to our 12-Country European Tour. If we naively choose city A, Portugal, as our starting city, we will visit countries F, K, H, J, C, L, E, I, D, G, and B in order of their proximity to one another, using the distance data provided. After we visit every country, we will return to Portugal to complete the tour. This naïve route requires us to travel a total distance of 16,000 km.

What if we choose a more strategic starting point, a country close to the geometric center of this TSP, a country like Germany? By beginning our tour in Germany, country I, we will travel to countries K, H, J, C, L, E, B, G, D, F, A, and then back to I. This route only requires us to travel 12,900 km — 3,100 km less than our naïve route. A notable improvement!

As you can see, the choice of starting city can significantly impact the efficiency of the nearest neighbor algorithm. Remember this, and do not hesitate to experiment with different strategies in an effort to optimize your solution.

**Conclusion**

The Traveling Salesperson Problem is a fascinating and complex optimization problem that has captivated the minds of many brilliant mathematicians and computer scientists. Its widespread applications in planning, logistics, manufacturing, biology, and astronomy make it an essential problem to study and understand.

Throughout this article, we explored the limitations of brute-force methods and the power of heuristics like the nearest neighbor algorithm, but the truth is that there is so, so much more for you to learn. As you continue to study computer science, you will encounter other heuristics (e.g., insertion algorithms) to help you more effectively solve the TSP and other complex, intriguing problems. Whatever you do, never stop learning, and remember that sometimes the most elegant solutions are the ones that prioritize simplicity and practicality.",2023-04-28 16:03:26

I wanted to get some advice from the wonderful folks on this thread. I am currently an undergrad computer science major and I usually have to completely programming problem sets for classes every week or every other week. I find that when I am first given the problem set, I read through the description and then immediately try to jump into coding. This usually ends with me spending hours on a complicated solution, getting stressed out since it takes forever to run, is messy and buggy while my friends usually have a more methodical approach to problems and write better code.

My question to you all is could you please walk me through your process of reading a programming assignment all the way to the end of coding it.

I can more or less accurately detect all objects and store the following results of each object:Area(number of pixels), xPosition, YPosition and like the bounds.

I tried differentiating circles from non-circles by assuming every object was a circle, finding the radius and using pi\*r\^2 to get the area. If that area matched the number of pixels then it was a circle.

However this leads to a few errors. Such as when an object takes up the same area as a circle would but is not a circle.

Any idea's as to what I can try? It also fails in the noisy cases since my algorithm doesnt save pixels that are dark (Which is counted as like the background)

Edit: (Further Detail)  
 Right now, I scan through the image and look for  pixels that arnt a black background. Then I scan through the object(neighboring pixels) but I  dont store each pixel,  I only store the minumum x-value, max x-value,  min y and max y. And the number of pixels.

After hours and multiple all nighters, I finally finished it. When hitting deploy to Firebase and seeing it online, I didn't feel as happy as I thought I would.

iy88t7,How do you approach logical problems (when designing algorithms)?,"I am a 2nd year cs student and with the current programming experience I have, I've noticed that my approach to logical problems seems to be quite ""random"". Often I will simply attempt a solution by writing a function/program that I think will work - I seem to try to figure it out as I go along. 

&#x200B;

While this approach does get me through simpler problems, it breaks down on more complex ones. When approach a more complex problem, usually one that is too large to keep track of mentally, I seem to start going in circles. I start by trying to solve one part of the problem, but then I realise that some other part needs to be solved before I solve this one, so I move on to the other part. This usually ends with me going in circles whilst trying to figure out a solution - I get stuck because I can't comprehend the problem as a whole.

&#x200B;

I have a good example where I encounter this issue: I have been programming using a language called scheme, which is purely functional. One of the tasks that I was set was to reverse a list. This was fine; I wrote a procedure which worked on the first try. This was a problem that I could ""store"" in my head in its entirety. 

&#x200B;

However, there is an extension of this task. You have to write a new procedure which reverses trees (lists containing lists containing lists etc). This means that each element in each list needs to be reversed: ( (1, 2) , (3, 4) ) would become ( (4, 3) , (2 1) ). When attempting a solution to this problem, I frequently found myself going in circles. For example, I'd solve part of the problem - reversing innermost elements in a list, but then I would realise that I can't do that first because I lose track of where I am in the tree. So I would take a different approach: trying to first reverse highest level elements. This would lead to another issue, which would lead to another... eventually leading me back to my starting point. I think that this is because I can't see the problem as a whole in my mind.

&#x200B;

I would like to be able to approach problems such as these in a more systematic manner, as opposed to a seemingly random approach. I want to know if there is a better technique that I can use to solve such problems or if it's simply a question of practicing until you can comprehend what's going on.

I've included my solutions to each reversing algorithm (the tree reversing one doesn't work yet).

964jck,"How the Fast Inverse Sqrt trick works and how you can come up with fast power, exp, log, and other methods.","This may be a bit dated, but going through my adolescence in the mid to late 2000th, the revival of the [fast inverse sqrt method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root) and the air of mystery surrounding this strange number, 0x5f3759df, made it one of those things where anyone who would ever dare to call themselves a programmer would know the reference to. Trying to understand this method, and its magical constant, was sort of my white whale. It wasn't until 2014, right after I graduated from college, that I finally understood how the method came about. It's actually deceptively simple, and I think that anyone, with a bit of luck, could have come up with this constant.

In fact, you could even create up constants for the sqrt, inverse cube root, and any rational or irrational powers. You can also use a similar technique to create approximations of exp, log, and geometric means.

The fast inverse sqrt method is essentially this approximation:


    float invsqrt(float y) {
      int i  = * ( long * ) &y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking
      i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck? 
      return * ( float * ) &i;
    }


in essence, it seems like if you take the bitwise IEEE 754 representation of the float y, as a 32bit integer, divide it by 2 (the left shift by 1), then subtract it from 0x5f3759df, and finally treat it as a float again, then you somehow get a value that seems to approximate 1/sqrt(y), with up to 10% relative error for the range of floating point numbers.

Why?

To answer this question, let's start with some simpler notations. We'll use the function float2int(y) to denote the conversion that takes in a IEEE 754 floating point number, and outputs its machine representation as a 32bit int; basically what the first line does. We'll also define the inverse function int2float(i) that performs the reverse conversion. Obviously, float2int and int2float will be inverses of each other.

Now, the question is why int2float(0x5f3759df - float2int(y) / 2) approximates the inverse sqrt function.

Well, this is where the luck comes in. Assuming that you got curious and started looking at the function

    f(y, m) = int2float(m - float2int(y) / 2)

and you have a plot where you can fix an arbitrary constant m, and plot out the curve for f(y, m) in terms of y, what would you see?

Well, as luck would have it, you can [try this out](http://www.phailed.me/2014/10/0x5f400000-understanding-fast-inverse-sqrt-the-easyish-way/#Adding%20Alpha).

If you plot the curve for just invsqrt(y) on the same graph, you'll notice that, as you vary m, your function is just a multiplicative factor away from invsqrt(y). That is, f(y, m)/invsqrt(y) is linear-ish, and your task is to find the value of m that makes this ratio go to 1 (or as close to 1 as you can manage for as many values of y as you can manage).

So how do we solve this problem? Well, the way that the original authors did was to treat this as a boundary value problem; e.g., use some value of y that simplifies the equations as much as possible. Their choice was to set y = 1 at one end of the boundary:

    1 = f(1, m)/invsqrt(1)

this simplifies to

    1 = int2float(m - float2int(1)/2)/1

and recalling that int2float and float2int are inverses, we have

    float2int(1) = float2int(int2float(m - float2int(1)/2)/1)
      = m - float2int(1)/2

which gives

    m = 1.5 * float2int(1)

I'll save you the troubles of computing `float2int(1)`, it is 0x3f800000, so, to satisfy the boundary condition, the magic constant would come to be `1.5 * 0x3f800000 = 0x5f400000`.

This is very close to the 0x5f3759df, so how do we close the gap? Well, it turns out that if you graph the errors of this plot, you'll notice that the error is always positive. As a result, if you just subtract a little bit off of 0x5f400000, you can actually halve the absolute value of the error by shifting half of the error down into the negative side. Finding the optimal constant is then a simple task of bisecting through viable constants while minimizing the maximum absolute value of the relative error.

This method also generalizes to arbitrary powers. It turns out that for any power, c, you can approximate y^c by

    int2float(0x3f800000 * (1 - C) + C * float2int(y))

And finally, with a bit of analysis, you can also derive analogue laws for exp and logarithms, e.g. in https://github.com/leegao/float-hacks#exp-redux.",2018-08-10 06:31:54

137ithk,Coming up with Dynamic Programming solutions,"The basis of coming up with dynamic programming solutions is to start with a recursive function that represents the recurrence formula for the problem you are solving.

Here's the initial solution for the Coin Change problem:

[Recursive solution for the Coin Change problem.](https://preview.redd.it/z1hi78uv2txa1.png?width=1102&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ebe9bf9d054c5be5ef2597530b0e068ba9ad3b2)

You will soon realize that this function takes too long for some cases because it is calculating the answer for the same input values multiple times.

Then is when you add Memoization:

[Solution using recursion and memoization for solving the Coin Change problem.](https://preview.redd.it/k4vmial23txa1.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=efe84dab68b5de7563e2ab5330a5d3817ef124f1)

 If Memoization still feels like a hack for you, then you can try to rewrite the recursive function as an iterative function. This is often hard to do, but it is a recommended exercise if you want to test your understanding of the problem you are trying to solve.

An example:

I guess I'm just looking for some advice from fellow computer scientists. I have completed my undergraduate degree (4 years) in Computer Science. Although I love my field and was planning to go into web development, many things got in the way of finding a job right after graduation. (Mostly mental and physical health, and working in a part-time job just to save some money)

I'm curious what the best way would be to go about re-learning coding and concepts. I haven't touched anything in maybe under a year. I do not think all hope is lost as I still remember a lot of ideas and I doubt I have forgotten everything, but I do not think I can just jump back into job hunting right away.

Another question is, how would I approach an interviewer later on, if they ask me why I have not been active in coding for a year? I'm hoping to do as many projects as I can before getting an interview, but I worry that they will look at my timeline on my resume and maybe inquire.

ybtv2z,"[ELI5] ""Computer graphics are triangles""","My basic understanding of computer graphics is a bitmap. For things like ASCII characters, there is a 2D array of pixels that can be used to draw a sprite.

However, I recently watched [this video](https://youtu.be/gsZiJeaMO48) on ray tracing. He describes placing a camera/observer and a light source in a three dimensional plane, then drawing a bunch of vectors going away from the light source, some of which eventually bounce around and land on the observer bitmap, making the user's field of view.

I sort of knew this was the case from making [polygon meshes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Dolphin_triangle_mesh.png) from 3D scanning/point maps. The light vectors from the light source bounce off these polygons to render them to the user.

Anyways,

1. In video games, the computer doesn't need to recompute every surface for every frame, it only recomputes for objects that have moved. How does the graphics processor ""know"" what to redraw? Is this held in VRAM or something?

2. When people talk about computer graphics being ""triangles,"" is this what they're talking about? Does this only work for polygonal graphics?

Given that the whole goal is to free up space to send all of this data to RAM, aren't loading screens taking up unnecessary space?

Or [Skyrim](https://youtu.be/voDDEdeW5U0) where you have 3d-rendered models you can scan around?

My guess is that the GPU is idling as there is currently nothing to display or compute to the screen, so some leeway for graphics might be given there. Still, wouldn't you also need to load these loading graphics, physics, and animations into RAM as well as take it out at some point?

115omu4,algorithm for finding shortest non-overlapping paths between multiple sources and destinations,"preface: this is for a factorio mod, not for homework.

####Technical question
I'm pretty sure this is NP-hard, but does anyone have any thoughts on how to find the mutually cheapest path from two (or more) sources to their specific targets - *s^1* to *t^1* and *s^2* to *t^2* (etc up to *n*) where a given node can only be on one path.

I originally was looking at stuff like A*, but now I think that the problem generalizes to the [minimum cost flow problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-cost_flow_problem), with every edge has a capacity of 1 (and varying costs b/c of game details).  I think I can set up the problem by creating one source *s^0* with edges to each _s^i_ and one target *t^0* with edges from each *t^i*, and looking to find a flow of *n* from *s^0* to *t^0*.  Does this make sense?  

Which algorithm would be best for this problem?  I don't really know which algorithm is most efficient for this problem in general (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_simplex_algorithm?), and I know my specific use case would have massively more nodes and edges than in the solution.  Would that mean that a different minimum flow algorithm or pathfinding algorithm is better?

These conveyor belts take up space, and two conveyor belts can't sit in the same spot.  Factorio has undergound belts, that attach to conveyor belts and travel below the ground for up to a certain distance in a straight line.  Underground belts are more expensive (and look less nice), so we try to avoid them when possible (but only if it's not better than normal belts).

Normal belt (S=source, B=belt, U=underground belt start/end, T=target, W=wall or obstruction):

    .SBBBB..    
    .....B..  
    .....B..    
    .....BT.    

Underground belt

    .SBU.WUB..    
    .....WBB.  
    .....WB..    
    ... .WBT.



I think this can be graph G=(V,E) where each node is a coordinate on the graph that doesn't already have a building in it, and each node has edges that can be reached by a single belt or underground belt.  One complication is that an underground belt can't turn on the same tile it comes out - it has to continue forward for at least one tile.  I *think* this could be incorporated into the graph, but I'm not sure how.  

The mod BeltRouter (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BeltRouter) will automatically route conveyor belts for you, using the shortest path.  It even allows you to do multiple belts at once! However, it does these one at a time, so the first path can get in the way of the second path.  I'm looking for ideas on how to solve this.  


Thank you!  Happy to clarify anything, I appreciate any insight into this.

As a side note, does anyone know of an easy way to visualize shortest path algorithms that lets you use a custom algorithm, preferably in Python?",2023-02-18 20:03:57

18z4q8l,A job in CS that involves more coding and solving real-world problems,"Hi, I'm currently a high school student and would like to study CS.

I read that some software engineers don't like coding and therefore are happy when they can move into management. With AI becoming more and more integrated into the development cycle of software and the fact that software engineers these days have a lot more management and client communication to do than actually writing code, designing architecture or creating algorithms.

Since writing code and coming up with new or faster solutions to problems is something that I really enjoy, I worry that by the time I'll be ready to work as a software engineer, the amount of these tasks will have decreased even more. Don't get me wrong, I know that stuff like meetings, presentations, client communication, etc. are necessary and I'm fine with doing these things. However, I still want to actually solve real-world problems. If I wanted to become a manager, do phone calls all day and only use my computer to work with the glorious MS Office Suite, I wouldn't need to study CS... :D

Does anyone of you share my point of view and maybe have some advice on jobs in the CS field that fit my description?",2024-01-05 11:27:03

12o2efh,Is it True that Computers can only work Linearly?,"I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I reckon that computers work in a linear fashion at their core. Although some of the techniques we use might appear non-linear to us humans, computers are built to process instructions one after the other in a sequence, which is essentially just a linear process.

Is it correct to say that computers can only operate linearly? *edit: many redditors suggested that ""sequentially"" is a better word*

Also, I'm interested to hear your thoughts on quantum computing. How does it fit into this discussion? Can quantum computing break the linear nature of computers, or is it still fundamentally a linear process?

# edit:

Thanks for the answers. Most of them suggest parallelism but I guess that is not the answer I am looking for. I am sorry, I realize I am using an unclear language. Parallel execution simply involves multiple linear processes being executed simultaneously, but individual CPU cores still do it in a linear fashion.

To illustrate what I mean, take the non-linear nature of the brain's information processing. Consider the task of recognizing a familiar person. When someone approaches us, our brain processes a *wide range of inputs at once*, such as the person's facial shape, color, and texture, as well as their voice, and even unconscious inputs like scent. Our brain integrates this information at once using a complex interconnectedness of a network, forming a coherent representation of the person and retrieving their name from memory.

A computer would have to read these inputs from different sensors separately and process them sequentially (whether in parallel or not) to deliver the result. Or wouldn't?

13t2ly6,A Visual Introduction to how we represent Graphs in a Computer Program,"Hello there!

Today we will be diving into one of the most common ways of representing data and modeling problems (and solutions) in Computer Science. We will be talking about **Graphs**.

This is the third of a series of posts introducing graph theory in a very visual way.

Now that we know some basic definitions of graph theory, it is time to see how graphs can be represented in a program. We will explore the most common representations and analyze their pros and cons.

**This is a summary version of the weekly edition of the Algorithmically Speaking newsletter. You can read the full article here:**

[Algorithmically Speaking - #5: Representing Graphs](https://albexl.substack.com/p/graphs-representation)

 Let’s begin! 

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

## Edge List

The first representation we will explore today is the **edge list** representation. As its name implies, it consists of a **list** with the **edges** of the graph.

An edge in this list consists of an ordered pair (x, y), representing that there is an edge from node x to node y.

Let’s look at the following graph, where we have numbered the nodes from 1 to 5, and look at the corresponding edge list representation:

https://preview.redd.it/z91ljjiu8c2b1.png?width=3423&format=png&auto=webp&s=758ab0e180d88bfb0ca0497c94fe513bc91973b3

Notice that this graph is **directed**. If the pair (x, y) is present in the list, there is an edge starting in x and ending in y, but the opposite does not hold unless the pair (y, x) also appears in the list.

If the graph is **undirected**, then the edge list representation will contain the ordered pairs (x, y) and (y, x) for every pair of adjacent nodes x and y.

If we would like to represent a **weighted** graph, the most natural way to do it is by extending our representation of an edge to be a triplet instead of a pair.

Let’s say we have edges starting from node x, ending in node y, with a weight of w. One way to represent those edges would be with a triplet of the form (x, y, w).

Let’s add some weights to our previous graph and see what its edge list representation would look like:

https://preview.redd.it/0ou8n7bz8c2b1.png?width=3690&format=png&auto=webp&s=97483bb05e0f23c55b416101c2269806c6ff9830

The edge list representation is particularly useful for algorithms that process the edges of the graphs in some order. We will be exploring some of those algorithms when dealing with the **Minimum Spanning Tree** or the **Dynamic Connectivity** problems.

But this will be in future posts. In the meantime, let’s move on to the next representation.

## Adjacency Matrix

An **adjacency matrix** is a two-dimensional array indicating the edges of the graph. Let’s denote this matrix as G.

Each value G\[x\]\[y\] indicates whether the graph contains an edge from node x to node y. If the edge is included in the graph, then G\[x\]\[y\] = 1, and otherwise G\[x\]\[y\] = 0.

Let’s take a look at our initial graph and its corresponding adjacency matrix:

https://preview.redd.it/ay9r81sh9c2b1.png?width=4350&format=png&auto=webp&s=c10b3c56031f41bc369fd08bc4d9d0b6916be2f0

Being able to read an adjacency matrix can give you insightful information about the graph.

For example, inspecting the previous matrix, we can realize that node number 1 has the most outgoing edges, while node number 5 has the least (actually it doesn’t have any):

https://preview.redd.it/p4kqcagv9c2b1.png?width=4350&format=png&auto=webp&s=c58ef832226a162d01bee305d0939fdc31802674

Also, we can notice how even if it doesn’t have any outgoing edge, node number 5 has the largest number of incoming edges. On the other hand, node number 1 has no incoming edges:

https://preview.redd.it/37sip89pac2b1.png?width=4350&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad3705d146a1a59036b58897f139f72c3932c62e

If the graph is weighted, the adjacency matrix representation can be extended so that the matrix contains the weight of the edge if the edge exists. Otherwise, it will contain the number 0:

https://preview.redd.it/tcehhnvuac2b1.png?width=4350&format=png&auto=webp&s=a33666da827faacc78b53632709ef3c9e8d94921

 ***Note:*** *We are choosing the number* 0 *to represent the absence of an edge because it is convenient in this case. Nevertheless, for solving some graph-related problems, this number can vary. For example,* -1 *or a very big (or small) number can be used instead.*

One of the greatest advantages of the adjacency matrix representation is that we can efficiently verify the existence of an edge. By indexing in a position \[x\]\[y\], we immediately know whether there is an edge or not between nodes x and y.

On the other hand, one of its greatest drawbacks is the fact that it requires O(n\^2) space to represent a graph with n nodes.

Let’s move forward to the last representation we’ll be exploring today!

## Adjacency List

The **adjacency list** representation is the most common way to represent graphs since most of the classic graph algorithms can be implemented very efficiently using this representation.

Every node x will be assigned a list that will contain all the nodes to which there is an edge from x.

Let’s see an example:

https://preview.redd.it/4bu3jcg7bc2b1.png?width=3666&format=png&auto=webp&s=31bc8556a5f0dcc594d6a61aafb3c588ab2a33d1

Notice how in this representation we store the exact neighbors for every node, instead of allocating space for all of the n nodes of the graph, as in the adjacency matrix representation.

Let’s take a look at node number 1 and its neighbors:

https://preview.redd.it/6arasajabc2b1.png?width=3666&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4a27e1f87ff264017755ff6f680dc9f1d0f1b51

We could store ordered pairs instead of single integers to represent weighted graphs. The pairs would be of the form (y, w), where y represents a node and w represents the weight of the edge.

Adding some weights to our previous graph:

https://preview.redd.it/rlsbnlhgbc2b1.png?width=4368&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bfbe5712624fdfeee382f82e247533b717278a1

 And once again, taking node number 1 as an example: 

https://preview.redd.it/jnmmg4iibc2b1.png?width=4368&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f7ab2112cad22d4c1a92c3e33d8857de990062e

An advantage of using adjacency lists is efficiently finding the nodes to which there is an edge from a given node.

Notice that, potentially, a graph can have O(n\^2) edges, which would result in this representation using the same amount of memory that the adjacency matrix representation uses. But this is rarely the case in most practical graph problems.

On the other hand, if we would want to check whether there is an edge between nodes x  
 and y we would have to iterate the adjacency list of x until we find node y or reach the end of the list. So, adjacency matrices take the lead here.

In future posts, we will explore algorithms for traversing graphs, finding shortest paths, or determining valid colorings.

Most of these algorithms behave very differently depending on the type of representation we use for our graphs.

So I always wondered if there could be a scenario where technical debt is never or rarely repaid by the big companies that essentially run our modern society: say if Google, Amazon, Microsoft all became greedier and greedier and kept running their programmers ragged, which I'm sure I happening right now, then the technical debt might never be repaid; as a consequence may all our digital services one day simply not work? If say the technology that ran Amazon's servers or the Google search engine just became so complex and buggy that no one really understood it due to years of poor programming standards could we get a, less extreme example, of what happens in Warhammer 40k with the tech priests not understanding anything their forefathers made?

So maybe for each CPU, we can represent that register with an array[] holding 8 bits or 32 bits

How exactly would this operation differ based on the CPU ? How would the size of the array or register affect my computation and execution time? Does a 32bit CPU simply have the capability to handle more instructions or is it more so able to process more data per clock cycle?  Is this the reason why a 6502 cpu has a much smaller instruction set compared to an 8086?  Is it able to load or fetch more data from RAM per cycle?


Wouldn’t it not make a difference if the instruction/operation was simple and could be represented in either 8 bits or 32 bits?  With that said wouldn’t a larger bit width register size lead to increased fetch decode and execution time for a CPU if it has a bunch of empty/non useful data it still needs to loop through?

145hbhu,I don't understand the Halting Problem,"The key to the solution, from what I've got so far, is imagining a machine that can detect whether or not another machine halts. We'll call that machine H, that takes as input a machine Q

Then, with some simple logic, we can make a machine that halts when H detects Q doesn't halt, and that doesn't halt when it detects Q halts. That'd be Hn

So, with this machine Hn, the paradox would emerge by doing Hn(Hn), since now, if it were to halt, it shouldn't halt, but if it doesn't halt, it should halt. Paradox.

But, one key thing I don't get: Doesn't the internal Hn also need an input? And wouldn't all of the subsequent machines need an input as well, until we reach a static program?

So instead of being Hn(Hn), shouldn't the paradox only arrive if you do Hn(Hn(Hn(...))) forever? and at that point the paradox isn't thanks to the algorithm, but rather because it's a [supertask](https://youtu.be/ffUnNaQTfZE).

&#x200B;

The same could be said if you build a machine that takes another machine (one that halts) as an input outputs 0 when the original outputs 1, and outputs 1 when the original outputs 0, let's call that one N

N(N) should also be a paradox, no? After all, if N outputs 0, it should output 1, but if it were to output 1, it should output 0!

18yfax0,Beauty of Software Engineering," 

This might not be the right place for this but I'll share anyway. I feel as though a lot of us who got into computer science and more specifically software engineering went into it from a place of love and passion.

I'm not sure where along those lines for me at least, it became about making more money and working less. I started hyper-fixating on total compensation and work life balance, which I think are completely valid reasons. The issue here was, I started losing passion for Software. It started becoming more and more of a chore and less and less of a hobby. What started as an escape for an 11 year old from the reality of life. A world where he has full autonomy and complete creative freedom. Has now become a 25 years olds chore, being micromanaged by people who've haven't touched a single line of code in their life.

I'm slowly beginning to realize the importance of actually enjoying your work. Focusing on fulfilment and value instead of compensation and stock options. I think that's a lot more powerful and a better way to progress in your career. I want to go back to building cool things and making people smile.

119okgp,confused around godel numbers.,"If every possible algorithm has a unique godel number and a godel number can be written as a single integer, wouldn't this imply the number of possible algorithms is less than or equal to the number of integers? Therefore there would be at most a countably infinite number of algorithms?
However, consider the algorithms that map any single input to a single number f1) =1, f(2)=1 etc. Can't we create an uncountably infinite number of these algorithms? (As in because there are uncountably infinite real numbers, doesn't this imply there are uncountably infinite functions with a different return value?)
Initially I thought this was fine because there is a hard bit limit on what numbers can be calculated, like you can't write pi in finite time but what if we return the function that calculates pi instead of pi, that should still be a function and thus an algorithm with a godel number.
Doesn't this imply there are more functions than godel numbers?",2023-02-23 04:36:59

13jaas7,Programming without a stack trace: When abstractions become illusions,"This [insightful article](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/stacktrace-abstraction/) by [Gregor Hohpe](https://linkedin.com/in/ghohpe) covers:

* Evolution of programming abstractions.
* Challenges of cloud abstractions.
* Importance of tools like stack traces for debugging, especially in distributed systems.

Gregor emphasizes that effective cloud abstractions are crucial but tricky to get right. He points out that debugging at the abstraction level can be complex and underscores the value of good error messages and observability. 

The part about the ""unhappy path"" particularly resonated with me: 

>The unhappy path is where many abstractions struggle. Software that makes building small systems easy but struggles with real-world development scenarios like debugging or automated testing is an unwelcome version of “demoware” - it demos well, but doesn’t actually work in the real world. And there’s no unlock code. ... I propose the following test for vendors demoing higher-level development systems:  
>  
>1. Ask them to enter a typo into one of the fields where the developer is expected to enter some logic.  
>  
>2. Ask them to leave the room for two minutes while we change a few random elements of their demo configuration. Upon return, they would have to debug and figure out what was changed.  
>  
>Needless to say, no vendor ever picked the challenge.

# Why it interests me

I'm one of the creators of [Winglang](https://github.com/winglang/wing), an open-source programming language for the cloud that allows developers to work at a higher level of abstraction. 

We set a goal for ourselves to provide good debugging experience that will allow developers to debug cloud applications in the context of the logical structure of the apps.

After reading this article I think we can rephrase the goal as being able to easily pass Gregor's vendor test from above :)",2023-05-16 16:41:19
19bc3vt,How and where does a binary number get converted to decimal representation?,"I learned how computers work back in the '80s, which revolved around the 6502. I mostly worked on basic software since but recently I got interested again at low level programming. I am happy to see that basically everything still works the same only having added complexity to it. But there is a question that never occurred to me in the past and I can't get a clear answer on, so I hope someone here can answer it?  


I know that binary data that represents an alphanumeric character gets converted using a Unicode table (I am assuming these days it is done via a font-file as opposed to the ASCII character ROMs of old?) This file will probably have some code to instruct the video driver to draw the corresponding glyph.  
But how does a computer convert a binary number to a decimal representation? There is no direct relationship between e.g. 6489 and the 6, 4 and 8 glyphs (there is arguably for the 9). So how and where does the conversion from 6000 to 6, from 400 to 4 and from 80 to 8 take place? I assumed the CPU might have a built in converter (BCD perhaps or some algorithm?) but perhaps this is the OS job?  I can find no info on this.

11371uf,Should all high-level languages transpile to a central language?,"A *source-to-source compiler*, *transcompiler*, or *transpiler* translates programs written in one programming language to another. For example, a Java-to-C++ transpiler would take Java code and convert it into equivalent C++ code. Transpilation may become useful to eliminate the repetition of implementing multiple algorithms across multiple languages.

If a transpiler were created for every pair of languages, we would need n(n - 1) transpilers (rough sketch):

            A
          // \\
        /  | |  \
       B--/---\--C
       \ |\ _ /| /
        \//   \\/
         D-----E

It may be simpler to have a central language that all high-level languages transpile to and from:

            A
            |   
            |     
       B----X----C
           / \     
          /   \  
         D     E

Is this a viable idea?

One idea that occurred to me is that the central language X should have a unique property that makes it the ideal transpilation hub point. Not assembly or machine language, since they are specific to a computer and not standardized across all platforms and languages. Maybe a perfectly abstract, minimally syntactical language such as Lisp.",2023-02-15 20:01:26

1an2ssn,"Strictly speaking, what is an object in programming?","A friend of mine and I disagree over what an object actually is in object-oriented programming. I say it's a specialized piece of data saved to the memory that the program allocates to not be overwritten, but my friend says it's a name like ""xPosition"" or ""stringToInt""

In object-oriented programming languages, pretty much everything is an object. Functions, integers, strings, lists, etc. are all object types. My experience with them is in Python.

If I know the basics correctly, an object is created when a line of code with a new literal is run. So whether I have a variable to catch it, writing `5` on its own will find an open spot on the memory and save the value 5 in however many bytes it needs. Garbage collection will free this memory or maybe prevent it from being saved since there is no reference to it, but the idea is there.

When I say `a = 5`, a reference 'a' is added to a variable table on the memory. When `a` is called, Python searches that variable table for a key called 'a' and if it exists, fetches the value associated with it. That table also stores the value's type, so that '5', stored as 00000101 in one byte, can be interpreted as the integer 5 as opposed to the ascii character associated with 00000101.

So in this situation, with names and variables and data, would you say the actual 'object' itself is the data stored on the memory? Or would you say it's the entry on the table of names? Or is it something else?",2024-02-10 00:08:53

1462gue,Best Practices using LaTeX.,"I have just finished my first seventy page thesis in LaTeX and would like to share my tips with you on your way and would also like to hear your tips for using TeX here below the post.

I started TeX locally on my computer with TeXShop. Unfortunately, my computer broke down while I was working. I could only restore parts of my work through my backups. Partly I wanted to work on other computers. For me personally, Overleaf ([https://www.overleaf.com/](https://www.overleaf.com/)) has turned out to be a very good companion as an editor in the browser. Overleaf also gave very good formatting tips during the work with regard to creating tables, missing parameters using BiBTeX and much more.

I used Zotero ([https://www.zotero.org/](https://www.zotero.org/)) as library management software. In particular, I quickly lost track of what was relevant to my work and where. With the browser add-on, I was able to save the sources relatively quickly and create my bibliography in BiBTeX format.

Make backups of your interim work at any time. Even if Overleaf saves your results online, you should create backups that contain the entire source code. The Pro version even offers Git integration.

To create notes for my work in the meantime I can strongly recommend the Todo package (to be imported with \\usepackage{todonotes}). Using the command \\todo{your note} you can then mark corresponding paragraphs at the right place.

Since LaTeX sometimes places graphics elsewhere, I can also recommend the package placins. With its help you can limit the placement to certain sections. The package can be imported using (\\usepackage\[section\]{placeins}) with the parameter section for section-limiting.

My thesis also has programming code in the appendix. To format it code-wise I highly recommend the package listings (to be imported using \\usepackage{listings}) 

These were my biggest helpers, I hope I can be of some help to one or the other of you. If you are also currently working on a TeX project. Otherwise, I am very curious about your tips.

Basically, you have 2 photons that have the number encoded in each one. You have them interfere, then decode it. If destructive interference, it would subtract the number from it (a 10 would be twoice as much as a 5, so subtracting them would make a 5). Do the opposite, and you get a higher energy wave from those 2 merging (constructive interference), making a 15!

Could such a system work for computations? (I doubt it would be good on modern day computers, but on massive computers that are big enough that the speed difference between electrons and photons is noticible, a system of mirrors and interference could allow calculations to occur at light speed).

So, could addition and subtraction be done that way? If so, could multiplication and division be done *directly*, or would you just have to send a signal saying ""continue doing this ""x"" times"". What about exponents?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello there!

After three weeks of learning the basics of graphs, I think it is time to show you examples of how we can translate real-life problems to the graph theory domain

This will be the last of a series of posts introducing the basic concepts of graph theory before we dive into topics such as traversals, and finding cycles, among others.

Here’s a summary of what we have covered in the previous editions:

1. Introduction to the concepts of [nodes, edges, and connectivity](https://albexl.substack.com/p/introduction-to-graph-theory).
2. Defining what are [neighbors, degrees, and colorings](https://albexl.substack.com/p/an-introduction-to-graphs-ii) in graphs.
3. How to [represent graphs](https://albexl.substack.com/p/graphs-representation) in a computer program.

Today, we will learn about practical examples of how to use graphs in real life. For that, we are going to see examples of “games” that are played on boards. They might seem unrelated to graphs, but the truth is that they are more closely related than you might think.

At the end of the post, you will find some algorithmic challenges so you can try and apply some of the topics that I will explain today. Feel free to skip to that part if you think you already have the necessary skills to solve them.

Let’s begin!

## An Initial Problem

Let’s dive in straight to the matter. Take a look at the following problem and think about how you would approach it:

https://preview.redd.it/krf1rmu0nr3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6890cc02f7ecafa3327f392163608c2660c39d1

By simple inspection, we can notice that there are three “sets“ of floor tiles that can be identified as “rooms“. These are all the rooms highlighted and numbered:

Intuitively, we identify these “connected“ regions and we sort them out as “rooms” because it just makes sense in our heads.

But what if this was the input to a program? How could we design an algorithm that a computer will execute to find the number of “rooms” in any map of a house that uses this representation?

Well, unfortunately, before thinking about designing algorithms we have to think about modeling this problem in terms that a computer can understand. And one possibility, as you might have suspected already, is doing so by using graphs.

## Representing Boards as Graphs

Let’s talk about a classical way of representing boards using graphs. Take a look at the following problem and try to think of a solution.

This time go a bit further and try to think of a general solution, instead of just solving this particular instance. It’s ok if you can’t, I will show you how to do it soon.

https://preview.redd.it/f04jvvg6nr3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4eb98877382658edbc5f182e3f522126ce6c5c3

Once again, our brains might identify that there are only two paths between the highlighted squares, and we can easily spot which one is the shortest: 

https://preview.redd.it/j8b1n009nr3b1.png?width=1555&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b62fe71c2b3091ed3735d24b3d9cbf575d29002

The path shown on the left takes 9 steps while the one on the right takes 11 steps.

But, who defined what a path is in this problem? Who defined which tiles we can move to when standing on a specific tile?

Our brains (or at least mine) intuitively assumed that the possible moves from a given position were the following:

https://preview.redd.it/v7qf7k0bnr3b1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=204d5817b885b926f020b7479fdc84fef4cc64e5

So, as long as we are not trying to go to a “wall” tile, we can move to the left, right, up, or down.

Let’s take this set of movements and the “floor“ tiles and see how they relate to graphs. Assuming that the start and end tiles are also floor tiles, we can number every floor tile arbitrarily like this:

https://preview.redd.it/jwkf1lohnr3b1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1e17e2971c1c99f9a658111f0a9646be0a27ade

We have 14 “floor” tiles, which can be represented as 14 nodes of a graph. So, what about the edges?

Let’s add an edge between two pairs of nodes if it exists a valid movement between their corresponding tiles on the map. For example, we can add edges between nodes 1 and 2, and also between nodes 13 and 14.

That being said, our problem can be reduced to finding the path with the minimum length between two nodes in an undirected graph.

This is the graph that results from taking every floor tile as a node and adding edges according to the valid moves that we defined:

https://preview.redd.it/u94iiezjnr3b1.png?width=2195&format=png&auto=webp&s=33388b27b52c9b19d444a51fd51b264f9248d7fa

The problem of finding a path with the minimum length between two nodes is a standard problem in the graph theory domain, and we will learn how to solve it in future posts of this series.

For the moment, let’s go back to our initial problem and try to model it using graphs applying what we learned from this example.

## Counting the Rooms

Let’s recall the problem we saw at the beginning of this post:

https://preview.redd.it/q63774ymnr3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=924e910b5767e9b60a7746efb2a798491bb6c585

Let’s number every floor tile, and assume that we have the same possible moves that we described above. That is, from a given tile we can move to the tiles at its right, left, top, and bottom as long as they are not “wall“ tiles.

A possible numbering could be the following:

https://preview.redd.it/bgtr6e0pnr3b1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d451e28cf81d8ec82a07fcf60ea7ac9bd4fcfda

 Translating this map to a graph the same way we did before, we get the following: 

https://preview.redd.it/bz9ymsjqnr3b1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=0311f27afc7d52f5a7f3cfde5c5a36d250c30b2c

And if we were to solve the problem of counting the number of rooms in a graph, we could rephrase that as counting the number of its [connected components](https://albexl.substack.com/p/introduction-to-graph-theory).

See all the “rooms“ taken to the domain of connected components below:

https://preview.redd.it/2xc3ctrtnr3b1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=305209b6f203bc9cf9921b2e15698aa1e05c736c

As you also might suspect, the problem of finding the connected components in an undirected graph is also a standard problem that can be solved by using various graph algorithms.

We will be covering those algorithms and more in future editions of Algorithmically Speaking.

In the meantime, it’s time to try what you’ve learned!

## Test Your Skills

I have seen a variety of challenges and puzzles on boards that I would like to share some of them with you today.

I would suggest that you try to focus first on solving them by any means possible and then try to think about how to model this problem using a bit of graph theory.

As I [promised before](https://albexl.substack.com/p/one-month-of-algorithmic-posts), no more plain-text statements. Here we go:

**Problem #1:**

https://preview.redd.it/xgj16v8znr3b1.png?width=1533&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e2c4b2ada71956c934bff787cdc79f71f0f93a3

 **Problem #2:**

https://preview.redd.it/za6no143or3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed8e954472dbe4201880e15f851e254ded26fc87

## Conclusions

I hope I was able to keep igniting your passion for graph theory by showing you some basic guidelines on how to model board problems using graphs.

This approach is used in numerous real-life applications (at the top of my mind I can think of numerous examples related to the gaming industry).

Also, I recently stumbled upon this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMQbHMgK2rw&t=795s) where I found out about a competition that has been going on for more than 50 years and has a lot to do with boards, mazes, and of course, graphs.

Some takeaways:

* Board problems can usually be modeled as graphs by taking some set of tiles as the nodes and the possible moves between the tiles as the edges.
* Usually, board games involve tasks such as counting regions, or finding paths which are usually standard problems of the graph theory domain.
* The chessboard is a [bipartite graph](https://albexl.substack.com/p/an-introduction-to-graphs-ii). Do you see it now?

I wish you good luck when solving this week’s challenges. Don’t forget to share your progress with the community!

If you think this post can be helpful for someone, share it with them. Nothing will make me happier!

See you next week!",2023-06-03 09:01:03
18uyefo,Tips on getting better at coding interviews,"So, this might be a little winded, but I graduated with a degree in CS about a year or so ago. I currently have a job in the industry, it's not generally a software engineering job, but I want to get one.

I understand things from a high level pretty damn well - whether it's architecture, Big O, Time and Space complexity, when to do tradeoffs with specific knowledge, such as hardware and how programming languages may affect things, network protocols etc., but I'm HORRIBLE at coding interviews. 

For the most part, I can get to the point where I speak at a high level about how to solve a problem by using DSA (sometimes I'm wrong), what coding language to use, and how I would solve it, but when it comes to actually coding it out I'm just...bad. 

That being said, I've been coding for about 6-8 years now, either as a hobby and have created a multitude of projects, but I don't really know how I can start getting better at those Leetcode things that they use to gauge how 'good' you're going to be at your job. 

Does anyone have any tips on how they got good at this stuff? I'm trying it out in Python so that I focus less on the syntax and more on the actual code, but anything is helpful at this point. I really want to get a software engineering job by the end of 2024 as a goal, and I want to give myself the year to really buckle down and train my brain to do well on these interviews.",2023-12-31 03:40:53

1932o2t,Mathematical thinking and one's intellectual ceiling,"I was never able to get a proper education in Mathematics in my earlier days. Hence when I started my studies in Computer Science, I was amazed at how & why even simple things worked. It also took me a long time to understand things.

Much of it eventually made sense. By that I mean I could see how brilliant minds had come up with these theories and conclusions. Like understanding the workings of a magic trick after its revelation. This went on for many algorithms including recursive behavior and some divide and conquer methods including merge sort.

These algorithms were brilliant and completely beyond something I would ever be able to come up with, but they _made sense_ after I read and understood the inner workings and machanisms. Sometimes, it became really difficult to follow, like during modular arithmetic - but ultimately, it made some _intuitive_ sense.

I would work through algorithms by first reading a summary and then trying for weeks to solve it. Upon solving them I would check and see if I was somewhat close to correct. This would some how '_prove to myself_' that I was good enough.

However, upon coming across the algorithm of quick sort, I was completely taken aback. I had never come across such an _unnatural_ and _unintuitive_ way of thinking. Sure, I can tell you how it works, but I would not be able to even imagine or approach a solution in such a manner. Even after coming across advanced algorithms like those of AES Galois Counter Mode, Aho-Corasick, etc, which were well beyond me, I could not shake off quick sort (Hoare's partition, not Lomuto). It is still an algorithm I could spew out, but _don't really get how someone could think up_. I went on many forums, but no one really understood what I was trying to say. They would say, ""Read it, and memorize it"".

Perhaps this could be due to the fact that this way of thinking is _very_ natural for trained mathematicians who had a good base since childhood. Even Sir Tony Hoare did not publish the algorithm at first due to him thinking it as being _too simplistic_. I even asked a mathematician, ""How long would it take you to figure something like this out?"" and they replied, ""This is pretty simple once you've learned about something known as 'invariants'"".

At this point, I am simply wondering, is it really that simple a concept, and if it is, what mathematical education would give me such skill to see these as simple? And does finding an algorithm such as this difficult to imagine mean I have reached my ceiling of capability? Having a learning disability all my life made me work really hard trying to be as capable as a normal person. I never seem to get the satisfaction of being '_good enough_'.",2024-01-10 07:27:55

I am looking for some help in optimizing a cubic (and polynomial in general) function estimator I have written. I am currently using this to help simulate properties of biomolecules in solution that involves studying their formation of reversible n-mers (dimers, trimers, tetramers etc.) in various solutions. 

It is matching very well with experimental results and literature predictions, but I was hoping to optimize this function. You need to solve an n-order polynomial during the process where n is associated with the n-mer you are simulating (quadratic for a dimer, cubic for a trimer, so on and so forth). It is easy to solve the quadratic but a bit tricky for the higher order polynomials. 

Luckily, I only need positive real solutions to the equation, so I have used the estimator written below in VBA with good success. I would just like some critiques in making it more efficient (demanding higher accuracy extends the loop, which can be problematic).

1acls7q,Why don't CPUs expose all physical registers in their instruction sets?,"I have heard that high performance CPUs have more registers or register files than their instruction sets would suggest. They perform [register renaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_renaming) to eliminate false dependencies.

However, because the instruction set only allows access to a subset--for example, x86-64 has 16 general-purpose registers--compilers already have to use complex register allocation algorithms to get the fastest assembly code. Already, the compiler has to convert the code into [Static Single Assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form) (SSA) form, renaming variable whenever they're modified, and then the values of those variables map to 16 general purpose registers.

But if at runtime, the CPU is already renaming registers, which seems like a form of register allocation to me, I don't understand why the instruction set limits the programmer/compiler from making use of this information so more register allocation can be done at compile time, making the CPU more efficient.

Alternatively, if the answer is that ""runtime register renaming produces better results than 100% compile time register allocation"", and that compilers just aren't as good, then why should registers be exposed at all? Why not have the assembly be something like SSA form, and let the CPU decide which register to use, and let it spill to memory only when it needs to?

I can think of a couple potential reasons, but they're just guesses of mine.

One reason may be backwards compatibility. Intel and AMD want x86-64 CPUs to run 32-bit x86 code, which was also a limited register architecture. This I can understand.

Another reason may be so that processors suited for high performance can run the same code as processors optimized for low power usage, which might not do any register renaming. But that would leave me wondering why there aren't exclusively high-performance supercomputer instruction sets that do have hundreds of physical registers exposed.

My final hypothesis is that it could be just to save space. If you exposed 200 registers, you would need 8 bits to specify one particular register. Assuming 3 operand opcodes, that would mean 24 bits are taken up by register operands. RISC architectures tend to have uniform 32-bit instructions, so that would leave only 8 bits to specify both the operation and the addressing mode. Otherwise, they'd need larger opcodes, which would take up more memory, and because memory latency is often a bottleneck in high-performance computers, it's worth introducing complexity in the CPU hardware to do runtime register renaming instead of just programming all registers directly, simply to reduce fetches from memory.

But in the end, I don't actually know. Is there anyone with expertise about that does?",2024-01-27 21:42:16

Take a look at the previous posts of this series if you think you need some more background before diving into the content that will be exposed in this article:

1. [Algorithmically Speaking - #3: Nodes, Edges, and Connectivity](https://albexl.substack.com/p/introduction-to-graph-theory)

**This is a summary version of the weekly edition of the Algorithmically Speaking newsletter. You can read the full article here:**

[Algorithmically Speaking - #4: Neighbors, Degrees, and Colorings](https://albexl.substack.com/p/an-introduction-to-graphs-ii)

Let’s begin!

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Neighbors and Degrees

Two nodes are **neighbors** or **adjacent** if there is an edge between them. The **degree** of a node is the number of its neighbors.

In the following graph, we have highlighted a node (colored in green), its neighbors (colored in red), and the edges between them (colored in blue):

https://preview.redd.it/jvl23n8vey0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=18708ac8986ca1fd7d6ef1ba33b192216fcb8725

 We can see that the green node has three incident edges and three neighbors, and therefore, it has a degree equal to 3.

In the next image, we can see the degree of every node:

https://preview.redd.it/0t39le8yey0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=f16cea127a7992d600b19efa87996748e30c5d73

Something to notice is the fact that the sum of degrees in a graph is always 2m, where m is the number of edges. This happens because each edge increases the degree of exactly two nodes by one. So, the sum of the degrees is always even.

A graph is **regular** if the degree of every node is a constant d. A graph is **complete** if the degree of every node is n−1, where n is the number of nodes in the graph. That is, the graph contains all possible edges between the nodes. By definition, a complete graph is a regular graph.

Here’s an example of a regular graph that is not complete. Notice how the degree of every node is 2:

https://preview.redd.it/bwfrwpd4fy0b1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=530ddf6f453e469d1c48e9b5cab34dcccc6acf18

And this is an example of a complete graph. Notice how the degree of every node is 3 and there are 4 nodes: 

https://preview.redd.it/ba443hp6fy0b1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=613e6cfc34180beffb17c90f123bb955b08a7c00

When we are referring to directed graphs, we define the **indegree** of a node as the number of edges that end at the node, and the **outdegree** of a node as the number of edges that start at the node.

Here’s an example highlighting a node with an indegree equal to 2 and an outdegree equal to 1:

https://preview.redd.it/zsztfb9bfy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=f79bda1967ee721c48abb24d957b0a4214517aca

And these are the values of indegree/outdegree for every node. Notice how some nodes can have indegree or outdegree equal to 0:

https://preview.redd.it/gehnxdeefy0b1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=862850d6cdae875c579179d484463b13dc0005d6

## Colorings

In a **coloring** of a graph, each node is assigned a color so that no adjacent nodes have the same color.

A graph is called **bipartite** if it is possible to find a coloring of its nodes using two colors. It can be proven that a graph is bipartite exactly when it does not contain a cycle with an odd number of edges.

For example, the following graph is bipartite:

https://preview.redd.it/u3ff564kiy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2fc3727103e4960f4f12348df9cdd73905c0ce7

 We can claim that it is bipartite because we can find a coloring of the graph using only two colors:

https://preview.redd.it/5q6tlbamiy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=a94bc6fb6e332cbf339c94e1718aab36831641f5

And here’s a more intuitive way to visualize bipartite graphs. The previous and the following graphs are the same: 

https://preview.redd.it/323j7qmoiy0b1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5d2fda73372482f91636d8ed28b4511c72800c8

With this representation, it becomes visually more clear that the nodes can be split into two sets, and that every edge in the graph connects nodes from different sets.

Now, let’s take a look at the following graph:

https://preview.redd.it/zw1ejb3riy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b2327d0cc3a220489b0b45add7e217cf5cf5a08

No matter how hard you try, you won’t be able to find a coloring of this graph using only two colors. Remember earlier, when we said that cycles of odd length and bipartiteness are related?

Inspecting the graph closely, we can notice that it contains a cycle of length 3. It won’t be possible to color this cycle (or the entire graph) using only two colors:

https://preview.redd.it/32fw886tiy0b1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f2155022d4c1eb696d067ab4abba305c15283a

In future posts, we will explore algorithms to determine if a graph is bipartite or not. Also, we will dig deeper into how the degrees of nodes play an important role in finding topological orderings in directed graphs.",2023-05-20 09:41:51

Not all numbers are right on here, and Im too lazy to fix it, so if you find the wrong ones, please let me know and I'll fix, or fix it yourself and reply with the fixed file, please.

One is how to build an instruction. The other one is how a simple processor processes instructions. The last one is a disassembler structure.

If you find any of these useful or interesting, leave a comment. I'm trying to craft diagrams that make complex issues simple. Cheers!

When looking at graphs of log(n)^2 and log(n)^3 compared to √n, we can see that for very big values, √n is bigger, meaning for big O that log(n)^3 < √n.

12wo59f,AI Predictions for CPU Scheduling?,"Hi everyone!

I am currently doing my Bachelor's in CS and I'm looking at OS right now. I had a thought to share and hopefully get some answers from people more experienced than me in this sub.

I was looking at CPU schedulers and how the Shortest Job First policy is the provably best policy to implement when minimizing average waiting time, but how this is limited by the fact that predicting the amount of CPU time a process has left is essentially impossible. This concept of predicting future performance is also already employed in Multilevel Feedback Queues from what I understand.

I am sure someone has thought of this before, but would it be possible to use a machine-learning model to try to better predict the time that commonly executed processes take?

For example, you can have a model continually running as part of the OS which learns the user's habits and what programs they are likey to use at any given time, or you could have it learn which programs are used and how long they usually take. We could then use these predictions in creating a better scheduling policy.

I imagine the overhead for doing this right now is absolutely too large for a modern OS, but could something like this be feasable in the future? Have people already thought to do this?

197gsj6,Checking Number Is Power Of 2,"There was an LC question asking to identify if a number is a power of 2.  At first I thought to just repeatedly multiply but then saw others had identified a bitwise check as the more efficient answer.

I recognized at first that the bitwise check would be more efficient, but I wanted to know if theoretically the two approaches would have the same time complexity.  People acted like this question of which “theoretically” was better was totally stupid and said computers do bitwise operations in O(1).  Someone even said my question was stupid (after I tried to explain “theoretically” in terms of the number of operations a Turing machine would need in the worst case) and that I had no understanding of time complexity.  Left a very bad taste in my mouth.

Am I totally off here?

Thinking about it a bit more, I’ve reasoned as follows:

What computers do is irrelevant for the theoretical question.  However, if you fix the input size as in a computer to 32 or 64 bit integers, then I think the complexity for both repeated multiplication and bitwise checks should be O(1), though the latter will have a much better constant.

If you don’t fix the input size, then actually the bitwise should be more efficient theoretically, because it is just O(b) where b is the number of bits in the integer, whereas multiplication would be something like O(b^3) — you have to go from 1 bit up to the number of bits and each multiplication should be O(b^2).

So that answers my question I think.  Even theoretically it is much less efficient check by repeated multiplication.

It just really rankled me because I don’t think it was a stupid question — and though there are aspects of time complexity that I don’t understand, I think I have a basic grasp of the concept (will admit framing in terms of Turing machines probably isn’t relevant — a human would need the same number of ops too).",2024-01-15 19:03:45

19ddisz,A new form of markdown.,"Hi,

This is not an advertisement, but just a showcase of something I've been working on for a while. I read the guidelines, but do not know what an *IAmA* post is. But here goes, and I appreciate you taking the time to read this.

I am a rather disorganized person and have some form of learning disability in processing information 'normally'.

I found regular markdown and other forms of markdown languages to be rather limited *for my use case* so I developed a simple syntax of sorts to help me organize data in a form that I found to be easily digestible/ recognizable into meaningful partitions. I call it the A1V markdown language and a sample of it is presented in the image below.

Apart from regular markdown features like tables and text formatting, it allows for text coloring and highlighting in any 6 digit hex color code, presents a line-numbered code section to manage snippets (no code highlighting as of yet), images to be inserted in base64 string form, superscript, subscript and integral format as well.  It has sections that are blurred but made visible on hover, sections tagges as warning, note sections, etc. as well. The syntax makes use of programming chars used most often so it is very easy to get up and running with (at least for programmers). i'm working on making it useful for the wider community with support for histograms, formulas, and graphs and charts and mathematical notation (this obviously, would pale in comparison to great works like TeX). Due to HTM5 being prevalen and fairly mature, we can make use of these technologies to make organization of information more palatable to the eyes.

It is a very miniscule and humble undertaking but I'm satisfied with it so far. It helps me manage my info and snippets. I will release a public version soon and I wish to incorporate suggestions and features from my fellow people. Please share your thoughts.

I'm currently a college student and I've been wondering about the effectiveness of college education in preparing students for their future careers. Specifically, I'm curious about whether college prepares students to become researchers or software engineers (or any industry role), and whether the focus on academia is hindering their preparation for industry jobs.

It's no secret that college places a heavy emphasis on academia, with many courses and majors geared towards preparing students for a career in research. However, the reality is that a very small percentage of students actually end up in academia. So, my question is, does college adequately prepare students for industry jobs in software engineering?

The reason why I would have chosen ""Algorithm B"" is growing faster"" is because ""Algorithm B"" refers to the denominator.

11bq77f,What would it entail to build a Large Language Model (LLM) that can turn Wikipedia into structured data?,"_Sidenote: I know about the WikiData project :) which as far as I know is just making input be structured by humans._

I am wondering [where to find implementation details for how a large language model (LLM) works?](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/11bpwg8/where_to_find_implementation_details_for_how_a/) and now am curious having read about the potential, if it would be possible to build a LLM that can convert Wikipedia itself into structured data. What would that take at a medium-high level? What kind of code would you have to write? I have no sense of this currently (I am a Node.js/TypeScript developer for many years). So hoping for a mental boost to start thinking about how one could implement various products using LLMs.

At my extremely minimal knowledge, you would do whatever magic (which I'm currently wondering about in that question) to code an understanding of natural language generally, then get the code to read through Wikipedia (and perhaps do what [LLaMA](https://research.facebook.com/publications/llama-open-and-efficient-foundation-language-models/) did and read CommonCrawl and such as well, for better language learning). Then now that it has all the data stored somehow in memory, spit it out in JSON.

Large gaps in that understanding:

1. How the LLM is constructed (the code written by the human trainer).
2. How to take the nebulous neural network numerical values and pick out the schemas from the model, then pick out the data for those schemas.

Those two things are black boxes to me, hoping for a little insight how it might work. Would be really cool to try something like this.",2023-02-25 17:18:01

1agachg,Efficient sorting when comparison is the bottleneck,"I'm writing a commandline application for sorting files based on subjective, user defined criteria. So for example, let's say the user wants to sort cat pictures by cuteness. My application would repeatedly present two cat pictures to the user, and ask them to select the cuter one. This would be fed into a comparison based sort behind the scenes, resulting in a list of cat pictures sorted by cuteness

In this design, the comparison would be the most time consuming part of the sort, by far, so I need to choose an algorithm that minimizes the number of unique comparisons. I say unique because I could apply a simple dynamic programming trick and keep a map of comparison inputs to results, so that if the same comparison comes up multiple times, I can simply look up the old result instead of asking the user to compare the same pictures again

I've also thought about extending this to comparisons that are ""indirectly"" computable based on previous comparison results. So if I'm presented with two cat pictures `a` and `c` that I haven't compared before, but I have determined that picture `c` is cuter than some other picture `b`, and I've also determined that picture `b` is cuter than picture `a`, I can deduce that `c` is cuter than `a`, and avoid asking the user to compare them. I could probably also extend this recursively, chaining indirect comparisons in order to find redundant computations.

So my question is, which sorting algorithm should I use? Does my idea of finding redundant computations by comparing existing comparison results affect which algorithm would be optimal?

Thanks in advance",2024-02-01 12:55:16

Today we will be diving into one of the most common ways of representing data and modeling problems (and solutions) in Computer Science. We will be talking about **Graphs**.

This is the third of a series of posts introducing graph theory in a very visual way.

Now that we know some basic definitions of graph theory, it is time to see how graphs can be represented in a program. We will explore the most common representations and analyze their pros and cons.

At the end of the post, you will find some algorithmic challenges so you can try and apply some of the topics that I will explain today. Feel free to skip to that part if you think you already have the necessary skills to solve them.

124xb6n,Dynamic Programming - Recursion Trees to DP Tables,"So I'm learning dynamic programming and I've found recursion trees to be intuitive in encoding decisions. For example, in the problem Target Sum, where you can choose to either subtract or add the number that you're currently on, a recursion tree is an elegant way to visualize that decision at every element in the array.


However, with regard to this problem, I'm unable to see how a dp table can encode these decisions. With a recursion tree, each decision is an edge resulting in a new node. It seems to me that this Target Sum problem would require (unless there's a trick I'm unaware of to collapse these dimensions), a 2D dp table because there's a decision you're going to make (adding or subtracting the element).


Here's the problem I'm currently looking at: https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/


So I have two questions:

1. Is there a general way to relate these recursion trees to dp tables?
2: How are decisions captured in dp tables, for example, how would a 2D dp table for Target Sum encode the decision for subtracting or adding a number.

1304vst,C Memory Safety And It's Consequences In Safety-Critical Applications,"Hi all!  


I'm a first year engineering student and was doing some digging about C out of my own interest. I saw a lot of mention about C being an unsafe language due to the potential to exploit memory vulnerabilities. From what I understand, you could do a lot of different things to compromise systems by exploiting Buffer Overflows/Stack smashing, or abusing mistakes such as Use-After-Free pointers or Dangling pointers, or taking control of uninitialized pointers to run code of an attacker's choice.

Now, C is a low level language used a lot on different embedded systems because of it's great low-level control and speed. It's also heavily used in safety-critical applications such as Flight Control Systems, Life Support Units, Autonomous Driving Systems, and things of this nature which led to my questions:  


1) How do developers working on safety-critical applications ensure their systems are not vulnerable to memory-related exploits?  
2) What strategies and practices can developers follow to write safe and secure C code for these critical applications?  
3) Despite the existence of memory-safe languages like Rust, why has C remained the preferred choice for a lot of these safety-critical applications over 50 years since its creation?

I'm looking forward to your insights on this topic. Thank you!",2023-04-27 00:43:10

So currently for myself I do a lot of heavy gaming in 4k 60/120hz. I also do a lot of scattered web browsing and care about video streaming/watching quality.    


Currently I own a I7-13700K. However right now, the AMD 7-7800x3D is being hailed the best of the best for gaming. It would next me some extra FPS, have a lower power draw, lower thermals, and have a new socket.   


However i'm wondering what i'll miss from the intel platform if I do switch. Everyone always frames it as intel is better for workloads and AMD is better for casual stuff and gaming. But WHY?  


I have very little background knowledge about how pc parts actually work. I've been trying to learn about cores and threads. I think I got the super basics. Also learned about cpu cache. So I think the 7800x3d is better for gaming due to its 3D cache. This makes sense.  


However id like to understand why is intel good at what it does. And what else might it be better at, even by a little? For intel people talk alot about multi threads for work loads. Or its E cores. So how do these things work? Why does the multi or e core not seem to matter for gaming?  


If I have 10 tabs open on chrome, will a multi threaded core be able to process those more smoothly than AMDs, who people contribute single core work to? What about for streaming videos where diffrent visual effects might be used?

I designed a hexagonal processing unit where light enters an empty space and is reflected within the container bouncing off walls, on each wall is a receiving solar panel that generates an energy signature and with every side working together we generate a repetitive pattern that is the basis of a computer idling.

N = dy(x+t) - dx(y+u) + dx b

\- 0 = dy x - dx y + dx b

N = dy t - dx u

Let u = v+1/2:  
N = dy t - dx (v+1/2)

0 > dy t - dx (v+1/2)  
dx(v+1/2) > dy t

dx (2v+1) > 2 dy t

This is the implementation that I be using as of this time.

void drawLine(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1, rgb color) {  
int dx = abs(x1 - x0);  
int dy = abs(y1 - y0);  
int tilt = dy < dx ? -1 : 1;  
int step = tilt == -1 ? x0 < x1 ? -1 : 1 : y0 < y1 ? -1 : 1;  
int mode = tilt == -1 ? y1 < y0 ? -1 : 1 : x1 < x0 ? -1 : 1;  
int sV = tilt == -1 ? x0 > x1 ? x1 : x0 : y0 > y1 ? y1 : y0;  
int eV = tilt == -1 ? x0 > x1 ? x0 : x1 : y0 > y1 ? y0 : y1;  
int L = tilt == -1 ? dx : dy;  
int R = tilt == -1 ? dy : dx;  
for(int i = sV, h = 0, l = L, r = -R, c = tilt == -1 ? x0 > x1 ? y1 : y0 : y0 > y1 ? x1 : x0; i <= eV; i++) {  
if(l < (r += 2 \* R)) { h++; l += 2 \* L; }  
if(tilt == -1) plot(i, c - h \* step \* mode, color);  
if(tilt == 1) plot(c - h \* step \* mode, i, color);

}

}

It hasn't been tested as far as I know, so I'm not sure if changing step and mode would break the function if it were to undergo extensive use, but this is an optimization that could be done:  
int hStep = x0 < x1 ? tilt : -tilt;

int vStep = y0 < y1 ? -tilt : tilt;

&#x200B;

Since line drawing functions are easily called countless times a frame, it would probably go faster due to checking that less, but I'm not sure how messing with the first one, which be more rigorous would affect things after extensive use.",2023-05-24 22:33:43
131cvms,Resources for understanding parallel computing models in distributed systems,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently working on a project that involves building a ""parallel executor"", which is a piece of software that takes a ""remote computation"" object and effectively parallelizes it across a distributed pool of computers.

To accomplish this, I need to gain a deeper understanding of parallel computing models and abstractions used in building distributed systems. Specifically, I'm interested in learning about the parallel computing model used in building such executor, and how it can be applied to breaking down tasks into smaller ones and executing them in parallel across multiple computers. This also will help me build the core abstractions to represent a ""remote computation"". I would also appreciate any other relevant resources that may help me gain a better understanding of parallel computing.

My ultimate goal is to build an automatic distributed parallelization system that can handle remote computation objects and effectively break them down into smaller tasks and execute them in parallel across multiple computers. I believe this will be similar to the problem presented in this page: https://www.unison-lang.org/articles/distributed-datasets/core-idea/

18op6xc,Is C really faster than Java?,"Hi. I'm student learning computer science, and aiming to learn low level such as how arm is running assembly codes.

I have quit abstract question, what is fastest language?

To get answer, I define it specifically.

&#x200B;

Computer language's compiler translates it's code into machine language assembled by assembly code computer can run.

Computer runs machine language with cpu made of ALU, register, data IO, and memory controller.

Then, fastest language will be a language that has compiler writes assembly code optimized to cpu.

For example, it shouldn't change value in memory if it's not necessary like Java's array.

&#x200B;

In theory, so Java shouldn't be faster, but there's a problem.

Code I wrote used set, save logic, addition, multiplication, subtraction arithmetic.

Because I know Java initialize every element into Null when declare the array, but C doesn't, so I expected Java will be slower.

But here comes a problem I faced and made me write this article.

[C](https://preview.redd.it/svdjshvkyw7c1.png?width=5120&format=png&auto=webp&s=d625b3f4779d645c673a91e15b5212f64ab3cebc)

As you see in images, Java took about 13seconds, and C took about 43seconds.

It could be the problem caused by my setting,

I used m1 MacBook Air, CLion and C11 in Cmake with Clang-tidy all default for C, IntelliJ and JDK 17.0.9 with all default for Java.

&#x200B;

So I come up with some ideas.

First, JDK 17 can do multithreading for default, but C11 doesn't.

So I've searched for it, but couldn't find any information similar.

Second, macOS 14, based on Unix Darwin kernel 23.1.0 let Java multithread as default, but not on C11.

As you expected, couldn't find it.

Third, Clang compiler can have problem.

So I used PC and used visual studio using GCC, but it was still slower.

Exactly, it was different computer, so z was 1024, Java took 7.3...seconds, but C took 13.6...seconds.

Maybe Gcc compiler could be faster and Mac isn't proper for C on the other hand windows is,

but still, C was slower than Java.

&#x200B;

For you to give a try, here's my source code.

&#x200B;

C

`#include <stdio.h>#include ""stdlib.h""#include <sys/time.h>#define A 2048int a[A][A], b[A][A], c[A][A];int main() {`

`for (int i = 0; i < A; ++i) {for (int j = 0; j < A; ++j) {for (int k = 0; k < A; ++k) {c[i][j]+=a[j][k]*b[k][i];}}}gettimeofday(&stop, NULL);printf(""took %lf s\n"", (stop.tv_sec - start.tv_sec) + (double)(stop.tv_usec - start.tv_usec)/1000000);`

1adeh6m,UnsetN O(1) Data Structure Help,"Hi, I'm looking for a data structure which supports get, set, and UnsetN in average 0(1) time complexity. ""UnsetN"" Basically means getting a number N and doing an unset (Ctrl+Z) operation on the data N times. I know it may sound impossible but I got to stuff that are a bit close so I wandered if there's any solution to this problem.

Example:

list is [1, 2, 3]

Set(index=0, value=7)

list is [7, 2, 3]

Set(index=2, value=1)

list is [7, 2, 1]

Set(index=0, value=10)

list is [10, 2, 1]

UnsetN(2) list is [7, 2, 3]

Thus, at the end, Get(index=0) returns 7

Edit:
I thought I would just clarify some of my attempts to solve this problem.

I tried to create some sort of stack/list of lists, but then I had to choose between deep, shallow, or lazy copy.
Deep copy didn't work because it took O(n) average time, shallow copy didn't separate the arrays' instances so changes in the new array transferred to the old ones, and lazy copy merged the 2 problems by sometimes making the operation take O(n) and sometimes (in some other implementations) making new changes effect the old list instances. In lazy copying, there are also cases where I would store the changes in a different location (like a tuple or a list) but that would make UnsetN take O(n) average time).

I also tried storing a map of changes for each index, but I got to the understanding that, though the UnsetN operation could return one element in O(1), it cannot return the rest in O(1) as well. I tried to solve it by using 1counterall indexes combined, so the first change would be tagged as change 0, the second one with change 1, and so on. The problem with this approach is that I want to revert the list to a certain counter,but there are cases where I can't obtain each index's version up to that counter in O(1). For example, If my current counter is 4 and my changes map is: {0: {0: 5,2: 9, 4: 6}, 1: {1: 7, 3: 8}} And I want to revert the list back to counter=2, I can know index 0's value easily in 0(1) by doing changes_dict[0][2], but I can't obtain index 1's value in the same time complexity.

I thought about making a kind of ""Holed List"" whereit doesn't contain all indexes but I can still obtain thelast index before my requested index in O(1), but Idon't know how to do that (maybe something math ormemory related?), so that's where I got stuck.

191rrkr,Is my idea an efficient way to solve Boolean Satisfiability problems,"Well, throughout this text I assume that 1 and true as well as 0 and false are analogous, and will only deal with the numerical aspect of the truth variables. They can be converted back post all the mathematical calculations.

A few notations: My Boolean variables shall be x, y, z, i, j, k.

AND function: a, OR function: o, NOT function: ' (I shall use function, though others may call it an operator)

eg (x a y) o (i a j')'= (x AND y) OR NOT(i AND NOT j). Operations by order of parenthesis.

I will slowly build up my argument as points for better verification:

1. I guess we can all agree that with operations only on 0 and 1 (an odd and an even number), the and function acts as multiplication, atleast in value preservation(or based off on parity; that's how I took it)

To show what I mean

0 a 0=0, 0 a 1=0, 1 a 0=0 and 1 a 1=1; Similarly 0\*0=0, 0\*1=0, 1\*0=0 and 1\*1=1.

2. We can agree that by DeMorgan's Laws: x o y = n(nx a ny)=n(nx\*ny)

&#x200B;

Let's take a random Boolean Satisfiability problem:

((x o ny) o z) a ((x a (nx o y) a z) = 1 (odd)

Converting it to multiplication, we basically get:

n((nx\*y)\*nz)-\*-((x\*n(x\*ny)\*z)=odd (part a and be separated by hyphenated Asterix)(sorry for the awkward convention)

Obviously, both parts should be odd for product to be odd.

a. This implies (nx\*y)\*nz is even. So, atleast one of the conditions x=odd, y=even, z=odd is satisfied.

b. Since the whole thing is odd, x, z should be odd and x\*ny is even. So y should be even since x is odd

So we get solutions for (x, y, z)=1, 0, 1.

Is this an efficient algorithm, since it primarily involves just math, something which computers have always been good at. Are there any logical fallacies that I haven't caught up with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Please excuse me if my answer is somehow a pre-existing/inefficient algorithm. Since I am relatively new to CS

And I also know that this is not even remotely close to an 'algorithm', and is just more like a informal essay kinda thingy. I should have used pseudocode and whatnot, but as I said, I am very new to CS and I have no idea on how to write an algorithm and have no idea on how to calculate the complexity (have only done basic complexity yet).

Thanks a lot for your time.

    int main() {
    int a = 5;

    }

it assembles into a lengthy assembly code and it has this line:

    movl    $5, -4(%rbp)

Basically saying subtract 4 bytes from the stack pointer and place the value `5` at that address. My confusion is, when this assembly code is converted into binary, static memory allocation happens, or it has happened already at the assembly code part, now if the binary has the machine understandable equivalent of `movl    $5, -4(%rbp)` it means that binary already contains the value 5 right?, and when that binary itself is loaded onto memory: the call stack of the OS when it is being executed, isn't the instruction to load the value 5 into memory obsolete? since the value 5 is already part of the binary and it is already sitting in the memory.   


I understood the static allocation process like this, the binary contains all the values,   
ie: 0101000010`00101`00010101010100101 (Assuming this is the binary for simplicity sake)  
 it is loaded onto memory and the OS tells the CPU to run the program by changing the IR register to point to the starting address of the program. Why are me allocating memory by updating the stack pointer here when we already have the value 5 inside the binary. for dynamic allocation, i understand that we need to move stuff onto memory into the heap, but for static, im lost.

What he then did, is went and spoke to his supervisor, who involved some of the recruiters and VPs they've known for a long time, and pushed through the CREATION of a new position for me to apply for.

This position was then publicly posted onto their website and numerous platforms so that the position would be viewed as genuine, even though the multiple thousands of people that applied for the position were never truly being considered for that position, and even the ones that were being interviewed were just so that on paper they could say that the hiring process was above board. I too was interviewed, but it was mostly just me talking with some guys that I've already known from potlucks and Christmas parties for years, talking about how life has been and general small talk.

Having just received my offer letter from the bank for my summer internship, I just wanted to share this with some of the rest of you guys, even if just to reassure you that it may not be what is on your resume that is getting you rejected from these positions, it might just be that the position never really existed to begin with.

Just to at least try to stop the hate spam, I do understand that nepotism is wrong and that this isn't right, but as my way of (kind of) making amends, I wanted to share this with you all.

TLDR: Those internships you apply for and don't hear back anything? Yeah those positions might just not actually exist.",2024-02-07 21:29:59

The 2 questions I have are: 

1. Is most of the coursework and exams just coding and programming? What is an example of what a typical senior project would look like? 
2. In your career, how much of what you do is actually coding versus doing other stuff? And if it is mostly ""other"" stuff, can you define what that is? It's pretty well known from most engineering disciplines that we barely incorporate most of our college learning into our professions. I would say that 10% of my job is actually engineering (e.g., solving problems, analyzing data, finding solutions, etc.) and the other 90% is doing bureaucratic stuff, sitting in meetings, and things that probably should already be automated by now.

        int tmp = &a;
        &a = &b;
        &b = tmp;

If we insert some memory safety check before every pointer operation into the binary, we'll have:

    void main() {/*...*/}
    int swap(int *a, int *b) {
        validate_ptr(a);

It's 100% safe to execute this binary under real mode because it will never access illegal addresses.

Now, if our OS has a ""compiler"" that ""compiles"" every executable binaries into such ""safe binaries"" before executing them, we can get rid of the MMU and let everything run under the same address space. This can reduce a lot of overhead.

12q06mc,The Collatz conjecture and the definition of algorithmic undecidability,"I came across the Collatz conjecture a while ago and it has led me to another question, having read this conversation on Stack Exchange: [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1156004/how-could-the-collatz-conjecture-possibly-be-undecidable](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1156004/how-could-the-collatz-conjecture-possibly-be-undecidable) .  My understanding of decision problems is that for a finite length input, an algorithm tries to decide if it's a member of a particular set or not.  If there exists an algorithm that for every possible finite length input can correctly decide whether it's a member of this set within finite time, the problem is decidable.  Undecidable problems are those where it's either not possible to always get the correct answer, or the time complexity to do so can diverge to infinity for finite length inputs.

If we take the original Collatz function (i.e. the 3x + 1 or x / 2 rules) and the decision problem is to determine if any particular integer converges to 1, my contention is that we don't currently know if this is decidable or not.  There appear to be four possible situations depending on whether the Collatz conjecture has been proved or disproved within mathematical logic.

1. The Collatz conjecture hasn't been proved or disproved (as it currently is).  In this case there could be finite length inputs that take infinite time to determine they diverge to infinity (i.e. it's undecidable).
2. The conjecture has been proved.  In this case we would know that every finite length input must either converge to 1 or be found to be part of a finite length loop within finite time (i.e. it's decidable)
3. The conjecture has been disproved but only by showing that finite length loops exist.  In this case there could still be finite length inputs that take infinite time to determine they diverge to infinity (i.e. it's undecidable).
4. The conjecture has been disproved in a way that includes showing some integers must diverge to infinity.  In this case we know there are finite length inputs that take infinite time to diverge to infinity (i.e. it's undecidable).

My question is if the above reasoning is valid, showing that there are some decision problems that we can formulate but not yet know if they're decidable because it depends on an answer from mathematical logic.  Thanks in anticipation.",2023-04-17 22:47:16

1acuxtl,Big need in skilled nursing facilities a program that translates orders from epic to point click care,I’m unsure why this hasn’t been developed yet but it’s greatly needed and with ai I’m unsure how it hasn’t happened yet. Hospitals use epic software so when a patient is discharged they have their after care orders. Some patients have pages of medication orders. Each order has to be typed into point click care (skilled nursing facility software). This is the longest process and can take hours depending on amount of meds. For ex I mean the epic says take amoxicillin 500 mg 3 times a day. It truly shouldn’t be that hard for a software to translate it into point click care.It’s already possible to drop the orders epic into point click care but each order isn’t scheduled and each one has to still be gone into and typed in. That process requires going through each page to find med and then fill it in. It’s just data entry but can take hours and that’s time we don’t have. If we could get orders in much faster then we can do more admits which would make corp so happy lol.,2024-01-28 05:11:26

19evdrd,Suggestions to tame complexity in hierarchical state machine?,"I'm working with a hierarchical state machine which seems very large to me -- 15 leaf nodes, and 5 parent nodes (example of hierarchy included below). The number of states makes it difficult to understand all the interactions, and putting all the state transitions into a single diagram is a nightmare. I suspect that the state machine could be simplified, possibly through:

1. reducing the number of states.
2. restricting the kinds of transitions that are allowed.

I'm hoping for advice on how to do either of these, or more suggestions for how to tame the complexity in the state machine.

I've searched for suggestions regarding ideas (1) and (2) a bit already. I expected there would be some heuristic to determine when states should be combined to reduce the number of states, but I haven't found anything about this.

19d22vx,Best way to simulate Low-Field MRI from High-Field MRI,"Hi fellow computer scientists,

&#x200B;

I'm trying to trivially simulate Low-Field MRI from High-Field MRI. I'm wondering if any of this options is valid. If so which one is the best?

&#x200B;

A) Let's consider we have a 3D High-Field MRI image:

1. Apply FFT to obtain k-space -> Undersample k-space with mask -> Apply IFFT
2. Apply FFT to obtain k-space -> Downsample k-space with bicubic interpolation -> Apply IFFT
3. Apply FFT to obtain k-space -> Center crop k-space -> Apply IFFT

&#x200B;

B) Also, in case of low SNR in Low-Field, I can consider larger voxels during acquisiton. We want the same FOV (is this okay, right?). In such case what will happen to k-space when compared to an acquisition with smaller voxels? Let's consider we have a 3D High-Field MRI image with size 512x512x512:

1. The new k-space, with size 256x256x256, will look like a downsample version of the k-space acquired with smaller voxels. Similar to option 2.
2. The new k-space, with size 256x256x256, will look like a center cropped version of the k-space acquired with smaller voxels. Similar to option 3.

Say there are 5 acceptors: A1-5 and 2 proposers: P1 and P2. How would the Paxos algorithm work in the following situation?

1. P1 prepares ID = 245 to A1, A2, A3
2. A1, A2, A3 promise for ID = 245
3. P1 receives a majority for ID = 245
4. P2 prepares ID = 999 to A3, A4, A5
5. A3, A4, A5 promise for ID = 999
6. P1 sends propose of value V1 to A1, A2, A3
   1. A1 and A2 accept a value of V1
   2. A3 message is delayed
7. P2 send propose of value V2 to A3, A4, A5
8. A3 and A4 accept a value of V2

Now A3 will always commit to V2 since even if P1's message reaches earlier, it's ID has been committed to P2's ID.

My understanding is that when a native opcode is defined as part of ISA, then it’s binary representation defines the logic gate path the circuit inside the CPU needs to take to execute the instruction (mostly within the same cycle). Hence this implementation, being all in hardware, can be considered an ASIC. For programs compiled for generic architecture, the execution would fall back to a macro kind of procedure that would execute multiple native instructions to get the same result and hence slower.

When adding a second value to a dynamic array of size 1 (initially containing one element), the textbook counts 2 operations: one for moving the existing element to the new array, and another for adding the new element. 

However, when adding a third element to this array (now of size 2), the textbook counts 4 operations: one for creating a new array, one for moving each existing element (2 operations), and one for adding the new element.  
Why are the operations counted differently in these two scenarios? Shouldn't the process of creating a new array and moving elements always be counted consistently, either as separate operations or as a single operation? 

I know it's somewhat irrelevant, but I'm trying to understand the rationale behind his difference in counting methods.

18u8q1s,Dependent types and parametric polymorphism,"I was writing some Rust code and encountered a surprisingly theory-leaning question. I was trying to make code that would deal with stack-allocated (statically sized) arrays ""generically,"" making use of a language feature called const-generics. 

However, this code would not be truly generic, as at no point could I ""query"" the size of the arrays to influence functionality. Rust types suffer erasure at compile time, meaning that this is fundamentally impossible. I had to make separate trait implementations for different array sizes, all of which had essentially identical logic. 

One thing led to another, and I ended up learning about Idris, a Haskell-ish implementation of dependent types. Here, there would be no problem doing something like what I described above (with a few important caveats). However, I hypothesize that using dependent types to do this in Idris would completely negate the performance benefits I was seeking in the first place.

I don't know a ton about compilers, but in a language without a runtime, am I right in thinking that it is not realistic to have code with both static-alloc performance and polymorphism over type size, regardless of what kind of type system is used? Or is having a dependent type system somehow a magic pass to performant size-generic programming via some kind of monomorphization process?",2023-12-30 06:10:13
18ttbq2,Inquiring about the Tools Used to Create a Programming Language,"Hello everyone,

As a web developer specializing in ReactJS and NodeJS, I've recently found myself curious about the foundational tools used in creating programming languages such as JavaScript or Python. I understand that this is a complex topic, and while I've done some research online, I've found that many explanations delve deeply into the history of computing which, while informative,  can be a bit overwhelming for someone seeking a straightforward answer.

I came across several answers that are quite long but informative, such as these:[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5csa5q/comment/d9z75vs/?utm\_source=reddit&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5csa5q/comment/d9z75vs/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/qp042/comment/c3zajcx/?utm\_source=reddit&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/qp042/comment/c3zajcx/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I  appreciate the depth of these explanations, but I was hoping for a more concise description, much like how I might simplify the explanation of how a website is created for someone with less technical background.

If a child asks me how a website is created, I can answer in a long,  detailed, and informative way, but I can also answer shortly and straightforwardly (a website is created by programming languages). Of course, I know HTML and CSS are not programming languages but they are something similar. This is the way I answer shortly for the child to grasp the idea. So I ""invented"" a way to answer shortly the question  ""How a programming language is created?"":

This is a simplified model to understand the hierarchy of tools involved in creating a programming language:

1. A software product is created using programming languages (tool group 1).
2. A programming language is created using ""tool group 2.""
3. ""Tool group 2"" is created using ""tool group 3.""
4. ""Tool group 3"" is created using ""tool group 4.""
5. ...And so forth.

Would anyone be willing to explain, in a condensed form, what ""tool groups""  might be involved in the creation of a programming language, following this model? I'm looking for a high-level overview that captures the essence without going into exhaustive detail.

Thank you in advance for your insights and assistance. I'm eager to learn from this community!

* A sigmoid function (such as 1/(1+e\^(-x)))

I found scipy-entropy filter and it is quite fast. I know it uses cython underneath but it was still way faster than my pure C implementation of the method I said earlier.

From what I understand, in an in-order execution model, the CPU core processes instructions in the sequence they are received.

However, I'm not sure how this works when a co-processor is involved.

1ag8wh6,Opinions on Data Science Bootcamps (and my current position),"So a bit of background about myself:  
I recently finished a Master in Computer Science (I have a Bachelor degree in Economics) from a reputable university in Europe (specifically Spain). However the program lacked any sort of direction. I have always been interested in Data Science but it's been really hard landing any jobs since my portfolio is definitely lacking (couldn't build a proper DS portfolio during the master). Also, I honestly need more knowledge in order to pass the interviews and would love to dive in deeper into the field. The question is, should I join a Data Science bootcamp? What are your thoughts? Ideally I think a bootcamp is great because:

1. I learn better in a structured, non self taught environment
2. They help build a good portfolio
3. Networking and job hunt help (supposedly)
4. Chances of landing a DS job increase

**What do you guys think? Am I tripping and should stay away from bootcamps? I'd appreciate any input!! Thanks!!**",2024-02-01 11:31:29

The same goes with decommiting, why is it better to leave memory reserved than to release it completely? Why not release every time and just recommit it the next time?

198vnzu,"Unveiling JWTs: The Problems Solved, The Journey from Passwords, An Architectural Example Needed.","Forgive the verbosity of this post, but I find myself deep in a cryptic conundrum in the face of JWTs (JSON Web Tokens). As I explore the many facets of modern web development, I’m prompted by the continual resurgence of JWTs in my learning journey. In awe of its increasing relevance and usage, I would like to untangle my confusion and become proficient in understanding and implementing JWTs.

JWTs are tokens designed to transmit information between parties as a JSON object in a compact and secure way. Predominantly, I've learned that they are used in the realm of user authentication and secure information exchange, but can someone enlighten me in granularity? Precisely, regarding the key problems addressed and solved by JWTs?

Authenticating users, indeed, is an integral part of almost any application and has evolved significantly over the years. Not so long ago, username/password and cookie-based session were the most prevalent incumbents in the realm of user authentication. Yet, with the demise of the world-wide monoliths and the rise of decentralized applications, in particular, the dispersed SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) and microservices architecture, I sense a shift in the authentication paradigm. But how did we navigate from those traditional passwords concept to JWTs?

In an attempt to comprehend fully, I'm also earnestly seeking an architectural example to grasp this concept better. For instance, having an API with a specific method for login and one for token generation, and having it ‘talk’ to a frontend application would help immensely in understanding JWTs conceptually and practically.

Let me lay out a scenario that might serve as a basis for such a walkthrough. Suppose we have a user-based application; user credentials are stored securely on a database. The user logs in via a frontend application (let's say, built with React), which then sends a POST request to the backend (let's say, Node.js API). The API then verifies the user credentials against the database.

From here, how do we integrate JWTs into the process? Where would the 'method for token generation' come in? How does the front-end application handle the received token? How is this token used on subsequent requests to the backend? Ideally, how would the backend/API handle such a token? If someone could illuminate this process in a step-by-step guide, I'd be immensely grateful.

Moreover, it would be immensely beneficial if we also delve into the realm of token expiration and token refresh, and how they are designed into such architecture. How do we handle the potential expiry of JWTs issued in an ongoing session?

I am keen to receive your comprehensive perspectives to broaden my understanding and fill the gaps. Your knowledge, insights, and experiences can really help to bridge my confusion. Thank you!

TL;DR: I'm seeking in-depth insights into the problems JWTs solve, how we transitioned from password-based authentication to JWTs, and a practical, architectural example of implementing JWT authentication.

My gratitude in advance.",2024-01-17 12:41:45

13wtpy9,Need help (newbie) - Church-encoded Booleans,"Hi everyone,

I don't know where to ask, so I come to this place. I know that we're not to ask questions regarding programming issues in this subreddit, but I didn't find any programming subreddit (including lisp, scheme and the like) that felt appropriate because I'm stuck at the theoretical, mathematical, logical level.

I'm taking CS classes at Uni, but it's a non-standard ""lateral"" track, so we're to study a lot of stuff on our own. I'm currently trying to get a grasp on the lambda calculus because I feel it is helpful for functional programming.

I'm at a loss when it comes to understanding Church booleans.

(I know ""normal"" booleans from programming languages like Java, were you set x (or boolean x) = true or ask whether x == 5 or 4 == 7 which might evualuate to true or false).

So, my ""hang-up"":

Church convention:

true ≡ λa.λb. a

false ≡ λa.λb. b

If you use beta reduction, true gives you back whatever you use and discards λb.

λa.λb. a (5)

\----> 5

but

λa.λb. b (5)

\----> 5

...that is the same and \_almost\_ like the identity function. This, I don't understand.

But my bigger problem, which, of course, probably arises from not properly understanding Church booleans in the first place, is if-then.

if ≡ λp.λa.λb. p a b

How do I go from here to ""choosing λa if true and λb if false""?

My first try was obviously BS because I used the bound variables of λa and λb for λp, which was not so smart.

\[This was my try for ""True"":

    λp.λa.λb. p a b                      (TRUE) a b
    λp.λa.λb. p a b                      (λa.λb. a) a b
    λa.λb. ( (λa.λb. a) a b)              a b
    λa.λb.  ((λb. a)  b)                  a b

eeerm...what?....oops.

... yeah, didn't make sense. I don't think I can use a and b when it comes to p because they are already lambda-bound?)

&#x200B;

How does p --> TRUE ""trigger"" an output of λa and p --> FALSE λb?

136xihg,What is the link between the halting problem and the Universal Turing Machine?," 

A lot of the lectures when introducing the halting problem show the universal Turing machine right before the halting problem. However, I feel like they fail to show the connection (or maybe I just cannot see it and it's only my fault). I  would be really grateful if you can provide me with some mental bridge to help me connect these concepts.

Universal TM is a machine that can simulate any other TM. It should output the same output as the ""inner"" TM itself.

A halting problem can be shown by a function or algorithm that contradicts itself.

    def g():         
        if halts(g):         
            loop_forever() 

Is the connection here just that thanks to the existence of the UTM, we can simulate one machine inside of another and let the outer TM contradict the inner TM and then generalize this for all TM thanks to UTM? However, shouldn't the UTM  provide equal output to the inner TM? Or there is more to it? I feel like I'm getting lost when seeing all of this ""fancy language"" of university lectures.

I also can understand this explanation, however, I'm not sure whether it is correct or not:

 If there was an algorithm that could solve the halting problem for all possible Turing machines, then we could use that algorithm to decide whether the Universal Turing Machine halts or not on a given input,  which we know to be impossible.  
In other words, the Universal Turing Machine can simulate any other Turing machine, including one that solves the halting problem, but it cannot solve the halting problem for itself.",2023-05-03 19:51:16

1al118o,Storing mathematical formulas with variables in Microsoft SQL,"Hello, I need to implement a feature that stores a user input formula.   
The formula will have variables (like nbItems, nbReports, averageFailures etc: 2\*averageFailures > (1+nbItems) bla bla)   


I was going for a simple solution of storing the formula as a string in a table, and another table with the variable names, then I could make a many-to-many relation between the tables. (I am constrained to use MySQL databases). This way I could just get the formula, all variables associated then fetch their values from an API (can't store value in DB, they change frequently) and then replace them in their respective placeholders.

Is this a bad approach to it?   


I see that people usually split these expressions with binary trees, but I do not know if it's a good solution, as some people on StackOverflow are against it:  [java - Store expression trees in database - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5026322/store-expression-trees-in-database).

Can you give me some suggestions on how to approach this or validate/invalidate my approach?

1agix5r,Is this possible?,"I am not a coder at all, ive dabbled but my knowledge is extremely limited and i'm well aware that if i have a random idea, the probability that it is original is close to 0. However i had an idea and if it is any good it would be a shame for it to go to waste. Again id like to clarify this is coming from a place of extreme ignorance and lack of knowledge on the subject. 

I was thinking about a tv show and a dude high on this drug put back together shredded documents for the FBI to help solve a case. I thought, what if a program could do this? I asked AI to write up pseudocode for the idea with a bunch of extra information and things to consider.   


It came out with this:  
Advanced Pseudocode for Shredded Document Reconstruction

**Input:**

* Shredded document images (front and back) in high resolution
* Optional: additional context (scene photos, witness statements)

**Output:**

* Reconstructed document image (if possible)
* Confidence score for reconstruction
* List of potential matches and associated probabilities

**Algorithm:**

1. **Preprocessing:**  


* Convert images to grayscale (optional)
* Enhance contrast and sharpen edges
* Remove noise and distortions

1. **Feature Extraction:**  


* For each fragment:
   * Extract edges and contours
   * Identify text regions (lines, words) using OCR or segmentation techniques
   * Calculate texture features (e.g., smoothness, entropy)
   * Extract color information (if relevant)
   * Estimate paper thickness based on edge strength

1. **Matching:**  


* Define a similarity metric considering:
   * Geometric fit (overlapping edges, matching contours)
   * Textual content (OCR results, letter frequency analysis)
   * Texture similarity
   * Color compatibility (if used)
   * Presence of snags (e.g., interlocking edges)
* For each pair of fragments, calculate similarity score based on the defined metric
* Employ a probabilistic approach to account for missing information and uncertainties:
   * Use Bayesian inference to incorporate context information (if available)
   * Implement Markov Random Fields to model spatial relationships between fragments

1. **Reconstruction:**  


* Find the highest scoring matches using a global optimization algorithm:
   * Simulated annealing
   * Branch and bound search
   * Genetic algorithm
* Iteratively merge matching fragments based on their positions and orientations
* Refine the merged image using inpainting techniques to reconstruct missing areas
* Employ context information to guide reconstruction (e.g., alignment with known document structure)

1. **Evaluation:**  


* Calculate a confidence score for the reconstructed document based on:
   * Overall consistency (e.g., number of unmatched fragments)
   * Plausibility of text content
   * Visual coherence of the reconstructed image
* Output the reconstructed image, confidence score, and list of potential matches with their probabilities

19edr42,Random Graph Generation Algorithm,"While a seemingly simple looking task, when you dive deeper for an optimal algorithm, we discover various intricacies of this task.

Textbook algorithm is fairly simple, if we need a graph with N nodes and M edges, just keep generating random edges and add if not already present till we get M edges, while this may work great for sparse graphs it becomes inefficient really quick as graph becomes denser.

The problem becomes even harder if we want the graph to be connected, the base step is to generate a random spanning tree amd add remaining edges randomly such that they don't repeat.

This problem is essentially to sample some edges from complement of a set where the universal set is the set of all possible edges, in a way that they don't repeat, we use Floyd's Sampling algorithm for it, the end result is a mathematically random graph which is optimal in worst case, you can check out the implementation.

Payment application

/Sf1/(contract number)/instructions page?

195ke3b,"Im not a CS person. Im doing research on AS2, AS4 and asymmetric encryption and documents standard XML. I would greatly appreciate any help as I am pretty lost.","Hey,  


I hope Im posting in the right community. If not, I'd be grateful if you could direct me to the proper one.

I have to prepare a presentation about [Peppol](https://peppol.org). Peppol is an infrastructure that makes possible secure Electronic data interchange. They basically provide network, to which end users can connect to and send to each other business documents through Access points (access points are companies, who are service providers for this).  


Part of the presentation includes me explaining what are AS2 and AS4 communication protocols. I also have to explain what asymmetric encryption is and how it fits into this whole story of Peppol and EDI.  


In the instructions I was given is also ""Documents standard: XML"". I have to explain the documents defined by Peppol and give some examples. I'm not sure if this refers to documents as in how a document is structured as it would be on a paper (e.g. when i write a contract - where i put the parties, the subject matter, the date etc.) or is this ""document standard"" another IT term that I dont understand.  


I searched through the internet and read about AS2 and AS4 protocols as well as asymmetric encryption. I understand the concept of asymmetric encryption but I cannot understand how it fits into the context of Peppol, I have a slight idea but no where near enough to make a coherent presentation. Regarding AS2 and AS4 I literally have zero clue about what I read on the internet. There is a lot of abbreviations and technical stuff that I just dont understand.   


I would be extremely grateful if someone could explain to me these concepts in a way that a person not in IT and CS can understand, since I also have to make this presentation in user-friendly way. ",2024-01-13 09:36:38

18p5ow8,How is the problem of mixed multi/single-value properties addressed in computer science?,"I don't know if this is the right sub but I hope I will get some help. I am an engineer with no programming experience I can speak of so please don't be to harsh.

So let's say I want to model the concept of a laptop. To make things easier there are only two laptops and they both only have two properties: thickness d and allowed operational temperature T. An operational temperature range is fairly common with laptops for example the laptop should be run in an environment between -10°C and +50°C. But to keep things simple let's say the laptop is only available in two thicknesses d1 and d2, and can operate only at two temperatures T1 and T2.

I could say:

d = {d1,d2}

T = {T1,T2}

As you might have noticed the properties are not conceptually the same. A single laptop will only have one thickness but will have both operating temperatures. An easy way out would be to model both properties differently: d as single valued and T as a set. 

But now a problem arises when one property can be both. For example,

* let's say the laptop can only be used at one temperature instead of two. I would feel very natural to write T=T1 (that one temperature). As one could argue that the set of only one element is the element itself: {T1} = T1.
* let's say there are 3 laptops: one can be operating in an environment with temperature T1, the second in T2 and the third in T1 and T2. 
* a 'type' property: the laptop can be a notebook and a MacBook at the same time. But can be of just one type too.
* the 'color' property: the laptop can have several colors. But can also be just one color.

I tried use a syntax inspired by some logical notation. 

For example,

* for the thickness of the laptop: 'd=d1' XOR 'd=d2' with XOR being an exclusive OR.
* for the temperature: 'T=T1' AND 'T=T2' and in the case of the three laptop example 'T=T1' OR 'T=T2' (OR being the inclusive or)

This has some advantage, as expressions that feel natural can be used like 

d > 10 (meaning the thickness of the laptop should be bigger than 10)

T > 5 (the operating temperature should be bigger than 5), meaning that both T1 and T2 must be bigger than 5.

But have T to be equal to two temperatures at the same time is not something that is common in any programming language (I think) and is probably not a good idea. I am clearly way out of my depth trying to figuring this out on my own.

So my question is: how is the problem of properties that can be both multi-value and single-value addressed in computer science? What formal relationship should I use between the property and it's values? 

Thanks and happy holidays.

143dwyv,What kind of text-file format is the best for specifying trees.,"Hello.

I'm playing with the thought of writing a program  for rendering trees.

In the first instances, they are just rendered in the command line window as a regular tree.

I want to just make a text file to be parsed as a tree, with the bare minimum of fuzz, so it is as easy as possible to define a tree, but with as little amount of ambiguity as possible. And it should be easy to edit the definition, add delete
nodes and so on.

I have thought of using markdown headings for speciffying levels, but thinks that even that is a little too much.

As I see it I have two alternatives that are viable:

* tab indentation 

    root
        level1
             level 2
        level1
             level 2
                 And so on

* markdown headers, much like the first one.

I think, having to make the user write it as a tree is implemented in an array is too much.

I wonder if I am overlooking some other options for defining a tree by a text file, which is just as easy. (I have considered numbering, but thinks renumbering will be too big a chore.)

**Edit**

I want a file format as simple as possible for being able to parse a text file as an inorder binary tree, with as little markup as humanly possible, and yet leave as little room as possible for ambiguities.

The motivation behind this, is to lower the threshold for drawing a graph down to nothing. The end goal, is to output pic scripts you can edit further, and then have pic render the diagrams as svg or whatever format available.
 
So, thank you for any suggestions!",2023-06-07 13:53:30

13xny90,A Manifesto for Cloud-Oriented Programming from the creator of the CDK,"In this [insightful article](https://docs.winglang.io/blog/2022/11/23/manifesto), Elad Ben-Israel, the mind behind the CDK, shares his love for the cloud, but also his frustrations with the complexity of building cloud applications. The challenges he identifies include:
1. Focus on non-functional mechanics: The need to understand and manage cloud platform mechanics instead of focusing on building valuable features for users.
2. Lack of independence: Developers often need to rely on others to handle parts of the deployment process or to resolve issues, interrupting their work flow.
3. Delayed feedback: The current iteration cycle in cloud development can take minutes or even longer, significantly slowing down the development process and making it harder for developers to stay in their flow state.

## It's not just a rant
Elad is not just ranting about cloud development. He proposes a solution in the form of a programming language for the cloud. This language would treat the entire cloud as its computer. The language compiler will be able to see the complete cloud application, unbound by the limits of individual machines. Such a compiler would be able to handle a significant portion of the application's non-functional aspects, enabling developers to operate at a more abstract level, thus reducing complexity and promoting autonomy. Moreover, it could expedite iteration cycles by allowing to compile applications to quick local simulators during the development process. 

## The Winglang Project
Elad reveals that he's in the process of developing such an open-source, “cloud-oriented” language, dubbed [Winglang](https://github.com/winglang/wing). Wing aims to improve the developer experience of cloud applications by enabling developers to build distributed systems that leverage cloud services as first-class citizens. This is achieved by integrating infrastructure and application code in a secure, unified programming model. Wing programs can be executed locally via a fully-functional simulator or deployed to any cloud provider.

## My Interest in Winglang
I, together with a group of dedicated contributors, joined forces with Elad to develop Winglang.
While still in Alpha and not yet ready for production use, it's already possible to build some [real applications](https://github.com/winglang/research/tree/main/dogfooding).

13qlels,HtDP vs SICS (intro CS courses): a discussion,"Good morning all!

I would love to have a discussion on pros/cons of two of the most popular Comp-Sci intro courses I have seen in different CS/programming forums, these are SICS (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) and HtDP (How to Design programs). 

Some background: I am in a fortunate situation where I took an open source web-dev bootcamp and ended up getting a job as a software dev at a place I really love. The bootcamp certainly prepared me for many of the higher level topics in web/cloud dev however, I would really like to expand my own CS education as my undergrad was in physics and I feel many intro CS topics are missing from my toolbelt.   


I have narrowed the ""start"" of my journey to the two video-curriculum-based classes mentioned above, each being pushed by their own open-source ""undergrad education tracks."" OSSU ([https://github.com/ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)) with HtDP and teachyourselfcs ([https://teachyourselfcs.com/](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)) with SICP. I started with OSSU as they have a verbose course-load with a large community, however I've had some MAJOR issues with the HtDP course that have really made me rethink that decision and would love to have some discussion & ideas from those that may have more/other experience and hopefully also create a resource for those that have this dilemma in the future. Below are my pros/cons for each.  


HtDP  
pros:  
\- a part of the OSSU curriculum  
\- unique approach to problem-solving first & tdd  
cons:  
\- ANY course access behind a paywall (3 months) on edEx  
\- many practice problems in the course behind a paywall (there is a separate problem bank)  
\- done in a course-specific & not very popular language (racket, which is a BSL language?)  
\- pretty much requires their IDE, DrRacket, which (in my opinion) is horrible  
\- tons of graphic-based problems & projects (this con is certainly opinion based)  


ICS  
pros:  
\- multiple courses taught using the SICP book including those from MIT, Berkeley, and even more ""modern"" ones using python  
\- open to the use of multiple languages (though Scheme, a Lisp dialect, is recommended)  
\- lots of language resources  
\- can esily use your own IDE/environment  
\- no paywalls on most of the courses I've seen  
cons:  
\- older/less-modern classes  
So... these lists probably do a good job of highlighting my biases and frustrations haha, hence why I'd like to have conversations with others. I've been completely turned off of the HtDP course by their paywalls and incredibly specific language/topics - this brings back memories of undergrad professors making you buy THEIR textbook - and just gives me a bad taste in my mouth and reeks of money. Both courses have free books so you can easily self-teach/pace yourself without their video-curriculum-courses, but I'd like to have that structure in my life as I'm working a full-time job. At this point, I'm likely just going to start the SICP Berkeley course, but the beginning of the HtDP was so unique and interesting in its TDD methodology and interface work I'm honestly a bit sad to leave it behind. Using a separate IDE & environment from the one I use at work every day and learned on is just unacceptable to me and figuring out how to replicate the work in my own just isn't worth the time investment (to me). Honestly, just a bit frustrated at all of the work I've tried to put into HtDP just to have course access removed after 3 months and having to make another fake account to reset all progress combined with their community's mentality of ""oh just do it, you must not be motivated enough!"" I'm an adult in a full-time job trying to learn, so I don't always have time to finish up a course this quickly, what can I say? Anyway, thoughts, discussions, and criticisms are all very very welcome!",2023-05-24 13:15:50
13fybxc,Storing changes in text,"Hi, I’d like to store a history of some text as it is changed over time - something like the contents of a document every five seconds for example. Instead of saving the whole document I was wondering if it would be more efficient to save some sort of ‘diff’ or changes from the previous state of the text.

I was wondering if there was an algorithm that could perform such a differentiation and return some value that could be then used to reconstruct the history of the text, or is this something that people make from scratch, or am I barking up the wrong tree entirely? Thanks!

EDIT - Thanks for the suggestions, look forward to examining the algorithms! I should have said that I'd like to be able to reconstruct the history client side so using git isn't really an option (as far as I'm aware...)",2023-05-12 21:55:07
137r8xt,Hello Everyone!!! Logging - file v async message to db,"Hello everyone, I am working on modernizing my views on some architectural design patterns and am currently doing a fair amount of lambda and sqs work for context and need some additional thoughts and opinions.

I image most folks are are familiar with how applications generally log to a file and this is many times the default approach. It's fast, it has a reasonably small size, and if you want to get advanced with it you can import that file into a log processor to get metrics and do more advanced searches and such. In my case these currently end up in AWS CloudWatch and I am seriously not happy with Amazons solution for this. I find it very challenging to find groupings of log lines together that I would expect to be grouped together and IMO the ability to search through cloud watch is almost non existent. (if someone has a writeup to prove me wrong or show me a better way to use CloudWatch I welcome it)

One solutions I have seen to solve some of these log search problems is to log to a DB (about 12 years ago) but I recognize this is not a great solution due to the relative expense of the DB call (ie will probably cause some performance degradation to the application)

What I am thinking about and want other thoughts on, is if you are going all in on modern architecture, messaging, lambdas (or similar) is there any good reason to not log via message? 

In example I have an event I want to log from my lambda application and rather than logging out in a traditional way I send a message to a queue that is then picked up and processed by a logging application to a DB.

What downsides could occur using this style of architecture?

This is what I think I see ...

Pros:

* Solves the expensive DB write call
* Decouples the logging process from the primary application
* By storing the logs in a db makes them much much more searchable for issues, auditing, and the like

Cons:

* Mentally its more complex, at least at the beginning
* May not mean you do not have logging in your app as you still need a way to get info out during local development

So to everyone here what are your thoughts? What am I missing or not thinking about? Is there some great solution out there that would solve this without manual work that I dont know about? Costs associated with the solution v what I am suggesting? Let me know",2023-05-04 15:48:34

12rbeh0,Why do so few modern programmers know what their instructions are actually doing on the hardware?,"I don't know if it's because of optimising compilers or people learning high-level languages first, but it seems that programmers now know a lot less about what their code is doing on the hardware.

In the 80s and 90s programmers knew how to do a lot of complex operations and code optimisations all by themselves, I think this is because basically all commercial software was made in assembly/C, and even BASIC was very intertwined with the hardware.


Now it seems that people don't know anything about the computer, if you ask someone which integer comparison or mathematical operation is more efficient, they're clueless.

For instance, I see when programmers are making code that loops a number of times they'll typically write:
int i = 0;
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    printer(""Print 100 times"");
}

Very few seem to know that comparison to 0 is way faster than numerical comparison on most CPUs.

Of course micro-optimisations like these are less important now because of compilers optimising, and the rest of the inneficieny being irrelevant on fast computers, but it still amazes me how little programmers know about their hardware.

https://preview.redd.it/dztm57dz9vsa1.png?width=1549&format=png&auto=webp&s=563cbce0e2cd114c6a89b2b30fa3ef3e02d074c5

It's quite simple: we would have partitions on opposite sides of the disk that can grow in opposite directions. This would allow us to grow them independently without the need to move partitions.

My question is: if this is not feasible, why exactly?

I understand that HDDs should not be read in arbitrary ways due to the limitations of head movement (I estimate reading blocks/pages from right to left would take \~2x head movement time). SSDs also have different read/write speeds for random vs sequential access, but I can't see how reading entire pages/blocks in arbitrary positions would be a  problem. If this is right, this scheme should have been feasible on SSDs.

OS kernels, in theory, should be able to translate the address space of an ""inverted"" partition so they can be used at the file system/software level transparently.

I know that volume managers and such solve this problem, so there's not a big demand for this kind of solution, but I am particularly curious about hypothetical solutions that would be OS-independent. (why  no hardware volume managers :v)",2023-04-09 14:14:44

1adr37o,UnsetN O(1) Data Structure Help,"(repost to add correct flair and additional explenation)

Hi, I'm looking for a data structure which supports get, set, and UnsetN in average 0(1) time complexity. ""UnsetN"" Basically means getting a number N and doing an unset (Ctrl+Z) operation on the data N times. I know it may sound impossible but I got to stuff that are a bit close so I wandered if there's any solution to this problem.

Example:

list is [1, 2, 3]

Set(index=0, value=7)

list is [7, 2, 3]

Set(index=2, value=1)

list is [7, 2, 1]

Set(index=0, value=10)

list is [10, 2, 1]

UnsetN(2) list is [7, 2, 3]

Thus, at the end, Get(index=0) returns 7

Some additional info:
I thought I would just clarify some of my attempts to solve this problem.

I tried to create some sort of stack/list of lists, but then I had to choose between deep, shallow, or lazy copy. Deep copy didn't work because it took O(n) average time, shallow copy didn't separate the arrays' instances so changes in the new array transferred to the old ones, and lazy copy merged the 2 problems by sometimes making the operation take O(n) and sometimes (in some other implementations) making new changes effect the old list instances. In lazy copying, there are also cases where I would store the changes in a different location (like a tuple or a list) but that would make UnsetN take O(n) average time).

I also tried storing a map of changes for each index, but I got to the understanding that, though the UnsetN operation could return one element in O(1), it cannot return the rest in O(1) as well. I tried to solve it by using 1 counterall indexes combined, so the first change would be tagged as change 0, the second one with change 1, and so on. The problem with this approach is that I want to revert the list to a certain counter, but there are cases where I can't obtain each index's version up to that counter in O(1). For example, If my current counter is 4 and my changes map is: {0: {0: 5,2: 9, 4: 6}, 1: {1: 7, 3: 8}} And I want to revert the list back to counter=2, I can know index O's value easily in 0(1) by doing changes_dict[0][2], but I can't obtain index 1's value in the same time complexity.

I thought about making a kind of ""Holed List"" whereit doesn't contain all indexes but I can still obtain thelast index before my requested index in O(1), but Idon't know how to do that (maybe something math ormemory related?), so that's where I got stuck.

195iq0d,Why do computers tend to heat up faster if you simply put them to sleep mode than if you turn them completel off?,"I notice for example if you turn off a computer and you let it rest for as short as 45 mins it recovers pretty fast in the sense it won't heat up or a while. This is esp true for laptops.

Where as if you let a computer remain in sleep for as long as say 8 hours, even though its not used for such a long time it will heat up much faster. Sure it won't suddenly heat up rapidly as if you left a regular computer at its screen on all day long simply doing nothing without letting it go into black out but the difference if staggering compared to turning it off and turning it on.

I'm quite curious why is this the case?",2024-01-13 07:40:50

18zueq2,Too much of a dilemma,"Sorry for the long problem statement :(

I am from a tier 3 college, currently on the verge of 3rd semester completion. 

I am learning Flutter, learnt upto API integration to a beginner level and currently making more projects using firebase. 
I am facing a huge confusion, I don't want to be in that 4-5 lpa spectrum as a fresher

I am not asking to become an SDE and get a 20-30-40 lpa package. 8-12-13 lpa as a developer is enough for me. 
(These were my expectations even when I was in the JEE phase aiming a tier 1 college) 
Problem is, I want this as a fresher. 

How do I achieve this, I am keeping a 1.5 yrs of time limit since companies start coming from 4th yr starting. 

Are data science/ML roles so easy to get as a fresher, considering my maths upto 10th is good, but +2 and engineering mathematical aptitude is not that good?

Is it possible for a fresher from a tier 3 to get 8-10 lpa as an APP DEV or a BACKEND DEV or a Fullstack app dev?? (I don't even know if that is a role, I searched but didn't find any openings for full stack app developers)

How is it possible? brute force?? By making as much as possible projects. Or by integrating ML in my app? 


Say I made 10 good projects with good fundamentals of the language and framework and got 8/10 lpa and someone with 3-4 projects would get 4-5 lpa? I am ready to shift to kotlin if needed. 

Is this doubling of CTC possible or am I daydreaming and need a reality check?

I just wondered about how it could be that Turings (complete) abstraction of a computer could be immediately realized for practical use in the physical world.

Because as I understand it, the Turing Machine is a purely mathematical construct, trying to capture what an symbolic algorithmic process is. So in theory, it could have been developed much earlier (at least I see no fundamental objection against why not some year 1000 philosopher thinking about computation could have invented it), when Physics wouldn't have been able to realize it in any way similar as effective. Note: I have a meaningful feeling for the theory of computation and TMs, NOT for Physics

I know that this question is a bit hypothetical, but what I am essentially asking about is the historical connection between the ideas for practical and for theoretical computers.

How do you store terabytes of imagery (remote sensing data in general, such as LiDAR, hyperspectral, etc.) in a file system?

How do you manage the file system?

Once example would be the CIFAR dataset, which is a dataset that consists of millions of images.

**My assumption** would be to organize imagery in folders and sub folders. Then extract meta data for each image file (dimensions, crs, data type, etc.) and save that *with the file path* into a table in Postgres. This table could then be used for advanced querying of data (filter for data in date range, spatial filtering, etc.).

I would appreciate it if someone could describe the steps involved ! 

Btw, I asked this question before and never really got a straight answer. I want to start with the basics of pure image management in file system (like CIFAR image dataset). STAC and COG is another discussion. Please don’t recommend to store images in RDBMS 🤣.

18tb7jf,Difference Between Classical Programming and Machine Learning,"I'm having trouble differentiating between machine learning and classical programming. The difference which I've heard is that machine learning is the ability for a computer to learn without being specifically programmed. However, machine learning programs are coded, from what I understand, just like any other program. A machine learning program, just like a classical one, takes a user's input, manipulates it in some way, and then gives an output. The only difference I see is that ML uses more statistics to manipulate data that a classical program, but in both cases data is being manipulated.

From what I understand, an ML program will take examples of data, say pictures of different animals, and can be trained to recognize dogs. It tries to figure out similarities between the pictures. Each time the program is fed a new animal photo, that new photo becomes part of the data, and with each new photo, the program gets stronger and stronger and recognizing dogs since it has more and more examples. Classical programs are also updated when a user enters new data. For example, a variable might keep track of a users score, and that variable keeps getting updated when the users gains more points.

Please let me know what I am missing about what the real difference is between ML programs and classical ones.

Theoretically, do you reckon the human brain could support some architecture for general computing and if it could, might it be possible to use the optical nerve to inject your own code onto the brain? I wanna make a distinction that using the ""software"" that already exists to write the ""code"" doesnt count cos its just not as cool. Technically we already use the optical nerve to reprogram brains, its called seeing. I'm talking specifically about using the brain as hardware for some abstract program and injecting that program with either a single laser or an array of lasers, specifically used to bypass the ""software"" that brains already have.

13ffyc6,True Random Number Is Still a Myth,"Generation of true random numbers were always being a challenge either when it was first discovered or the era we are living right now.

&#x200B;

>The use of random numbers in computer science can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when electronic computers first began to be developed. One of the earliest uses of random numbers was in the Monte Carlo method, a computational technique for simulating random processes that was first developed by scientists working on the Manhattan Project in the 1940s.The first algorithm for generating random numbers on a computer was developed by John von Neumann and his colleagues in the late 1940s.   
>  
>This algorithm, known as the middle-square method, involved squaring a four-digit number and using the middle digits of the result as the next random number. While the middle-square method was simple and easy to implement, it had some significant drawbacks, including the fact that it could generate long sequences of numbers that were not truly random.

&#x200B;

We have come a long way in the generation of random number from the time it was first discovered the most common one are ""Pseudo Random Number Generators""(PRNGs)

&#x200B;

>Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) use a deterministic algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers that appear random, but the sequence is actually predetermined by the algorithm and an initial seed value. If the seed value is known, the sequence of numbers can be reproduced.

Although it is significantly better but not quite for some application because of that, some computer systems use physical phenomena such as atmospheric noise, radioactive decay, or thermal noise as sources of entropy. These sources of randomness are used to generate a seed value for a PRNGs, which can then be used to produce a sequence of pseudo-random numbers. This combination of true randomness and pseudo-randomness can provide a high degree of randomness for many applications.

&#x200B;

>Over the time different techniques were developed to satisfy the need of true randomness (close to it).

&#x200B;

1. **Physical sources of randomness:** These methods use physical phenomena to generate random numbers, such as radioactive decay, thermal noise, or atmospheric noise. For example, a hardware random number generator (HRNG) can be used to sample physical processes and generate truly random numbers. HRNGs can be expensive and require specialized hardware, but they provide a high degree of randomness.
2. **Pseudo-random number generators with unpredictable seeds:** These methods use pseudo-random number generators, but with unpredictable seed values. The seed values can be generated from sources of randomness, such as mouse movements or keyboard timings. This approach can be less expensive and more accessible than using physical sources of randomness, but it can still be vulnerable to attacks if the seed values are not truly random.
3. **Internet-based randomness services:** These methods use random data from network sources, such as atmospheric noise or radio noise, to generate random numbers. This approach can be convenient and accessible, but it can also be vulnerable to network-based attacks.
4. **Quantum random number generators:** These methods use quantum phenomena, such as the polarization of light or the measurement of quantum states, to generate truly random numbers. Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) provide the highest level of randomness and security, but they can be expensive and require specialized hardware.

&#x200B;

>QRNGs or HRNGs are majorly used in cryptographic applications.

So why it is so hard to generate a true random number , the thing is all the methods discussed earlier all depends on some source/seed to generate random number which is not idle for generating a true random number as a true random number is unbiased and not based on any pattern. There are some researchers that are trying to improve the randomness of random number with the help of AI and machine learning but still it's a long way to achieve a true random number. Some researchers suggested that a true random number is beyond the realm of computer science and it is a problem of quantum physics.",2023-05-12 09:25:15

from the viewpoint of statistics: dice fall perfectly randomly with a probability of 1/6 for each face: nondeterministic.

Both are valid viewpoints and an ""is it either A or B"" question is doomed to fail to answer it. Both viewpoints are supported by enough empirical proof to show that we need to add this 3rd dimension to our Boolean logic.

Hi guys,

Is it too late?

I'm 22, and I am considering a career or at least learning Computer Science. I have basic background in High school Math and physics. I consider myself to be analytical and philosophically-inclined - I loved math and especially physics in high school. Due to the specific situation I had when choosing my major, I ended up enrolling in a Biology program. Well, Biology even helped me be confident in my family business environment, but I already view this as something not to be worthy following. Instead I think those things will be more useful that make my thinking/learning abilities better.

I suppose modern times have shown more that memorization or memory-based degree programs will not be that useful and profitable as ones like physics or computer science (actually, Elon Musk has talked about it).

I'd like to hear your suggestions, in particular, about my age which is 22 and whether or not it is possible to get a career in CS or related through learning online - without a university degree.

Or is it like - I had to start programming at the age of 13?

1bmrxd0,My solution for config hell,"I worked as a full stack developer for several years.  Here and as a hobbyist developer and ran into several recurring annoyances.

* Glue code is annoying to write; much of webdev is hooking together preexisting systems.
* The interesting code is in the backend, but the frontend often takes longer to develop.
* Configuration is a hassle.  Little compares to the pain of ""It works on my machine"".
* Documentation often wildly under- or over- specifies how to get a tool running.
* I'll write a quick script, then when I need it again a month later, I forget where it is, or how to run it.

I knew there had to be a better way to develop in 2024.  By meta-tagging algorithms with the type of their inputs and outputs, we obtain a machine-understandable description of how to run them.  In the process of adding these tags, we can also index the algorithms by keyword for easy searching later.  With a little bit of theoretical computer science, this tagging also allows us to quickly find the sequence of algorithms required for a larger process.

Fundamentally, these tags are types and the algorithms serve as casts.

Ontolog is a programming language I'm developing that treats all computations as typecasts.  This change in perspective large solves the above problems.  For a more philosophical tutorial/demo, check out [ontolog.dev](http://ontolog.dev).

Beyond the language, Ontolog will be an open-source no-code interface developers to distribute their algorithms to nontechnical consumers.  Ontolog is platform-independent, config-free, fast, and great for orchestrating large processes.

Possible use cases include:

* Scientific computing
* 3D Design
* Report/document automation
* Smart home automation

1bdbdmz,What is the theoretically strongest error correction?,"Suppose we are trying to send 1 bit of information (TRUE or FALSE) across a very noisy channel, but we can use an arbitrarily large amount of bits to send the message. Given this, what is the maximum proportion of errors that any theoretical error correction scheme could handle? (For example, 25% noise would flip exactly 25% of the bits)

One error correction scheme I thought of was to send 3 bits, which is able to correct a single bit of error or 33.3% noise (1/3). If I send 101 bits, then I could correct up to 50 errors or 49.5% noise (50/101). In the limit, the message will be correctly sent with up to 50% noise.

I am not sure if this is correct, but one way I thought of improving this was by using a Hamming codes. Making 15 copies of the 101bit block for Hamming(15,11) would allow for 1 of the 15 blocks to be corrected. Afterwards, the 11 data blocks would be able to handle 45.5% noise (5/11). I am not sure how to calculate the maximum amount of noise the 101 \* 15 bits would be able handle, or if swapping things around for 101 copies of Hamming(15,11) would be better/worse. I am not sure if Hamming(7,4) would work well, since it has an even amount of data bits.

Alternatively, making 23 copies of the 101bit block for Binary Golay(23,12) codes would allow for 3 of the 23 blocks to be corrected. The remaining 12 data blocks could handle 45.5% noise (5/11), ignoring the last block to make the amount of data blocks an odd number.  


Is 50% noise the maximum any error correction scheme could theoretically handle?",2024-03-12 22:57:18

1bqpcdd,The British Library's analysis of the ransomware attack they suffered in October,"[https://www.bl.uk/home/british-library-cyber-incident-review-8-march-2024.pdf](https://www.bl.uk/home/british-library-cyber-incident-review-8-march-2024.pdf)

It's unusual for an organisation to publish this sort of analysis.  There are a couple of things that I thought were interesting lessons that are probably applicable to a very wide selection of organisation.

The first is about their attitude to risk.  They were good at identifying large risks that were too big to carry (""out-of-appetite risks"") and getting something done to mitigate them.  But no-one had an overview of all the little risks they were carrying and how those added up to a large degree of risk in the aggregate.  It seems to me likely that this is true of many other organisations that are staffed with good, competent people; individuals assess risks and make sound judgements about whether those risks *on their own* are worth doing something about.  But they don't have any mechanism for assessing the overall level of risk being carried by the organisation because risks that individuals judge too small to bother doing anything about aren't reported anywhere.

And, secondly, their recovery has been severely hampered by their inability to reinstall many systems because they are obsolete.  In many cases, they have recovered their data from off-site backups or external sources but are unable to put it back online because the software vendor no longer supports the software or has gone out of business entirely; even where they have managed to hold on to a copy of the installer, often it won't run on a modern operating system that complies with their upgraded security requirements.

But what about variables associated with the input that aren't length?

Take this code for example:

    randomList = [1, 6, 2, 7, 13, 9, 4]
    def stupid(inList):                         #O(n) * O(C) = O(n)

            for x in range(500):                #O(C)
                x = x + i
    
    
    def SelectionSort(inList):                  #O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)
        inList = list(inList)
        for i in range(len(inList)):            #O(n)
            mIndex = i
            for j in range(i+1, len(inList)):   #O(n)
                if inList[j] < inList[mIndex]:
                    mIndex = j          
            temp = inList[i]
            inList[i] = inList[mIndex]
            inList[mIndex] = temp
    
        return inList
    
    # Modified Selection Sort
    def ValSort(inList):                        #O(2n) + O(k) * O(n) = .....O(n) ?
        inList = list(inList)
        maxVal = 0
        minVal = inList[0]
    
        #Find the minimum element, and the maximum element
        for i in range(len(inList)):            #O(2n)
            if inList[i] > maxVal:
                maxVal = inList[i]
            if inList[1] < minVal:
                minVal = inList[1]
        
        k = maxVal - minVal
        setIndex = 0
    
        #Loop through all possible elements, and put them in place if found.
        for a in range(k):                      #O(k)   ?
            a = minVal + a
            for i in range(len(inList)):        #O(n)  
                if inList[i] == a:
                    temp = inList[setIndex]
                    inList[setIndex] = inList[i]
                    inList[i] = temp
                    setIndex += 1

    print(SelectionSort(randomList))            #[1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13]
    print(ValSort(randomList))                  #[1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13]

This does come with the condition that the list you want to sort must be entirely unique, no two elements can be the same, otherwise my ValSort just doesn't work. But that condition doesn't change the Big-Oh of Selection sort, so it should be perfectly valid still.

&#x200B;

So let me explain my hypothesis here. 

Selection sort loops through the indicies ( `O(n)` ), and compares the current value to all other elements (`O(n)`). You're doing O(n), O(n) times, and as such the Big-Oh of the entire function is O(n\^2)

ValSort, loops through all elements, and does 2 comparisons to find the maximum and the minimum of the list ( `O(2n) = O(n)` ), and then loops through the difference instead (`O(k)`), looping through the entire list every time it does that (`O(n)`), and as such the Big-Oh of the entire function is O(n) + O(k) \* O(n) = O(n) .... ?

&#x200B;

This is what I'm asking. Obviously this algorithm is awful, as 90% of the time you're looping through the list for literally no reason. But if I evaluate ""k"" as a constant (`O(C)`), then by the conventions of Big-Oh I simply just drop it, leaving me with O(n) + O(n), or O(2n) = O(n)

So, As the title suggests. How do you evaluate Big-Oh with variables not related to the number of inputs? Clearly there is something I don't know going on here.

1bgods1,How do you rotate an image matrix into 2d vectors containing their x and y coordinate?,"Ok, I've been studying 3Blue1brown videos of how matrices work, and I've been looking at visual kernels videos, on how an image can be translated to 2d space by imagining them as points on 2d space. I just have one more curiosity, how are we able to apply a 2d rotation matrix to say a simple 3x3 black and white image??? The 2d rotation matrix is 2x2 and the image has a matrix of 3x3. But that 3x3 matrix only specifies the intensity of white color, not the vector space.   


So then I guess in my head what would essentially happen is:  
1. There is a way to map each value of  that 3x3 intensity matrix to 2d vector spaces to draw on the screen of the computer 

2. Once that is figured out, there is a way to also individually rotate all of this matrix with the rotation matrix??

Are those assumptions correct?

    CONNECTED-COMPONENTS(G):

              MAKE-SET(v)
         for each edge (u, v) ∈ G.E

CLRS then states, `""In the actual implementation of this [...] algorithm, the representations of the graph and the disjoint-set data structure would need to reference each other. That is, an object representing a vertex would contain a pointer to the corresponding disjoint-set object, and vice versa. These programming details depend on the implementation language, and we do not address them further here.""`

I understand how this algorithm works; I am just confused why this is even necessary.

As I understand it, a graph is a visual tool and you can represent this graph in many ways in an actual computer: a matrix, a list, etc. **But, by virtue of creating the representation of the graph in the computer, wouldn't the connections be delineated too?!**

Is this about *converting* these data structures into a *set* so that you can simply see *what* is connected, and not necessarily their *specific* connections, i.e. instead of iterating through all these connections, you can just make a set and say, ""All of these pieces of data in this set are connected...All of those pieces of data in that set are connected.""

4ycxrh,TIL That some people have no idea what they're doing on the job.,"Being a younger employee in the work force (soon to be comp sci. grad), I am slowly starting to realize that most of these people whom I work with have no idea what the hell they are doing.


For example, this tech guy who came to install new RAM onto our computers, and he attempted to remove the HEATSINKS from the RAM modules, thinking it was part of the packaging. He also brought DDR3-ECC memory modules instead of the required DDR4-Non ECC memory modules, and had a hard time figuring out why the notches were different. I gave him a course on RAM modules and what PC3-XXXX and PC4-XXXX and ECC means.

Turns out he has a degree in Psychology and used to work at Home depot. I'm not trying to degrade him, not at all, everyone's just trying to survive and I respect that. But I thought even a beginner tech guy would know these things right? I figured I would be coming into the workforce not knowing anything, it's slowly seeming like the opposite. I am very humble, and I know that these people have experience I know nothing about so my goal is to take in as much as I can, given how fortunate I am to be able to be doing the things I am doing at my age. I mean I think out of the typical CS students I have always kind of been ahead of the game because I love computers but man, I can't even explain how I feel. I'm still waiting to meet that one person that really knows what the hell they are taking about so I can learn from them.

I would like to address this topic and open up a space of discussion for anyone who would like to chip in with their very own piece of information to the betterment of the CSGO community.

Me and several members from Stackoverflow who we have come to know one another through the comments, have embarked on a scientific journey to put this discussion to bed, we couldn't find a bed so we did some research instead. Our research spanned over Linux, MacOs, and windows, we collected peofrmance data of the peograms and have come to this conclusion:
""It is know that 32bit is better than 64bit BECAUSE you can run two 32 in a 64 but you cant run two 64 in one 32, furthermore, 32 is half 64, makes sense, in other words, you can run 2 32 of the same on a 1 64. In addition, teh 32 is more power efficient because it uses 64 less bits than the 32, prolonging the life of the machine""

t678u0,My thoughts about Linus Torvalds on moving the Linux Kernel to modern C.,"""We all know Linux is written in C. What you may not know is that it's written in a long-outdated C dialect: The 1989 version of the [C language standard, C89](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/c/c89). This is also known as ANSI X3.159-1989, or ANSI C. Linus Torvalds has decided that enough is enough and will move Linux's official C to 2011's [C11 standard](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1548.pdf)."" - Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols. 

The Linux Kernel is the soul of modern computers, this implies that from time to time it is seen with new updates, many people in forums comment on the migration of the C language to C++.

The Linux kernel has always been, and will continue to be, C. It's just moving from C89 standard (back when it was largely US ANSI maintained, not ISO/IEC) compatible to C11 (which is also C17, C11 with some fixes/improvements) standard compliant.

I.e., the kernel will need a C11 (or C17) standard compatible compiler to build. There maybe further compiler implementation-specific aspects beyond that, such as how the rest of the GNU/Linux system is built.

C++ wouldn't benefit the kernel much, ++ only adds class declaration and behaviour, as far as I know it's just applying a higher standard. 

More or less the same functionality, with some more efficient implementation of some things.",2022-03-04 01:32:26

n94v03,Why is the first character of binary numbers always 1? Wouldn´t it be shorter if you can put 0 in the start?,"EDIT: I understand it now. I Would also like to thank this community to help me understand this matter better. I wish everybody wonderful and great day.

Hi, computer science redditors.

*I have been lately learning a lot about computer science (including binary numbers). This computer science subforum has halped me to understand things a lot better already. You people are the best. Thanks for this again.*

My question is (like tittle say): Why is the first character of binary numbers always 1? Wouldn´t it be shorter if you can put 0 in the start?

For example this is how binary numbers works (with 1 in the start):

I wrote this in binary to decimal (but this implies for all the other conversions also;unless I do not see something)

1=1; 2=10 ;3=11 4=100; 5=101 6=110; 7=111; 8=1000;...

With 0s (binary can start with 1 or 0) can be maybe done something like this:

1=1; 2=0 ;3=11 4=00; 5=10 6=01; 7=111; 8=000 ;...

I have done this only to 8 (just for additional explanation of what I am trying to say) but it really reduces no. of characters (1 or 0) by a lot and it has got same meaning.

For example with that type of counting we can still have infinite numbers(not finite: so this is not the reason why we are not using this).

Isn´t it less characters always better when storing on computers (a lot less memory space) using binary? Am I missing something? What?

Thank you for possible reply.

EDIT(for additional explanation; maybe I did not explained well what I am trying to say):I was thinking this can maybe be usable in a storage-memory. With ""blanks"", but not a third simbol. Not in a trit way. I think we can make a ""something like binary pointer"" that is not stored in memory, but it is usable for checking the no. of ""blanks"".For example lets say we have 3 bits = 8 values. With ""blanks"" you have more than 8 values (000,001,010,100,111,110,101,011,0,1,01,10,11,00: 14 possible values). This can maybe reduce space by itself.And maybe If we have more values that automatically means that we have more option for ""compressing"". So it uses even less storage than.",2021-05-10 13:48:36

ibgx4i,Current default image filetypes such as png and jpeg should be replaced by a standardized image filetype that allows text to be extracted (without an OCR),"Image filetypes are outdated. Current image filetypes are suitable for pictures, but the same file formats are still used all over the internet for images that contain text or some sort of markup. Take memes for example; they are just raster images but almost always contain text. You can't copy text from them, search for the text in a search bar, or click on links (without an OCR). 

Most websites seem to use regular images for diagrams and layout features that involve text. If a standardized filetype that combines manipulatable text and images became an internet standard, I think it would benefit our overall user experience greatly. 

Of course, I can think of some counter-arguments, such as:

* Everything already uses standard image file formats,  so everything would have to be changed to implement it including the image editors. It would be too much work. True, but it would be worth the transition in the long run. 
* Vector images such as PDF files are already a thing. Yes, but PDF files are suited for documents rather than images.

79yukh,Binary/Octal/Hex BLEW MY MIND,"Holy shit this just opened my mind to something I've never **EVER** thought about in my life.

We are all taught that computers use 1's and 0's, but I doubt that every single person can comprehend what that means.

I just learned this lesson in my high school AP Comp Sci Principle class, which I took cuz I like computers but know virtually nothing about them

* Blows my mind that the first people to code a computer had to literally write in 1's and 0's in BINARY holy shit that had to be a pain in the ass

* Binary is more than off and on; it is off and on that represent a number that represents a power of 2^nth power *and for some reason it's read from left to right, to confuse new learners even more* ( but now I understand why cuz that is how a counter works, it starts from the right in a set amount of digits and goes up until it hits 0 and then goes over to the next digit and continues)

* Holy shit it all makes sense know, nonsense octal and hex are easy now and seem like a **HUGE** innovation that seems like most people don't even care about. Like it basically compresses all the 1's and 0's that are a pain in the ass to deal with into a nice little package

* Now visualizing that all the hex has to be converted to binary which is put through CPU's and such and then converted BACK to be interpreted as things that we humans can easily understand ** AND THIS ALL HAPPENS IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE** like holy shit that's amazing

This really put into perspective what I'm actually doing when I'm using a computer and that why when you're playing a ""game"" your computer can become overloaded and not run well. 


TL:DR Learning the concept of Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal opened my mind to a completely different way of thinking and that blows my fucking mind

Recently I learned about the equation for the height of a heap, which is unanimously marked as logN, where N is the number of nodes. Quick side rant before the actual question:

Almost everywhere I look, the height is written as logN, but only after looking into it does one find out that its actually logBase2 N. I was taught that when the base of a logarithm is omitted, it refers to base 10, so this is a little bit upsetting to see in every source I find. Maybe its difficult to mark the base in textbooks or something, but come on... inaccurate information grows uneducated graduates 

&#x200B;

Anyways, here's the question I have: with the base for the equation for the height of a binary tree being logBase2 N, I quickly made a connection between the base of the logarithm and the number of child nodes possible per node. From this, I tried to change the equation to possibly accommodate a ternary tree (by changing the base from 2 to 3) and this didn't work, which kinda confused me. So I did some googling and couldn't find the equation for height of a ternary tree anywhere, although I did find an equation for the maximum number of nodes given a certain height. From the equation that I found ( M(h) = (3\^(h+1) - 1) / 2 ), I tried to solve for h, which when graphed got something totally wacky and not what I was looking for. So:

TLDR: Can somebody give me the equation for the height of a ternary tree? Or for that matter, a universal equation that has an input for the number of child nodes per node as well as the number of nodes in the tree?",2021-03-16 04:51:20

udtbs0,"Creating a virtual, autonomous, self-sustaining world","Forgive naivity, ignorance and the possibility that this is the wrong forum etc

In principle would it be possible to basically build a system similar to Minecraft that would be autonomous? What I mean is: you would design the world and set certain parameters and then leave it to play out or, more ideally, respond to the novel conditions it creates. 

It would be necessary to programme some kind of elementary primitives which can then grow in complexity and multiply in random ways. With Minecraft, the world dies when you leave and reloads when you return. In this programme, whilst it would no longer render in the user's absence, the story and landscape would continue to grow. Clearly the theoretical model would be something like cellular automata. If anyone has read the novel [Permutation City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_City) I am basically describing Egan's ""autoverse"".

I have been reading about [Assembly theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_theory) and it made me think of this. However this shouldn't be a theoretical abstraction. It should be fun and engaging to use, a game. FarmVille on steroids. 

Finally, supposing it's possible: does something like this already exist? Is there already some software that does this? If not, how in the hell would you go about creating it? Is there a rendering engine like Minecraft that is open-source. Would C++ be required etc.

Thanks for any ideas.",2022-04-28 12:00:07

How does the computer know that the data type of adress 1-4 is int and 5-8 is float? Does it also have another memory address that points to those 4 memory adresses that says that those are integer and float types? 

I know ints and floats are represented differently in binary but in the end its all 32 bits so the computer could read it however it pleases. 32 bits can be read as an integer or as a completely different float. Thats why i dont know if the computer leaves another address just to say what data types are on certain adresses or does it work differently?",2021-12-28 21:36:08
oll6l4,how to tell if my code is messy or complicated,"I have been developing a game in c++ using opengl. No engines are being used, so I have to create all the physics, collision, etc. The game is basically a 2d version of super Mario galaxy. Because of this, there are a lot of calculations that get complicated and messy. For instance, there's a function that rotates the map model by model so that the gravitational force the player is experiencing is pointing downward. I included the code below: 

    float* Map::adjustDownward(std::shared_ptr<VertexData> input, glm::vec2 direction) { //adjusting downward for everything else
        float angleDown = atan2(-1, 0);
        float angle = atan2(direction.y, direction.x); //gets the angle that everything needs to be rotated by
        float angleDifference = angle - angleDown;
        std::shared_ptr<VertexData> playerVertexData = player->getVertexDataPointer(); //player vertex data
        float xDiff = input->getAvgX() - playerVertexData->getAvgX();  //gets difference of x
        float yDiff = input->getAvgY() - playerVertexData->getAvgY();  //gets difference of y
        float angle2 = atan2(yDiff, xDiff); //you need to extract the angle for a correct calculation
        float magnitude = sqrt(pow(yDiff, 2) + pow(xDiff, 2));  //magnitude is needed for calculating the new rotated position
        angle2 -= angleDifference;
        if (abs(angleDown - angle2) < .0001)
            angle2 = angleDown;
        float newPos[2] = { (magnitude * cos(angle2)) + windowSizeOnStart[0] / 2 - input->getAvgXModel(),(magnitude * sin(angle2)) + windowSizeOnStart[1] / 2 - input->getAvgYModel() };
        return newPos;
    }

As you can see, there are a whole bunch of angle manipulations and other fun calculations. I have been trying to figure out a more simple way of condensing functions like this, but I can not figure out anything. That returns me to my original question: is this code messy, or just a complicated calculation? If it is messy, what are some techniques I can use to clean up functions like this? One way I judge if a piece of code is not messy is if I can easily follow it after not looking at it for a few weeks. I can barely understand that function after a while, but again, there are a lot of small steps it does to give the final answer",2021-07-16 17:07:30
o6xgp5,When Generating a Random number why do we have to subtract them and add 1 and + min?,"Say im generating a random in Java between 25 and 50.

We do ((max - min) + 1) + min;

I'm confused why we do this. Why do we subtract max from min then add 1, then add min again?

50 - 25 = 25

25 + 1 = 26

26 + 25 = 51

Im confused what the 51 has to do with the random number generation.

I can only imagine it has something to do with when counting in programming, 0 is counted first. Like in an array 0 is the 1st number, and 1 is actully the second number. 

Ive looked up the random number formula, and answers to this online, but everything i come across is related to excel or just explains how to generate a random number.",2021-06-24 09:31:43
o5rdlh,How come a jpg image can have a transparent background?,"Hi all, my first post here.

I've been into computer graphics for nearly 15 years (as an amateur) and I always knew the dogma ""if you want transparency, use PNG, because jpg can't do that"".

Today I came across this image: [https://i.ytimg.com/an/gu9Gu6uBRBeES-vHq2jIAA/featured\_channel.jpg?v=5a5a7632](https://i.ytimg.com/an/gu9Gu6uBRBeES-vHq2jIAA/featured_channel.jpg?v=5a5a7632)  
which is a jpeg BUT... it has a transparent background; moreover, pixels on borders are transparent.

I checked if that image could be a .png called ""something.jpg"", but it's indeed a jpg. Opened in photoshop, it absolutely has a transparent background, which can't be replicated if I try to save the image again with another name.

Someone can explain how this is possible?",2021-06-22 16:40:09
o4h6az,Writing Faster Code (deduplication)? - Python,"I have a dataset and I needed to delete the duplicate rows. I know there are packages for this but I wanted to write my own code for experimentation purposes. I wrote it so it is parallelizable using the multiprocessing package. Then for comparison I used the recordlinkage package to perform the same task. I use to the same column for blocking and same, exact-match matching criteria (as opposed to jaro-winkler or some other distance function). Unsurprisingly the recordlinkage package is orders of magnitude quicker. This may be a question that's rather specific to the inner workings of the recordlinkage package but why is this the case? You inevitably have to make b\*n\*(n-1)/2 comparisons where b is the number of blocks and n is the number of rows in each block (assuming that each block is the same size). I'm wondering how the recordlinkage package can accomplish this in less than a second where my code takes several minutes.

c11owp,Is it too late to learn computer science?,"Hello, I am 17 (Turing 18 this year) and want to get more into CS. I started learning to code when I was 15 (turning 16 Same year). 
I asked myself what the right age was to start coding and thaught it was some age around my age. I thought so, because I barely know anyone who is able to code and the ones I know started somewhere around my age. 

So i went online and read articles explaining that the right age was 2(!)-7 years and was shocked. I do not come from a family where we have a computer scientist and there are almost no people my age who can code around me. 

Therefor I have several questions : 
- Do people really start this young? 
- When did you start to learn to code? 
- is it still possible for me to learn CS at university?

bdcsca,"A new, disruptive, video format would definitely be welcome to a lot of us who edit videos frequently...","For context, 
I am not demanding anyone go out and do this right away, but I work in product marketing at a company and a good deal of my work deals with content marketing as well. This means editing videos.

A bit about the company I work for - the way we make videos is we brainstorm, record, then edit our videos and put our products in, but sometimes we'll take the video and edit it and re-render it as many as ten times because of the relevant departments giving us their input - Corporate marketing, engineering, and quality assurance departments. We have to check a lot of boxes before we put it on YouTube.

The main issue is that whenever we rerender a video it often times takes ten minutes to finish rendering before we show it to the department that may not approve of it.

So, I guess what I'm proposing is someone create a new video file format that can detect only a few seconds of the original video that is being re-rendered that have been edited and then just, ""skip rendering and just rewrite the parts of the video that did change.""

Does this make sense? So like I have company_video.mp4 (render time ten minutes, 25 seconds), my supervisor doesn't like the ending, so I go through and rerender company_video.mp4's ending, and when rerendering it only takes 5 seconds because I'm only changing the ending (theoretical render time 5 seconds).

This could save us a ton of time if it could be done.",2019-04-15 06:22:05

1awx6ey,Should We Still Contribute to Open Source if Our Contributions are Scraped for AI Models?,"With the recent advances in AI and my use of it personally in my job alongside many companies using it to reduce the number of juniors they want to hire I don't think that it's reasonable to contribute to open source as it will hasten how quickly even senior level software developers are replaced by AI. I understand the thoughts that it can't do what programmers do with respect to design or novelty but more and more I am coming to question that idea as I've built fairly novel applications in programming languages that I'm entirely unfamiliar with which are robust and performant using AI code. These were a few Go servers and command line tools for those wondering, so this might be a testament to the language rather than the AI but before starting I was entirely unfamiliar with the language and now for my job I have some highly performant safe work in it. Some worthwhile context is that I'm a senior dev with a background in Rust, C, and C++ so this was likely easier for me to do than most, but it's hard to avoid the thought that with AI I did easily what would normally have been someone else's full time job. I think many of the faults of AI will be ironed out as novel approaches to LLMs are found and at the bedrock of that is open source being used as training material.   


Am I incorrect in my assessment that contributions to AI using our skills will only devalue them and hasten our replacement and if so where or why? I understand that there's an argument to do it out of fun or to solve known glitches and errors in open source frameworks that you're using, but my drive quickly diminishes when I know contributions will reduce my future earnings.

8wq0xb,I've been trying to get to the bottom of why I'd been feeling like shit for the past several weeks. This is my attempt at introspecting,"Mods, I realize that this is probably not a good fit for this sub. Feel free to delete if you deem it necessary.

Some background: I'm a recent CS graduate who just graduated and is immediately starting MS in a different country (the USA) 

This is me attempting a back and forth conversation with myself to try and find out why I'm being feeling down and out off and on these past several weeks. I'm in a better place now, I think. But things were bad. And I realize some of the below might stink of entitlement or whatever, and you'd be absolutely right. I'll aim to be better.

<Begin>

Everyone feels alone man. Every human is a ball of insecurities. The bravest thing you can do is open up to them.

> But it feels like.. I don't want to burden someone else with my problems. I do want someone to listen, but what right do I have to demand emotional labor from someone?

I'm here. What's on your mind?

> Same as before. Not feeling good enough. Doubt. Seeing all these people accomplishing and what do I have? an overcomplicated email reminder. I see people in this industry making waves: people who are self taught, people who started coding young, people who started coding when they were much older than I am now. All these people who found their way into the industry and I'm still here, about to go into several thousand dollars in debt.

Would you be happier if you followed their route? If you made your way into the industry by self taught means?

> I don't know.

Are you jealous that they didn't have to do what you did? That you had to spend several years in university when they didn't have to?

> I don't know. Maybe a little.

Do you feel like they do not belong here?

> No. Of course they belong. Would I feel this way if I thought they didn't belong? They are an essential part of the industry.

Would you feel better if these folks were not allowed in because they didn't go to university?

> Would I? No. What right do I have to gatekeep?

Do you want to stop university? Rescind your application and try your luck on your own?

> No. A large part of me wants to go to university. Wants to do the MS. 

And yet you complain about the debt, despite knowing and accepting it?

> Pathetic, isn't it?
> 
> I think I know why I keep the [MalwareTech](https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1001176192081264642) tweet around. It's a form of masochism on my part. I go back and read all the comments making fun of the fools who are going to university and exemplifying their own accomplishments which they achieved without needing a college education. The comments ARE targeted at the idiot kid who is the subject of the whole thread, and the achievements of the individuals in the comments cannot be detracted. They have every right to make the comments they did.
> 
> But I cannot help but feel the words target me too. And it hurts seeing them. It's foolish to think that, I know. I'm not being rational, I know. But still, it hurts. And I still think about it. I still go and read it. See what I mean about masochism?
> 
> If those folks see this, they'll just make fun of me too. They'll have every right to because I'm being fucking stupid. How can I talk to someone about this without being hit upside the head? 

What do you want?

> I just want to be validated. I just want someone to tell me that my four years of college weren't a waste of time. I just want someone to tell me that the two more years I'm going to spend in college won't be a waste of time. That I will be able to find and experience things there that I can carry out into the world, something no one else could possibly have gotten. 

That is the nature of any path anyone takes. Each person is going to find something different in their life paths that they will carry. The self taught folks found things that you can never hope to find. You'll find things that they can never hope to find. Is it that you want the things that you find to be better and worth more than the things those folks find? You want to feel that you are better than them.

> Is that the vibe I'm giving off? 

It is. You want validation for the path you are taking. You want validation because your feelings were hurt ever since that day you read that thread. Ever since you saw those comments making fun of the path you took. Is this not just you being childish?

> ...

I can understand wanting validation. Everyone does. That is ok. But why do you want to feel like that you are better than the non university folks? They have every right to be here, just as you do.

> I just don't want to be mocked because I chose this path when there are other avenues into the industry that those folks used.

And you won't be. Anyone who mocks you unsolicited is a shitty person, regardless of their background. People have no reason to be shitty to you as long as you're not being shitty to them. This wanting to be superior will get you mocked.

You can be better than this. Go to university. Get into debt, we'll pay it back. You chose this path. You know you want to follow through. Own that shit. Don't let anyone take your choices away from you. They have no right to.

From that minigame all I remember is that stock values go up and down over a period of time. Some stocks do worse than others and obviously some do much better. In terms if knowledge on AI, I've watched one or two videos from Primer on YouTube.

Anyways. To the question:

Could you teach an AI to observe and record one or multiple stocks over the length of a year and as a result have it be able to predict positive or negative trends in stocks of a current stock based on how the stocks it previously observed did?

To be honest, all I think it would be able to do after only one year of observations is simply emulate those trends and not really be able to predict any future ones due to how uncertain things like stocks are.

b1oie0,Is it time to cancel the Tor Project?,"This may sound like an extreme opinion on a controversial topic, but hear me out.

&#x200B;

I first heard about the Tor Project in 2011, I believe. Back then it was referred to as 'The Onion Router', and was presented as a privacy tool with the capability of protecting free speech even during censorship attempts from dictatorial governments anywhere in the world.

&#x200B;

Around that time, I heard about the Tor Browser in the context of the so-called 'Dark Web', where you could find some texts, transcripts, leaked information... and you could also, allegedly, buy drugs, hire hitmen, and download child pornography and all sorts of paraphilia. I always assumed the hitmen thing was an exaggeration by the media, but the other things certainly were there.

&#x200B;

Fast-forward to June, 2018. A government crisis is happening in Venezuela, and the local ISP successfully blocks access to the Tor Network, including its obfuscated bridges, for at least 2 months straight. It is unclear to me why the blocking started and why it eventually stopped. Apparently it happened again in January, 2019, but the point is that, when Tor had a good moment to shine for Venezuelans, it was defeated by the government. In other words, the best reason for Tor to exist, in spite of all the crimes committed under its anonymity, failed to justify its existence.

&#x200B;

To me, the cons far outweigh the pros. What do you think?

&#x200B;

Edit: Deep Web -> Dark Web  
Edit 2: To clarify, the intention of this post is to discuss if Tor still has a legitimate reason to continue existing, since the original benefit of protecting free speech may now be no longer obtainable in the event of government censorship, and since it still is largelly used for the easily provided anonymous access to the Dark Web",2019-03-16 04:24:33

6oegmn,I'm freaking out.,"Hello all. Sorry for this, but recently I've been having an internal crisis. I am in the summer after my freshman year, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, and feel like I have no clue what I'm doing. So far I've taken a class in C++, and that's basically it. I'm also starting to work on a video game with my brother. Everything with the video game is pretty simplistic. We are using Unreal Engine, and are just diving in and learning how to use everything by following an online class (150 or so episodes). I should also state that I've always wanted to make video games, but it was always a pipe dream to me, until I switched out of Molecular Genetics after the first semester because I had friends that taught me the basics, and made me realize it's doable.

Recently I've been doing a lot of research into video game development and app development. I'm freaking out because I feel like I know absolutely nothing about what I'm reading. I understand that I'm new to this, and that maybe it should all sound like gibberish, but don't want to fall behind. 

My main question is, will I learn all of this stuff? Or is it just expected that I've been working with computers my whole life and that I should know it already? I now realize that all I know is basic C++, and an idea of object/class oriented programming. I love what I'm doing so far, as it simply seems like a giant puzzle that I solve by building more pieces. Everything is going well, but I don't want to end up in a class next semester and not had any idea what is going on. I am absolutely on board with doing my own research and self-teaching this stuff, but ran into the problem of not knowing anything when I started researching.

TLDR: New(ish) to computer science, and have no clue what most stuff is when I do research into app development, game development, etc. Should I be worried, or will I be taught everything that I need to know.",2017-07-20 06:20:56

hgaqep,Quantum Computing for High School and University,"Imagine being able to simulate the  quantum mechanical properties of an atom.  So far, we are only able to  approximate how the atom behaves. But what if we can simulate exactly  how the atoms behave. With Quantum Computers, we can! Quantum Computing  has been said to impact countless  industries, from medicine development  to chemistry to material science. Companies like Google, IBM, and  Amazon have all jumped into the race to design and build the first  commercialized Quantum Computer.

Great! Now that I got some of you high school students interested, I highly suggest that you take a look at the [QuBes Summer Camp](https://www.qmunity.tech/qubes-camp), hosted by [Q-Munity](https://www.qmunity.tech/). QuBes is a beginners QC summer program that takes place from July 20th  to July 31st. The course requires no prerequisites AND will be taught    by Ivy  level professors from Harvard, MIT, and Oxford. QuBes is a great opportunity for high school students who want to get an edge  during college admissions as well as an advantage in the tech space  when applying for a job.

Assuming that 3D humans created human simulations, and that those simulated humans created more human simulations and so on and so forth, it has been argued that it is more likely that we are in a simulation then not. But if we had say, 12gb and then ran a singular program which simulated 12gb of memory, no matter how many times we did that, we would never exceed the original 12gb that the original memory had. Going by the same logic each human simulation would not be able to simulate another simulation of equal quality since the entire program would still need to obey the original “12gb” size. Basically, am I correct in saying the idea that a simulation’s simulation would not be able to just keep on creating more simulations?",2022-03-19 05:48:10

pmjoaf,Writing a Program that Simulates Coin Flips,"Here is a problem I thought of:

&#x200B;

\- Suppose I am watching someone flip a fair coin. Each flip is completely independent from the previous flip.

\- I watch this person flip 3 consecutive heads.

\- I interrupt this person and ask the following question: If the next flip results in a ""head"", I will buy you a slice of pizza. If the next flip results in a ""tail"", you will buy me a slice of pizza. Who has the better odds of winning?

&#x200B;

I wrote the following simulation using the R programming language. In this simulation, a ""coin"" is flipped many times (""1"" = HEAD, ""0"" = TAILS). We then count the percentage of times HEAD-HEAD-HEAD-HEAD appears compared to HEAD-HEAD-HEAD-TAILS:

&#x200B;

    #load library
    library(stringr)
    
    #define number of flips
    n <- 10000000 
    
    #flip the coin many times
    flips = sample(c(0,1), replace=TRUE, size=n)
    
    #count the percent of times HEAD-HEAD-HEAD-HEAD appears 
    str_count(paste(flips, collapse=""""), '1111') / n
    
    0.0333663
    
    #count the percent tof times HEAD-HEAD-HEAD-TAIL appears
    str_count(paste(flips, collapse=""""), '1110') / n
    
    0.062555

From the above analysis, it appears as if the person's luck runs out: after 3 HEADS, there is a 3.33% chance that the next flip will be a HEAD compared to a 6.25% chance the next flip will not be a HEAD (i.e. TAILS).

&#x200B;

**My Question:** Thus, could we conclude: Even though the probability of each flip is independent from the previous flip, it becomes statistically more advantageous to observe a sequence of HEADS and then bet the next flip will be a TAILS? Thus, the longer the sequence of HEADS you observe, the stronger the probability becomes of the sequence ""breaking""?

&#x200B;

xnhdio,Distributed CPU emulation - feasibility and future?,"Since learning about virtualisation I've never really understood why we still organize computers in the static way of having the CPU controlling component fysically dedicated to that CPU and running a single kernel. Why isn't there an abstraction layer consisting of firmware that provides an uniform software environment for software to run on? The answer is that in a sense that already happens but since the components are dedicated to a single computer the current situation is just making the most of the limited resources available.

But for a server and especially a virtualisation platform this system design seems needlessly constraining. If instead running software on a single location the resources where part of a larger distributed environment resources could be used more efficiently and it would be scalable by design. So the question I'm trying to answer is why don't we do that? Are there systems doing this, apart from some supercomputers?

The only suggestion I could find is that it has to do with timing. I must admit I'm surprised by how short one clock cycle is (1GHz per cycle = 1 nanosecond = 1 billionth of a second). At those timings transfering electricity over variable distances through copper might be a problem. But on the other hand I don't really see why that should be a problem: timings would still be predictable and if you're so dependend on just-in-time delivery this is a problem then I'd say there're too many and too strict dependencies. And optics would still be fast enough I think.

So in my mind it should be possible to have one platform, running software 'detached' from the hardware - like with processor emulation - hosted by many systems/components. I would say a distributed system over a network should even be possible for compute heavy tasks. Why don't we have this, or at least companies like cloud providers?

I guess it would either be too expensive (or not in the financial interest of companies) or a legacy from the past. It 's an interesting thought though: it felt very obvious and logical how we do computing, but the more I think about it the more random and inefficient it seems. I think people a 100 years from now will have a hard time understanding the past.",2022-09-25 08:12:19

tperu1,"Multilobal AI? A question for those who know a great deal about Artificial Intelligence, Robot Confidence, and Voltron.","Yellow Lion discourages Black Lion from picking up the cup but doesn't tell Black Lion why. Red and Blue Lions are indifferent and have nothing to add. Green Lion encourages Black Lion to pick up the cup but not so severely as Yellow Lion is discouraging.

However no Lion except Black Lion can make the final decision, who is taking the pressures from Yellow and Green lions into account despite not knowing *why* each Lion is advising in the manner they are.

Left to its own devices and information Black Lion would pick up the cup. This is bolstered by the pressure from Green Lion. However Yellow Lion is so strongly against the idea that it ends up discouraging Black Lion from doing so although Black Lion doesn't know why.

The goal in this simple example is to have five intelligences that pursue information in different ways that then inform an executor AI who weighs it against the choices it would otherwise make. These independent AIs would never inform the other about the information it processed or how it came to that conclusion beyond to say a yes or no with greater or lesser intensity. However the executor AI (the black Lion) would *after the fact* attempt to discern why it was advised the way it was without ever actually being told why. As in .. it could be wrong and it knows it could be wrong and for this reason it has doubt.

Then i did a bit of research on google bc i was wondering why were computers limited/only use 32/64/128/256bit int and unity uses 32bit floating point presicion and it only works well till 100 000 units from Vector3.zero.
After that u get error/warning in inspector and the models and textures are glitchy.
So after googling i found that:

Double-precision floating-point format (sometimes called FP64 or float64) is a computer number format, usually occupying 64 bits in computer memory

Only 64bits in memory?
Why dont computers use 1024int numbers or even 4096/8192bit integers.
Compared to normal hdd that have 500+GB of memory or even RAM memory if they are talking about it,its still a fraction of it and wouldn't take much space.
And CPUs today can do billions oc calculations per second so even if its a 8192bit numbers pc shouldnt have a problem.",2021-09-19 19:26:26

If this is indeed true, then as long as a packaged program can run on a system, it would have to be a type of OS.

ki2em7,LinkedList: Remove the kth node form the end," **Question:** Write a function that takes in the head of a  `Singly Linked`   
 List and an integer k and removes the kth node from the end of the list. The removal should be done in place, meaning that the original data structure should be mutated (no new structure should be created). Furthermore, the input head of the linked list should remain the head of the linked list after the removal is done, even if the head is the node that's supposed to be removed. In other words, if the head is the node that's supposed to be removed, your function should simply mutate its value and next pointer. Note that your function doesn't need to return anything. You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least two nodes and, more specifically, at least k nodes.

Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to the next node in the list or to None / null. if it's the tail of the list.  


 

**The Solution:**

    class LinkedList {
      constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = null;
      }
    }
    
    function removeKthNodeFromEnd(head, k) {
      let first = head;
        let second = head;
        let i = 1;
        while(i <= k){
            second = second.next;
            i++
        }
        if(second == null){
            head.value = head.next.value; // Why can't I do: head = head.next
            head.next = head.next.next;
            return
        }
        
        while(second.next !==null){
            second = second.next;
            first = first.next;
        }
        first.next = first.next.next;
        
    }

**I have understood the above algorithm for the most part. Except why I need to have:**

           head.value = head.next.value;          head.next = head.next.next; 

**Why can't I just replace the above lines with a single:**

    head = head.next",2020-12-22 09:55:56

hresk4,csrankings.org is biased. We need a better research based ranking website for CS.,"Many of you know the importance of university rankings while applying to a grad school, especially if you are an international student. I am an international student and I relied upon [csrankings.org](https://csrankings.org) to shortlist the universities based on the research. I always thought this website was well maintained and could be trusted. However, a recent incident has changed my opinion.

Being a beneficiary of the website, I was personally motivated to keep it upto date to help new international students applying to grad schools. I noticed there were many missing faculties in the AI field at McGill University and thought I would submit a pull request. To my surprise the pull request was denied by the repo owner citing that a particular faculty was not a full-time employed at the university (the policy was to exclude faculty who are <75% at the University). In this case, I personally know the faculty and I told the owner that the faculty was a full-time employee and is in a tenure track. I also told him that they supervise newly admitted students (MS and PhD). But then came a big surprise. The repo owner told me that the faculty is a head at an industrial lab and hence only way to verify if that person is >75% at the university is to check their financial records.

This reply made me upset because:

* The website essentially gets updated at the discretion of one person. He chooses to ignore a particular pull request (PR) citing some policy of the website. However, there are many other faculties on the website who are part-time researchers / head at some research labs (I can speak for many AI faculties in this case). There is no way to get their names removed because one can't produce the faculties' financial records to prove that they are correct.
* Many so called policies are not mentioned on the website but the owner brings them up while submitting a PR. In my opinion these policies should be put on the website so that the students who look at the website are not being misled.
* The owner doesn't accept ECE faculties who supervise students admitted to CS because they don't fit the policy. However FAQ page of the website mentions the following statement:

>As mentioned above, tenure-track faculty who can advise PhD students in CS can be included regardless of their home department. The primary audience of CSRankings is prospective graduate students who are seeking a postgraduate degree in Computer Science.

But when I asked him about this, the person mentioned that the faculty of ECE has to be listed on the CS website. However, in a later part of the conversation, he says 

>websites are generally lagging indicators at best

You can find the entire conversation during [here](https://github.com/emeryberger/CSrankings/pull/2723#pullrequestreview-448465670). I find it hard to accept the fact that the website I trusted the most is actually faulty.

I hope there was a better research ranking website that is unbiased, give a good indicator of whether a faculty supervises a PhD or MS students (irrespective of the % spent at the university) and where the policies are applied to all the universities and faculties. In fact, the website should have a better policies.",2020-07-15 01:53:59

gnf2qa,Should I drop out of university?,"So here’s my situation: I’m a first year Computer Science undergrad in the UK who had no previous programming experience prior to uni. I have no friends on my course to help me if I’m struggling and I have overall had a really negative experience of computer science so far. 

My first semester module marks were decent, I averaged out at a 2:1. However I didn’t do great in my programming module, I got a 2:2.

My second semester was not great. I didn’t revise for exams until the last minute, some exams I did good in and got firsts, others I failed. I had a group project where I barely contributed because I felt so out of place and behind. I didn’t understand what was going on and it was quite fast-paced so I couldn’t keep up. I received some of my second semester programming module results today and I’m likely on a 3rd, or if I’m lucky a 2:2.

I can’t say I have an overly keen interest in computer science but I think that could be because I’m not good at programming. It feels like everyone around me on my course is doing great and I’m the only one behind. Not to mention I have literally no friends. 

So what should I do? Stick at it and practice programming everyday for the next 3 months until the start of 2nd year or drop out/transfer to another degree (my other dilemma is I don’t know what I’d otherwise be interested in)?",2020-05-20 16:56:00

agf6j1,Independent Study,"So I was forced to take an independent study this semester. The semester ends tomorrow, and I have my final. My problem is that it was supposed to be a ""game design"" IS, but I lost interest in the program my school has after two days. I talked with my teacher about it, and since they know me, I was able to switch it last-minute to an essay about Kali Linux, which I started learning about a week ago.

The problem is, between school and preparing for college, I really only know like half of the terminal commands and I can't talk about hacking (my high school is very conservative when it comes to computer science, ""hack"" is like saying the f-word) so I need some topics of essay-writing about Kali Linux.

Anything goes. How to create notes, how to download extra things onto Kali, anything that doesn't involve ""hacking behavior"" (not my words).

ad9md0,"Chemical, CompSci.. or Engineering ? 🤔","Hi everyone!

I am a student who lives in Italy and attends (after a year thrown into management engineering) chemical engineering, but I am not convinced of my choice.

Let's start with the two things that interest me the most

1. ***Chemistry***.  I'm very interested in chemistry, my mother teaches organic chemistry and I really like biology, microscopic work, genetics, natural sciences. But I do not know if / how I would like to work actively in this field.

2. ***Computer science***.  I've always been a fan of computer science, technology and everything around it. I would like to work on projects that are interesting for me but I don’ t like programming so much.. it does not excite me a lot.

I have chosen chemical engineering because I imagined it was the connection between this two things that I like the most, but in reality it is not so .. and after reading so much on careers, I can say that I don’t like to design system or something like that.

What can I do ? What do you recommend? The only choices I have in mind are 1) change towards chemistry 2) change towards computer science 3) find a course that unites both (and not engineering)

Thank you very much to everyone, I am open to questions

61ty5s,The Greatest Sorting Algorithm of All Time,"Hello all,

This sorting algorithm has been a pain in the butt since it started. I'm not sure if it is any better than pre-existing algorithms because I have no way to express the complexity. Many of you stated in the past that the boxset sizes would be too large for it to be linear time. Then I thought of using medians to get a o(logn) thing going and then I realized you can use the number that causes a new boxset to be created as the pivot. But I also realized that large numbers would have large boxsets and small ones small- the same n2 situation. So I decided to find the biggest number smaller than the conflict number in the current list (o(n) search) and find how many numbers are smaller than that and subtract how many are smaller than the conflict to find the maximum number of elements. If this is not clear please let me know.

I realize it might be o(n^2 ) because the number of times you can have conflicts might be o(n) but i think not because there is the reindexing case. For example if n/2 of the boxes have subboxes then each of those subboxes can have at most two elements. At every successive level the number of possible conflicts is more than halved.

I think it might be some o(n^x ) where 1<= x <= 2 The reason i express this in this manner is because i am honestly not so interested in pursuing this any longer. If you guys still don't think there is anything to it, then I'm done.

One is called “Big Data” and the other “Data Engineering”. 

As background: I’m a graduated in Business and Administration (in Chile), and now I have a steady job analyzing copper exports. I’m not sure I’m doing what I really like, and programming is something that really interests me as a tool to improve my professional skills or (maybe) as a whole new career. I have some basic programming knowledge in html, css, and JS. I think the data part of programming is really interesting, and believe it can be applied to almost anything. Since I know some basic concepts, and look forward to keep studying the next couple of months until the curse starts, I feel that I’m somewhat prepared to go into computer science and to specialize in that field of study. I'm kind of lacking some advanced math and statistics concepts, but I do have a really big interest in learning them.

Being in subs like this, I’ve come to understand that it’s really important to learn the fundamentals and the theory behind this (and all other) CS concepts.

5bdunv,Algorithm Analysis : Average number of Comparisons help with HW,"So after trying to get an answer for this question for about two weeks now, asking my lecturer and not fully grasping his explanation,  I am now turning to you reddit:

http://imgur.com/a/QxdFE   

Image 1-2 is the question

3-4 are my lecture notes (How to calculate number of comparisons average case analysis)

5 is the start of my latest attempt

I am stuck on **1(C)**

This is a master's level course in algorithms and analysis.

In general I am not too comfortable with getting the average case for the number of comparisons so some general steps or tips here would be helpful.

The search algorithm in the question appears to be a jump search (or similar) so my answer should be √n as far as I am aware.


I am having trouble following the lectures notes, from the formula (http://imgur.com/c02X7cg ):  

A(N) = Σ P(Ii)T(Ii)

ΣP(Ii)= 1/n   (value is equally likely to occur in any position in the array)

T(Ii)=?? I don't really understand this. Is it supposed to be the total number of comparisons done? or the total number of comparisons/ number of input cases?


I've put this question up as last ditch effort for he night before heading to bed, let me know if it isn't clear what I'm asking.

Thanks for any advice!

4ohs2r,"High school student looking to get as big of a head start as possible before belly flopping into the computer science world, have a few questions.","Hello, thanks for giving me the time of day. It is summer (obviously) and I am heading into my junior year of high school, a time most students begin stressing out over their future and careers (I started doing that a long time ago). I want to pursue a career in computer science and reach for a job in the video game industry. Maybe Ill change my mind about what Ill do with the degree in the future, we`ll see. Anyways, I digress... I need some advice and answers, hopefully one of you would be kind enough to help a kiddo out. :) 

1) After looking into getting a head start on this career path, one thing I saw suggested was taking an online course. [This one to be specific.](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science#introduction-to-computer-science) After setting up a github account (which I look forward to using in the future) I quickly realized the kind of time investment this would be. I saw that I could either audit the class, effectively taking the class for free without obtaining a certificate at the end of it, or pay for the class and get the certificate. My question(s) are as follows; Is taking a class like this worth my time? Should I simply pay for it to get this certificate? More importantly, what should I do **now** and through high school **before** I apply to and (hopefully) attend a college with a good comp sci program? **How can I get a head start?**

2) Can I obtain a position in the video game industry with a degree in this? Vague I know, but truth be told I`m not sure what position I would want. I kind of just have this fantasy of being on a dev team, coming up with ideas and making them reality. Sorry, that was too cheesy, I vomited a little.

Computers have always fascinated me, I built my own and I am extremely happy with it. If I never found my love for computers, I would not have ever had the pleasure of talking to you lovely people! As a young kid I may have more questions not too far in the future, fair warning haha.

4jlloe,I'm spending way too much time trying to decide a minor can anybody help?,"Sup Reddit I just finished my first year in university a little while back and I'm having difficulty deciding a minor as there is a lot that intrigues me but I can only have one minor and I figure it might as well be something that compliments my major nicely. The minors I was looking at were in no particular order:
Biology, Business Studies(entrepreneurship), Stats , Math , Creative writing , English, Philosophy. I don't go to a prestigious(buts it's still solid) school and they're comp sci program doesn't seem like anything special so in my head I don't feel like my degree would be able to carry me as far as some others might be able too. I feel like I need every edge I can get, what would you recommend? 

Side note: I might want to come back for a masters later but ideally I would love to get straight to work right out my bachelors. Also data scientists look intriguing I don't know how good the job prospects for those are in Alberta , Canada(I guess I'm willing to move). ",2016-05-16 15:11:51

What can you do with C++? 
I will be learning this in college as my first programming language. I know that all we will learn is basic commands, input, output, if/else statements, etc. But is there more to the language. Like for example will C++ help in building an app or developing a game?",2016-04-26 01:49:33
4gfg31,Economic principle in Engineering: Will CS majors be out of jobs?,"So my college is 75% CS majors. The CS major is a broad field; there are diverse topics like computer security, software engineering, design, etc. The graduates of the CS degree earn on average 70,000. My school released the statistics and companies that they work for. 

And I thought to myself: why do these people learn CS? Already, the CS knowledge can be learned online, essentially, for free on Udacity, MIT Opencourseware, Stanford Online, Edx, Coursera, and even some Youtube videos. Albeit, some of these online classes may be introductory, still there are some topics that can be learned online for free.... Also for me, I go to college to access the biology and chemistry labs since I need experience in labs- which no company or research firm will give me, so I have to learn it through school (where tuition is a skyrocketing $60,000). 

But CS is a skill that can be learned online and at home.... for free. 
So I don't know why these people are paying so much to have a piece of paper with the words- Bachelors of CS. Already major technology companies like Google don't even require a CS degree, since a lot of companies want to see projects which are a better demonstration and showcase of CS skills. (However, a CS degree is necessary to validate CS research and academia). 

Yes I know that the CS field already pays well.  [Sorry for the long post so far, but here is my real question]: 

CS is already a rapid growing field. The reason why CS majors make so much to do programming is because of the lack of current CS employees. But as the trend of those that are majoring in CS are continuing to rise, will the CS jobs be filled and the salary diminish according to the Economic Law of Supply and Demand? 

From my own personal experience in interacting with CS kids, it seems that a lot of them only know how to do CS. The kids in my school (and I'm not bashing on CS kids from other schools or anything), don't want to learn anything else... They don't like English to improve communications; or any other science to expand their knowledge. They only come to school to learn CS. 

And as the advances of artificial learning continues, and already some software can write their own codes, do you think those one-dimension CS kids will be out of jobs? Especially if they can't bring anything else into the table. 


And now before you start hating on me: Yes I admit, I write a lot. I need to get to the point quicker. I know my English isn't the best. Blah Blah Blah. I was just wondering about these CS kids. 
And yes I do take some CS classes with these CS majors since CS is an elective requirement. I don't complain about the CS classes (because I already learned the material online); but I do feel like the CS majors are wasting their time and money. Just an observation.

and no i'm not hating on all CS kids or people. I just need some different insights. ",2016-04-25 21:06:57

2zharz,Prospective CS Student - Need Help Selecting a Laptop,"I'm currently a senior in high school, and am planning on pursuing computer science in college. I've taken multiple courses on CS through online classes both traditional (through VHS, formal teaching) and relaxed (Code Academy, YouTube tutorials). I am also currently enrolled in an Object Oriented Java Programming class through my local community college. I'm totally excited to get more involved in Computer Science in college. 

Problem is, I don't have a laptop. (Not one that could get me through college, anyway) I've been using my family's laptop to get me through high school thus far, but the time has come to find one for myself. 

I'm looking for something that will get me through at least my 4 years in college. I'll be attending a university which requires lots of walking, so I'll need something that is manageable and can easily be carried around. Currently, I'm looking at either the MacBook Pro with Retina 13-inch base model (~$1400 w/ education discount and AppleCare) or the MacBook Air 13-inch maxed out (~$1400 w/ education discount and AppleCare). Storage isn't such a big issue for me, as I don't download lots of movies or big files. I think 128 GB should be plenty, and if I need more I can just use the SDXC slot or an external drive. Both models would come with 8 GB RAM, but the Pro would include a higher wattage processor that would be much better to use. I've never really gamed on a laptop, so graphics performance isn't a huge issue. Mostly, I browse YouTube, social networking, research, word processing, and coding. I always have tons of tabs and windows open at once. Both of these machines have pretty comparable battery lives, and either would likely get me through the day no problem. OS X is great for managing workspaces, which is why I'm going with either the Pro or Air (Unless there are any strong objections with incompatibilities).

2po01j,An Important new Theorem in Computer Science an information theory (I'll leave the last few lines of proof to the interested reader),"Nishikala's Little Theorem by William Evans

Definition 1:
Whenever 'n' is used throughout this paper, it is defined as follows:
Let n be some integer s.t. n > 0.
Express n in standard binary format and add leading 0's such that number of digits (bits) equals 2k, where k is the smallest integer s.t. n < 2k 
This is exactly equivalent to standard computer storage of an integer as a nibble (4 bits), a byte (8bits), 16 bit integer, 32 bit integer... always choosing the smallest data type that is large enough to contain n.
Definition 2:
ni is the ith bit of n (thus ni = 0 or ni = 1)
Definition 3:
0j is a bit-string of 0's i bits long and 0i ith 0 of such a bit-string
Definition 4:
^ is exclusive operator on 2 bits:
0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
Definition 5: 
The 'Prime Tick' of integer n, 'n, is defined recursively as follows:
'n1= 1 ^ n1
'ni+1 = 'ni ^ ni+1
We recurse the whole length of the bit-string, including any leading 0's added to n as described in definition 1.
Definition 6: 'Tick' of integer n, ""n, is defined recursively as follows:
If n = 0j, then n"" = 'n. (i.e. if n = 0j, we use the 'Prime Tick' Operator)
Else ""n1 = nk ^ n1
""ni+1 = ""ni ^ ni+1 
Recurse the whole length of the bit-string until ""nk = ""nk-1 ^ nk
Lemma 1:
'0j = 2j - 1
Proof:
'01 = 1 ^ 0  = 1
Now let '0i = 1, then
'0i+1 = '0i ^ 0i+1 = 1 ^ 0 = 1
By Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI),
'0i = (11...1) = 2j -1
Definition 7: ""q(n), where q is a positive integer, means apply 'Tick' Operator q times
Definition 6: Q Operator on a positive integer n is defined as follows:
Q(n) = ""...""(""n), where we recursively apply the 'Tick' Operator until one of 2 cases occure:
a) ""q(n) = ""p(n), for some p, q such that 0 < p < q
b) ""q(n) = 0j, for some q
Note that in case a) the 'Tick' Operator generates a cycle of length q - p. (Proof omitted; it is not necessary to prove our Theorem)
Lemma 2: if ""m = 0j, then m = 1 and j = 0
First observe that ""1 = 1^1 = 0
Now Proof by Contradiction:
Suppose ""m = 0j, for some integer j > 0 , and n != 1
Then, either m = 0j or m !=0j
Case A: m = 0j
then ""m = '0j = 1j != 0 (by Lemma 1)
Case B: m != 0j
then m = (m1m2...mj) in base 2, where j mis a binary digit and at least 1 mj is 1.
let mr = 1, be first 1 in bit-string
if r != 0
then
""mr = ""mr-1 ^ mr
Since n1...nr-1 are all 0, and 0 ^ 0 = 0, we know ""nr-1 = 0
Therefore:
""mr = 0 ^ 1 = 1, therefore ""m != 0
if r = 1, then
""mr = mk ^ m1, where k is length of m expressed as a bit-string
Then either:
a) ""mr =1 ^ 0 = 1    ==>    n"" != 0
or
b) ""mr = 1 ^ 1 = 0
if case b), then find mi such that mi is first 1 in bit-string s.t. i >= 2
then
""mi =  ""mi-1 ^ mi
""mi = 0 ^ 1 = 1 ==> ""m!=0
Since m1...mi-1 are all 0, and 0 ^ 0 = 0, we know ""mi-1 = 0
QED
Definition 7: The Modal Modulus of Q(n), |Q(n)|, is the number of distinct integers, not including 0i, in the sequence generated by Q (n)
Definition 8:
If Q(n) generates a cycle, and |Q(n)| = 2k - 1, we say that Q(n) is Maximal and write:
Q(n) = O(n)
We call O(n) a Formal Q-Cycle
Note that this means O(n) generates a cycle that includes every integer from 1 to 2k
Lemma 3: |Q(3)| = 3
Proof:
3 is (11) base 2
""(11) = 01
""(01) = 10
""(10) = 11
We call (11) the First Formal Tick and write
|(11)| = 1
We call (01) the Second Formal Tick and write
|(01)| = 2
We call (10) the Thirst Formal Tick and write
|(10)| = 3
Lemma 4: |Q(15)| = 15
Proof:
15 is (1111) base 2
""(1111) = 0101
""(0101) = 1001
""(1001) = 0001
""(0001) = 1110
""(1110) = 1011
""(1011) = 0010
""(0010) = 0011
""(0011) = 1101
""(1101) = 0110
""(0110) = 0100
""(0100) = 0111
""(0111) = 1010
""(1010) = 1100
""(1100) = 1000
""(1000) = 1111
Again, we call (1111) the First Formal Tick, (0101) the Second Formal Tick ... through to (1000) the Fifteenth Formal Tick, and write:
|(1111)| = 1
|(0101)| = 2
...
|(1000)| = 15
Definition 7: Product and Quotient
""m x ""n = ""(m+n)
""m/""n = ""(m-n)

Lemma 5: Quantic Powers Lemma [QPL] 
22k - 1 = (22(k-1) - 1) x 2k + (22(k-1) - 1)
Proof:
Let '<<' be the binary 'left bit-shift' operator that shift every bit in a bit-string to the left by a specified integral amount.
So, a << k, is eviquivalent to, a x 2k
Then,
22k = 1 << 2k, in binary
22k - 1 = (1 << 2k) - 1 = (111213...12k)2
            = (1112...1k0k+1...02k) + (0102...0k1k+1...12k)2
            = ((22(k-1)) << k) + (22(k-1) - 1)
            =  (22(k-1) - 1) x 2k + (22(k-1) - 1)
QED

Theorem 1: 
Nishikala's Little Theorem
For all n, s.t n = 22k - 1, |O(""n)| = 22k - 1
Proof:
3 = 22 -1 and 15 = 24 -1 (Lemmas 2 and 3), So Theorem holds for k =1and k = 2.
Assume:
a) |O(""(22k - 1))| = 22k -1
and
b) |O(""(22j - 1))| = 22j - 1, For all 0 < j < k
S0,
22(k+1) - 1 = (22k - 1) x 2k+1 + (22k - 1), (Quantic Powers Lemma [QPL])
 = ( (22(k-1) - 1) x 2k + (22(k-1) - 1)) x 2k+1 + (22(k-1) - 1) x 2k + (22(k-1) - 1), by [QPL]

This is a wall of text post about my struggles in life that I'm giving to the kind folks at r/computerscience so that you redditors can give me some perspective and guidance and maybe share some of your own hardships.

I was a single child with a single mother who passed away in 2007. I was left with her house and a mortgage to pay during the big recession. Instead of selling it for an unsatisfactory price and continuing with school I dropped out of High School my senior year and started working manual labor jobs to afford the mortgage since it appeared to be the better financial choice to hold on to my house. I was weak in Math back in high school and not really trying in my studies anyways due to my mother's health. I never really tried in school during my life anyways... I always had my personal problems. I was always struggling with personal issues of having a drunk abusive father who was always in and out of Jail.

After working manual labor jobs for a couple years I eventually worked up to $15/hr as I found that a company I was working for found that they benefited more from my IT skills than my facilities maintenance abilities. I got lucky as our CEO retired and my boss who previously did most of the IT moved on to a better and higher paying position. I took over part time as an IT Support Specialist, had my mortgage readjusted and started going back to school in 2010.

After having a dose of ""Real World"" slamming me in the face so unexpectedly I definitely don't want to major in anything less than something that will directly get me a job right out of college. Sociology, Psychology and Earth Science are pretty interesting but there's no way in fuck I'm going to get myself into more debt to get a degree that's anything less than a meal ticket for the rest of my life. I have the experience in Computers, I live in the Silicon Valley, my friends all work in the computer industry... I want to fucking study computer science.

By attending 6-8 units per semester for the past 3 years I have all my General education and non-major coursework out of the way. Now I just need to do Math. After barely scraping by Algebra 1 with a D in High School and dropping out of Algebra 2 I'm finally finishing my Algebra 2 community college course this semester. So far as long as I keep my head up these next few weeks I should get an A. However, it's fucking HARD for me. I have my girlfriend helping/tutoring me all the time when I'm stuck. I'm doing almost every problem and exercise in the book instead of just doing the assigned work load and I'm trying SO HARD just to get this 'A' in a remedial math class that most of you probably breezed by as 15 year olds. I feel it's a huge joke for a 24 year old to be struggling with such a minor math class. (apparently this algebra 2 class is pretty hard though, systems of linear inequalities, introductions to summations, formulas circles, elipsses, and hyperbolas, logs, inverse functions)

Given all these math struggles, and lack of math experience, and lack of schooling in math how hard will it be for me to continue through this Math conquest and Juggernaut my way through to 3rd year calculus, vectors, linear algebra and differential equations? Can I do it? How hard will it be? Where can I expect troubles?

Am I the only aspiring computer science major who's been completely math-tarded attempting to forgo these math classes?

v9e9lj,"I had an idea for a sorting algorithm, but I'm not sure exactly on some details of it and I need help with making it efficient","So the idea goes like that: it's an improvement of bubble sort, that goes through the array, if it founds two elements that are in descending order then it saves the index of the first of them (index1) and continues until it founds two elements that are in ascending order and saves the index of the first of them (index2). The next step will be to reverse the subarray from index1 to index2, and that's because all the comparisons we did beforehand showed that it was descending subarray, and we do it by swapping elements with the following indexes: index1, index2, and then index1+1, index2-1 and then index1+2, index2-2 and so on until it reaches the middle of the subarray (or one of them, in case that the subarray has an even length).

&#x200B;

Now the problem is that even before I implement it, it already has way too many problems with its efficiency:

&#x200B;

1. Should I check the whole array, and if I found any reversed subarrays then save their start and end indexes, and after I finish checking I then reverse them or instead do the reversals while checking the array instead of in the end it?   
On the one hand, the first method requires too much memory to save each time, but the other one can cause that it would reverse the subarrays, but then after the first pass, most descending subarrays will be in the length of two, which means all their swaps will be between adjacent elements, which means the algorithm becomes almost like bubble sort which will make inefficient. So my point is that both of them have disadvantages, so I'm not sure which one will I use
2. Should the subarray also include identical elements (what I mean by that is that in the process of finding the descending subarray I will still continue searching for it not only when the next element is smaller than the previous but also when it identical)? I think it reduces the amount of swapping sometimes but it also means two things:
   1. The algorithm swaps pairs of elements that don't need to be swapped because they're identical.
   2. If it avoids what I mentioned before, then it will have to check first whenever they're pre-swapped. If they're, then stop the reversal of the subarray and continue with the rest of array, and if not, then swap and continue with the reversal process. Now I do know that the first pair ( index1, index2) is one I don't need to check because I know that I have to swap, and that I don't need to do the checking in subarrays that have less than 4 elements, but what do I do if I do have 4 elements or more? it would mean that I need to extra comparisons either until I reach the last pair or until I reach identical pair, but that's also very inefficient because it means I need to check twice if a pair is ascending or descending.
3.  If I do choose to include the previous step of including identical elements in the subarray, should I also go back in order to check whenever there were identical elements before I started saving the start and end indexes of the subarray in order to include them in the subarray? again, it reduces sometimes the number of swappings but it can increase the number of comparisons because it can cause repetitions of pre-done comparisons. The solution I thought of is that I will start to do the process of finding this subarray (in case it exists) already when I see two equal elements so I will avoid repetitions, but then it means that I need do a lot of steps of increasing index2 until it finds adjacent elements even when that subarray isn't even decreasing, which means that even if the array is fully sorted it will still require more steps than just comparing elements
4. After I reverse the subarrays, do I need to merge them until I reach one array or should I just continue with the process of reversing them until there are no descending subarrays (or that everything that comes after the first reversal is already sorted)? because merging means that it won't even sort the actual array but rather create out of it another sorted array, but if I do want to sort the actual array then I need to copy it to the main array which will take extra time. The other option doesn't seem good because at some point it will be almost like bubble sort.

f9f6hq,how does proxy server works ?,"Every computer on the internet needs to have a unique Internet Protocol (IP) Address. Think of this IP address as your computer’s street address. Just as the post office knows to deliver your mail to your street address, the internet knows how to send the correct data to the correct computer by the IP address.

A proxy server is basically a computer on the internet with its own IP address that your computer knows. When you send a web request, your request goes to the proxy server first. The proxy server then makes your web request on your behalf, collects the response from the web server, and forwards you the web page data so you can see the page in your browser.

When the proxy server forwards your web requests, it can make changes to the data you send and still get you the information that you expect to see. A proxy server can change your IP address, so the web server doesn’t know exactly where you are in the world. It can encrypt your data, so your data is unreadable in transit. And lastly, a proxy server can block access to certain web pages, based on IP address.",2020-02-25 19:00:25

In my experience most entry level (CS2) courses are taught in an OOP language like java or c++, and most students in these courses struggle with the concept of recursion. I believe that switching over to a hybrid language like Scala would give students a better understanding of recursive calls via the functional aspect of Scala (perhaps require students to do some labs only in a functional manner).

My doubt are about which path should i take to study something about game programming to achieve a title in this sector to achieve a junior job maybe one day? I don't even know if I really need to take another title related to game programming or if a computer science's degree is enough.

Sincerely, I'm at my first year and I don't really know how all this stuffs works.

I'm studying Unity, like any other beginner,  to start exercise and thinking about mini-projects to do just for fun and to improve my skills; and obviously I'll study on my own everything that could be useful or interesting, cause like I've said: I love all the concepts of computer science.

Even if everyone could program a game just scripting at 18 years, I want to learn the computer science itself, and the degree is something that I'll take in any case, indeed I believe that are required certain knowledge to program more advanced part of a game like the IA or the graphic engine (with a lot of math).

So, just to introduce myself, I'm 20 y/o, studying for a CS Bachelor's degree and also an intern at the intelligence area of a bank.

You can pretty much assume by this little bit that I'm just starting my career and have a lot (a tremendous lot) of stuff to learn right? And I agree a 100% with you.

But... do you know what I've always liked to do and also helped me to learn a lot of different things in my life? SHARING.

That's right everybody, I've always been the guy who talks to everyone in the group, the one who likes a good chat (and have learned how to actually learn useful stuff from these chats).

So I thought to myself, why am I in this new stage of my life not sharing daily problems related to CS, Unique University experiences that only happen on universities, something I found online that could be helpful someway or another... And the reason I'm not really sharing these and other experiences is because I don't have much friends into CS, BUT I HAVE YOU!

Okay, now once and for all here's the deal, what would you guys think of an 1 hour or maybe 1 hour and a little bit chat on discord per week, where we could talk about something that happened at work, at uni, at starbucks, whatever, SHARE our experiences with each other, looking for our own development.

If you like CS you probably already know that we learn a lot with each other every single day (stack overflow is the proof of that right) so, if you already know and also like that, I know your gonna love this idea as much as I do.

So please, if you are interested and would like to SHARE your experiences with other CS (or maybe not, who knows) mates in order to have a great time meanwhile learning something new, just say NEYMAR in the comments below and I will definitely create the discord group and later decide the best day, time, etc (boring stuff).

qiu1wc,Programming Languages are overrated,"I have been thinking about this from a long-long time and thought of sharing this here. Programming Languages are given a lot of importance than they deserve in the programmer community. I have seen a lot of people flexing that they know x number of languages which is incredibly shameful. Most of the programmers(90%+) would always give programming languages a lot of importance. Programming languages do not matter much. 

The core concepts of programming matter a lot more than programming languages but still a lot of people want to learn more and more programming languages. Senior software engineers know this that programming languages don't matter as you can learn a programming language thoroughly well in a night if you know the concepts well. By concepts I mean all the things that are applied while making a product(e.g. a web app), if you know compiler design, it would be incredibly easy to grasp a language, that is where concepts pay off.

This problem's cause is bad platforms and bootcamps but I would not name them. They teach the programming language and nothing else. That does not pay off as you might get a freelance job for 10$/hour but you won't be able to land a good 100k+ job at a good company. And I won't even like to call you a programmer if you just know the programming language.

You actually get the taste of core concepts when you go to get a CS degree from a formal college. Yea, I hear you saying that ""Duh, I can't go to college"", then learn it yourself. I myself am 14, started to program seriously since 13 and I can't go to college too. So I started learning the concepts myself. I do not know a lot of programming languages and I just know JavaScript that too not to a great level but I have come to learn system design and databases pretty well and I can make a web app easily. 

Programming Languages are just a way to implementing our programming thoughts, it is just a tool. Just like english is a language to express our thoughts about philosophy, science, etc. Do tell me your thoughts about this, I would love to read them.

acchsa,Studying is not like everyone said and my study life is one of the most boring in my group of school friends. Is it just my university or in STEM?,"Hello,
I'm studying CS at RWTH Aachen. So far I always have been told, that studying is a really awesome time. That there you can find the best friends, participate in many different communities, do tons of interesting stuff.
But the last few months of studying were for me quite bad. I learned almost all of the time, neglected all my friends, found not many interesting new people here, had no time for extracurriculars and don't feel like here are a lot of parties.
I somehow feel like I'm missing out on something. Additionally, from my old friends I hear that they on the other hand meet a lot of new people, have a lot of time, go to a lot of parties, protests... Most of them though are studying social sciences, although one also computer science (but at a different University)

Apart from that, I'm not sure anymore, if computer science is the right subject for me. I like the technical and practical and even some of the theoretical aspects, but I miss my social life. I worry how a future job could look. Will I work for hours in front of a desk? I believe I will miss workmates, variety and moving around.
Has someone maybe a good article that explains, how the jobs in CS usually look?

I'm thinking about taking a break, doing some internships and maybe changing University. What do you people here think about my situation? Would a full year break be a waste? Would changing university to one that is less focussed on technology be an option? Then I would miss out on interesting research, right?

Tl;Dr: my study life is boring. I only learn and am unsure, wether I really want to work in cs later. I can't really imagine, how it would be. (To few social contact, variety?) Im thinking about chsnging to a more general university in a bigger, more active city.",2019-01-04 00:50:55

Hi there!

I've been teaching myself how to program for a couple years now. I started out with CS50 and went on to a series of projects. These projects have taught me a lot, but they are mostly practical. I feel that my knowledge of many of Computer Science's topics is still quite limited.

I've become a fan of YouTube videos which explain general aspects of programming. My favorite channels are Computerphile and some of Sebastian Lague's and Tom Scott's videos (especially in the ""The Basics"" series). I have recently discovered Reducible, which is on its way to become one of my favorites, too.

Here are some of the characteristics which make them unique:

* The quality of their content.
* The beauty of the video (and its animations) - let's exclude Computerphile from this :)
* They are (mostly) language agnostic.
* The overall narrative is organized in such a way that it is a pleasure to watch these videos.
* I can't find a better word for this: these videos are *beautiful*

Do you know of any other such channels? I'm open to other types of resources, too (books, websites, etc.).",2023-01-13 12:27:59

slotas,Integrals and Floats: Is that it?,"To represent values, it seems that computer scientists have settled that the only things they need are integral types that represent whole numbers (-1,0,1,2) and floating point numbers (.25, 10.0, Positive infinity, NaN). These come with modifiers for the size of the variable (eg int and long or float and double) and whether they are signed or unsigned (eg uint or int). 


After that, representations of any other mathematical object come from combinations of integrals and floats and the functions defining their uses. For example, a vector is a struct of floats that adds componentwise, can multiply with scalars by multiplying each element, and can dot product with another vector.


Why don’t computers support more data types? I know that there is specialized hardware for specific operations like FPGAs, but there are types that any computer should be able to use. 


I’m not an expert in hardware design or machine code, but I think that as an example, a “polynomial” data type could be used to reduce the size and increase the speed of many programs. 


A polynomial is an expression of the form “y = ax^b + cx^d …” To represent this with an array of bits, I suggest the following rules. I believe it should be possible to create circuits to support this. 


Starting from the right, add the length of a string of ones times x to the power of the number of 0s to the right of the string. 


As an example, here are the polynomials that 4 bits can represent with this system:


0000: 0

0001: 1

0010: x

0011: 2

0100: x^2

0101: x + 1

0110: 2x

0111: 3

1000: x^3

1001: x^2 + 1

1010: x^2 + x

1011: x+ 2

1100: 2x^2

1101: 2x +1

1110: 3x

1111: 4


It should be possible to create circuits that take an integral or a float and a polynomial and output an integral or float that the polynomial returns when called on that value. It should also be possible to create circuits that add, subtract, multiply, divide, and do function composition on pairs of polynomials. 


The polynomial rule I described above does not support negative coefficients, but that can be fixed with the rule that the coefficient is, where L is the length of the string of ones: ((L%2==0)? -L-1 : L+1)//2. 



0000: 0

0001: 1

0010: x

0011: -1

0100: x^2

0101: x + 1

0110: -x

0111: 2

1000: x^3

1001: x^2 + 1

1010: x^2 + x

1011: x -1

1100: -x^2

1101: -x +1

1110: 2x

1111: -2


This rule extends to larger strings of bits in an intuitive way. 


Variant ideas:
A type that multiplies all values by x to get rid of the constants. 


A type for floating point inputs that uses the inverse coefficient instead of the coefficient to better represent certain important infinite series including the Taylor series expansions of sin(x) and e^x.

s011f6,Why did it take so long for consumer OS's to get UNIX-like features?,"Forgive any and all ignorance as I ask this question please. As I understand it, Linux was the first open source UNIX-like OS, correct? And UNIX itself has been around since 1969!

My question is, if the robust stability and security features like protected memory, preemptive multitasking, secure user accounts/admin stuff and all that have existed for so long... why did Mac OS and Windows both lack any of that robustness until a full decade after Linux was created?

In other words, if we had a way to make an OS that would virtually never crash and had orderly memory management and security and the rest, why did Apple and Microsoft both ship such fragile OS's that could be toppled by a single rogue app and were generally terrible at security and for *SO* long?

Apple even had [it's own UNIX implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/UX) for the early Mac computers complete with the System 7 GUI laid over top. Anyone care to speculate why THAT wasn't just the Mac OS everyone got? Microsoft also [licensed a UNIX version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix) from AT&T in the early days.

d4zuy1,How to create General ai,"There is alot to talk about especialy about programming i tried to make it as simple as possible by avoiding it,this is easiest solution i know.I could write a book about it but dont have much time left so I would never finish it.U can read more on twitter jure cvitanovic on facebook these are blog posts.

Reasoning

Reasoning is tricky cause ai doesnt know shit for sure if it doesnt have input and calculations without input are cruical for decision making,especialy priority.U have to draw radiuses min max if u want precision on translation(movement)pathfinding with weights is good but u need to divide and conquer cause u cant run pathfinding on large area and u have to run it a lot of times regulary especialy on new input or output.Interest can help determine probability cloud in an area but u have to account for new events and baits.Bait can be predicted when something is out of interest of living beings double bait when time for objective on ""better solution"" is to good for robot and bad for humans(based on location for example).Distraction bait when u calculate what opponent doesnt want u to do and bait takes ""realistic time"" or longer and times differentiate between cloud of probability for thing they dont want robot to do and bait.

Its important to establish interest and how it manifests itself.For example if u avoid killing people u avoid translating things into their body or excessive input on their bodies in different ways.

Excessive input can be calculated as things done by people(or other beings) that hurt (input of unusual movement for example)them but dont happen inside simulation.

Past is important factor here cause even if thing is translated near(projectile) past can determine intention.

Interest can be simple like love,survival ( like sub can be need to belong ,power ,money ,health)

Love can also be part of survival but design of spreeding genes doesnt help u survive but your kids.So its important factor even if it increases health.Health can be linked to increased perfomance for calculations.

i could list alot of situations but the point is that u have to generalize a bit then based on micro actions u feine things u dont understand.Scientific thinking which takes separate thread or processor deals with thing not logical by simulations where u have to question certain things and define new one with as little attributes as u can cause ure just have a bloating mess.

For no input red data on electronic devices about certain things like people u go with geographic data based on accumulation of things of interest or u can skip and avoid it in calculations if u dont have any.

if u include it in calculations u screw up the systemcause u get to many error in decision making (this might be less obvious).

Priorities are very important in reasoning cause they can decide success or failure.U generaly want to avoid more risky decisions but its unaviodable cause ai doesnt know everything.U need to caclulate things on a fly for redecisions (adjustments),giving up on a desicion(part of an objective single or many depends how u program it)is generaly bad idea unless the effect is negative (bait).U usualy want to adjust and avoid switching to alternatives especialy to late cause u have different stats(location effects on body etc) and things generaly need to be precalculated which could falls into adjustment category.Time is an factor but bigger factor is conflict of interest,effect of threat can be actualy calculated without any data on it based on ""logic"" of simulation.

Data from that can be established and fed into database.For example experiencing an explosion,purpose of actions(translating circular object when interest is harm at low speed could potentially be harmles unless there is uncertainty of possible chemical reaction and act on ""doing"" something with the object to avoid self harm or object being activated based on movement time or enviroment attributes)can help u determine the goal of decision or simply decision of other living being or effect of an simulation(robot running from lava cause of heat as a thread aswell reduced visibility large amount of mass and etc-u run simulation of impact on a fly to determine effect).

Priorities are such as time,distance(difficulty lots of conflict),other beings in area and enviroment simulations all can be generalized into other and expanded by calculations if u do them with uncertanty based on very primitive rules and not expand those more when calculating,depends how u want to do it. 

Ai input

Its separated by physics simulation and prediction of living beings since they dont obide laws.

Living things have more iregular shape,structure of bones is relevant to be calculated and can be determined by shading of skin or if with clothes by running cloth simulation,calculating shape of body then determining where bone lie based on ""uplifting"".For all that u need to determine the shape of body ull gonna calculate.Double camera (like eyes) help alot in that prediction otherwise u have to rely more on movement.Beings tend to have rigged surface noisy texture prolongated(depends on a being) based on shape of a being.Math for simulation is already there it will be wrong to a degree cause of hardware so u ll gonna have mistakes but with time those mistakes show so if u recalculate

the decision making of output shouldnt be to bad if u think mistakes would ""grow"".Structure of being also has to be determined cause some dont rely on bones but have shell or bone less structure.

Visual input is probably the hardest.

Other input may be sound,transfer of data via electromechanical waves(option of hacking or sniffing)

thermal data(bad at distance but can help in close encounters) .

This would belong to reasoning but it s worth saying that all data not made logical by simulations is produced or is human.Things produced by humans tend to have purpose linked to interests,strange textures that dont make sense when time is a factor(cause maintenence-sign of human activity nearby in time scale) .Things made by human are not alive cause they still run by simulation just illogical to exist ""normaly"".

Other input could be vibrations like explosion but its kinda nonsense cause u can blow input device and still confirm such event via visual sound or thermal.

Dust(smoke) as a problem in determining beings can be removed on delta time with simulation.

Things on camera such as dust become obvious very quickly since they stay relativly same position during movement and distance calculations are ""wrong"" for it.

Misconceptions about agi.

Robots dont know things for sure there is probability of mistake when predicting living beings

and what they do if u dont have input.There is lack of precision in simulations cause of hardware

but u can tune that how u like to a degree.

robots dont have to be ruthless it all dpends who writes politics for action which are there to limit

stuff like skynet happening ,or something u dont want which is spoken alot in safety of ai.

robots need to be a generalist and to reduce having to many of them which would increase cost and

all have their vulnerabilities they need to have a shape of a human or to some degree depends

what is their basis of movement what materials they are made of and etc.

robots can be destroyed by high powered weapons explosives missiles since they cant act perfectly since they dont know everything and estimation has to be decided they can fall into traps or destroyed at distance by humans they are not invincible.

if they have to act fast the have to rely on fast decision making which i called instinct which can be wrong.so if u make one thats the tricky part.u have to decide stuff like priorities and radiuses of actions and interest.

robots dont evolve 20000 years in a week they ""prefer"" to do things cause thinking takes time and has high probability of ending nowhere to its more effective to just act.

robots can build other robots either from scratch or by having blueprints and copying code.

so being an ai engineer doenst make u special or a god.

u cant build robots solely with machine learning even if program can learn anything cause then it cant understand things ,u cant run infinite simulations on life especialy since its changing and same situation may never occur again.Even if u generalize some things its still far to little weights to be effective,if u generalize to much then u have useless shit.

If u want to prove me wrong be polite and ill discuss and explain

Also I didnt say how to calculate everything mentioned but if u ask i will",2019-09-16 12:18:36

- Brown University
- California Institute of Technology
- Columbia University
- Cornell University
- Dartmouth College
- Duke University
- Harvard College
- Harvey Mudd College
- Massachusetts Institute of Technology
- Northwestern University
- Pomona College
- Princeton University
- Rice University
- Stanford University
- Tufts University
- University of Chicago
- University of Pennsylvania
- University of Southern California
- Vanderbilt University
- Washington and Lee University
- Washington University in St. Louis
- Yale University

1) Which of those colleges do you NOT recommend for a CS major please? (I need to narrow it down more… 22 is too much)
2) After graduation, I’d like to work in California state. Would studying in a college from another state affect badly my chances?
3) Which of these colleges’ communities have the least presence in CA?
4) Would you recommend other colleges and universities that I should add to my list?

Note: I’m an international student, in case that affects anything.

Edit: I'm avoiding public schools because they don't give scholarships to international students, and my family cannot afford to pay for them. Are there any exceptions, some public schools that do give full-need met for internationals?

Note 2: I still haven’t taken the SAT yet, so I can’t know which are reaches /matches/safeties from this list for me. But I’m aiming for +1530. So let’s assume everything will go as planned for now. If not, I’ll have to update my list accordingly later.

pqhh7v,CMV: The Halting Problem doesn't make sense,"I'm going to be referring to the problem as its framed in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macM\_MtS\_w4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macM_MtS_w4).

My problem with it is twofold: one, its an entirely immaterial program, and arguably doesn't 'do' anything (in a sense, it can't be run--not can't finish, it can't even *begin*), and two, it violates the laws of physics. Nobody was ever expecting a general solution to physically impossible or instubstantive programs, and for that reason I find the halting problem entirely vacuous.

Its very similar to the following 'contradiction':

1. Statement 2 is a lie.
2. Statement 1 is true.

Many people have seen a problem like this before, and its relevantly similar to how the halting problem is laid out. If you accept statement 1, then that implies statement 2 is false about 1 being true, meaning you've contradicted your initial assumption. If you assume statement 1 is false, then that means statement 2 is true, which means statement 1 is true, so which contradictions the initial assumption.

My problem with this 'contradiction' is that its entirely insubstantive. It doesn't bottom out in the real world anywhere, and I'm not convinced the problem can exist anywhere other than pure linguistic pedantics.

To demonstrate this, see a similar problem:

1. Statement 2 is true.
2. Statement 1 is true.

Here's the question: how do you evaluate these two statements? Are they both true? If you assume statement 1 is true, then that means statement 2 is true, which confirms your assumption, no contradictions. So they're true then? But wait, you can do the same by assuming they're false. If statement 1 is false, then statement 2 is false, meaning statement 1 is false, just like your initial assumption.

Technically you can do it with just one statement, to make it more like the halting problem:

1. Statement 1 is true.

So there's absolutely no way to evaluate these statements. My argument is this: 'truth' does not make sense unless you bottom out in the real world somewhere. Truth, accuracy, correctness, all it really means is that there's a 1 to 1 correlation between a representation and reality, but there *is no reality being represented by these insubstantive statements.* It leads to an infinite regress, which is why its unsolvable--you have to know the truth of statement 1 to know the truth of 2, and you have to know the truth of 2 to know the truth of 1.

The contradictory version is the same--also leading to an infinite regress of insubstantive questioning, we just don't notice because we get caught up in the contradiction.

Notice how a series of statements that bottom out somewhere substantive can be solved:

1. Statement 2 is true.
2. Statement 3 is true.
3. Statement 6 is true.
4. Statement 5 is true.
5. Statement 6 is true.
6. Statement 9 is true.
7. Statement 8 is true.
8. Statement 10 is true.
9. Statement 10 is true.
10. I ate eggs for breakfast this morning.

This time, we *can evaluate the statements*, no matter how long it is. This is because we bottom out at something we can empirically evaluate, and then derive the truth value of the other second-order statements (statements about other statements). But when a set of propositions contains *only second order statements that don't refer to anything except each other, you can't evaluate it.* But if you break the infinitely regressing cycle with a substantive statement, the problem disappears. No matter how long the series of meta-statements goes, as long as they bottom out somewhere substantive, you can solve it.

This is relevantly similar to the halting problem, because in the same way that we're evaluating the truth of an insubstantive statement, we're also evaluating the haltability of an insubstantive program. In order for the program to be run, we'd have to know the results of the program, which depend on the results of the program, which depend on the results of the program... ad infinitum. It only becomes a problem because we've made up a completely meaningless and immaterial thing. How would such a program even *start*? Where would it get the inputs? In the same way that circular sets of statements can't begin evaluation, this program can't begin to run.

That's not to say that someone couldn't *attempt* to write such a program. Only that they would fail. The program they generate would be a real thing that exists in the actual world, but it would never be relevantly similar to H+ (as described in the video). To demonstrate, lets try it, and showing why it can't be done will be illuminating.

Suppose you created a Python program that looks like this (ignore boolean/string conversions for the moment):

    # read output from file
    outcome_file = open(""outcome.txt"",""a"")
    outcome = output_file.readlines()
    
    # flip the sign
    if outcome == True: 
        outcome = False
    elif outcome == False:
        outcome = True:
    
    # write to file
    outcome_file.write(outcome)

Also stipulate that the only program capable of creating the outcome.txt file is this program. No other program or user has done so. What will happen? The program will crash immediately if there's no pre-made outcome.txt file (which you can't do, because the program needs to be evaluating the outcome of something it itself generated).

Why'd the program crash? Well, you might say its because I made a mistake, but think about what would be required not to: the outcome.txt file in the second line would have to be ***THE EXACT SAME*** both in contents and time as in the one in the last line. You would literally have to go backwards in time to send the outcome of the program to itself in order for it to run. Turing is correct that this program can't be evaluated, but only because its the kind of thing that violates the laws of physics.

Some people might continue to object: ""That's exactly what Turing was getting at!"", but that's a sleight of hand--the question wasn't whether *H+* can exist, its whether *H* can exist. Sure, we've shown that the program doesn’t work when its own output is required to run it, turning it into H+, but that's only because H+ contradicts the laws of physics. H+ may fail to exist, but that doesn't demonstrate that H can't exist, any more than saying ""you can't run H on a computer that's in the shape of a square circle"" demonstrates that H can't exist. When you artificially construct a contradiction in the scenario, its not a sign of the other entity being flawed, its a sign of the scenario being flawed.

So brilliant. If you know a Python library that can send booleans back in time or perform other logical contradictions, then perhaps this will have practical significance to you. For those of us that want to evaluate real programs that can exist, the halting problem isn't meaningful.",2021-09-18 06:47:43

I believe many standard implementations of quicksort (e.g. std::sort, java.Arrays.Sort()) look at 3 different elements of the array and use the median of those 3 for the pivot. A study showed that looking through more different elements for the midpoint was less efficient than looking at only 3, even in very large arrays.

I'm now wondering about finding what I'll call a ""pseudomedian"" of a larger set of elements than 3. Here's my idea for that:

1. Take 3 sets of 3 elements of the array
2. Find the medians of each of those 3.
3. Those 3 medians are themselves a set of 3 elements. Take the median of those, and you get a sort-of pseudomedian of 9.

This could also be extended to any power of 3.

ioq6yp,"Difference between IDE, SATA, SCSI, Fibre Channel, and SAS","**Introduction**

The **hard disk interface** is the connecting part between the hard disk and the host computer system, and its function is to transmit data between the hard disk cache and the host memory. Different hard disk interfaces determine the data transmission speed between the hard disk and the computer. In the entire system, the quality of the hard disk interface directly affects the speed of the program and the performance of the system. From this article, you can understand the connector concepts of **IDE, SATA, SCSI, Fibre Channel and SAS** and their development process, and finally two important interface protocols: **AHCI** and **NVMe**.

&#x200B;

**1 Bus Interface Types**

From an overall point of view, hard disk interfaces are divided into **five types**: parallel ATA (PATA, also called IDE or EIDE), SATA, SCSI, Fibre Channel, and SAS. IDE is mostly used in household products. And some of it are used in website servers. SCSI is mainly used in the server market. While Fibre Channel is only used in high-end servers and is expensive. SATA is now the mainstream hard disk. Most notebook computers and desktop computers use it, and solid state hard drives also use it. SAS is generally used in servers. It has fast transmission speed and strong reliability. Under the broad categories of IDE and SCSI, there has a variety of specific interface types that can be divided according to different technical specification and transmission speed.

&#x200B;

**2 What is IDE?**

**2.1 Integrated Drive Electronics Definition**

The full name of IDE is ""**Integrated Drive Electronics**"", and its original meaning refers to the hard disk drive that integrates the ""hard disk controller"" and the ""disk body"". This approach reduces the number and length of cables for the hard disk interface, enhances the reliability of data transmission, and makes hard disk manufacturing easier. Many hard disks used to have IDE interfaces, but now almost all hard disk interfaces are standard with SATA.

IDE represents a type of hard disk interfaces, but in actual applications, people are also used to call it the first IDE-type hard disk ATA-1. This type of interface has been eliminated with the development of technology. With the time passes, more types of hard disk interfaces are developed, such as ATA, Ultra ATA, DMA, Ultra DMA and other interfaces are all IDE hard disk interfaces.

&#x200B;

**2.2 IDE Mode**

There are three transmission modes for IDE: PIO (Programmed I/O), DMA (Driect Memory Access), and Ultra DMA (UDMA).

The biggest drawback of PIO mode is that it consumes a lot of CPU resources. The IDE interface running in PIO mode has a data transfer rate ranging from 3.3MB/s (PIO mode 0) to 16.6MB/s (PIO mode 4). There are two types of DMA modes: Single-Word DMA and Multi-Word DMA. The highest transfer rate of Single-Word DMA mode is 8.33MB/s, and Multi-Word DMA (Double Word) can reach 16.66MB/s. The biggest difference between the DMA and the PIO is that the DMA mode does not rely too much on CPU instructions to run, which can save the processor's operating code.

Due to the emergence and rapid popularity of the UDMA mode, PIO and DMA are immediately replaced by UDMA. UDMA is a standard protocol under the Ultra ATA system, which is based on the 16-bit Multi-Word DMA mode. One of the advantages of UDMA is that in addition to the advantages of DMA mode, it also applies CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) technology to enhance the performance of error detection and debugging during data transmission. Since the introduction of the Ultra ATA standard, its interface has applied DDR (Double Data Rate) technology to double the transmission speed, with a transmission speed of up to 100MB/s.

&#x200B;

**2.3 IDE Advantages and Disadvantages**

Advantages: Compatible and cost-effective.

Disadvantages: slow data transmission speed, short cable length, fewer connected devices, no support for hot swap, poor upgrading ability of interface speed.

&#x200B;

**3 What is SCSI?**

**3.1 SCSI Basics**

The full name of SCSI is ""**Small Computer System Interface**"", which is a completely different interface from IDE. SCSI is not specifically designed for hard disks, but a high-speed data transmission technology widely used in minicomputers. It has the advantages of wide application range, multitask, large bandwidth, low CPU occupancy rate, and hot swap. So SCSI is mainly used in medium and high-end servers and high-end workstations. But the higher price makes it difficult to popularize like IDE. SCSI also has some potential problems. It has limited system BIOS support, and it has to be set for each computer. There's also no common SCSI software interface.

&#x200B;

3.2 SCSI Version

[SCSI Version](https://preview.redd.it/9va77mrmwvl51.jpg?width=586&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afbe6a86c11eb332f0d6e168dd7ee39da5c3a570)

&#x200B;

4 What is Fiber Channel (FC)?

4.1 Overview of Fibre Channel

**Fibre Channel** is the same as SCSI. It is not originally an interface technology developed for hard disk design and development, but specifically designed for network systems. However, as storage systems develop, they are gradually applied to hard disk systems. Fibre Channel is developed to improve the speed and flexibility of multi-disk storage systems. And it greatly improves the communication speed of multi-disk systems. The main characteristics of Fibre Channel are: hot swap, high-speed bandwidth, remote connection, large number of connected devices, etc. It can meet the high data transmission rate requirements of high-end workstations, servers, mass storage sub-networks, and peripherals for bidirectional and serial data communication through hubs, switches and point-to-point connection.

&#x200B;

4.2 Fibre Channel Protocol

[Fiber Channel Protocol](https://preview.redd.it/nwlay7w7xvl51.jpg?width=583&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=722202586f763da88594b9ed40032efeb3add19f)

&#x200B;

**5 What is SATA?**

**5.1 Serial ATA Definition**

SATA stands for ""**Serial Advanced Technology Attachment**"" or ""**Serial ATA**"". It is an interface used to connect ATA hard drives to a computer's motherboard. SATA adopts serial connection mode. Serial ATA bus uses embedded clock signal, which has stronger error correction ability. Compared with the past, its biggest difference is that it can check transmission instructions (not just data). Errors are automatically corrected, which greatly improves the reliability of data transmission.

&#x200B;

**5.2 SATA Interface**

Now the general interface is **SATA interfaces**. The reason why it can replace IDE is because the performance of the SATA is much better than that of the IDE. SATA speed is also much higher than IDE, and it also supports hot swap/hot-plugging.

Most of the computers we use are also SATA interfaces. The current SATA interface has three versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. The larger the version number, the later it appears, the better the performance, which mainly due to the faster data transfer rate. SATA 3.0 is the most common interface used today, though there have been four revisions since its introduction, namely 3.1 through 3.4. The SATA interface version is backward compatible, and the higher version is compatible with the lower. Some SATA hard disks provide jumpers. Due to the jumper settings are different, the version number of the SATA interface of the same hard disk is different. In addition, the actual transfer rate of the interface requires the support of the SATA motherboard.

SSD has better performance, smaller size, and higher interface requirements. High-performance SSDs have basically switched to M.2, U.2 and PCIe, but SATA interfaces will not be eliminated in a short time. It is still in mainstream market, especially the HDD market. The SATA 3.3 specification upgraded by SATA-IO also brings some new features, optimizing the support of SMR, and can be powered off remotely. SMR shingled magnetic recording technology can increase the storage density of HDD by 25%.

The SATA interface entered the 6Gbps era from the 3.0 standard in 2009. In 2011, SATA 3.1 was updated, SATA 3.2 was updated in 2013, and then SATA 3.3 was updated in 2016. These subversion upgraded have not brought many new functions. After all, the bottleneck of HDDs is not the speed, and it is difficult to make big improvements from the interface.

&#x200B;

**6 What is M.2?**

The **M.2** interface is a new interface specification. It is a new standard tailored for Ultrabooks to replace the original mSATA interface. Whether it is a smaller size or higher transmission performance, M.2 is far better than mSATA.

M.2 interfaces are generally divided into two types. When buying M.2 SSDs, you need to pay attention to internal agreements. One is to use the traditional SATA AHCI protocol, which has no difference in performance with ordinary SATA solid hard drives; another is to use the brand-new NVMe protocol, which can provide SSD performance up to 3000MB/s or more.

&#x200B;

**7 What is SCSI?**

**SAS (Serial Attached SCSI)** is a new generation of SCS technology, which is the same as the current popular SATA technology. It uses serial technology to obtain higher transmission speed and improves internal space by shortening the cable. SAS is a new interface developed after the parallel SCSI. This interface is designed to improve the performance, availability, and expandability of the storage system, and to provide compatibility with the SATA.

SAS technology can be backward compatible with SATA. Specifically, the compatibility of the two is mainly reflected in the compatibility of the physical part and the protocol. At the physical layer, the SAS interface and the SATA interface are fully compatible, and the SATA hard disk can be directly used in the SAS environment. In terms of interface standards, SATA is a sub-standard of SAS, so the SAS controller can directly control SATA hard drives, but SAS cannot be directly used in the SATA environment. Because the SATA controller cannot control the SAS hard disk. As for the protocol, SAS is composed of three types of protocols, which use corresponding protocols for data transmission according to different devices. Among them, the serial SCSI protocol (SSP) is used to transmit SCSI commands, the SCSI management protocol (SMP) is used to maintain and manage connected devices, and the SATA channel protocol (STP) is used to transfer data between SAS and SATA. Therefore, under the cooperation of three protocols, SAS can seamlessly work with SATA and some SCSI devices.

The backplane of the SAS system can be connected to dual-port, high-performance SAS drives and high-capacity, low-cost SATA drives. So SAS drives and SATA drives can exist in a storage system at the same time. But it should be noted that the SATA system is not compatible with SAS, so SAS drives cannot be connected to the SATA backplane. Due to the compatibility of the SAS system, users can use hard drives with different interfaces to meet the capacity or performance requirements of various applications. So they have more flexibility when expanding the storage system, allowing storage devices to maximize application benefits.

In the system, each SAS port can connect up to 16256 external devices, and SAS adopts a point-to-point serial transmission directly with a transmission rate of up to 3Gbps. It is estimated that there will be 6Gbps or even 12Gbps high-speed interfaces in the future. The SAS interface performance has also been greatly improved. It also provides 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch interfaces, so it can meet the requirements of different server environments. SAS relies on SAS expanders to connect more devices. Most expanders have 12 ports. 

Compare with the traditional parallel SCSI, SAS has a significant increase in interface speed. With the use of serial cables, it not only can achieve a longer connection distance, but also improve the anti-interference ability. In addition, this cable can also significantly improve the heat dissipation inside the chassis.

**8 Tech Guide: AHCI and NVMe Attachment**

Here we will focus on the AHCI protocol and NVMe protocol of the solid state drive (SSD).

There are two mainstream transmission protocols for SSD (Solid State Drive): One is the AHCI protocol, and the other is the NVMe protocol.

&#x200B;

**8.1 AHCI Protocol**

**Advanced Host Controller Interface** (AHCI), sets the operation of Serial ATA (SATA) host controllers in a non-implementation-specific manner in its motherboard chipsets. That is, AHCI allows storage drivers to connect advanced SATA functions. When we use SATA SSD, we must enable AHCI mode in the motherboard settings. This is because when the AHCI mode is turned on, the number of useless seeks of the SSD can be greatly shortened and the data search time can be reduced. So that the SSD under multi-tasking can exert all the performance and effects. According to related performance tests, after the AHCI mode is turned on, the SSD read and write performance is increased by about 30%. However, with the gradual enhancement of SSD performance, these standards have also become a major bottleneck restricting solid state drives. Because the AHCI standard designed for hard disk drives is not suitable for low-latency solid state drives.

&#x200B;

**8.2 NVMe Protocol**

Another transmission protocol is the **NVMe protocol** that represents the future performance trend. The so-called NVMe protocol is to make full use of the low latency and parallelism of PCI-E channels, greatly improve the read and write performance of SSDs under controllable storage costs. It reduces the high latency caused by the AHCI, and completely liberates ultimate performance of SATA SSD.

[NVMe Specification](https://preview.redd.it/h1ytcky4zvl51.jpg?width=465&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82dd70dcaf36596f438f33fca93f2f0aba38c978)

**8.3 Tech Note**

**8.3.1 PCI-E**

PCI-E (peripheral component interconnect express) is a high-speed serial computer expansion bus standard. Its original name is ""3GIO"". It was proposed by Intel in 2001 to replace the old PCI, PCI-X, and AGP bus standard. It belongs to high-speed serial point-to-point high-bandwidth dual-channel transmission. The connected devices allocate exclusive channel bandwidth and do not share bus bandwidth. It mainly supports active power management, error reporting, end-to-end reliable transmission, hot plugging, quality of service ( QOS), and other functions. PCI-E also has a variety of specifications, from PCI-E x1 to PCI-E x32, which can meet the needs of low-speed devices and high-speed devices in a certain period of time in the future.

The PCIe bus protocol can be directly connected to the CPU with almost no delay, making it an excellent companion to the NVMe standard. In the era of the AHCI standard, the actual performance of PCIe can hardly be exerted due to the agreement limit.

&#x200B;

**8.3.2 NVMe SSD**

Due to the [**flash memory**](https://www.apogeeweb.net/article/1865.html) particles and the main control, the SSD(solid state drives) price with M.2 NVMe protocol is very high, which is about twice the price of SATA SSD. So buy the corresponding level of solid state hard drive based on the configuration and requirements of the computer. Otherwise it will cause performance waste.

In terms of software layer, the delay of NVMe standard is less than half of AHCI. NVMe streamlines the calling method and does not need to read registers when executing commands. Each command of AHCI needs to read registers 4 times, which consumes 8000 CPU times in total loop, causing a delay of about 2.5 ms. NVMe can support receiving commands and prioritizing requests from multi-core processors at the same time.

NVMe has automatic power state switching and dynamic power management functions. The device can switch to Power State 1 after being idle for 50ms from Power State 0. If it continues to be idle, it will enter Power State 2 with lower power consumption after 500ms. There will be a short delay when switching. The SSD can be controlled at a very low level when it is idle. In terms of power management, the NVMe SSD will have a greater advantage than the AHCI SSD. This is important for mobile devices, which can significantly increase the power endurance of notebooks. Moreover, NVMe SSD can be easily matched to different platforms and systems, and can work normally without the corresponding driver provided by the manufacturer. At present, Windows, Linux, Solaris, Unix, VMware, UEFI, etc, support the NVMe SSD.

PCIe SSDs based on the NVMe protocol far exceed the traditional AHCI-based SATA SSDs in terms of performance and practicability. It can be said to be the future of the development of the SSD industry. But the traditional SATA interface will become the first choice for ordinary machine installations under the background of reduced manufacturing costs.

**8.3.3 Size Introduction**

The size and application of the hard disk can be divided into:

1) 0.85 inches, mostly used in portable devices such as mobile phones;

2) 1 inch, mostly used in digital cameras (CF type II interface);

3) 1.8 inches, used in some notebook computers and external hard disk enclosures;

4) 2.5 inches, commonly used in notebook computers and external hard disk enclosures;

5) 3.5 inches, mostly used in desktop computers. External hard drive enclosures with 3.5-inch requires an external power supply.

&#x200B;

**8.3.4 Interface Comparison**

SATA hard disk has a new design structure, fast data transmission, save space, and many other advantages over IDE hard disk:

1) SATA hard disk has a higher transmission speed than IDE hard disk. SATA can provide a peak transfer rate of 150MB/s. It will reach 300 MB/s and 600 MB/s with the development. At that time, we will get a transfer rate nearly 10 times faster than IDE hard drives.

2) Compared with the PATA40-pin data cable of IDE hard disks, the SATA cable is small and thin. And the transmission distance is long, which can be extended to 1 meter, making it easier to install equipment and wiring in the machine. Because the size of the connector is small, this kind of cable effectively improves the air flow inside the computer and also speeds the heat dissipation in the case.

3) The power consumption has been reduced. SATA hard drives can work with 500 mA of current.

4) SATA can be backward compatible with PATA devices by using multi-purpose chipsets or serial-parallel converters. Since SATA and PATA can use the same drive, there is no need to upgrade or change the operating system.

5) SATA does not need to set the master and slave disk jumpers. The BIOS will number it in the order of 1, 2, 3. While the IDE hard disk needs to set the master and slave disks through jumpers.

6) SATA also supports hot plugging and can be used like a U disk. IDE hard disks do not support hot swap.",2020-09-08 08:54:55

Tech/engineering because i think tech will advance the human race and thats cool and interesting. Law because i wanna help fix the system.

 But i chose law because i felt it fit my personality better and that id be better at it and excel, and im not the best at math (specifically struggled in calc II and felt this meant engineering is not for me). but i had an internship at a county firm and all the lawyers did was paperwork in their quiet office, which i dont want! Im social, and i want to work with people, and lead people (I have the ENTJ personality). 

The main reason I'm hesitant to get into tech/engineering is because I dont know I'd be good at it.... anyways, im lost.

fe31ut,Where to begin for starting a small coding project?,"Hello everyone! I'm a a noob to computer science; switched to the major not too long ago and have honestly struggled through the classes but will manage to finish my degree soon.

In my experience, the way that they taught the classes and concepts were all in different coding languages- every semester we learned a new language, from C to C++ to OCaml to Java and so on. I feel like I was just trying to cram and keep up with classes, which caused me to lack the depth in each language since I was just trying to pass the classes (stacking like 4 CS classes each semester) so I could graduate on time. The lack of depth hits hard when I'm faced with simple tasks like creating a simple program to do \_\_\_ or coding challenges that are open ended.

All the projects that I've done is through my classes- no internship, no side projects- and the projects that I've done have mostly been really small ones with a lot of help and backbone code provided to the students. The projects also lacked application to the real world and were simply stuff that taught us like algorithms and operating system concepts.

I want to start doing side projects and honestly have no idea where to start! I only have experience with the basic computer science concepts and don't know much about JavaScript or web programming, which I wish my school offered as part of my track. The other part that is annoying is that my school taught the classes on their computers with all the proper libraries and tools installed. I want to be able to create my own project on my own device (Mac) and to be able to create a project that users can interact with and run, and don't even know where to begin.

Does anyone have tips for how to start a small project? What languages are useful for doing web programming? What are good places to host the project and be able to see the results?

I'm not very bright and this topic seems fairly complex so I would appreciate it if you could explain it to me like I'm 5.  
My topic is called:  Lattices and Basis Reduction  
A little backstory:  
I'm a senior in high school taking Computer Science. We have an assignment due tomorrow called Theoretical Computer Science. When choosing our topics there was a big rush for everybody to write down their names under each topic as only 3 people may do each topic. I stayed behind waiting for the crowd to dissipate. By the time I went to write my name, there were about six open topics, and the person in front of me was taking a long time to decide on a topic, so I went ahead and wrote my name under the topic that had no names. By the time I sat down, my teacher came up to me and said, ""Hey, it's super cool that you chose this topic. Nobody in my class has ever chosen it before."" so immediately, I thought, huh that's cool, and then he added, ""It's also the most difficult one on the list, good luck.""  
I just need somebody to please explain this topic to me, again its called Lattices and Basis Reduction. Keep in mind I'm only a senior in high school and I feel like this is a very difficult topic. I've done a lot of research on my own, but I end up staring blankly at a Wikipedia page or other articles with no clue what I'm looking at.

&#x200B;

I'm not asking for anybody to complete my assignment for me, I haven't posted any of the questions here for that reason, I'm just looking for somebody to please explain the topic to me, as I find it incredibly confusing. My tutor is unable to help me as he is confused as well, none of my friends are doing this topic, and people from previous years are also not doing this topic. My teacher is also refusing to assist me as it is an independent assignment.

The tutor was able to explain the project and walk through it with me. Tbh, the project seems way to advanced for my class. But I was able to get most of it done and now I understand what was being asked of me. I was on the right track but instead of having having what was supposed to be done in the class file. I was trying to do it in the demo file. I don't feel as discouraged anymore. But I definitely will start studying more after my 6 week math class is over next week.

9p1c5f,I have a B.S in Chemical Eng from UCSD and am applying for an MS in Computer Science. Want some advice on which schools I am competitive for. Credentials listed below:," 

Hello everyone,  

First time posting here. I am hoping to get some advice on what colleges (Top 10, 20, 30, 40+ rankings) I can aim for based on my application (GPA, GRE, LOR's all described below). **I am hoping to apply for a Master in Computer Science this year and start in Fall 2019.** 

&#x200B;

I am an **international student** who attended UC San Diego from 2012 -  2016. I graduated with a degree in Chemical Engineering with a  Cumulative GPA of 3.065 (just met the cut off!) but major GPA is **3.65**. 

&#x200B;

I want to switch field from Chemical Engineering to Computer science due to the research I did in my senior year. During my undergrad (and a  little bit after graduation while I was looking for jobs), I was doing  research with one of my Chemical Engineering prof's in the  NanoEngineering dept at UC San Diego (for those of you who don't know,  the Nano and Chemical Engineering dept at UCSD is one dept and thus  prof's teach courses in both programs and are usually doing research  that applies topics from both fields). During this 9 month project, I  was working on writing C++ simulation code to model the diffusion of  nano-particles within polymers. Additionally, I also used a lot of  python and matlab for data analysis work. I had no prior experience in  programming before and taught myself C++ and python to conduct this  research with some assistance from my prof's Phd student. This project  concluded after 9 months since I found a Job and my professor got a better job at Duke University and moved to North Carolina.  

&#x200B;

Once that project ended, I wanted to learn more about computer science  and explore programming more. Since then, I have taken classes in Java,  C, Assembly, Data Structures, Discrete Math (UCSD + community college  depending on availability of courses) I have completed all lower  division courses a CS Undergrad is expected to take and am starting to  take some upper div courses at UCSD this fall. **I have received A's in all but one of those Computer Science courses (which was a B+).** 

 

Now, I do understand that since I am switching fields, some  universities may have me take some more undergrad courses in my first  semester/summer session which I am fine with. In fact, that is why I  want to go for a Masters program so I can get a formalized education  that covers all the fundamental topics in the field. I am also looking  to work on some sort of research project/Thesis during my masters so am looking for a 2 year program.  

&#x200B;

Here is a list of my credentials so far 

* Graduated UCSD, BS Chemical Engineering: Cumulative GPA 3.065, Major GPA 3.65 	
* GRE Scores: Quant 166, Verbal 153 AWA 4.5 	
* LORs: All the people mentioned below confirmed that they will write me really **strong** letters of recommendation 		
   * Prof I did research with in my senior year for 9 months 			
   * while talking Computer science courses at community college, I got  to know one of my professors really well and he is now the dept chair of  Computer Science at the community college. I recently spoke with him  and he suggested I should apply to top 10 schools like UCBerkley, UCLA,  UCSD etc and will write me a LOR to help with that 			
   * My supv at work who I have been working with since Feb 2017. Since  joining my current company, I have successfully completed a lot of  projects independently and helped him foster strong working  relationships with other dept's which prior to that were falling apart  leading to no progress at work. My boss has also confirmed that he will  write a really strong letter of Rec 			
* I have received A's in all but one computer science course I took so  far (I have been taking these courses while working my current job full  time 40+hrs/wk 	

SO: with that in mind, what colleges would you recommend someone like me to apply for? I really like the program at Harvard Eng because it is a  two year MS that allows you to work on a project for the second year  under an adviser in the dept. I'm not sure how different admission's  committees will view my application since I am applying from a different  field from my Bachelors and that my cumulative GPA is on the lower end  for most top 15 schools in the nation. Any advice is highly appreciated!  I tried my best to provide all the information I thought would be  necessary to evaluate my current situation but please let me know in the  comments if there's any more questions you have!  

&#x200B;

Thanks!  

&#x200B;

PS: I understand I don't need a masters degree to switch to Computer Science bu as mentioned above, I am international so it would be FAR more difficult for me to switch fields without at least a Masters degree. ",2018-10-17 18:34:33

You see, I love sports but I never take them to the extreme but I am good at them and I have the potential of going D1 in college but I've been seeing a lot of people who do D1 in college and honestly, their classes aren't the classes I would take to become a computer scientist. This is a problem with me because I am the third child and both my siblings are in college and one is in a really expensive school. If I take a D1 full ride will I still have time to study computer science to the utmost potential? Will D1 take up my time? Or do I better shot taking student loans?",2017-10-31 23:50:43

57hh1z,Comp sci homework help!!!! PLEASE!,"I am so desperate right now. In our assignment, we have to draw an image where it relies solely on 3 constants, which contains the x and y positions and the size of a shape of the image we're making. Say, a head for example. Now I had my image done with all my sizes and positions depending on the head constant.. but when I change my head constant, my image becomes VERY distorted. Here's an example:
final float MASTER_SIZE = HEAD_VALUE;
final float X_HEAD = width / 2;
final float Y_HEAD = height / 2;

here's an example of how i did the shapes
ellipse(X_HEAD - MASTER_SIZE) * a random value, (Y_HEAD - MASTER_SIZE) * a random value, HEAD_VALUE, HEAD_VALUE * a random value); 

The main goal in this assignment is to be able to change the constant freely without the image being too distorted.

4xs6u5,"People who majored in CS here, I wanna ask you something","My High School years are almost close to non-existent. I never studied for any class and barely passed most of my classes all four years. I never took Chemistry, Physics, Calculus, which are the main classes that I'll be taking in the next 3 years of college. 

I went to a shitty college for one year and decided to kick into the habit of studying. It didn't go so well, but at least I knew what it felt like to study for a class. I now understand that you have to put in time and dedication if you want to succeed in a class.

I keep telling myself before every semester begins that I'll do better than before. But after the first month or two, I get bored and just give up. I don't know what's wrong with me. Even in a shitty college with low academic levels, I can't even get a 3.5 or higher. 

I decided to transfer to a bigger University where I'll be dorming for the next 3 years. It has a higher academic level and it's obviously more expensive (3x the tuition). The campus is huge and textbooks are more expensive.

I'm taking Calculus 1, Physics 1, Discrete Math, and Intro to Computer Science. As someone who has NEVER took Calc, Physics, AP Comp Science, or Discrete Math, I'm anxious because there are going to be students who have took those classes in HS and are going to be ahead of me.

I'm mostly afraid of the professor going way too fast and I'll never be able to keep up. The only class that I studied my ass off for was Precalc in my 1st college, which I got an A in it.

4cfiqr,How does sustainable development apply to software engineering?,"World bank website defines sustainable development as follows.

>""Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.""

For me it is clear how it applies to fields like agriculture, construction and manufacturing because they produce tangible products. So, it is easy to measure the positive and negative impacts of their practices on the natural environment and society.

But the concept is a bit abstract for professionals creating software. The product (software) is intangible. There is no direct impact on the natural environment due to the process of typing the code. It's like an author writing a novel. But except he writes it on his computer without using paper. 

So, how does software industries and professionals who strive sustainable development relate it to their fields. Do they consider the end result of the software. That is what it will be used for. For example -writing software for functioning of a solar powered device can be called sustainable development in comparison to writing software for a (hypothetical) coal powered lawn mower.

wx5bub,Self-Teaching Computer Science is Impossible!,"Learning how to program is doable. Learning computer science without an in-person expert to ask seems impossible to me, frankly.

I'm studying basic algorithms and practicing leetcode. I can perform the algorithms, write the algorithms, and solve basic leetcode problems. However, frequently I get stuck on things like proofs and time complexity analysis. And here in lies the rub.

I find it impossible to verify/proof that a particular solution works, reliably, or to respond to proofs I find in any way other than acceptance. For example, I see a proof. I say, that seems reasonable. I perform a number of examples to verify it. It verify the chain of logic. Fine - But this is the same process I perform when I think of an algorithm to solve a problem, which may or may not work, frequently not working because I am frequently blindsided by a counter-example to my algorithm that I didn't consider.

This then makes me think: is there a counter-example to these ""accepted"" proofs? How is it proved that there is not? There is the chain of logic, but logic seems impossible to trust. I understand that the logic is based on axioms, but that doesn't help. 

Further, I don't understand how I am to think about algorithms or proofs. Is it a matter of being able to perform the logic mechanically until it becomes intuition? 


Here are some example of a proof I find difficult for the reasons I stated above (proof a DFS visits every node):

Other Questions:

-Why is Big-Oh notation SO prevalent? Why are we never interested in describing more precisely how an algorithm runs, and for small sizes of inputs? Surely, this would provide a more complete picture?

-For reasons I described above, it seems like computer science is very difficult to learn in isolation. Do you think that this is a problem particular to computer science, due to its strict logic, or only more apparent? If it is not only particular to computer science, then what is a person missing when they choose to study any particular topic in isolation?

My understanding is that binary code represents values in machine code? But how are those values processed by a CPU? If I imagine it I’d think of little pulses of electricity (a bit that’s on) pulses to the CPU. I’m supposing that the CPU’s frequency is how quickly those bits pass through? But from my understanding of logic gates and transistors. They seem to just add up values of these bits. So how does a single value that goes into one end of a chip get processed through many transistors to make a useful calculation? 

So for example if we have an OR gate/transistor, and two binary codes 00000010 and 00000001 pass through it…the output should be 00000011? But what does that then do? Where does it fit in?

I have about 3.5 years of experience in the consulting industry and am trying to imagine what I should be expecting or working towards 5 or even 10 years from now.  So far I've mostly been programming and designing software.

The questions i'm asking myself are similar to: should I specialize in some subset of the industry ? Should I get my Masters? Should I try a product-based company?

I realize there are no clear cut paths or ladders to move up, but am hoping to get some input on what kind of work you do (preferably CS majors with many years of experience). Did you end up in a managerial position? Do you still write code as part of daily job? Is there a position or time where pay doesn't increase if you remain as a programmer?

Now I don't want to bore you with a sad story to make you feel sympathy for me and want to help, but I feel some aspects should be highlighted to explain my situation. I'm currently suspended from my program at Carleton University in Canada. I was originally enrolled in Computer Science: Video Game Development but due to a devastating lack of motivation that has been with me ever since I was in grade seven I found myself falling short. I became all too comfortable with plagiarism and thus ended up falling behind because I never learned any of the things I needed to so come exam time I was crushed. In all honesty I'm afraid. Scared that I fucked up too much this time to recover, so here I am. No I'm not here to beg for handouts, no I'm not here to hear someone try to comfort me telling me to just chin up and get through it. What I'm here for is advice. This suspension is my wake up call and I need to do something about it. I need to learn to become a proper computer scientist in the span of 8 months so I can prove to myself its worth staying in my degree. I have no support from my family as my mom and I are a low-income house hold. I work a dead end part time job where the hours are pitiful and I'm struggling to pay my rent, student loans are out of the question as I've lost my full time student status as I am only eligible to take two electives per semester for a year. I need resources to learn from, I need drive and motivation so I don't fail again. I need hope. I come here asking for you, bright and intelligent computer scientists who know the ropes to guide me, tell me what I need to do, what online credentials I can obtain, anything and everything so that I don't fail. My knowledge in programming is very limited, I understand the basics of many languages but my application skills are horrendous, which intimidates me when I'm looking for a job so I can cover my ass for the 8 months that I don't have full proper classes.

Lastly, I'd like to apologize for being this pathetic and not having any control in my own god damn life. I just need help. I don't want to be like this anymore.",2015-06-03 21:26:41

wbk6w2,How does paging work?,"I understand this question seems kind of vague, so I'll narrow it down with a couple main points I desperately need answering - nowhere else has managed to answer it in a way I feel satisfied.

1. Why does each process need its own paging table? Doesn't each process get given a page to work with? I understand memory isolation as a concept, just not how this really ties in
2. I don't understand why multi-level paging is better than single level paging - I understand that single level paging requires an address for every single page in the virtual memory model (which is huge) corresponding to an actual physical address and sometimes a bit extra to say whether the address is actually valid or not. But in the case of multi level paging, it will still need to store address' and offsets to other virtual page tables, so how does this help?

u5duhz,What exactly are bitrates?,"I've seen youtube videos telling me that the bitrate is the number of bits in a second and that even if a video has the same resolution it can have a different bitrate but how is that possible? I thought every frame of a video is stored by storing the address and rgb value of each pixel, and then the same for the next frame, but then every video with the same resolution would have the same bitrate. Obviously the file would be really big and I just found out that these are called raw video formats. But then doesn't that mean that bitrate is actually result of compression? But then doesn't that also mean that all videos with bit rates are either lossy or inefficient? If the video is 60fps and the bitrate is less than the size of those 60 frames combined it would lose information. If the bit rate is more it would be inefficient. And finding the sweet spot would be basically impossible unless you have a computer do it for you, but with every video editing software I've even used it always asks you to set the bit rate. Are there any ways to even get lossless videos? Because even h.264 and h.265 use bit rates and claim to be lossless video compression. 

TLDR 

Am I right about what bitrates are and how they function, if not then please explain, and is there any way to do lossless compression on a video?",2022-04-17 02:59:55

qg1nhc,Would an adaptive processor ever become a thing?,"Ok, so, knowing that AI is a series of logic gates, I theorize that programming is going to go extinct, and be replaced with AI training.

Instead of writing a program, the program writes itself over time, based on your needs. The logic gates assemble themselves after getting a base neutral network from a trainer.

Building off of that theory, processors can be much more like the human brain, taking input data, and learning to route the output to the appropriate place, while learning what output is to be expected.

In this scenario, a single piece of hardware could theoretically become whatever it was needed to be, in the same way software defined radio works. The processor would be a hardware neural net, with variable values. External hardware would automatically train the net when it was plugged into a processor port.

qap6xe,An Unbeatable ModifiedTuring Test,"I’d like to propose a modified version of the Turing test that I believe no computer program could be written to pass. I believe this modification makes the test only passable by humans because it makes purpose-driven seeking of information the independent variable and not the provision of answers to pre-defined questions. This lack of having a pre-defined nature is the heart of the claim because, though artificial intelligence (hereafter “A.I.”) can be self-aware, it cannot be self-defined.

In the modified Turing test, there are two (2) apparent Turing tests taking place in two separate rooms. Finally, there is a third room that will be explained at the end. 

In the first room, a typical Turing test is run. This means there are two humans and a computer in the first room. The “investigator” human asks the questions and receives the answers, thus, we can generate two transcripts that have identical questions and are only different in their answers. This is standard. 

In the second room, there are two computers and one human. The “investigator” is itself a computer that has already passed the standard Turing test. Thus, in this second room, it is the computer program that is actually serving the role of trying to distinguish between the answers of a computer and human. Again, we can receive two transcripts of the Q & A.

The human investigator and the A.I. investigator In both of the first two rooms must be provided sufficient time for their questions and interactions with the computer and the human that they will end up judging. They must feel satisfied that they can make an intelligent guess in their own Turing test attempts. 

Finally, in the third room, we have our real investigator, This investigator will compare the four (4) transcripts and judge which of the two rooms had a human questioner and which of the two rooms had a computer program questioner. Thus, the true object of the examination is to see whether a computer program could match a human in asking the questions in a Turing test as opposed to answering them. 

Assuming a large enough amount of data, i.e., sufficient questioning and a long enough time given for the “interview process,” I do not believe a computer program can be designed that could pass this modified Turing test. My hypothesis is that because the “investigator” side of the traditional Turing test will be filled with questions that will make it apparent that a human is doing the asking. Importantly, the human investigator and the computer investigator in the first two rooms must NOT know that they are actually the subsections of the third room test. This means that the A.I. Investigator (who already passed the traditional Turing test) will now know that it should be trying to imitate a human.

The point of the modified Turing test proposal, in summation, is to show that the A.I that passed the Turing test can only do so when it is, knowingly, the object of the study. Providing the second layer into the experiment would turn the A.I. into the apparent “studier” and, yet, unbeknownst to the computer, still actually the object of the study.

This proposed modified Turing test will allow for a better barrier to defining humanity from computer programs should the hypothesis hold true that artificial intelligence will not be able to pass this modified version of the Traditional Turing test.

Please feel free to consider how this modified Turing test would work should the experiment ever take place.",2021-10-18 15:39:13

pixs57,How exactly does the communication layer of a given blockchain work?,"For the most part, I understand that in any system that requires communication between two or more devices, you really just need the IP of the device in order to connect and send data. 

Taking from that above concept, being able to create a blockchain that run in a LAN environment for the most part is easy, as getting access to the IP of a device over a local network is pretty simple and sending data between the two is straightforward. For the most part, online tutorials can show how that can work. 

What I don't understand is how to create or convert an existing blockchain that runs in a LAN environment to one that can accept nodes from outside a local network? How do you make a blockchain be accessible globally, and not just accessible within a local wifi network? 

How exactly does that initial connection get established to a given blockchain and what happens when that new node needs to be  indoctrinated? 

I've been looking all around to find information that talks more deeply about the actual communication between nodes and how the actual network layer works, but I've come across very little. 

I've also looked at the source code of bitcoin to see if that could give me any clues but it just left me more confused.

pbde2s,Could you please help me clarify this definition?,"Hello, I am trying to become more knowledgeable on CS and current topics and I was recommended Mastering Ethereum. While the first chapter is pretty clear and easy to follow, this definition has many words that aren’t entirely clear for me. 

“From a computer science perspective, Ethereum is a deterministic but practically unbounded state machine, consisting of a globally accessible singleton state and a virtual machine that applies changes to that state.”

- Deterministic state machines: I can’t say I totally understand. Except maybe it seems from Wikipedia that all deterministic state machines are also FINITE, meaning they have a predetermined number of states?

- practically unbounded. Does this have to do with the finite number of states? Is this saying that Ethereum is a finite state machine but “practically infinite” ? How does that work?

- state : I understand this. The states are the possibilities of the machine. In the classic turnstile example the states are locked which only allows the input (coin) and unlocked which only allows the input (push).

- Singleton state: I tried to read bout it but I still don’t get it. Any help?

Could you maybe go word by word and help me clarify that initial statement?

Even the concept of a virtual machine changing the state… I know VM from my days running windows on a mac, so I understand the concept, but when it comes to modifying the state of Ethereum… does that simply mean adding a new block/transaction/smart contract? 

If states have to be predefined, how can my contract fit in?

I have some questions about storing and processing information on computers? I really do not understand that well. I do hope you can help me. It is really interesting topic to me.

How does computer store or process information:

1.Is everything written eventually in binary numbers? For example... number is 325252. Is it written in computer like this(this is binary for 325252: I used some internet converter): 1001111011010000100 and than some sort of convert back to decimal numbers when I try to see decimal number?

2. How does computer know what does binary numbers mean? How for example does computer know if I am trying to write some word or write a number or try to run some computer program out of this numbers? How can he spot that from 1s or 0s.

3. Is there some sort of system how computer works: With this I mean: For example:?

0000101111110010001010101010101010110101010110101010101010101010101011010101

After thinking for weeks and months on end, I considered Computer Science. Programming and software development has always fascinated me, as well as frightened me because it always seemed difficult (but where's the fun when something is easy?). Met with an advisor and we agreed to follow up after I research more about other majors similar to CS just incase I had a change of heart(Data Science, IST, Math and CS). This was due to me forgetting to mention I was interested in programming, so when he asked me my interested I was anxious and completely skipped over talking about programming so he suggested majors that would possibly include less. But I think I'm set on doing CS, even if its hard, I'll actually enjoy learning compared to my boring ass major right now. 

So first, what language should I take? I have the option to take either Python or C. Originally I was thinking Python because it has been said to be the easier of the two to learn but after more research it seems that C might be a better pick in the long run.

Also, I have never done a single line of code in my life. Is this gonna be a problem, or should I assume an entry level course assumes I know nothing?

Now it's more or less one year that I code in C# in Unity and I really like it, but these days I'm starting to think that I want to lear computer science. 

I really like being a coder and making games: but I'd like to start to understand the theory and get what's actually going on when I code. I don't think that would be useful for making videogames, but I think that, even if it's not that useful, I must learn it. Basically I'd like to be a programmer, rather than a simple coder, and to learn about algotithms, data structure, operating systems, but I've no idea about how to start learning those cool things.

I would learn another programming language, like C++ (that would teach me about more complex stuff, like pointers; I could also use it to make game engines, one day) or C (which would also be really useful to understand concepts) and than learn Assembly; but I read several articles just suggesting only books to learn concepts, rather than low-level languages like C. 

I would like to know how to study computer science and what path should I follow. I'd really like to learn C or C++ and then read books about algotithm and data structure, but I don't know if that's the right way to start learning it and I would like to avoid studying wrong things in the wrong order.

What happens ""under the hood,"" when you string format?","I have a theory; Considering strings are objects which consist of lists, my intuition is, that Python looks at where the {} in the string starts, and ""remembers"" that position in the index. It then adds all the chars, which have been added to the variable inside the brackets, before continuing adding chars from the original string.

I.e if you have the string ""Per{}sons"".format(""pe"")

It will add chars 0-2 realize the bracket starts at index position 3 count the number of chars in ""pe""(n), add them to position 3 + n and then add the remaining chars from the original string (persons)?

Is this anywhere near correct? I tried looking for documentation, but I couldn't find any that explained what happened under the hood. Mostly it was about how to use it correctly.

If my theory is correct, could someone give a bit more detailed explenation? I am very curious about finding out.

Downgrading my browser from Brave to Chrome to get Flash to work even though Flash has been essentially dead for more than half my life. 2. Having to install their remote access software. 3. Having to watch dreadfully as an idiot I don't know fumbles with my browser permissions while I sit and watch for the better part of 20 minutes before being transferred to their Proctor customer service before being told 10 minutes later that I would need to ask for help in the Test Taker customer service chat. I then got what I assume to be put in the ""fuck off here's another bot"" room for 40 minutes before just giving up. Through this whole ordeal there was a lot that stuck out to me. They asked for my Driver's License for photo ID instead of my school issued ID, They sent multiple requests for remote takeover when I denied them escalating privileges on my computer to install what they told me was another browser plug-in. And I probably sound kooky but after all these events I went back to try to remove any personal data from my profile such as Address and Phone number and saw that they also automatically applied the screenshot I took of my face earlier to my account profile which I couldn't have access to remove. All in all pretty shit experience and wondering if anyone else had any horror stories to tell.

Guidance: You can assume there exists a function eps(q) that, for a regular expression q, returns true if the empty string ε is included in the language described by q, and false otherwise.

I concluded that the answer should be res(z, N) = rz1\*(p2) | rz2\*(p1). The problem I am having is seeing the purpose of the guidance. I don't get how it is supposed to help me.

1bt4e8v,What is the best practice book for computational problem solving?,"The core of computer science is computational problem solving. Computer scientists often get stuck and spend a lot of time trying to  wrap their head around how to continue writing some software.   

The core of computational problem solving involves creating a  problem representation that captures key information about the problem,  and designing an algorithm that solves the problem using its  representation. This works for simple problems. Complex problems at  work, during our career, have to be reduced to simpler sub-problems that  we know how to solve, abstracted to their key information, decomposed  into modules and subroutines that encapsulate the features, and so on.  That's where a computational thinking book comes handy because it  describes many different ways to solve a complex computational problem  efficiently.

I'm reaching out to this community to gather feedback on a recent paper I've authored concerning a novel Recursive Data Compression algorithm. My proposal challenges conventional boundaries and tackles concepts traditionally viewed as intractable within the field.

As you dive into the paper, I invite you to temporarily suspend the usual reservations surrounding the Pigeonhole Principle, Kolmogorov Complexity, and entropy — these subjects are thoroughly explored within the manuscript.

I'm specifically interested in your thoughts regarding:

* The feasibility of surpassing established compression limits in a practical sense.
* The theoretical underpinnings of recursive patterns in data that seem random.
* The potential implications this method might have on data storage and transmission efficiency.

I welcome all forms of critique, whether supportive, skeptical, or otherwise, hoping for a diverse range of insights that only a platform like Reddit can provide.

Thank you for your time and expertise, and I eagerly await your valuable perspectives.

1aw351d,Looking for existing literature on a graph feature/algorithm,"Hi,

I'm looking to submit a new dag feature/algorithm to networkx, that I am calling ""pure descendants"". The maintainers have asked me to provide an existing name and literature for this concept, but so far, I am unable to find any. Was hoping that someone here could help point me in the right direction, or could point me somewhere else that I could ask.

The concept of what I am calling pure descendants goes like this. Pure descendants of a set of nodes R, are all nodes downstream of R that are *entirely* derived either directly or indirectly from R.

https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7213

For example in the following graph (imagine all edges are directed, pointing down)

      A  B
     /|\ |
    | | \|
    | C  D 
     \|  |
      E  F
      | /
      |/
      G

    pure_descendants(A) -> {C, E}
    pure_descendants(B) -> {}
    pure_descendants(C) -> {}
    pure_descendants(D) -> {F}
    pure_descendants([A, B]) -> {C, D, E, F, G}
    pure_descendants([A, C]) -> {E}
    pure_descendants([A, D]) -> {C, E, F, G}
    pure_descendants([A, E]) -> {C}
    pure_descendants([C, D]) -> {F}
    pure_descendants([D, E]) -> {F, G}
    pure_descendants([E, F]) -> {G}

1avstc5,Why is there no U2F alternative for authorizing transactions?,"As far as I understand, U2F key generates a public/private key pair that it then uses to sign a bit string coming from the portal we want to authenticate to. That portal then uses public key to validate that we are we by checking signature.

This is obviously great for increased security authentication, but cannot be used for authorization of transactions, as there is no way for end user to verify the exact scope of the transaction itself (for example which bank account we are sending money to).

The question I have is: why cant we just create a U2F token with a display, that would sign not only the nonce, but also the message that service provider is sending, and that would be displayed on the screen before authorizing (for example scanning finger on a key). As a result, it would not be possible to use the signature to authorize any operation, other than the one described in the message.

Above seems like a natural extension of u2f protocol. It does not seem to be worked on yet, from which I assume that there is some flaw in my reasoning above. ",2024-02-20 21:04:03

1avgv8b,Inverting matrix A*A mysteriously helps speed up computation of eigenvalues?,"[Originally posted here: https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/q/43867/]

I have written the following code in MATLAB. I also observe the same effect in Arnoldi iteration in ARPACK in C.
```matlab
N = 4000;
A = rand(N); % Random entries in Uniform[0,1]
tic
AstarA = A.' * A + 5*eye(N);
toc
AstarAinv = inv(AstarA); % Inverse
tic
eigs(AstarA, 1, ""smallestreal"") % Eigenvalue with smallest real part
toc
tic
eigs(AstarAinv, 1, ""largestreal"") 
toc
tic 
svds(A, 1, ""smallest"");
toc

```
Observations:

 1. `eigs(AstarA, 1, ""smallestreal"")` takes about 16s.
 2. `eigs(AstarA, 1, ""largestreal"")` takes about 8s.
 3. `svds(A, 1, ""smallest"")` takes 6s.

I am perplexed by the result. I do not know what is going on in svds sooooo slow, but for the first two observations, I have implemented Arnoldi iteration in ARPACK in C. I see the same effect - the algorithm converges faster with the inverted matrix.

I could not understand this - if many eigenvalues are very close to zero then surely inverting can help pull clustered eigenvalues apart and speed up convergence. But the smallest eigenvalue of `AstarA` is about 5, which is far from zero. **So why inverting the matrix still helps?**

**The same effect persists when I change** `real` to `abs`. **You cannot simply say it is because it is easier to work with largest absolute values than smallest values** - ""smallestreal"" and ""largestreal"" are fully symmetric concepts.

[Also, although it might not be possible to answer, why is svds faster? Isn't it also using Arnoldi iteration?]",2024-02-20 12:49:10
1aukfgh,Good way to store files that change frequently on the backend.,"I am making an application that deals with files. The client initially uploads the file to the server. From then on, any changes made to the file are sent to the server as deltas.

The server uses these deltas and changes the file to reflect the changes made by the client. 

I am right now just storing the user files in a local directory on the server. This obviously will not scale well. There arises another issue with this approach. I want to offload the task of updating the file to another process on another server. Since this process is on another server, it doesn't have access to the files in the local directory of the web server. 

I want to know what's a good way to store files that may change frequently. ",2024-02-19 10:42:32
1au7tr1,I build my first parser! Feedback welcome!,"Hey everyone! I recently completed a university assignment where I built a parser to validate code syntax.  Since it's all done, I'm not looking for assignment help, but I'm super curious about other techniques and approaches people would use. I'd also love some feedback on my code if anyone's interested.

This was the task in a few words:

* **Task:** Build a parser that checks code against a provided grammar.
* **Constraints:** No external tools for directly interpreting the CFG.
* **Output:** Simple ""Acceptable"" or ""Not Acceptable"" (Boolean) based on syntax.
* **Own Personal Challenge:** Tried adding basic error reporting.

Some of those specifications looked like this :

* (if **COND** B1 B2) where **COND** is a condition (previously shown in the document) and B1/B2 are blocks of code (or just one line).

yes, I understand Virtual memory has contiguous memory blocks.

but how it's mapped to physical memory addresses.

physical memory is still fragmented.

here, I am confused why using virtual memory can solve an issue from physical memory fragmentation if it's still fragmented when using of virtual memory.",2024-02-18 08:11:47
1atjvmy,Question about data arrangement problem,"Assuming you have an array of elements ranging from -1 to 1 that was defined by a graph generated from user that could have patterns from linear graph to sin x graph (eg. \[-1, 1, -1 ,1\] or \[-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1\] and an unsorted array of number range from 60 to 180. How would you fit the unsorted array into the graph array that best represent the pattern of the graph (eg. sinx graph -> \[60, 80, 130, 80, 60\]) and can be dynamically sorted (can sorted with multiple types of graph).  
My first thought on this problem is to find locale min and max and then sorted a subset of elements in that range, but it seems to result in O(n\^2) or higher.

16maozo,I finally did it! Got hired!,"Hi everyone!

I graduated earlier this summer, after a 4 year Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. By all accounts, I was a good *student* and graduated with a 3.9 GPA, however, I had just 1 internship, that too not in Canada. My University was also quite bottom of the barrel, frankly.

I was an international student, and COVID kinda screwed me out of an internship in 2020, so I went back to my home country for the summer of 2022, and did a 4 month internship there, just so I had something on my resume that helped me in my job hunt.

I started my job hunt in Feb of this year, should have started earlier, but oh well. Keep in mind, I'm TERRIBLE at interviews. Like horrific. Never done Leetcode practice either, so wasn't particularly great at those kinds of questions either.

It was an incredibly long wait, specially as an international student, lot of anxious months, but I finally managed to land a job as a .NET developer at a Small Enterprise, and its fully remote too. The pay isn't anything fancy, around 55k. But that is still an incredible amount for me, and I think the experience is worth its weight in gold regardless. 

For everyone still looking, keep trying, its a numbers game, and at some point, all you need is one person to give you a shot. It'll happen. Make a couple of decent projects, be calm in interviews. I started of shitting myself in every interview, but towards the later months, I always nailed the initial few rounds due to all the practice. Being likable with give you a huge edge when applying at smaller companies.

P.S. If anyone has any advice on how to learn .NET framework 4.8, I'd really appreciate it!


TLDR: New Grad, spent 8 months job hunting, landed a 55k role as a .NET Developer at a small enterprise after 900+ applications, and zero Canadian Experience. If you were in my position, just keep trying, its a numbers game, and all you need is one chance <3",2023-09-18 23:18:31
16nmyc2,I finally got a job.,"Computer Engineering new grad here. Graduated from York University with a 3.0 GPA. 1 year full stack internship at a start up. Got a job through a referral  at a very small start up. Full Stack Developer.

The job requires me 2 days in office (Mon, Thurs), and the office is 15-20 mins drive from home, so I don't mind working in person.

The pay is alright. They said it's 50k rate for the first 3 months (probation period), then it will go up later. 

I'm not complaining, since 1 job is better than 0 jobs.

Edit: I am Canadian.",2023-09-20 14:38:41

I've sent out hundreds of applications and gotten \~5 interviews. Haven't gotten a single interview in over a month now, and at this point barely even getting rejection emails. Just wanted to get this off my chest because I got a rejection today for something I thought for sure would at least yield an interview. Nope. Feeling super bummed about that but I'll survive.

The reason why is I don’t get that much work to do. The first 3 months were in my training I was enhancing my skills and learning new technologies.  Now I am in a project and haven’t got any task so far (1 month since its started). 

I am getting paid fully and I am full timer here but I just feel guilt for not doing or contributing.

s5mwxo,Why Canadian engineers accept low TC and why they shouldn't.,"I know there have been topics recently on this board regarding why Canadian companies pay less than US ones. But this topic is more about why Canadians themselves as a whole accept low pay and don't seek better opportunities despite so many opportunities being out there now.

**They don't know what high TC looks like:**

Quite frankly most Canadians don't know their own worth. If you told most Canadian senior engineers that new grads at well paying companies (in Canada) these days are getting double their TC or more, most wouldn't believe you. This is because they think sources like Glassdoor/Indeed are accurate for TC and/or believe others are lying. They have no idea about [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) and certainly don't frequent reddit or Blind to learn the truth. One Canadian PM recently told me numbers on [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) are inaccurate and people are lying since that's easier to accept than them being grossly underpaid. If most Canadians knew their actual market worth, we'd be seeing a massive exodus unlike we've ever seen before from Canadian companies (it's already kind of happening but not at the rate you'd expect).

**They believe they can't and will never pass the technical bar:**

They think technical rounds are way beyond them and they'll never get good at that stuff. I thought the same for ages until I actually applied myself and did it. Many come up with excuses like ""Oh I'm to old/dumb for that stuff"" but ultimately that's all it is, excuses. In reality, anyone determined can learn to get good at technical interviews. Sure people learn at a different pace and/or have a different amount of free time, one person might only need 4 months to prep, another might need 2 years. But the point is, almost anyone can do it if they keep at it and never give up. Also many people think interviews at competitive companies require in depth domain knowledge, I've lost track of how many times I've been asked (but what's the tech stack!?). In reality almost every top company doesn't give a crap about your previous tech stack, just your fundamentals.

**They think you need to move to the US to obtain high TC:**

Some people love living in Canada and believe high TCs are only possible in the US. This might have been true in the past but more and more remote options/satellite have and are opening up for Canadians. And sure, most companies will still hire Canadians in Canada on the discount, but Canadian companies pay so poorly that even these discounted TCs will be 2-5X what they are currently making.

**They think high TC = more work:**

It is an industry myth that higher TC inherently means you have to work longer and harder. My first job out of university, I was making 70K a year on average with awful WLB. Felt like I was constantly on-call and working overtime and I thought that was normal and just the way the tech industry was. Only much later did I realize people making 2-10X my TC had far better WLB. In reality, what determines WLB is company culture, it has nothing to do with the TC they are giving you. Canadian devs aren't any worse or less hard working than US ones just because they make way less money.

**They chase promotions at their current jobs:**

A lot of Canadians have an outdated, boomer mindset where they think a high amount of loyalty to their current company will be awarded in the end and that's the way to go. They'll be making 80k/year and be working super hard for a promo...that will give them a 20% bump at most. Not only is no promo guaranteed but working so hard for so little makes little sense. I'd understand chasing promos if you're at a top paying company that's going to actually reward you handsomely but the average Canadian company? You could get promoted 4 times and still be making less than what new grads are currently getting in this insane market.

**They think they have job security at their current role:**

My hot take on this subject is job security, especially in tech is a total myth. No matter how much your work might say you're all a ""family"" they would let you go in a heartbeat if that ended up being the best decision for business (or even so executives could get bigger bonuses at times). Sure some companies have more aggressive firing policies than others. But no job is truly safe in tech. So it's always good to be prepared for the worst.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So to summarize:

The job market is hotter than it has ever been for Canadian engineers. If you're working at a low-paying Canadian company, you're doing yourself a huge disservice. You're making your bosses rich while you get skinned alive. Obviously, if you work for a non-profit this does not apply to you.

Here's my personal example. 

2021: 110K CAD TC (working at Canadian companies in 2021 and prior) 

2022: 320K CAD TC (Pre-IPO US Unicorn, base is 220K CAD, the rest in private equity). Fully remote. 

And I'm just a mid level SWE with 4.5 YOE. Seniors in the current market can pull 400K CAD +.

Feel free to list other reasons in this topic why Canadians accept low pay I have missed.

Edit: Cross-posted this on r/PersonalFinanceCanada for more visibility as suggested. A lot of these points don't pertain to just the tech industry but US vs Canadian companies in general.",2022-01-16 22:05:10
16mwfml,Got a new job after being laid off this year,"Inspired by the other thread so I’m writing this to provide personal insights from someone who went through a recent layoff. 

Profile: ~7 YoE as a SDE, been working at a relatively well-known Canadian company for the last few years, got laid off with some severance. Spent the first few days in shock before beginning to apply for a new job. 

Some useful resources: Otta (higher quality job posts compared to other sites), LinkedIn Jobs (with Hide n’ Seek Chrome extension to remove spammy/irrelevant promoted jobs), Huntr (to keep track of interview loops), Enhancv (to have a nicer looking resume). No affiliations, just a happy user of these.

Also: on salary negotiation/conversation (Fearless Salary Negotiation: A step-by-step guide to getting paid what you're worth https://a.co/d/bmZY9g8), resume & tech career advices (https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/books/)

Market is really brutal. You have to interview perfectly to get a job. At least one time I’ve been rejected because “some candidates did better in a specific round”. 

Thanks to the severance, I was able to be picky when applying (e.g. no Leetcode). Some stats: submitted ~50 applications, went through interview loops with 10 companies, made it to the final round/onsite at 3 companies, ended up with 2 offers. Took me 3 months in total.

Few things I observed:

- Market is heating up a bit (more companies resume hiring and more call backs)
- Companies are paying around 140k+ CAD (+stonks) for senior positions. 
- Remote jobs are super competitive 

New TC: 200k CAD, fully remote. I didn’t apply to big techs/MANGA.

Feel free to ask any questions.",2023-09-19 17:03:04
z93ftf,Got the job!,Jr Software Developer. 6 months of searching. So stoked.,2022-11-30 21:13:56
18eru4v,I really screwed up. Need advice.,"I graduated 8 months ago from a university in Canada, with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. 

My GPA is low (2.1). I have no internships under my belt, and I have no personal projects. The only projects I have are my school projects (the ones I had to do for my classes).

I basically fooled around these last 8 months, playing League of Legends all day... Yeah I know, I'm dumb. But I decided that I want to change. What should I do to find a job as a software dev? Am I just screwed now?

Edit: Thanks for the responses everyone. I'm feeling a lot more confident now and will take all of your advice.",2023-12-10 01:00:57

x13uyd,My Journey from unemployed to FANG,"I've always been a lurker in these cs career subreddits. I thought I would share my story to motivate the people that didn't start at the top, I rather started at the very bottom of the bottom. You could say I started my career in the worst way possible.

I started in another Engineering department completely unrelated to Computer Science. After 3 years and some internships, I decided to switch into CS and completed my degree in a total of 5years at one of the ""top"" uni's in Canada, I honestly don't think where you did your degree matters unless it's Waterloo coop (coop being the important part).

&#x200B;

I graduated in 2019 and had 0 software internships under my belt and 0 job offers. I was unemployed for a whole year from 2019 to 2020 where I saw my peers progress in their careers and lives. A lot of the people I went to school with ended up in FANG or some other unicorn company in the States or Toronto. This was really my own fault, I didn't put in the time to even try to interview, I was sucked into a game called World of Warcraft Classic and blamed it all on the pandemic. I really got a wake up call when my gf back then broke up with me. I really thought wtf am I doing with my life.

&#x200B;

Job 1: Mid 2020, somehow, a local company gave me a chance in a Software Analyst role, I was expecting 50k, but they offered me TC \~63k CAD, I was so happy. This role really wasn't what I was aiming for, but you grab onto anything you can when you've been unemployed for a year. After 10months, I knew this would make my career die since there was no real software development being done. I was simply a customer relations software analyst. It did develop some social skills that I'm grateful for. This is when I discovered leetcode and I started to apply to other jobs.

&#x200B;

Job 2: I've sent probably around 200 applications to all kinds of companies in both tech, finance for a software engineer/development role. I just got 2 replies, one from a big bank and another from Amazon. I thought I was on top of the world. I actually got replies!! During both interview process, I had ""done"" around 200 questions. But I put ""Done"" in quotation marks because most those questions were easy and anything above easy, I mostly just copied and pasted the answer while trying to understand... If you had asked me what is topological sort, I would have said is that even a english word??? Let's get the failure out of the way, somehow I go through the whole Amazon process and even did their virtual onsite. But that was a rough wakeup call, out of the 4 rounds. I did 1 question right and my LP answers were horrible due to my lack of experience. Quick rejection. Big bank's interview process was much simpler, it mainly consisted of some basic knowledge check in java and OOD. But even so I thought I completely bombed the interview since I didn't even know basic design patterns back then when they asked. Somehow I ended up getting an offer TC \~85k CAD.

&#x200B;

I've been pretty happy with my current role, there was a lot of learning and has really been an eye opening experience. There were so many things I've never even touched before, Unit tests, Integration tests, work flow diagrams, architecture decisions to name a few. Back then, I didn't even know wtf was JIRA before I started, sprints? epics? stories? They might as well have been talking in a foreign language. Over the past year, I've really settled into my role and I have even become a mentor to new hires and interns in my company.

&#x200B;

However I started to become unhappy at my job not because I stopped learning or because of my compensation level, but there was clearly an unequal distribution of work and my team got a new manager that had no idea how to manage things. For example, a team mate of mine that was hired at the same time as me worked on 1 ticket for 2.5months that was originally estimated for 2 weeks and broke the CI 3 times for that 1 ticket. Following that, he picked up another ticket worked on it for a month and just left in the middle of it to go on a 6 week vacation. The work was left for me to complete... In the same span of time (4 months), our team completed 2 epics with \~ 15 stories total. I did all the rest of the work. There is 0 responsability and 0 ownership and nothing is being done about it.

Another example of our manager, I had done a ticket that was assigned to our team outside of product area, I've mentioned it plenty during standups and meetings. There was a ticket on our board and it got QAed and there was actual prod code merge with multiple PRs. Somehow, the product manager that had asked my team to do this created a clone of the original ticket and I caught the notification. I was asking what is going on?? Is there more work to do? No.. my manager simply thought we never did any of the work and told them that. There are many other stories, but you get the gist. Moral of the story is, if you have a toxic work environment, leave and never look back.

&#x200B;

Job 3: During this time, I kept grinding leetcode. I told myself one day, for sure no matter how many times I try, I'm going to get into a big tech company. A few recruiters from different FANG companies reached out to me, but I was scared, I never answered them because I thought I wouldn't pass their technical interviews. One week ended up being a month, a month ended up being half a year. I got a wakeup call after my team mate went on that 6 week long vacation and left his work to me, I was fed up, I couldn't continue working in this environment. I started to speak to recruiters from different companies to see where it would lead.

Timeline:

June: leetcode all day everyday until I was sick of it, initial talks

July: moving, not as much leetcode, had the phone interviews + online assessment interviews

August: Final push, hermit life for 2 weeks grinding \~150 leetcode mediums. I highly recommand getting premium and do the top 100 questions tagged for each company and also grind75.

End August: Final virtual onsite rounds

Result: 200k CAD offer with 2 YOE at a FANG company.

&#x200B;

I was stressed out of my mind the past few months, I really wanted to leave my current job and I had no idea if I had the ability to pass the bar at technical interviews. Even before I got the job offer, the recruiter simply emailed me can we talk soon? I had no confidence on my interviews and my heart was beating at 200km/h while waiting. But somehow I did ended up getting 1 offer :)

&#x200B;

Some tips for interviewing:

LEETCODE specific:

Premium and use questions tagged and sort by frequency!

Grind 75: Covers most concepts: data structures, algorithms, [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75)

Initially if you don't know anything, don't try to solve it yourself. You are just wasting your time, go look at the solutions and start doing problems with the same solution pattern. Ex: Monotonic stack, start with something easy, once you understand the concept. Apply it to other questions. Then take a few days of break. Come back to those questions, do them from scratch. Rinse and repeat. This will slowly allow your brain to recognize patterns in the questions.

&#x200B;

System design: [https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)

Also for system design, definitively go on youtube and just search for the most popular things:

How to design tinder/instragram/spotify/google maps to name a few.

Prepare stories for behavioral questions. Some companies really like to grill you on those!

&#x200B;

TL DR: My journey wasn't easy, you see all those posts of new graduates that end up earning 300K right out of school. Those are the exceptions and not the norm! Everyone follows a different path. Don't compare your level 1 to someone's level 20. I started in a different major, ended up being unemployed for a year and somehow got a FANG offer in 3 years. If I can do it, you can too.",2022-08-29 23:54:37
ueqf2c,"For those on lower end of the salaries, here are some companies that don't need any Leetcode","Adaptavist, SWE (80-95k CAD):

1337hfn,2023 new grad job search experience (stats below),"Hey r/cscareerquestionsCAD, just wanted to share my job search experience as a 2023 new grad (for full-time SWE). Let me know if this seems normal/unusual or if you had a similar experience.

**Background:**

* Bachelor of Computer Science 2023 from University of Waterloo
* 0 YoE full-time, 2 YoE internships. Did 6 SWE internships, 4 months each
* 150+ LeetCode solved, studied system design

**Applications:**

* Applied to 300+ jobs on job listings/company websites → 2 interviews (\~300 ghosted/rejected)
* Recruiters messaged me on LinkedIn → 2 interviews
* Asked 20+ connections for referrals → 2 interviews

**Interviews:**

* Company 1: referral → call with recruiter → ghosted
* Company 2: applied → call with recruiter → interview → rejected
* Company 3: applied → call with recruiter → interview (day 1) → virtual onsite (2 interviews on day 2) → virtual onsite (4 interviews on day 3) → ghosted → rejected after asking 2 weeks later
* Company 4: message → call with recruiter → rejected
* Company 5: message → call with recruiter → interview → ghosted
* Company 6: referral → call with recruiter → interview (day 1) → virtual onsite (3 interviews on day 2) → offer

Almost all of the companies I did my 6 internships at had layoffs or hiring freezes during 2022-2023, so I wasn't able to get any return offers. My last internship company converted previous interns to full-time, but recently had layoffs and froze hiring.

I was sad after all the rejections, but I'm very grateful that I got an offer in this market as a new grad. I'll likely accept the offer and continue to grind LeetCode/system design while applying for better opportunities as the market improves.",2023-04-29 21:38:29

15padj4,Perspective from the person in the other side of the table for technical interviews..,"I am on the other side of the table, the person doing the technical interviews.. If you are open to some honest, general feedback, here it is.. I am not saying all of you are doing this, but I see this a lot especially among junior candidates.

You bullshit too much. And I can tell you are bullshitting.. It lets you get pass the HR, but you fail at technical interview. It is not because you do not know, it is because you pretend to know. Admitting you have limited technology is much better than trying to bullshit your way in the technical interview. It is so easy to tell.

How are you out of college in 2022 but proficient in NoSql, Relational databases, Docker, ReactJs, Jenkins, Bash, .NET, Python, CSS, jQuery, HTML? Just because you wrote 10 lines of script does not mean are experienced in Bash..

Please do not claim you have advanced Java knowledge just because you implemented a rest endpoint and a service class.

Just because you logged into Jenkins and clicked ""Run Pipeline"" does not mean you have experience in Jenkins. It takes me one question to reveal you have never actually implemented a pipeline yourself. Just tell you are familiar with Jenkins, what it does, why it is used if that is the case..

Please do not try to bullshit your way by making up weird answers when I ask what a ConcurrentHashMap or an CountdownLatch is.. Just tell you never used it, if it is the case. You will win interview points for being honest.. I do not expect you to answer it anyway.. Who can know every single class in Java? If you can properly answer it, excellent.. But my intention is to see if you are just going to keep it real and say you have never used/needed it AND extra points if you ask me back what it is because you are curios.. When I give the answer, if you can make a few comments in your own words on why it might be useful, you just made yourself the top candidate. Make a comment on telling where this class might be useful = interview points..

Do not over engineer simple take home exercises. In most cases what we are looking to see is if you understand the requirements or not. We do not care if it is the fastest solution or the most memory efficient solution. Those we will discuss when we go through the assessment in the interview. I will assess your listening skills when I do this. I will want to see if you can take the hints I am giving you.  Bonus points if I challenge you to solve the exercise without using a HashMap and if you can come up with an answer and explain/challenge me on why it is a worse solution than what you implemented. I will not be frustrated, I will agree with you and praise you. None of these require the fancy technologies you keep listing. These require the knowledge of the fundamentals and active listening skills.

See the technical interview as a conversation. Try to showcase your communication skills and your honesty the most, not your technical skills. Show me you are an easy person to work with. Show me you can listen, show me you can express your thoughts. Show me you can disagree by making your points. Technical skills can be learned easily and quickly and I am more than happy to teach you when you join anyway.

As I said, I have nothing to gain from this post. If you have anything to take from this post, take it. Do not hate me, you will have nothing to gain by hating me. If you want to claim you are an expert in many technologies, keep doing it. If you believe I am wrong and there is nothing for you here and I am being an ass, instead of arguing with me just keep what you are doing. If what you have been doing is working for you, again, just keep doing it. This is just another point of view, for those who are interested in.",2023-08-12 17:30:15
yrouc3,Enough with the recession fear-mongering,"Meta and Twitter aren't the only IT companies in the world. They don't even hire that many Canadians, being mostly US-based companies. Daddy Elon debt-loading his latest trinket during a bad egomanic trip isn't an economic recession.

Chill out. Grab a boring remote $100k - $150k job. Move to rural prairies or rural maritimes. Enjoy riding the recession out with a $800/month mortgage for a literal mansion on a literal acreage. Chop some wood and turbocharge a shitty old Civic. Drink some Alpine or Kokanee. Buy a Ps5 and a quad. The 'recession' will pass and you'll be OK.

y5ow36,List of Canadian Tech Internships for 2023!,"Hey all 👋

I've always had a tough time looking for tech/swe internships in Canada. So me and my school's computer science society decided to make an active repo tracking internships! While other repos exist, we found them to not be active enough. In addition, this one also tracks internships of various lengths for schools that have year long programs.

Now for the link!

As a recap, I graduated in December and was offered a job for 50k. The majority of you told me to turn the job down and I am glad I did! I was offered a job for 80k at the start of January and started working there a couple weeks ago. Its in the field I wanted too!

In total I sent out about 24 applications over the course of 2 months which resulted in 2 offers and 6 interviews. 

Thank-you guys so much. Your advice resulted in a 60% higher income for me!",2023-01-24 05:06:23
1174ik9,"Why has it become so hard to land an entry level job in recent years after graduating with a CS degree and even after having co-op experience, good personal projects when people with just a CS diploma used to get tons of job offers in the past?","I know some grads whom recruiters have not even contacted for an interview and they graduated like a year ago and they sent minimum 800-1200 applications for entry level jobs, they had done internships or co-op, had some decent projects under their belt, had their resume looked at by many people even some of those people were professionals.

How can I even land a job when only like nearly 3000 entry level jobs get posted all over Canada for CS students? Even many of them require minimum 3 or 4 years of work experience in the relevant field, I don't know how you can get 4 years of experience when you freshly graduate from university. Nearly 400-200 applicants are applying for that one job position. I don't know how you can get that job in this competition; it feels like it's a rat race out there.

Most of you will say it's happening because of recession and tech layoffs, but our neighbouring country faced mass tech layoffs too, but still fresh grads there don't even have to deal with such competition that we are facing here. If you search LinkedIn, you will see they have nearly 100k entry level jobs for cs students and on average 20-100 people apply for those posts. I know our population size is smaller than them but still, they can't even fill all their job posts with their domestic applicants and here even a domestic candidate is struggling to get an entry level job.",2023-02-20 11:39:08

14yubgf,I finally got a job.,"So, after being laid off in January of this year and almost 400 applications later I finally landed a job.

Tc : 70k year(HCOl area)
Position: Software Developer (React, React native etc)
Type: Hybrid (2 days per month in office)

Note: I was making more in my previous job but the market is brutal so have to deal with it.

I have around 2 yoe and a masters in cs.

What did I learn: Find 1 or 2 tech stacks and be good at them at least so that you can pass a junior level interview. Nowadays companies are not even asking leetcode type questions. I have given around 8-9 technical interviews during my job hunt and only 1 company asked me leetcode type problem. Almost all of them focused more on the take home test or the tech stack related questions. And yeah keep grinding leetcode just so if you are unlucky enough to get one in interview.",2023-07-13 19:40:13

I was let go from my first software developer job in May. I was there for two and a half years.

For almost 5 months,  I had one technical interview in that time (which I failed), two failed leetcode assessments, a few HR talks that never went through, quite a bit of headhunter/agency phone calls, dozens of Indian cold calls/emails, and too many ""thank you but..."" generic job responses. Very discouraging to say the least.

But now, I have two job offers and I'm in a position where I have to choose between two big companies; a position I never thought I'd be in.  By the way, both job offers were from postings that asked for way more experience than I had and for a CS degree that I didn't have. It just goes to show, don't give up!

15ktts9,Is Every Post On The Job Bank A Scam or What?,"I'm talking about the job bank government website (Job Bank \*Dot\* GC \*Dot\* CA). Specifically in BC.

I've often come across these Indeed job listings where a "" small company "" is asking for a web designer and the job requirements sound very generic (eg: Must translate rough layouts into HTML, must be proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Must liase with stakeholders, etc.) No mention of frameworks or specific tools they use. 

I've never heard back from any of these roles. I'm just wondering are they scams or are they just really small family owned businesses who don't know anything about IT, so they're just using a template job description?

And these Indeed posts always lead me to a link on the Job Bank where they tell me to send my resume to an email address. And the email address is always a gmail one or yahoo one. Never a custom company domain. 

What is the story behind postings like these? How can it be that ALL the posts on a government website are scams? They even have a verified tag attached to them.",2023-08-07 19:05:35
1be78ut,Are software engineers not legally engineers in Canada?,"So I asked this same question on r/AskEngineers, got the feeling it was a stupid question, but I am going to try just one more time here:

Studied CS in US. While looking for jobs here in Canada, I read that software engineers weren't legally allowed to call themselves engineers.

So I did some digging, and I got this from Engineers Canada:

[https://engineerscanada.ca/guidelines-and-papers/engineers-canada-paper-on-professional-practice-in-software-engineering](https://engineerscanada.ca/guidelines-and-papers/engineers-canada-paper-on-professional-practice-in-software-engineering)

**“\[u\]se of ‘software engineer’, ‘computer engineer’ and related titles that prefix ‘engineer’ with IT‐ related disciplines and practices, is prohibited in all provinces and territories in Canada**, unless the individual is licensed as an engineer by the applicable Provincial or Territorial engineering regulator.

**Unlicensed individuals cannot use the title software engineer in their job titles, resumes, reports, letterhead, written and electronic correspondence, websites, social media, or anywhere else that may come to the attention of the public.**

I can't call myself a software engineer on social media? That's what my company calls me. What are we IT-related workers supposed to call ourselves in Canada? Only software developers? Programmers? Why do companies still advertise positions as software engineers then?

And why does the federal government's Nationa Occupation Classification say otherwise?(P.Eng mentioned, but not requried)[https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Structure/NocProfile?objectid=s%2B18U2GgCu7IIJq7TKb3Gqj2aj9x0aDA%2BjrG2CWXnXQ%3D](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Structure/NocProfile?objectid=s%2B18U2GgCu7IIJq7TKb3Gqj2aj9x0aDA%2BjrG2CWXnXQ%3D)

EDIT: I got my answer. So basically, it's not heavily enforced, there have been attempts by some parties to clear up the issue, and some provinces like Alberta have made clear exceptions for the designation while still requiring the professional version (P.Eng) for specific jobs that require it.

The detailed explanations in the comments are awsome. Thanks everyone!

EDIT2: Also, don't make the stupid choice I made by comparing software engineers to other more general engineers in a sub like  r/AskEngineers. I had no idea software engineers were such a controversial title. Haha.

EDIT3: So I am seeing some comments on not having an engineering degree. Which is interesting, because I felt graduates from Computer Engineering or Software Engineering departments at different universities ended up doing the same thing as SWE as a CS grad. Also, by this definition, can I call myself a scientist because I have a CS degree?

EDIT4: I know this is bit off topic, but from the comments I am a bit shocked to see people trying to compare ""Computer Science"" and ""Computer Engineering"" and ""Software Engineering"" disciplines and consider the CS one to be less rigorous with less math, less standardized approaches, and less ethics. Isn't this ""CS""careerquestions? Do people not understand that Computer Science isn't just coding school, that it is a ""science"" discipline where the mathematics, scientific method and ethics is a very big deal? Just going through coding bootcamp or ML bootcamp doesn't make you a ""CS"" guy. Sure, engineers working on LLMs can get by without knowing the intricacies of the underlying mathematics of the predictive models - but CS PhD researchers like the ones at Google DeepMind or OpenAI who come up with the theories and approaches have extensive background in mathematics, theory and ethics.",2024-03-14 00:05:48
sm3vn7,Can we please cool it on the High TC Koolaid?,"If you're young, talented, and career focused then go get the $$$ you deserve. I 100% support that!


What I don't support is having a passive aggressive post here every other day telling us that we are underpaid and should all be on your level. That's not helpful. It's just bad for everyone's mental health. It makes people feel bad about perfectly decent employment situations. Heck, those posts aren't even genuine questions.


Blind, Levels, and LeetCode have always been echo chambers of the most successful. FANG, US unicorn startups, and exceptional remote jobs have always paid more than double everyone else. This has been the meta of the industry since at least the early 2010s. We already know. We already give that advice when it is fitting for OP's question.


Here's the thing. We can't all be top 10% devs. Some of us are struggling to find our first job. Some of us have been rejected dozens of times and would be happy with any job. Some of us are looking for stable local Canadian jobs so we can immigrate. Some of us live outside Toronto and get our salaries adjusted regionally even by FANG. Some of us aren't as smart/confident/social as you and would not pass the interviews at your company. Some of us struggle with mental health and barely hold down our mediocre jobs.


The high TC rant posts are very demoralizing for all those people. Expecting everyone to operate at that level is unrealistic, unreasonable, and harmful. We shouldn't make people feel unsuccessful for having a stable job in a high skill industry and earning well above the median household income for their region. Many of us are earning 6 figures in our 20s at easy 9-5 jobs. That is already success.",2022-02-06 18:35:19

uufe0n,Using LaTeX resume template helped me a lot,"I used to make my resume with word and then convert to PDF.

Oh. My. God. 99% of the samples I saw were so damn clean, I just straight up took the first one and put my info on it, and exported to PDF. Not only it was better than converting DOC to PDF, but also, I got higher responses due to how clean and simple most of these templates were.

t0uhe3,My job search experience with 2 YoE as a backend software engineer,"Hello folks!

Lurker posting on a throwaway here. I'm a backend software engineer with 2 YoE and wanted to share my recently-concluded job search journey for Canadian Software Engineering roles and hopefully help others that are looking for a job in this market. I'll be including a few details about myself, my experience, my journey, and where I ended up. I'll also share any insights about how I prepped, and am willing to answer any questions below

### About Me

Graduated from UofT two years ago, with a Bachelors of Computer Science. Had the opportunity to complete a few internships at small Toronto startups, and finally one at a Big-N company in SF. Joined a non-Big-N west-coast US entertainment company full time in LA.

### Experience
Backend software engineer with skills in Golang, Python, Java, AWS, Terraform, etc. Worked on high-scale/thoroughput distributed backend systems that served global traffic. Joined as a new grad, promoted to mid level software engineer after three quarters, total full-time YoE: 2yrs. Total experience incl. internships - 5YoE (but it feels weird to count it that way lol).

### Interview Prep
Total time spent to prep was probably +/- 20h over two weeks. Some leetcode, some systems design, some reading, and a few mock interviews.

I hate leetcode. So I didn't _grind_ leetcode, but instead I did about 20 easy/med leetcodes from the infamous [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) list. I made sure that I meticulously studied Python - how to use it, how to write Pythonic code, shortcuts, tools, stdlibs, and wrote out all the useful algos (BST, DST, etc.) in Python so I could formalize my understanding.

For systems design, I read through the [Designing Data Intensive Applications Summary](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes/blob/master/books/designing-data-intensive-applications.md). Since I already worked with highly distributed and data-intensive systems at work, this was a lot easier for me to digest than I thought. I watched a few systems designs interviews on YouTube, and practiced with a few friends. The cheat codes here are: autoscaling, loadbalancing, trading consistency for consensus, and caches. Learn them and learn them well. 

### Job Search
I usually applied to *mid-level Software Engineer* roles. I started looking pretty casually in early January after hearing about how hot the market is. I only applied to companies that I was interested in working for (product-wise), had a referral for, or thought that they paid a lot (lol). I got approximately a 60-70% callback rate on my resume, which I was surprised by. I was also rejected immediately by a few companies - Instacart, Slack, Dropbox, Stripe, and Plaid.

Here's a brief list of the companies I seriously applied to, as well as some notes:

`Craft Screen` - refers to a phone/video interview about technical problems. Usually leetcode

`HR Screen` - barely a screen, never failed this. Basically just discussing w/recruiter about past experience, company culture, and salary expectations

`Hiring Manager` - dives into past technical projects, teamwork and collaboration, professional experience, and information about the role

`Breadth/Depth Screen` - either a wide (breadth) interview about the different tech that you've worked with (e.g. tell me how the internet works), or a deep (depth) dive into your domain knowledge -- e.g. specifics of a language, or how to solve a intricate db consensus problem

| Company     | Reason | Process | Salary Range  | Notes
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Square/Block      | Interned there in the past (startup, got acquired), seemed interesting       | HR Screen, Craft Screen 1, Craft Screen 2, Virtual Onsite (Pairing, Q&A - 5 total interviews) | ??? Recruiter said ""An offer you'll be very happy with"" | The second Craft Screen is as-needed (if you kill the first, you don't need it)
| GitHub   | Remote work allowed and interesting product        | Coding Challenge + ??? | ??? No recruiter contacted me | Starts w w/a Coding Challenge, but they never sent it to me and I didn't follow up
| Coinbase   | Remote work, heard they paid a lot        | HR Screen, Coding Challenge, Onsite (2 Pair Programming, spread over 2 days and will reject if first is bad) | (229K TC) 149K CAD Base, 7K bonus, 73K stock | The Coding Challenge was pure disrespect to the candidate (implement a multi-featured text editor in 90m) and boring as hell. Also offer is non-negotiable.
| Elodie Games   | Remote work, small startup game company       | HR Screen, Tech Breadth Screen, Take-Home Challenge (4h~), Challenge Review + Deep Tech Screen, Meet The Founders x2 | (200K TC~) 157-178K CAD base salary, variable equity | Very good experience here, enjoyed all the conversations I had with the team. Based in LA area.
| Singularity 6 | Remote work, small startup game company  | HR Screen, Hiring Manager, Craft Screen, Onsite (5x45m - tech, culture&collab, architecture, etc.)  | ??? Mentioned 150K+ USD base as standard offer | Only can hire Canadians in Quebec and wants to pay Canadian market rates
| AppLovin | Recruiter reached out via cold email and enticed me with TC | HR Screen, Craft Screen, Onsite (4x45 - tech, tech, deep tech, deep tech)  | ??? 170K USD base for SE1, 230K USD base for SE2 | Very difficult onsite. Felt very stupid afterwards. They drilled _deep_.
| Shopify | Previous manager/mentor worked here and referred me. Applied for Senior Software Engineer Role | HR Screen, Craft Screen, Life Story, Onsite (2x75m pair programming, 1x45m deep dive)  | <140K CAD TC for SE, <230K TC for Senior SE | See footnote*
| Wish | High TC and chance at 10x'ing your return cuz of penny stock | HR Screen, Craft Screen 1, Craft Screen 2, Onsite (???) | 140K - 200K CAD base + 180K-300K Equity + Signing Bonus | Assured me about company's runway and outlook despite stock prices
| SocialMedia | Interesting product to me | HR Screen, Craft Screen, Onsite (4x1h, 1 systems design, 2 not-so-leetcodes, 1 hiring manager) | (225K TC) usual offer is 175K CAD base + 167K/3yrs CAD equity | Was my first choice in above companies because of interesting product and company age
| Microsoft | Its a big name, I guess | Craft Screen, Onsite (4x1h Craft Screens) | ??? Microsoft apparently pays like 140-160K TC for SDE2/L61 | Wow Microsoft pays a lot lower than I imagined. Also see footnote 2

Sorry I'm not providing the exact identity of the SocialMedia company. I don't want to give too much away to identify me as a candidate. I hope you can understand. They are pretty often mentioned in high TC remote/Canada companies in threads such as these. You can probably figure it out in the comments below but I'm not willing to identify it personally.

**FOOTNOTE:** Shopify did not tell me their salary range. Only cryptically hinted that they ""couldnt come anywhere close"" to Coinbase's 230K CAD TC, even for Senior roles. When I told them I had offers, they all of a sudden said they could definitely come close to 215K TC. Indicated I'd be levelled as a mid-level most likely (despite not doing their onsite yet), and that offer would be <140K TC. Overall a bad experience.

**FOOTNOTE 2:** I hate Microsoft's interview process. I went through a bunch of recruiters during my time at University and all but one of them was bad. Same experience this time around, unfortunately. I went through the whole MSFT loop without talking in-person to one recruiter, and I had to constantly ask ""where am I in the process"". They would book interviews without telling me what to expect (HR screen? Tech? Sys Design?) and had to reschedule my interviews over 5 times. People were constantly late to my interviews as well. Very bad experience. Didn't even congratulate when moving onto the next round, just robotically asked for next availibilities. 


### Decisions
I had a couple of offers but ultimately wanted to end up at the SocialMedia company, so I started negotiating. I heavily recommend reading [this negotiation guide](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/). I ended up negotiating their offer to approximately 300K CAD TC for the first year, and 270K TC subsequent years. I'm very happy with that and I chose to accept the offer, and let the other companies know I've made my decision. I realize I'm incredibly lucky to be here, and feel a lot of gratitude to everyone thats helped me along the way.

### Reflections
Job market is insane right now. If you aren't happy at your role, please do yourself a service and apply. Even if you're happy, send off an application biweekly and see if you can find any interesting opportunities. I don't see myself as someone extrordinarily driven or intelligent, so I'm sure that you can find amazing opportunities too.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Again, I'm no expert in career advice, nor am I a seasoned/experienced engineer. I can only offer insight into my journey, and share my anecdotal thoughts.

edit: this was for a role in that will be working from Canada, remotely.",2022-02-25 04:08:55
zs6fqy,Layoffs and Recession Discussion Thread,"Hey folks, I wanted to compile a list of resources for those getting laid off, those unemployed and those looking for a job.

# Recession preparation:

* Ensure you have 6 months to 1 year worth of emergency funds
   * Calculate your total amount of spending over the past year and take the average. If you want to be safe, take the highest amount of spending per month. Go over your expenses and income after tax.
   * Determine which parts are discretionary, and which are for needs.
   * Pick an emergency fund saving goal:
      * 6, 9, or 12 months covering just needs
      * 6, 9 or 12 months covering needs and discretionary
      * 6, 9 or 12 months covering needs and discretionary + $2-5K for random event emergencies (vet visit, car crash, new car needed, plane ticket to visit family member in emergency situation etc. whatever fits best for your needs)
      * Start with the lowest goal if you have no emergency funds. 3 months covering just needs.
   * Example: You spent an average of $4K a month. $3K on basic needs, $1K discretionary. Starting savings foal will be 6 months of covering just needs, so reach a savings goal of $3K \* 6 months = $18K. To cover discretionary spending as well for that period, $4K \* 6 months = $24K
   * You can check /r/personalfinancecanada for more investment and savings information
* Brush up on you resume, and remember you can get it reviewed in our weekly thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/yrgo0o/salary_sharing_and_resume_review_mega_threads_2022/)
* Ensure your LinkedIn is up to date and is tailored well
* Keep a pulse on your industry and current trends

# I've just been laid off, what now?

**Step 1: Review your employment contract**

Contractor or not, review it! It may outline a severance package above the legal minimums! If it's not outlined, unless you are a contractor, they are required by law to provide termination notice depending on the length you have been employed for.

**Step 2: Review your severance package - is it fair?**

**Resources:**

* [Understanding How Severance Pay works](https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/losing-job/understanding-severance-pay.html)
* [How Severance pay is calculated and tips to negotiate](https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/pay-salary/how-is-severance-pay-calculated#:~:text=An%20employee%20typically%20receives%20one,years%20receives%20the%20maximum%20amount)

Layoff notice with no payout:

You make a salary of $70,000 per year, or $5,833 per month, or $1,346 per week in Alberta and have been with the company for 3 years. You have received notice of a layoff. They inform you that as per the legal requirement, they are giving you 2 weeks notice. Your pay continues as normal. For the last pay, a payout of any unused vacation earned so far, and any banked overtime is added.

Severance pay out example with legal minimum:

You make a salary of $70,000 per year, or $5,833 per month, or $1,346 per week in Alberta and have been with the company for 3 years. You have received notice of a layoff. They inform you that as per the legal requirement, they are giving you 2 weeks notice. Instead of getting you to work for that amount of time, they pay you out giving you a package of $2,692 ($1,346 x 2 weeks) plus a payout of any unused vacation earned so far, and any banked overtime.

Severance pay out example with company provided package:

You make a salary of $70,000 per year, or $5,833 per month, or $1,346 per week in Alberta and have been with the company for 3 years. You have received notice of a layoff. As you get your package, they inform you that they are giving you 2 weeks pay for every year you have worked. Making your severance package $8, 076 ($1,346 x 2 weeks x 3 years) plus a payout of any unused vacation earned so far, and any banked overtime.

**Legal Minimums per province summary**

Below is outlined the minimum amount that employers are legally required to give you based on your length employment. Some provinces there are restrictions as to who can receive severance such as:

* Independent contractors are not considered employees (and so are not entitled to legal minimum notice pay)
* You have to have worked the X consecutively with the same employer

**NOTE**: Benefits may also be extended for a length of time stated under the severance package.

**Step 2a (optional): Speak to an employment lawyer**

If your employer is not meeting the above minimums, or you evaluate that the package is unfair. Please reach out to an employment lawyer. Most will have a free consultation that you can discuss your situation

**Step 3: Review your emergency funds**

* Figure out what you have left, and how long you can last
* Immediately go over your last 6 months worth of expenses and figure out what to cut
* Take a breather - your mental health is important, and layoffs are never easy. Take some time for yourself, a day, a week, two weeks - whatever amount you think you can allow to focus on yourself and decompress.
   * If you still have benefits, review the mental health benefits offered and consider taking advantage of them if the coverage is good. Typically, therapists/counsellors/psychologists will have a sliding scale (income dependent) or in the range of $100-$200/hr.  Telehealth options are also available
      * Studies show that level of education does not matter if you're just looking for someone to talk to. All that matters is you find someone you trust, and you can forge a good relationship.

**Step 4: APPLY FOR EI**

* [Apply for EI](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-regular-benefit/apply.html)
* Note that if you are an independent contractor, you are responsible for your EI payments, which is optional to pay into. This may impact the amount you receive from EI.
* If you have accepted or received a severance package, you can still apply, however you cannot receive any EI until the package expiration date.

**Step 5: Get ready to job hunt**

* Brush up on your resume and get a review via our [weekly megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/yrgo0o/salary_sharing_and_resume_review_mega_threads_2022/)
* Make sure your LinkedIn is up to date, and make yourself open to work
* Do practice interviews. If you're doing it by yourself, it might help to video tape yourself and answer questions.
* Find and attend networking events and meetups - these can be free

# I'm worried I won't find a job, what should I do?

There's only one thing you really can do: **keep trying. Keep applying.**

In the meantime, some ideas to help:

* Volunteer with non-profit organizations that are related, such as Canada Learning Code, or through Volunteer Connector. This can have a good impact on your resume
   * Or, join a for-profit group to teach kids to code and get paid. Some Universities/Colleges have summer STEM bootcamps for kids you might be able to teach at seasonally
   * Or,  if you have experience, you can check out teaching positions at for colleges or universities
* Work on your own personal projects
   * Explore technologies and frameworks you have been wanting to get into
   * Build projects that can become a startup or monetizable
   * Gain more skills that have a larger hiring pool
* Freelance development
* See if going back to Education (bachelors, certificate, diploma, bootcamp, masters, PhD etc.) would increase your employability (considering financial affordability)
* Attend meetups and other networking events to connect (and be subtle that you're unemployed and looking)
* If you are experienced: create online content or a courses to sell on eLearning platforms such as Udemy
* Work on projects with others online such as on /r/INAT

Remember: **It will pass.** It will not be like this forever. I don't think this is as bad as the dot com bust or 2008 recession. It will eventually recover.

Hopefully some of this has helped, if others would like to share their experiences going through low times, recessions, worries, or other tips they want to add, please feel free to comment

# FAQ

**Q: How long will this recession/downturn last?**

My crystal ball says it could at some point within the next 10 years, maybe.

In all seriousness, I don't get why people ask this question. Nobody knows, and nobody is going to know.

**Q: What are my chances of getting a job once I graduated/Will I get a job?**

Nobody knows. It's a competitive place right now, so the only thing you can do is make sure you have done everything you can to remain competitive. That means internships, volunteering, projects, extracurriculars, networking, connections and LC.

**Q: There's not enough postings! Not enough jobs! Too many new grads! Too many bootcamp grads!**

The market will always be going in cycles of highs and lows. There's nothing you can do about other people and what companies are posting other than just do your best with whatever is within your control. If things do get desperate, it may be time to seek entry level positions for menial jobs such as data entry, retail, or taking a more entrepreneurial approach and creating your own business.

1ahev1r,Got an interview and messed it up!,"Finally had an interview after 2-3 months and around 100+ applications. But I completely messed it up. I have 5 years of experience and I think my experience was really fit for that role but I completely bombed the interview. Like i feel so embarrassed. The interviewer asked me what react hooks we’ve used and I completely blanked out and just told him i’ve been out of the industry for almost a year. I could have just said useState or useEffect or something! 

The interviewer then said he appreciated my honestly. Oh well, back to the drawing board. This is honestly just a rant.",2024-02-02 21:31:45
11l52g9,"PSA: It’s not just new grads, we experienced folk are having trouble getting jobs too","Browsing this sub feels like it’s a new-grad convention, and I’m hardly seeing any posts from experienced people sharing their job-market experience. So figured I’d at least attempt to get a little balance going in the discussion here. 

I’m a cloud solutions engineer with 5 years of experience working at a huge tech company, and hold a masters degrees in computer science from a good university in the US as well as cloud architect certifications. You’d think I’d have no trouble getting a gig but that hasn’t been the case: while I was approached by the likes of Google and Amazon last May and even cleared the Google interviews only to not receive an offer as they went into hiring freeze last June-July, things went largely quiet since until November. Calls and interviews resumed then but I’m yet to receive any offers in March 2023. 

The reason? The job market is so flush with folk looking for gigs that employers are enjoying the luxury of being ultra picky about skillsets and years of experience: unless you’ve worked on that exact domain of tech for the exact number of years they deem worthy, you ain’t worth squat because evidently they can get multiple candidates that fit their exact bill. Hell, they can probably get an astrologer involved and still have dozens of candidates to pick from right now!

My experience so far has been in a consulting capacity, meaning I’ve moved around from project to project over the course of my career, though within the same firm for the last five years. I’ve worked on all areas of cloud, on every public cloud platform in the enterprise space, but the market demands 5/8/10/100000 YOE on their specific niche and nothing else matters, because they’re hiring pre-programmed robots and not engineers apparently. 

And don’t tell me it’s my resume/LinkedIn because those have only gotten better since they attracted Google and Amazon on their own, without any applications from my side I might add. 

So what’s a guy to do? Nothing great, just pursuing certs I had no time for while working and keep applying and broadening horizons. Getting some odd job to pay the bills of course. What else?

So to all new grads that think some experience will sort out your problems forever, welcome to the jungle kiddo. 

Sorry if I sound mean, but it’s the harsh reality and yes, I’m angry and frustrated.",2023-03-07 17:12:56

11jtzmj,"Engineering perspective on the current CS job market, from someone who went through the 2014/2015 Oil collapse","I'm not a programmer so I don't have a complete appreciation for what you guys are going through. I stumbled upon this sub and from what I'm reading, the current job market for CS is not unlike the engineering market in Canada from a decade ago.


Engineering wages in Canada are heavily linked with the resource sector. When resources do well, they suck up engineering talent from the rest of the country, and an upward swing happens across all specialties (mainly civil, chem, mech and electrical). In 2010 you would be a fresh engineering grad from UofA/UofC/UBC and be handed an $80k offer (in 2010 dollars) from an oil sands company. Senior engineers, and project managers were clearing upwards of $150k.

And that's nothing to say of the rig pigs and others without a post-secondary education making $45+ plus. Up until 2013 resource workers were making on average $130k/year, 50% more than the average global resource worker. Higher salaries than US, and many European countries (Norway being the outlier).

**This was effecting everything from governmental research priorities, immigration priorities, education subsidies, etc. There was a 'flywheel'.**

And then the 2014 collapse happened. OPEC did their thing, and there was a glut. People lost jobs, got laid off, etc. It took another 6-7 years before any sort of recovery happened. Now with the geopolitical situations that exist the sector is trending upwards again.

**I'm seeing a lot of parallels here.** Seems like a fire was lit under this sector for a while, but the Pandemic really just made it all take off. Bootcamps feeding in more talent, immigration bringing in experienced programmers, computer science programs popping up in every university. 

This too will pass, but it may take some time. So be proactive in your career and look for tangential opportunities.  Things like doing the jockey, mundane web dev work. Know your worth. I saw that post of the dude getting a $45k/y offer in Vancouver - don't sell yourself short. It may not be as easy as it was to get the remote US job anymore either. Employers are going to take advantage of the labor surplus and try manipulative shit, so the new grads need to be careful of this. There is some shit going on that you just can't control right now. Not trying to be motivational or anything, just trying to give my perspective as someone who saw a similar thing happen in another industry",2023-03-06 09:25:26
11g516c,How did you find a U.S. company to hire you remotely?,"I’m curious how you went about finding a remote role in a U.S. company. I am thinking about expanding my horizons into working with U.S. companies because there is just a much broader selection of organizations using technologies I want to grow in, and solving problems I want to solve. 

When you dona search on LinkedIn for U.S. software companies, it’s not like they blanket advertise they’ll hire from Canada. I imagine it’s painful for them to get everything set up from HR in order for you to do the work from a different country. 

I’d be particularly curious about Non-FAANG companies for this, because we all know that FAANGs have this kind of sorted out a lot better already.",2023-03-02 15:08:17

10uvnjw,"How to avoid feeling behind/useless? Friends at UW with FAANG+, I have nothing noteworthy.","I made a choice many years ago to pursue biology in the hopes of becoming a doctor. I ended up hating it and dropped out in the middle of my third year. I ended up taking the rest of the year off and doing a gap year before starting computer science at a no name university with no co-op program. I had to start over. All of my peers in high school ended up at UWaterloo’s co-op program. Browsing their LinkedIn, I see that they all managed to secure a FAANG internship, some of them interning at HRT, Two Sigma or Jane Street. I feel like I lost 4 years with nothing to show for it. Never had a job during all 4 of these years. The majority of students at my university are either older students or students that are not what we would traditionally describe as being driven or ambitious. I severely regret not enrolling in a co-op program at any less prestigious university. Work experience is clearly much more valuable than a Masters in the current market. I feel in despair on most days because of my empty LinkedIn. I have grinded 400+ Leetcode questions, have reached out to 100+ recruiters via cold emailing and LinkedIn and have many personal projects using modern tech stacks - in addition to a personal portfolio. I cannot seem to get any half-decent internship interviews at any tech company. Looking for advice to cure my depressing mental state and unfortunate internship hunt experience. What makes it worse is that I used to outperform a lot of these people in all fronts in an academic context at a top school. I had a 1600/1600 SAT and 35/36 ACT if that is relevant at all. Ended up in a god-awful spot due to poor decision making, uncertainty about my career path and lack of foresight.",2023-02-06 02:53:50
19e3tcj,2 YOE Job Search result,"I'm currently at the Rainforest company and I've been applying to various FAANG/Unicorn/Big tech companies over the past 3 months. It was difficult to prepare and go through all the interviews while working full-time, but in the end, it has paid off!

I have not signed an offer yet, but TC will be in the mid-200s range, almost doubling my current TC. Even though the market seems to be quite terrible at the moment, it looks like it is picking up a little bit. If you have a decent, tailored resume that can pass the resume screening stage and then thoroughly prepare for the interviews, I think it is definitely possible to land some good offers, even if you don't have high YOE.

I wanna emphasize that the soft skills, ability to communicate clearly and give off that non-awkward, friendly-vibe to the interviewers, are very important and I think that has helped me a lot during my interviews.

However, I get rejected by all of them. I am honestly getting sick of this. Recently there has been that one company that matches exactly my skills and needs.

osrokk,Before you post an Immigration/Emigration Thread,"In the short lifetime of this sub, I have noticed a big influx in immigration into Canada or Emigration to the USA threads. 

While some of these threads are somewhat related, a lot of the discussions starts to center around visas, sponsorship and PR which can be better answered on other subreddits. 

Any new posts regarding Visa's or PRs that cannot be answered better via these resources can stay and you can post your questions as a comment in this thread. Otherwise it will be removed.

### FAQ

**I'm still a student wanting to enter Canada** 
Apply to Universities or transfer in as an international student, and enter on a student visa. 

**Which work permit should I apply for?** 
Express Entry will be easiest and fastest. For working professionals with a degree, this would be the best route. 

**I don't qualify for Express Entry. Now what?**
There are many ways to immigrate into Canada. Many enter Canada via education channels, such as a Masters or PhD program is common. You will have to check each program and see which is right for you. 

**Should I visit to find a job?** 
Depends on the country and visa you get, which will dictate how long you will stay. You cannot work in Canada with out the proper work permit, but you can seek employment while visiting. 

**I don't have a degree** 
Can be substituted for the right amount of work experience. While you could still qualify under Express Entry, Immigration is a competitive process and you may not be able to enter. 

**I don't have a degree AND I don't have any work experience**
You will likely not be able to enter under Express Entry, or Federal Skilled Workers Program (minimum 1 year of continuous full-time work). 

You could enter through the Temporary Foreign Workers program, however the onus is on the employer to develop a [Labour Market Benefits Plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/global-talent/requirements.html#h5) in which they must create more positions for Canadians in addition to hiring from the Global Talent Stream.

I would suggest trying to enter as an international student and finishing a small education program, such as a 2 year diploma, if your funds afford it (international tuition is typically 2-3 times the amount of a regular student)

## Emigration to the USA

Because the USA, Canada and Mexico are part of the NAFTA agreement, Canadians emigrating to the US qualify for TN Visa's, as opposed to the H1-B Visa's that other nations need.

### FAQ

**I'm still a student wanting to enter the US** 
Apply to Colleges or transfer in as an international student, and enter on a student visa. 

**Which Visa should I get?** 
Are you a Canadian Citizen? If so, a TN Visa. If you are transferring to a US branch for the company you currently working for, you can also have an L1. BUT, an L1 is tied to your employment at the COMPANY whereas a TN is a bit more flexible. Both have caveats however as to how the Visa applies.

**What should I answer if the company asks if I need sponsorship on an online application?** 

TN Visa is still considered sponsorship, HOWEVER if there is a short form or box to enter your own answer, respond that you are eligible for a TN

**I have a Canadian PR but not Citizenship. Does this change my visa type?** 
Yes, you cannot apply for a TN with a Canadian PR. Unless your citizenship is with Mexico, you will have to apply for an H1-B Visa 

**Is one visa better than the other?** 
Yes, a TN Visa. Generally speaking a TN visa is easier for the company and costs less, but this does not mean that companies will not hire H1-B's. 

**I don't have a relevant CS degree** 
Is it someway related to CS such as Math, Statistics, other types of Engineering? If it is somehow related, it might go through. Of course this is not a guarantee. The more relevant degree, the less issues you will have. If your degree is not relevant, it could pose an issue. It may be worth seeking an immigration expert. 

**I don't have a degree** 
Can be substituted for the right amount of work experience and reference letters from past employers 

**I don't have a degree AND I don't have the work experience** 
Might be tough to enter under a TN

**Do I need a Visa to work remotely?** No. However your currency and taxation will change. See /r/personalfinancecanada for more information. Visa is related to actually living on the countries soil.",2021-07-27 17:50:54
v8g7pf,My experience in the Toronto Junior market as a new Grad with no experience and a mediocre GPA,"I started my job search around the end of April when I was finished with classes and exams. When I did that I saw posts like this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/uj2j0j/best_advice_for_recent_grad_with_no_internship/) that made me very worried about my future prospects. In reality I thought it wasn’t that bad, it took me around a month to find a software engineering job making around 75k.

I really would recommend doing co-op and internships but if you haven’t I do not think your prospects are as bad as some on this sub make it out to be.

I should also mention that I had interesting projects, went to a good university, can do leetcode mediums pretty consistently and I think I sound like I know what I am talking about during technical interviews.

11s9nh0,How to avoid being underpaid?,"Title says it all pretty much. How can I avoid being underpaid as a Software Developer in Canada? I have 5 YoE, I am female, and I've never even been able to break the six figures yet. I've done everything that is usually suggested here:

1) I have a Computer Science degree at a well respected university and I have had amazing internships. 

2)  I have worked very hard over the years to get better at my craft, always. 

3) I've landed very prestigious jobs over the years.

3) My resume is well crafted: I almost one for one land any job I give my resume to, with little exception. 

4) I hopped jobs every year or so for a better salary, successfully. 

5) I am fluent in many languages, and have degrees in other areas that can prove useful for my work.

All in all, without fail, I get all the interviews in the world, all the job offers I could ever want, but every single time, the proposed salary is a disaster. All of my jobs have been like that. They've always lowballed me. Even during my internships, guys I went to school with that barely graduated, still landed jobs where they were paid 2$ more per hour than my Summa Cum Laude student ass was.

I've pretty much tried everything I could think of. Getting certifications. Getting better at my job. I've gone above and beyond, and still, I'm paid like shit, and the work I'm given is always fucking grueling. I always end up in jobs where I need to wear many hats for no added benefits. Meanwhile, many guys I went to school with have been hired in jobs where they don't do a whole lot and are paid triple my salary.

What am I doing wrong? What can I do to make myself more appealing to employers? How can I get a good salary in this economy? I'm at a loss...

Edit: I see some commenters taking offense at me stating my gender. Please ignore my gender if it causes you pain or anger. Stating my gender was done in the hopes that it would garner the attention of other women working in the industry that could perhaps share their wisdom. I did not think it would bring incels out of the woodwork. Please avoid making this post into a feminism diatribe; thank you!",2023-03-15 21:19:55

14scjku,Reality Check for CS hopefuls (earnings/school/big tech chances),"There have recently been some misconceptions on this sub and some I see time and time again. People see TikTok's or Twitter videos showing devs lounging around all day, living lavish and having high pay on levels and think that's the average dev experience so I'm here to clear up some misconceptions.

* You likely won't be making 200k out of university, even if you moved to the US, even if you go to an Amazing school / have great projects. The people getting into Google or Meta are literally the top 1% of devs. Amazon gets 50k Apps and takes less than 1000 new grads. To give you some context on the extreme case there was 60k apps for around 100 open intern positions. Tech is extremely competitive and the average dev is not making a super high salary.
* You still need to be talking to people, Software Engineering is a people focused job. The ideas you see in movies where devs are shut in people who don't speak to anyone for days isn't true. To be a successful dev you need to be social.
* Your background doesn't matter (if you were born into a wealthly / connected family this would help a lot more in law vs engineering), after a bit no one cares where you went to school, what was your GPA, who you know. All that matters is can you make the company money and can you demonstrate that to them. There are many studies which show that in Engineering the earnings of people who successfully applied to MIT with decent scores had similar earning to those actually went to MIT. CS is much more meritocratic than something like law
* Internships and University are the easiest time to break into big tech. [For example a leaked memo shows some FAANG companies only consider recent grads / current students for internships and new grad positions](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-hiring-careers-recent-graduates-students-only-after-layoffs) The interviews for SDE1 and internships are MUCH easier than SDE2 / same with the scope and responsibility. Bootcamps have been selling people the dream that oh just do a 6 months bootcamp and you'll make it to your dream company but a lot of the time those dream companies aren't even looking at your resume and the postions like apprenticeships are extremely competitve and barely exist in Canada.
* Once you gain work experience you'll realize that a lot of big tech hiring managers only look at resumes from other big tech companies. Meaning theres basically a moat around big tech engineers. making it even harder to break in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQVFYVMhPlw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQVFYVMhPlw) (there's a lot posts on engineering resumes / recruiting hell about this, where people will add instagram to their resume and suddenly all the companies they want will start reaching out)
* Don't get FOMO a lot of people only post their Ws but not their Ls, I've talked to some bootcamp grads who earned 100k straight out of a bootcamp when hiring was hot, and when you speak to them now a lot of them have been laid off / unemployed because the market is much less forgiving.

vjt0mf,Salary Sharing Interactive Results,"Happy Friday,

For this week and next weeks' TC Tuesday (which I forgot to post this on tuesday.... )

As most of you know (or should know) we have a weekly [salary sharing survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehwcm-hUI97AVLrHY_j44JrilAZ_HBs0itLXo_pYd1MrXl9g/viewform). **Thank you to everyone who has submitted their data and continues to submit data!** Because of your contribution, we have over 350+ responses!

We have had the [Raw Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bWuVGTKjJGlb2MxvRKZQMjhm30xQyywg2rLCfDqothI/edit) view as well as the [user Friendly and searchable view  made by /u/navneet\_here](https://salary-app.navaneeth.dev/) but the data visualizer built into Google Surveys is TERRIBLE and I promised some day I would try and have a better data view.

Well that day is today. I used Google Data Studio (which is incredible btw) and have a visualized all the data points and will continue to update the report as more data comes in.

The cool thing with Data Studio is that you can click on data points and watch other fields on the page change to match your data point so you can get a really specific view of a region [like so](https://i.imgur.com/MspwPFs.gif). You can also press ""CTRL"" if you want to select multiple fields.

If you want to reset your view, just hit reset in the top right corner [here](https://i.imgur.com/CAwDBit.png).

**[ACCESS REPORT HERE](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/6067f7e3-5112-47b9-aa0c-63cecdcfc1b5)**

**I AM NOT A RESEARCHER**, If someone wants to use the data for a formal research, please do!

As for the results, I think we can draw a couple of (and somewhat obvious) conclusions :

* **Remote US Salaries outpace Canadian ones.** In other news, water is wet. But seriously, even if we take into account that people with high salaries are more likely to submit a salary, the minimum TC for Remote US is around 20-25K higher than any other province. This may be due to the conversion of USD to CAD, which does increase salary by \~22% (depending on market rate).
* **Ontario has the highest salaries in the country**. Is water still wet? Median, Average, Max all beat every other province. Oddly enough, not in Minimum TC because someone is getting paid $11K TC which....who are you? And maybe reach out because that seems illegal....
* **High TC does not mean high base salary**. Some of our highest TC's have high bonus structure and high equity, but the base salary can be lower than ones with a lower TC's. Companies that do not offer equity or high bonus structure such as non-tech, and smaller orgs may have an equivalent or even higher base than those with a high TC.
* **Respondents who entered FAANG salaries all had a degree.** I don't want to draw tooo many conclusions from this as this is a small sample size, and there was a period of time I didn't ask the Bootcamp attendance question, so I can't say that no one also attended the Bootcamp. But what I can say is that whether it was related or unrelated, the highest education achieved by FAANG respondents were solely composed of degree holders.
* **More experience after 8+ years does not directly correlate to higher TC**. This one I found a bit interesting but not sure what to make of it. After 8 YOE, there's quite a bit of fluctuation in salaries that TC is almost stagnate. **Only 23% of respondents with more than 8 YOE make it past 200K TC** and if we compare base salary, it pretty much stays in the 100K -200K range, but rarely goes past 200K.
* **When do I hit 100K TC?** Excluding remote US companies (and Territories because there's no data for it...) if you live in HCOL Province (Ontario, BC, Quebec?) you can pretty much hit that when you graduate, so 0-3 years on average. For prairies (AB, SK, MB) 1.5 years OR 4+ years. It seems there's a few who are able to snag some high TC paying companies early in their career, and then no one hits 100K+ until after 4 years. For Maritimes, we don't have a lot of data points (7 to be exact) but it seems at 6+ Years.

Hopefully what this report does is give you a better tool to estimate your compensation given your area.

**What's next?**

There is some data points I haven't visualized that I would like to.

Someone asked the other day about how salary has changed over time, so I would like to maybe see if I can visualize that.

We just added an optional field to type in company name, so I would like to also put that somewhere. Again, not a researcher so I'm completely open to suggestions.",2022-06-24 16:57:29

t9w7bo,My job search experience - 130k base 1.5 YoE FT - Thanks for the help!,"Hey!

I've seen a few posts from people about their recently concluded job search and thought I would share mine! Posting on a throwaway account. I'm a software engineer just reaching about 1.5 YoE full time.

**Education**

I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from a university in Atlantic Canada at the end of 2020. I completed 3 co-ops at a security company (\~1000 employees), a local Canadian company and a tiny startup.

**Experience**

I'm mainly a front-end engineer at the local Canadian company, but for around half a year, I've been mentoring co-ops and working with AWS a lot more. I joined as a new grad at 50k, and after a year, I got a raise to 65k. You can probably see why I wanted to make a move...

**Interview Prep**

Passively grinding through Leetcode and familiarizing myself with python and writing pythonic code.

My Leetcode stats are 41 easy, 120 medium, 5 hard since September 2021. I refreshed myself on data structures and algorithms and wrote out the common patterns that Leetcode problems often involve. I kept a spreadsheet with most of the problems I solved and what patterns I used to optimize their solutions.

I also did a brief overview of system design and had a surface level understanding of the basic concepts; scaling, caching, load-balancing and database choices.

**Job Search**

I applied to various jobs at different levels (entry or mid-level). I started very passively looking in September 2021 but actively pursued a new role in mid-January this year.

I applied to mainly FAANG, places that seemed to pay a lot in Canada, or places doing really interesting work to me.

* \# of applications: 40-50 (including reaching out to recruiters or referrals)
* \# of interviews/screening: 8-10 different companies

Some very annoying processes at certain companies either do not inform you about the interview structure or require too many assessments just to get to a phone/on-site interview. The company I ended up going with had a very straightforward process which was great.

**End of my search**

I ended up with an offer of 205k CAD TC from a Unicorn company, and I'll be joining in the coming months. I'm grateful for all the advice and tips people have posted here.

If I can give one piece of advice, make sure to keep smiling if you get to the final round!

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them (I'm not anywhere close to an expert but ill try my best)!",2022-03-09 01:24:26
1777vag,Why is the job market in CS bad right now and how does it compare to the US? Do employees have negotiating power in Canada?,"Im a non tech engineeer, however CS and tech are fields I observed and have considered going into.

The main reason being cause I was envious when I saw it was so lucrative and employees seemed to have alot of bargaining power to do what they want and demand whatever.

A few years ago I repeatedly read of unemployed <3 YOE tech people in the cs subreddits who would turn down offers with better wages and work conditions than me. (90k, hybrid, 45 hrs per week) cause they knew they could get more and usually they would end up with greta paying jobs with way more benefits. Also CS itslef has nearly an unlimited wage ceiling and other side benefits such as learning skills to run your own startup or working remotely and being a digital nomad.

Most other fields are way more specialized, require in person attendance and are wage capped.
 
Gradually, I noticed that change and things became more negative. The Canadian CS subreddit seems there is even more doom and gloom here, and CS perhaps isn't the golden goose here as much as it is in the US. It seems the job seekers are a lot more down to earth, and there may not be as many lucrative jobs here.

I'm wondering are my observations correct and why is that the case? Why is the job market weaker in Canada and do employees have the same negotiating power?",2023-10-13 20:26:42
wgig0o,"Performance Improvement Plan provided by ER, legal options?","Shopify recently laid off 10% of their workforce (they had 14k staff). 

Around the same time they issued myself and dozens of colleagues Performance Improvement Plans. They've doubled down that this is an investment in my career, trying to get us into Positive impact rating. 

It's a good time to mention that they released a \~10% pay increase to all staff...except those they marked as Usually Meets, the level below Positive impact rating. They've admitted that the new compensation is for world class talent only in positive ranking. Anyone non-positive gets a PIP. Previously you wouldn't get a PIP for Usually Meets, only Off Track ranking, which is the lowest. Before a PIP was 3 months, now it's only 4 weeks. Same month they laid 10% off, they gave another percent PIPs.

They are documenting my activity and I can tell it's framework for a legal case or to justify Termination with cause. Those they laid off, they provided 4 revenue streams, $1250 laptop fund, access to EI, Shopify Partner ecosystem setup & 4 months severance, the minimum legal required amount for layoffs this size. Those on a PIP get terminated with cause, no severance package.

They've padded their 10% layoffs with another round of Performance Improvement Plan cuts and limited those passing the PIP from getting new compensation raises.

It's funny, they claim it's a way to get me into the new world class compensation, but they can't justify the rationale on my PIP. Their playbook says it's a method to coach me.

15dt0og,Watch out for startups that don’t compensate interns,"Credited from r/UBC u/Nice-Organization656

Original post link: /r/UBC/comments/15dcqx6/watch_out_for_startups_that_dont_pay_interns

Original post content:

“Hello,

I am a current UBC student that has worked at Dyne, a UBC-based startup (associated with UBC hatch, UBC-Startups, etc.) as an intern. I got to first know about the company at the UBC CSSS Tech Career Fair this January through Devvrat Tiwari, who I later learned was a member of the club. I thought that was strange at first but didn’t really think much of it at the time. He made it sound like it was a wonderful place to work and they were offering paid internships. I was really excited about the company and the opportunity as I had no experience.

As everyone knows, the job market is terrible and I had a difficult time getting interviews for a summer job. So I applied to a lot of the companies present during the career fair and Dyne was one of them. The job posting on the website said it was a volunteer position, which I was surprised to hear due to how they explained it to me at the TCF. I thought it was a mistake but applied anyways, and after getting the offer, I was told that it was indeed a non-paid internship. At that point, I had sunken too much time on it and reluctantly accepted the position because I was unable to get anything else. I managed to find an archive of the posting here: (https://web.archive.org/web/20230206200846/https://www.dyneapp.ca/careers/students)

Something to note, interns would get points based on their performance and if someone was the top performer, they would ""win"" a chance to be a paid intern. It was this weird sort of hunger game moment where we all had to fight against each other to see who was the best at doing unpaid labour.

I didn't think too much of it at first, as I thought any work experience would help me move forward in my career and something was better than nothing. After talking with friends and family regarding my position, I learned that unpaid internships are illegal in British Columbia. I do know there are more interns who continue to get hired and work there for free. I am unsure what to do, but I know that other students shouldn’t be exploited like I was. I need help and I don’t know what to do honestly. It was scary even just to write this in the first place granted the consequences it might have on me because of the NDA they’ve made us sign.

I feel students are being taken advantage of including myself, and I was wondering what we can do to hold the company accountable. I thought that this was a legitimate and trustworthy company as it was at a UBC-sponsored event. I think career fairs imply that the companies present have jobs, not unpaid labour positions. Why did UBC CSSS, the school, and the CS department allow this? I want to report this to help prevent this from happening again, but I’m not sure who to reach out to at the school and if there’s any action we can take against them. It’s just disappointing seeing companies like this be fully supported by the school to continue to take advantage of students in these trying times. I’m sorry if this was long-winded but thank you for reading and your help in advance.”",2023-07-30 18:45:43

12gbsgh,How do you have energy to self-improve after a full day’s work?,"I want to become a better software developer. I have 1.5 YOE and worked at 2 tech companies.

Everyone tells me that the best way to improve is to always be curious, and learn everything you can. However, I find that so hard to do.

I often work over 10 hours a day (admittedly, not all of it is productive), and I struggle to complete my sprints on time. Because of this, I find myself just focused on trying to finish my work, rather than exploring what everything does and how they work under the hood. To be honest, all of that is interesting to me, but I’m just completely spent at the end of the day.

The long hours also leave me feeling burnt out, and my brain just stops functioning at some point in the day. Sometimes, if I have a very complex problem, I just sort of give up and wait till I can think better or when the pressure of the deadline is higher than the pressure being stuck.

To avoid the burnout, I thought of working the normal hours, but if I don’t put in the extra time, I’ll have unfinished work at the end of a sprint and I worry I’d be laid off due to performance reasons (especially during these times).

I don’t think I’m stupid or lack passion - web dev was my hobby before it was my job. My managers at both jobs have praised me for picking up things quickly, at least during onboarding.. But the fact is that I see developers taking on large personal projects and courses during their downtime, and I just can’t figure out how they do it?",2023-04-09 07:03:17

16wj74y,Am I ruining my career? Should I jump ship?,"**TLDR: New grad hired as a software engineer, but feels like a glorified technical support. Considering leaving due to lack of coding and increased stress. What should I do?**

I was lucky enough to secure a a software engineer role at a startup. It started alright, my daily tasks were a mix of feature developments, code refactor, bug fixes, the usual. But it all got down hill since some org changes earlier this year. A lot senior members in my org were moved to another high priority project, and we had hiring freeze due to economy concerns.

Now I somehow become the go-to person handling customer complaints and production stability issues. Our product is used in a traditional industry, it's very frustrating dealing with non-tech-savvy customers. My time are occupied by juggling between angry customers, PMs, and SDK vendors. If not those, then I'm writing incident docs,  making excel sheets, and reports to management. It's been like this for months and I rarely get chance to code.  Despite raising concerns with my manager, I wouldn't expect any changes soon due to the ongoing hiring freeze, and the new project has higher priority.

I started to considering jump ship recently but it;s been really exhausting getting through the day and I did not have energy practicing leetcode. Also since I was not coding as much I doubt my ability could pass interviews.

Here is a summary of pro/con of the current job.  I would appreciate any insights and advice.

The bad:

* Little to no coding, feel rusty
* A lot of mental stress, like doing on-call everyday.
* Deal with vague problem with no guidance
* Long hours during severe incidents

The good;

* I have a job
* High visibility when fixing issues
* The pay is alright and fully remote
* Manager and higher-ups seem satisfied—I got promoted during a period of merit adjustments freeze and layoffs",2023-09-30 21:59:31

vv9d6r,Left Canada 13 years ago. Tech scene has changed. Curious what you consider the top companies in Canada to work for now are?,"Hi all! I grew up all over Canada. I'm a proud UofT 0T8+PEY EngSci grad, went to Facebook HQ (Palo Alto) out of school (when it was about 200 engineers), and stayed in California since then. Around 2015 the Mayor of Toronto came to FB HQ and met with some Canadians who left Toronto for Silicon Valley. He wanted to know how to get us to come back but there was just almost no tech scene in Toronto!

Now in 2022, a bunch of Canadian companies have popped up ([https://narwhalproject.org/narwhal-list/](https://narwhalproject.org/narwhal-list/)) and a lot of top tech are opening engineering offices in Toronto, like Facebook, Google, Netfix, Amazon, Doordash, etc...

I know this sub has a lot of new grads and I'm curious what you all consider the BEST OF THE BEST companies to join in Toronto/Montreal/Vancouver early career or out of school?

I'm kind of curious if I had graduated TODAY if I might have stayed in Toronto to work at some of these companies, but I want to get a pulse on the next generation!",2022-07-09 19:39:26

11cgosb,Spreading word about Host Cogent and Zofixer,"You mightve seen the job postings on linked in.  
   
They are pair of fake companies run by the same person. If you see a job posting by HostCogent, do *not* apply for it. You will not hear back from them, and if you do their process ""correctly"" you could be out $80.  
  
How it works, is that you are asked to make a vulnerability report for a few .vulnweb.com sites. They say ""you must use the ZoFixer penetesting tool"" for the assignment. If you do, you sign up for a free trial, and if you go through the ""main"" cancel page, it doesn't actually do anything. They won't tell you that until a month later you get charged and they refuse to refund.  
  
You have to find a hidden link to the stripe subscription page in a completely different part of the site to cancel.  
  
The tool itself is complete trash anyway, it basically just tells you ""route returned response with no content-type header"" or something. Surface level, completely useless info. If people are looking for a pen testing tool, Zofixer is hot garbage.  
  

But regarding the two companies, they are both on linked in with no employees, and until yesterday, as someone pointed it out, they had the same contact us email. Both are being heavily defended by only one person, Arash B. My guess is he's behind both companies.  
  
He seems to be using this fake interview process, for cybersecurity roles, web developer roles, etc, just to get people to sign up for the dumb tool.

There are a lot of open source software around that could use some extra developers here and there. There are usually entry level (good for starters) tickets that people of less experience can tackle.

Jumping in these codebases and contributing to a real project will be better than any portfolio/personal website you can build.

While analyzing my interview performance, I realized two things:

1. The interview was largely behavioral
2. Whenever the interviewer asked me a behavioral question, I would basically ramble a lot and not really get to the point. This was obvious to me after the fact due to a comment the interviewer made during the interview which I can't remember now (it's been a few years)

**Enter The STAR Principle:**

Since then, I started looking for ways to improve my performance in behavioral interview questions. I was introduced to the S.T.A.R principle during my Criminology degree and it has been by far one of the most helpful principles for me in behavioral interviews.

I have used it in multiple interviews since then with great results. That doesn't mean I always got the job offer but it does mean that I felt good about the answers that I gave. I used it during the interview of my current role as well.

The STAR principle gives you an easy way to tell stories that get to the point of the details that the interviewer wants to know about.

**How To Use The STAR Principle:**

**Situation:** Start by describing the situation briefly and clearly. What was your role in the situation? Who was involved? What were some important details that impacted your decision? Anything relevant to the situation that would set the scene for the interviewer can be mentioned here.

**Task:** Next, briefly and clearly describe the task that you had to do

**Action:** Go further into detail about the specific actions that you took. What is it specifically that you actually did?

**Result:** What was the result/outcome of your actions? What was it that you accomplished?

**Example of How I've Used This Principle:**

I was asked an interview question about how I would approach a new problem that I did not know how to handle initially (I'm paraphrasing, I don't remember the exact question)

**Situation:** I have recently completed an internship with Company A. This was my first internship experience and I had been assigned a task to add a feature to a code base. This was my first time reading a code base this large as in school, we usually only dealt with small code snippets or wrote code from scratch.

Adding a feature to an existing codebase and understanding how all the parts of such a large codebase works was a new situation for me.

**Task:** As mentioned, I was tasked with adding a new feature to this codebase. To briefly explain, the feature had to do x,y and z.

**Action:** While I had never worked with such a codebase, I did have tools at my disposal from my personal projects/schooling. I knew how to use a debugger so I started stepping through the code slowly in the debugger and started taking notes.

I started to understand how the different functions in the code interacted with each other and what the code was doing. I hopped on a call with a senior engineer as well who had context on the project and confirmed my understanding of the code up until that point. This gave me a better understanding of what I needed to add and where I needed to add it in order to complete the feature request.

Upon confirming my understanding, I started to work on and completed the feature request and got a code review from the senior engineer.

**Result:** The result of this was that I got my code merged into the codebase and completed the feature request successfully. My supervisor and the senior engineer were very happy with the contribution.

This is one example that shows how I can go into a problem that I do not know how to handle initially and achieve the desired result.

**Conclusion/TL;DR:**

The STAR principle has been one of the most useful tools for me to handle behavioral interview questions. It stands for:

**Situation:** Describe the situation in question

**Task:** Describe the task that you had to do in the situation

**Action:** Explain the steps/actions that you took

**Result:** What was the result of your actions

More info here: [https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/star-format](https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/star-format) . That's where I learned about the principle and I used information from that website throughout this post as well",2023-02-23 01:45:13
mdy5ha,Well Known Companies in Canada,"A list of the biggest tech companies in Canada and where they are located.

Note that although FAANG's are not Canadian, I thought we best include them so we get a better idea of what each city has to offer for tech and FAANG is still extremely competitive up here. This thread will eventually be moved into our wiki, but for now we want this to be in a more collaborative state.

Of course I should note that almost all companies have some sort of tech position to maintain their websites or internal systems, however I will limit this list largely to Technology-related companies with large engineering departments.

y8hl0f,Market is bad folks,Interviewed an intern today with 8 years relevant xp and 2 degrees. Intern...,2022-10-19 23:18:00
r1dxdv,Terrible at LeetCode? There are still very good options available,"Hello there, 

I just thought I'll just share some of the problems and challenges I faced while looking for a job. I'm an International student from India, and I have come to Canada to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science and Machine Learning. 

My LeetCode skills are garbage, and I can solve maybe an LC easy in 30-40 mins if I'm good. My stats are ~49 problems, with 25 mediums and 5 hards, and I solved all of them after understanding solutions in the discussions (I get blank when I see an LC medium usually).

So tl;dr, it was garbage. 

I was rejected after several OAs for SDE1/SDE2 positions, and some interviewers told me that I'm incompetent or a rookie on my face, which demotivated me for months, and as an international student with a family to support/feed, the pressure gets to you. 

But, I did have some experience working with real-time production systems prior to my Master's degree - I wrote code for mobile games played by over 2M daily active users, and handled several cloud engineering applications. Furthermore, I contributed code to some open source projects. 

The familiarity with real time systems made the difference for me, and I ultimately managed to get a really good role at EA for a PC/console game as a developer in a stack I'm good with (with a competitive salary when compared to top roles), and I was offered the role despite being a 0 in LC, because I was familiar with a similar tech stack, and I did really well in the stack based interviews despite doing nothing in the LCs. 

I'm just putting it, that even if your LC skills are horrible but you deep down know you can put together good codebases together, you can still get the job or salary you're looking for. 

Tl;Dr If you suck at LC, you may not be a terrible programmer. Keep faith and don't lose hope in the art of building softwares in the quest for LeetCode grinding.",2021-11-24 20:06:15
14tek0h,New Grad Job Search Experience 2023,"Hey gang, I’m sharing my 2023 new grad job search experience in hope that this writeup helps someone out there. Let me know what you all think.

**Background**

• CS major from UBC

• May 2023 new grad, started searching Sep 2022, accepted offer Jan 2023

• 3 co-ops over 16 months 

• 2 years CS TA 

• 1 year in university SE club with projects

• Leetcode: most of Blind 75, practised over and over

Edit: formatting

**Job Search**

70-90 apps directly on company websites, via Simplify suggestions, or LinkedIn — nothing came out of LinkedIn. All Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa offices.

• Didn’t attempt OA: 1

• Rejection after OA: 2

• Rejection after recruiter call: 1

• Rejection after first technical round: 1

• Offer: 1, after 1 OA + 4 behavioural + 2 technical interviews + reference checks. I signed for about 150K TC, 110K base. I’ll try to keep my interviewing skills sharp just in case.

• Didn’t attempt interviews: 3, because the invites came after I’ve already signed an offer and was burnt out.

• Co-op 1: didn’t reach out because I didn’t like my old team tech stack.

• Co-ops 2 & 3: went on hiring freeze.

**Thoughts**

Reflecting on my experience, I think a lot of the work is/should be done while you’re in university. TA and SE club helped me get my first co-op. From then on, the other  experiences gave me a lot to put on my resume and to talk about during interviews. I’m very grateful for these opportunities, thus would always recommend extending your degree for co-op/internship over graduating early without any. 

Another helpful thing I’ve been taught by my co-workers is to keep a smile folder! Store screenshots or notes of your achievements, business impact, praises, promotions, anything that speaks to your value as an employee but didn’t make it to your resume. These things can really help you piece together a narrative for behavioural interviews later.

Lastly, start the job search earlier than later. I think a few companies have hiring cycles that start Jul or Aug? I missed out on them.",2023-07-07 18:03:02

vg58x5,Shopify or Amazon for fulltime (new grad)?,"I'm in the very fortunate situation where I have to pick between Amazon and Shopify for full-time. It's a super difficult decision and I really need some insight on how to proceed.

Shopify offer and details:
- 85k CAD base
- 15k USD RSU
- 5k ""spending account""
- Full remote, get to live at home with my parents

Amazon offer and details:
- 110k CAD base
- 30k CAD Sign on
- 10k CAD stocks (roughly)
- 8k CAD Relocation
- Would have to move to Vancouver and work in-person

What would you pick and why? I'm leaning Shopify for the WLB and the chance to grind out some LC to land a better offer but I'm very tempted by Amazon for career and growth prospects. 

Thanks so much <3",2022-06-19 21:33:24
sqf7ii,"I ended up with a 100k base offer after 2YoE, thank you folks for your help!","I posted some threads here before regarding taking offers with low pay (60k/65k base). Here are the stats, I have a google sheet, but not sure how to stay anonymous, so I will just say the numbers:

1) # of applications from December till now: 155  
2) # of interviews/screening: 14  
3) # of automated rejections: 44, marked 0 on my sheet  
4) The rest are all marked -1 on my sheet, meaning no hearing back from yet.  
5) # of offers: 6. Lowest base: 65k Highest base: 100k

Some notes: I noticed from all these applications, the ones that were the most receptive to me or excited were the ones that were hiring for junior/recent grad/associate position. Which is odd considering I'm vastly over-qualified. And the ones that rejected me mostly were ones where I had the exact YoE/criteria they were looking for.

For reference, I started with 70k first job out of university, and stayed no more than inflation (78k) in 2021 for the last couple of years. So the jump was from 78k -> 100k just by switching jobs. No groveling over raise.

Notable companies that ghosted me after automated Hacker Rank assessment or straight up screening: Thomson Reuters, Snow Software, Morning Star

Notable companies (recruiters/engineers) that were actually very nice to me and treated me like a human being:  
Canadian Bank Note Company, SPS Commerce, Genesys, Wave

The most frustrating experience, is that none of the offers came at the same time. Most of them were 1 week after the other, which meant I had to turn down some because of shit salary or shit remote work policy. It was double annoying because I was also unemployed, so I took a huge gamble. If I were to go through this again, I would definitely stay at my old job first before doing something like this.",2022-02-12 01:21:12
17vjz0p,No entry level jobs?,"Kind of a rant, but about 5-6 months ago I finished a web development bootcamp located in Toronto Canada (Juno College). I took the bootcamp because I was let go from my previous job and was job hunting for about 3-4 months with no luck. I was a new graduate from and had about 1.5 years collective experience in my field from an internship and one other position post graduation (office type role, no coding experience at all or any experience in a tech field prior to the bootcamp).

going back to college / university would of been far to expensive for me and graduating in my 30's to compete with 20 year old's didn't sit well with me especially since I was transitioning from a completely unrelated field so I decided a bootcamp would be the better choice - The bootcamp was no mean a replacement for a CS degree, it only really focused on frontend web development and touched on some aspects of backend development.

but I feel my frontend skills and capabilities are more than enough to land a entry level UI / Frontend position(or I'm just delusional) and I feel confident in my ability to still learn while at whatever company WOULD hire me.(Note I was still applying to jobs in my field of recent study so during the bootcamp with no luck still so about total 8 months of unsuccessful searching while ""upskilling"" )

but now that I've ""graduated"" from the bootcamp and it's been about 4 or so months and I'm having an extremely difficult time finding any kind of work. I can't find any junior positions that don't require 3-4 years experience in the field already and I'm finding it impossible to compete with new grads from university because even they have real world experience with internships and what not and well actually know system design, unit testing etc.  


 I've applied to easily 100+ postings, have reworked my resume countless times, spent hours writing cover letters tailored to different companies and roles - even spamming recruiter and possible team lead / team managers via email (not actually spamming just sending them about 3 emails over the span of 2 business weeks 1 intro email  + my resume and cover letter attached and about 2 - 3 follow ups). I've gotten nothing but rejection after rejection for all these ""entry"" level positions.

I've had to get a job at the local superstore just to scrape by with my rent payments and I'm really starting to feel like I'm fucked and I'll never find a junior web dev position. Am I completely fucked? what's the next step even - go back to school and live in poverty hoping a college degree makes me more marketable? - continue grinding Udemy style courses and hope some recruiters are impressed by it and think that makes me  more ""qualified"" ?

All this work and effort just to back to retail work minimum wage is seriously depressing and makes me feel like life isn't really worth this struggle.

I took the bootcamp fully expecting to land a front end focused role, that paid me somewhere from 50-70k cad. I’m not aiming for some FANG level company or want to make 200k plus TC I just wanted a job from home or remote in this field because it genuinely interests me (UI development, front end stuff etc) and would appreciate help from the community on what steps  you think I should be taking or what I should be learning now.

However, me and couple others were pulled from the project and was told to train a new replacement telling us there was new project lined up for us. This was not the case and we got laid off a month later. The reasoning HR gave to me was that there's lack of projects due to budget cuts in the industry and they had to restructure.

When I was in the bench before the layoff, I also was in a meeting with the project coordinator who told us that they were prioritizing people who transferred from their Indian office (they were on closed work permit through IMP that requires no LMIA) because otherwise they would have to go back to India.

She also mentioned that she usually shared with her manager her daily work in a form of summary via instant messaging.

How does it compare to other career fields? Is it still better than those ones and a good choice overall? Is it as bad as this sub implies?

svod15,Am I missing something? What's the point of staying in Canada career wise?,"The only comparative high paying jobs are satellite offices from their American counterparts. Even the highest paying jobs (Meta, Brex, etc) can only maybe match their USD equivalent (pre-conversion) to CAD if you're lucky (very likely not).

Then on top of that, it's very likely higher taxes and similar COL, and a much weaker dollar. What's stopping someone from getting a 30% pay bump just from the dollar conversion?

AND on top of that, teams in Canada are likely working on less glamorous things, and the greenfield/high impact roles are likely in the central hubs of the company (ie USA), so career growth is probably going to stagnate in comparison as well.

Of course, this is all pointless if you have ties such as family or other personal investments towards Canada, but all else it doesn't make much sense to me.",2022-02-18 18:06:00

I imagine others do similar.

Plus, when it comes to companies that have AI filter the applications, they can't read yours at all

Edit: Guys. You don't generally open Word documents in Acrobat x)

What I mean is, PDFs can either retain all of the text data, think SVG, or be compressed so that it's effectively a raster image.

What has been your experience so far in these months?",2024-03-24 23:14:17
1aoh9hb,Seeking advice. 3 YoE and feeling hopeless after being laid off in Oct 2023,"I had been working ever since I had graduated mainly in the React Native development space. I worked at my recent position from June 2022 up until October 2023 where I was laid off. As expected, it took me by surprise, but I have been applying ever since and have been trying to brush up on skills here and there (which is not always easy as I, sometimes, have to postpone up-skilling due to prepping for another interview).

  
Nevertheless, getting callbacks or interviews seems to be very painful compared to 2022 where I was always getting them. I remember feeling hopeless back then to, but in the worst case, I still had a job, and at least things seem to had worked out when I least expected it (from a hindsight), and there were a lot of lessons that I learned along the way.

  
While I can at least get 1 or 2 callbacks, I am beginning to feel hopeless, my mental health is taking its toll (sometimes I feel like a different person), and I am getting more stressed (to the point that I can't even function like my usual self sometimes) as the months pass by. I want to believe that I am much closer to getting a job, but with the few callbacks and rejections thereafter, the light seems to get further and further away, and my career gap gets bigger and bigger.

  
I feel like giving up. It feels like it might be too late for me at times. Not sure what to do.",2024-02-11 20:12:36
18id3qb,Recent experience looking for a remote Frontend/Fullstack position,"Inspired by [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18hv4i1/recent_job_hunt_experience_from_seniorish_engineer/) in /r/cscareerquestions I wanted to write about my recent experience in searching for a senior frontend/fullstack position. My current company has announced that they plan to reduce areas of the business, and I wanted to get ahead of any potential layoffs.

Edit: 9 YOE, worked with mostly Angular and Vue professionally on the frontend

## Results

[Sankey diagram](https://imgur.com/a/VPrkLMl)

In total I applied to 58 positions, starting in late October/early November. Most (50) were through postings on LinkedIn or on the company website. I did have some recruiters (7) reach out to me directly, and I had one referral from a friend/former manager at their company.

I was fairly selective about the roles I would apply, mainly focusing on roles that were fully remote, and that were in an industry I found interesting and/or using a tech stack that matches my existing skills.

## Screening

Of the 58 positions I applied to, I received 8 offers to interview. Most started off with a phone call with the HR/recruiter for the company, with one requiring a small take-home. With 2 of the companies I ended up declining at this point since the salary range was not within my target range. From there most companies had either a technical screen (pair programming), with one having a behavioural interview.

## Onsites

Of the 8 screenings, I participated in 4 onsite rounds. These were all fairly similar and contained the same kinds of interviews:

- At least one pair programming interview: most were a leetcode-style problems, with one being a debug/fix/iterate an existing react application.
- System design interview, this was about 50/50 being either 'design a system from scratch' or 'walk through a system you designed'. I found I did much better with the latter since I was familiar with the subject matter.
- Behavioural interview: this was mostly a series of questions about hypothetical situations (or situations that had happened in the past), mostly around working with others (conflict resolution, introducing/proposing changes, etc).
- Past experience/leadership: One company had this, where we went through my experience at different positions and discussed projects/learnings.

From these 4 onsites, I successfully completed 2, failed one, and withdrew from another after accepting one of the offers.

## Offers

I received 2 offers that were fairly comparable with eachother. One was an American company that worked with an agency to hire full-time Canadian employees, where the other is based in Canada. The salaries and options grants were about the same, but what tipped over the edge was the Canadian company having _much_ better health and wellness benefits.

In terms of comp, I did receive a ~8% bump in salary along with options, and in total is a decent jump in total comp from my current position. However it's a slight pay cut in terms of liquid/actionable comp, as my current company is publicly traded and I can sell the shares I receive. However I'm ok with this trade, as I do think the company will be quite valuable in the future.

Before: $169K Salary + ~$40K RSU
After: $185K Salary + ~$40K Options",2023-12-14 16:59:19
12069qd,Recent Graduate: Is a lack of internships an instant rejection?,"I'll be honest, I'm looking for a pick-me-up more than anything. I want to work in tech, I genuinely love building things and writing code. But I'm starting to think it's all hopeless because I don't have any internships.

I have been applying to internships this summer, but haven't heard anything back at all (not even an interview). Since my degree was only 2 years I'll be graduating soon. So I should probably be thinking about applying to new-grad positions as well.

I know tech is a popular career, so there are lots of people wanting to break into it. So I appreciate the importance of networking, projects and open source contributions. I'm fine with all that stuff, because it's things that I can do.

My problem is whenever I try to do that stuff, I get kind of bummed out because it just seems hopeless. I can't shake the feeling that my resume will go straight to the trash because I lack internships/experience. Which is the one thing that I can't get on my own. Thus even doing projects seems like a waste of time and it's killing my motivation.

Is having no internships and instant rejection? Are you someone who recently got hired without internships, or hired someone without them?  


Myself, and I think a lot of people in my situation too, would really appreciate people's thoughts on the matter?",2023-03-24 02:30:07

I applied for more than 170 positions but only got this one offer. I was mainly looking for business analyst, data analyst and consultant positions, but ironically got this associate role. In hopes of getting some experience to help me land a better job, I accepted this only offer, only to get trainings and nothing real before eventually getting terminated.

I feel desperate right now. The whole job search from last time still haunts me, I’m no longer a new grad, and got a non-experience on my resume. What’s my best bet now?

15qgz32,Why does it have to be all or nothing in tech industry?,"I have 9 years of development experience in web and mobile domains. While I wouldn't claim to be exceptionally skilled or possess a natural engineering mind, I worked hard to pursue this career. I'm self-taught and have a degree from a different field. I've been able to live off my experience back in my home country, where my work involved a mix of remote freelance and full-time positions. My primary focus was on UI development using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Angular.

At a certain point, right before moving to Canada, I made a decision to change my career to iOS development. I quit my job and jumped into learning mobile development. It was right when pandemic started, so I got plenty of time to learn. I completed several online courses, where the most significant was iOS Developer certificate from Meta which took me 6 months to complete. I built dozens of projects, including working for a startup where I invested 2 years of effort to design, develop, and launch a social media app.

Since I moved to Canada, I have never been able to land any tech interview for web and mobile positions. There were some initial screening calls, where I kept hearing that their company is looking for exceptional and very experienced professionals. I couldn't get any freelance gigs either, even tried to compete with thousands of devs from all over the world for very small rates. I never thought that working hard and literally having a real experience means absolutely nothing in terms of employment. I never thought that I couldn't earn a single dollar after being in tech for almost a decade.

This is an absolutely astounding situation for people like me. I have never aspired to become a prodigy who lives to solve hard LC algorithms every day before breakfast, lunch and dinner, but it seems like the companies only want that kind of people.

I don't want to have $200k salary. What I think is fair is a simple opportunity for people with experience to be able to get a tech job, even for $2\\hr. To have some security or feeling that they are needed instead of having a constant pressure to perform better than the competition, or worse, thinking that they are stuck in a dead end situation after many years of hard work on their craft.",2023-08-14 01:52:26

11drpaa,Is Montreal still good for software engineers?,"I'm currently a junior (0.5 YOE) in Montreal. I make 70k (about average for quebec soft. eng.) and I feel like I'm poor. I'm currently paying 1k for rent and I have cockroaches and no laundry im a old building. I'm trying to look for a new place to live but it seems that if you want a *decent* looking 1 bedroom 1 bath appartment in Montreal nowadays, you need at least 1500$ monthly rent. 1800+ if you want something that looks nice. 

It makes me think that Montreal salaries are LCOL-based while the city itself is slowly but surely becoming HCOL (def MCOL at this point). I really want to move away. Somewhere better, but I don't know where.

My parents tell me that 12 years ago 1500$ would get you a luxurious appartment in Montreal. Housing prices have doubled since, yet salaries remained practicly constant. Not to mention inflation for pretty much any goods you buy and not to mention Quebec's highest tax in Canada.

1ajuesw,Advice on Job Hopping to Amazon During Layoffs - Early Career,"I am supposed to join Amazon Canada as an L4 SWE next week but I can't make up my mind on whether to go through with it due to fear of layoffs. The org I'm joining is under retail. I was originally supposed to join earlier but my offer was delayed and my current job is asking me to reconsider the switch.

I'm currently working a software job where I make around 65% of what I'd make at Amazon. After I gave my 2 weeks notice, they've still tried to convince me to reconsider staying. I've been here for 8 months and my issue is that compared to the amount of new skills and development I had when interning at Amazon and Coinbase, I have not learnt much at all. There is no visible engineering culture here and it's not comparable at all to the bigger tech companies. A lot of the tech for the product I work on is also very old (PHP) and we are encouraged to follow the same old patterns in the codebase. I've communicated this to my manager and he's given me assurances that I'll get to work with other technologies later this year but I don't know about that. The only pro of this place is that it's a very stable job that will be stable for the next few years. 

I really enjoyed working at Amazon and like the team I'm going back to but I'm worried that given I'm so early in my career layoffs could have a huge impact on me. There have been some new grads who got laid off last year at Amazon within a couple of months of starting.  I also graduated late from university due to personal issues which means I'm already a few years late into starting my career. Aside from the chance of layoffs I'm very confident in my ability to do well at Amazon.

I know it's impossible to predict the future but what should I consider to help myself make this decision?",2024-02-05 23:01:44

y8ogpv,How to ace Interviews,"backgrounded: Uwaterloo new grad, grinded leetcode over the summer (decent at it to do well in coding round)

I gave a bunch of interviews lately, none of them really focused on leetcode (only slightly). But most interviews dived deep into domain knowledge and skills.

Is there any resource any one could share with me where I could get better in my domain skills and ace this round. I feel i can never be good at everything since there are so many questions they can ask and pigeonhold into. 

For entry level roles I have been asked about my experience in microservices (which I know nothing about), deep dive questions into frameworks that I only did 1 project on.

ttuphv,Dispelling faang+ myths.,"I'm seeing a lot of myths about faang and adjacent tech companies from people who have seemingly never worked in them. I'm a SWE with about 5 yoe and I've worked at 2 different tech companies in the last 2 years and know people who've worked or are working at several others.

1. Faang only hires competitive coder geniuses who can churn out a LC hard bug free in 15m or less.

This is completely false. I've interviewed with 7 different faang+ companies last year and LC hard percentage is maybe 1 question during the entire process. The overall break down I would say is 20/70/10 for easy/medium/hard. And for most places you aren't expected to even run the code and bugs are expected since you're not operating within an ide.

2. They only hire people from the best schools.

This might have some truth for internships and new grads but I've seen people not from Waterloo or UFT. McMaster, Carleton, a host of random overseas schools. Even for myself I barely graduated from a no name school yet I got 5 offers in 5 onsites.

3. Everyone inside is a genius in the top 1% of their field.

Not even close. Every company needs worker bees who can get told what to do and do it. The difference is that big tech might have 1 of those for every 10 employees where your bank and government might get one for every 200 or something.

4. You're expected to work all the time and your life becomes work 

For most places this is absolutely not the case especially notorious ""retirement homes"" like M/G. Even places like Amazon or FB is very team dependant and I can confidently say 60+% of the teams work 40hrs or less as long as you're smart about avoiding the known toxic ones (aws, Alexa, frontline product at FB etc). 

On call for the most part is very reasonable. You usually are not expected to produce outside of monitoring and resolving issues. Its usually once every 8-12 weeks and if you get paged at night you can often get secondary oncall to take over during work hours while you rest during the day. 

Vacations are super generous for the most part. I've gotten everything remotely resembling a holiday off and unlimited PTO that I'm actively encouraged to use. Even the known ""toxic"" ones get at least 30 days if you include sick days and public holidays.

Feel free to ask questions about anything I missed. I genuinely believe anyone can get into these companies with like 2 months of prep and decent fundamentals. At worst a stop for a year at amazon to open things up which was what I did.",2022-04-01 16:19:41
sabe4o,How to get more interviews.,"In this topic let's discuss tips on how to actually get interviews as it appears that's a commonly asked question/concern on this sub and we can all learn from each other in this regard.

Note: I've never worked for any big brand company, only no-names thus far. So do not think the below tips are irrelevant unless you have FAANG on your resume or something.

&#x200B;

* First and foremost you want to work on your resume and show you've had impact in your career thus far. Avoid fluff and vague statements. For instance, you don't want to say ""I worked on X product and improved it"". You want to say ""I reduced latency on Y page in X product by 200%"". A recruiter will spend maybe 20 seconds looking at your resume, so short and sweet is the way to go. Get people to look at your resume and provide feedback, it can go a long way.
* Keep your LinkedIn up to date and if you're in interview mode, set your status to open/looking. You will be surprised how active recruiters are on there these days. I personally was contacted by Wayfair (a top option in Canada) and Amazon several times just through there without ever applying.
* Check out the Hired platform. You do a few quick tests and setup your profile. Afterwards your profile will be active and visible to recruiters for a few weeks there. And some great companies are actively recruiting from there. I personally was contacted by Dropbox for instance.
* Get referrals. People in tech are super nice and willing to help others. On forums like Blind, if you ask politely and show you're ready for interviews, a lot of people will give you referrals to their companies. A referral doesn't guarantee an interview of course but it can drastically improve your chances.
* Apply, apply and apply again. Ultimately getting interviews is mainly a numbers game and luck is a huge component. So never get discouraged. I've personally been rejected several times over the years by some companies and then eventually got interviews by those same companies on my 4th application.
* Use Amazon as a stepping stone. Generally people like to avoid working at Amazon. However, they are hiring like crazy these days and are giving interviews to anyone with a pulse. And regardless of bad publicity, Amazon is a top option to have on a resume, recruiters will hunt you down afterwards. So if you feel your options are truly limited, I would not turn down an Amazon offer. It's better to work there for a year (who knows, maybe you'll find a good team) and then countless doors will be opened for you. Additionally, if you do choose Amazon and are okay with moving to the US, it's a much better option to work for Amazon there than in Canada due to the pay differences.

Please share other tips that have worked for you below.",2022-01-22 20:31:30

108kon2,Those working in another industry and made a career switch to cs - is it what you expected?,"Those that went from an engineering, business, bachelor or stem field to cs, was the transition worth it or do you think cs is kinda glorified as a better working environment? Isn't it more stressful and you hear alot about burn out or constantly having to learn new thing, layoff etc. Kinda interested to know what people who made the switch think about their transition from their previous field to what they do now.

Coming from business to cs I found it much more stressful and the people I met in the industry were fake. Alot of big talk and people saying they will do x but never follow through. I know not everyone is like that but seems like thats my general sense of people in tech since seems like a dog eat dog field and competitiveness in the field. Plus all the competition just make you having to work extra harder. To me I kind of realize boring field is alright if it's chill.",2023-01-10 20:54:25

15wu0fz,"Is making a career and being ""fully self taught"" even possible anymore?","Full disclosure: I am 31 years old and do not have a university degree.  

I have a 2 year college diploma that is tangentially related to web development.  I have gone through a few udemy courses, as well as dabbling in the free resources (FCC, odin project) over the past ~8 months and am starting to feel somewhat competent developing websites & web apps using HTML/CSS/JS/React.  Considering dropping the money on a bootcamp to get ""certified"" and hopefully get the gaps in my knowledge filled in from the teachers and other students, as well as (ideally) the networking opportunities and job support.  

I guess my question is pretty straightforward: is getting a software dev/web dev role possible in Canada anymore without a degree?  I see people post in r/learnprogramming and r/cscareerquestions about breaking in through self learning, and while everybody says it's difficult and you have to *really* want it, this sub seems to be a lot more doom & gloom, maybe reasonably so.  Is our job market that much worse than it is in the states?  

Idk, not sure if I'm wasting my time trying to this by myself, you know?  I'm enjoying learning everything, but i'm curious if it is objectively worth it to bite the bullet and go back to school for 3-4 years and get a CS degree.

Any input is appreciated, thanks all.",2023-08-21 02:02:31
139m8td,"Feeling kind of hopeless - Can't find an IT job, only hearing stories of people far more qualified than me getting laid off or unable to find a job either. Do I quit while I'm ahead before going for a CS degree?","I have a 2-year CS College Diploma, and just over a year of experience in the IT Industry. I moved to the GTA in Canada and just cannot land a CS/IT job. Every job in the industry that I apply for has hundreds if not thousands of applicants also applying, and I'm obviously going to be far from the most qualified for it. Doesn't matter if it's a Junior position, Assistant position, menial office job that just wants skills in MS Office stuff, it feels completely hopeless, even when applying for ones at minimum wage. I've looked at all avenues - programming, software, security, doesn't matter either. I've set the distance on job sites like Indeed and LinkedIn to up to 1 and a half hours from my home and still can't find anything.

And I'm seeing this sentiment all over the internet - people with a CS Degree and half a decade of experience unable to find anything, new grads not finding anything, Senior positions working for decades getting laid off, and I just wonder ""What's the point?"" as someone who doesn't even have a degree. Just a few weeks ago a relative who's been in the industry for decades saw dozens of senior employees in their IT firm get laid off.

The only somewhat plausible option that I've seen is moving out of the GTA to a less populated area that has vacancies simply because no one lives there or wants to move there, which means moving hours and hours away from family, friends, and the conveniences of living in an urban area. I feel like this would be the ultimate last resort if I absolutely can't afford to live without the salaries they offer.

At this point, I'm genuinely wondering if there is even going to be a future in the IT industry. It seems like, as with many career paths before it, everyone was told a decade or two ago how lucrative this industry would be, and now it's overflowed with bright-eyed new grads looking to make it big, and no one wants to hire anyone or pay them anything above minimum wage now.

My plan for the past ~5 years was to get another year of IT work experience and then go for a Bachelor's in Computer Science, and decide what to focus on (Security, Software etc). But now I'm wondering if I should quit while I'm ahead and pursue another field - my main considerations being medicine, law or some kind of trade. I'm probably not going to attend University for another year, if not two, and then of course the Degree itself takes 3-4 years and tens of thousands of dollars.

I'm not asking for any wizards or fortune tellers, just genuine speculation on if the job market in this industry is going to be this terrible in 3-5 years or not. Even if the job market recovers, are the net salaries of CS careers going to go down because of the diluted industry, similar to what happened to the gaming industry? The salaries of Entry Level positions are already looking to be decreasing slightly, and even Senior positions appear to have taken a hit.

Thanks for any advice or discussion, I'm genuinely just wondering if to bother continuing and going for a CS Degree with the state of the market and its heavily uncertain future.",2023-05-06 12:57:33
12emf3c,Did you learn software design and OOP principles in your CS degree?,"I mean aside from the bare minimum? I'm interviewing co-op candidates right now and they're really struggling with inheritance. I did the same program, so I think I would have been in the same boat doing my own technical assessment, but this is something I now view as very basic. 

So, I don't think I'm very satisfied with how my alma mater teaches these topics. I don't think most people are served that well by how strongly algorithm theory is emphasized over design. Don't get me wrong, it's important to learn, and the main reason I'd recommend a degree over bootcamps and self-teaching, but I think a lot of the practical day-to-day stuff the average graduate actually uses suffers.

(There's no SWE program, just some individual courses distributed between CS and CE)

Edit: man, it's almost like they're teaching to the test of the garbage interview questions most companies use, which have nothing to do with what you do on a daily basis.

Edit 2: I should clarify that struggling with the exercise isn't enough to disqualify anyone. I was able to get a look into how they think about solving the problem, and that's useful even if the base knowledge is a little lacking. Inheritance is ultimately something you can pick up on the job because we use it a lot where it makes sense.",2023-04-07 14:05:24

I work at a small company and we have a team of about 15 people. I joined the company around 6 months ago. Since joining I have finished one high priority project all by myself. My manager also has said to me that I'm doing fine. But I still keep being anxious about my work performance. Before finding this job I was laid off from a company and it took me quite a lot of time to find this role. I don't want to lose this job at all cost even though it pays below market rate. 

Recently after finishing my first project I switched to a different one where I'm working with other dev. Whenever I raise PR, I get so many change requests which makes me anxious. Whenever I make some mistake in documenting or something like that, it makes me anxious. From a week or two I have very few things on my plate which also makes me anxious that I am not delivering enough. All of this is adding up to the stress of some personal life issues that I'm dealing with right now.

Prior to all this, I’ve done a 4 months internship in Canada and have around 1 YOE from India working as a software engineer. 

At the start of this year, when I finished my graduation, The company I was working at went belly up and laid off a bunch of people including me.

Since then, I’m constantly applying for jobs. I have given around 4-5 technical interviews and even 2 final rounds but all of them has rejected me saying that they have found someone with more experience. (around 300+ apps in total)

I then get an email containing the interview event and it says “Front-end React”. I immediately bring this up with him and they call me back explaining how I would have been “instantly rejected” if they had submitted me for a Java position. I try to not think about this too much as I have React experience so the interview content isn’t such a big deal…but…

y7fh02,How to start as a recent CS graduate with zero job luck?,"I've been struggling for almost half a year trying to find a CS job. Half the time I get to the final interview and never am able to get the job, and half the time the tech/coding questions are far beyond my understanding. But most of the time my application isn't even responded to (I probably get an interview every 25-50 applications). I am applying to jobs with 0-2 years of experience required, and with 80% or more matching technologies that I have experience with.

For context: I am a university graduate, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I got the highest GPA in my graduating class, and worked an IT job for the four years I was in school part time, and full time during the summer. After I graduated in 2021, I worked for eight months as a fullstack developer for a startup (the job I only got from a contact to the CTO) which effectively taught me very little due to the fact that I was solo for four of the eight months, and the other four I worked with a senior dev who barely spoke the same language. 

I don't know what to do to gain experience or how to get a job, and my EI is running out within the next two months. I've sought help with my resume with my university's alumni program and I was told it was as good as I can get it, with potential minor tweaks on a job-to-job basis (https://imgur.com/a/2OVaGCa). Unfortunately I need the job I get to be within a reasonable distance from lower NB, or remote.

So I guess my question is: what do I do? I believe I am intelligent with a great capacity to learn, however my skillset just doesn't seem to be enough and there doesn't seem to be enough jobs looking for people like me. Many of my peers have had jobs after graduating in 2021 until now, and somehow I seem to be the only one struggling. My motivation and mental fortitude have hit all time lows recently because of this, I feel worthless and inadequate. Are there others with similar issues?

11xoixf,Is there any official recent data on the employment rate for new grads?,"You hear all of these stories on this sub about new grads who are struggling to find any kind of work, but without any official statistics on the employment rate, it is difficult to tell if there are actually that many people struggling, or if you only see the bad stuff due to unemployed people coming on here to ask for help while the ones who are employed have no reason to post. 

I have tried searching it up, but the only data I can find is on the government of Canada’s website, and it says that 90% of recent grads are employed, but that data is from 2016, so things could have changed.

Instead of posts on the thread, I've compiled them into a google forms with results.  The survey is completely anonymous, no identifying data is given. 

**If you have already submitted your salary in previous threads, your data was already input** so no need to submit it again. 

Note that **there is now an option for remote US positions**. I have noticed there were positions placed under the location that are actually remote US. US positions pay more just due to our conversion rate alone, which skew location data.

In before, you guys say both, I don't think it can be both. I mean, if it is the economy then all private sector jobs are facing a similar crunch. If it's just CS, then CS is currently a worse off major than other private sector careers.

I guess the question is - are CS majors worse off than commerce majors at the moment?

Kinda sad if true, been hearing that commerce majors are over saturated for over a decade. Plus the requirements and work ethic you need to get a CS degree vs. commerce is unparalleled. Would love to hear from y'all.

Because, no offense, but if people who barely studied in highschool/uni can get jobs, and smart ass people that I know in CS can't - the economy is really incentivizing the wrong people to succeed at the moment.",2024-03-27 03:19:49

Throughout the day I would casually take some breaks in between work, to relax or run some errands as I'm working remote. It's never strictly a 9-5 more like 9-9 by the time I'm finished my tasks. I feel like there's no time to do anything during the weekdays except stay indoors. I used to go to the gym whilst in uni, but now I feel like I don't have time for that or I'm too tired to go after work.

I'm not particularly a slow worker but I just can't go full throttle for hours at a time and I feel like my boss adds up the story points till it reaches about 40hrs. I don't know if it's normal in this industry where you're expected to have 100% output with no time lost due to downtime. I don't want my tickets to carry over to the weekends or the next, hence why I sometimes spend outside hours trying to finish the tasks up.

14ts5zw,Should I switch out of CS due to job market? Worried about my future,"Hey all,

I’m currently a rising junior studying CS at a mid-tier university in Ontario. 
Currently I have no internships but have been applying to some but with no luck. 

After seeing how hard it is to land a new grad role for people with far more experience than I do I was wondering whether it’s even worth it to continue staying in this field. I mean, competition is insane these days and I fear that once I graduate it’d be nearly impossible for me to get an entry level job after applying to 1000’s + applications (which seems to be the norm with people without experience according to this sub)

I was thinking of switching to a more in demand field like nursing or branches of engineering like electrical or civil which have way less competition at least compare to CS

Am I delusional in thinking this way? I simply want a stable career for my future with decent job security and seeing people struggling to land roles in CS makes me question my career choice",2023-07-08 03:17:40
12hmyyb,Should I drop out of Computer Science?," 

I used to be the smartest kid in class in high school, had a 95 average, highest marks in my country for math in year 10. But I come to uni, and my first semester, fail a subject, drop another, and the other 3 are C's. I thought it was just a difference in place, workflow and all that. And my parents gave me another chance to perform in the second semester and prove myself(since they finance my education)(I am an international student). Second semester came, I fixed alot of my habits and was performing well, until my relationship had some serious serious problems that very deeply affected me mentally, and it affected my work for a whole month, possibly the most important month of the semester when all the midterms happened. Ended up missing alot of projects and exams because of the issue.

So, now Im probably going to fail 2 subjects, hopefully barely pass another, and the other subject im remotely confident i can get a B or so.

Yes things happened, but its not an excuse for incompetence.

should I drop out of college altogether? I dont have any drive or passion for this program as of right now. Im working to not disappoint my parents, not for myself. not because i want to learn. I dont want to understand anymore i just want the grade. and thats not how things should be. I take these things as signs that this field may not be for me.

Looking for some advice on the matter from people that may have gone through similar situations.

So I am trying to switch to SWE because I know the pay is better and I like computers. Since october I am doing online course. I did CS50X, CS50P, I did the odin project (only the foundations) and now I am doing Full Stack Open. I enjoy doing this.The last few months I was very motivated but the last few weeks I am starting to lose motivation because whenever I go to reddit, tiktok or even some people I meet, I see that the job market in SWE is very bad and that it is impossible to get a entry level job for new graduates. Since I don't have a CS degree, I am starting to believe that I am doing this for nothing and that I might never get a job!

im a 3rd year honours student. i give up finding a co-op for the summer, things look too stacked right now. i got 60 applications in and one interview that i bombed and never stood a chance with. i know- its not a lot. but it takes me hours to tailor all my resumes/cover letters as i got mental health issues, and i spend too much time doing it when i have schoolwork to do. i dont have the time to send out 200+ applications overall and i have no idea how anyone can manage to do so. i feel ill and discouraged at the thought of even applying to another job because i know im not going to hear anything back or get a bunch of rejection emails. what makes this worse is that i can't go back to school until next year, and i need a placement to graduate.

i know the market is shit right now, but i have classmates who were able to land co-ops, jobs are filling on the job board faster every day. im tired of my co-op advisors borderline lying to me about the job market, lying about how much effort it was supposed to take to land something. i am feeling scammed because for my whole life my family and friends told me to go into computer science, how data analysts are ""in high demand"" and how i will ""get a job easy"", and just when im able to get my foot in the door the job market and economy goes to shit with oversaturation. i feel like i spent all this time on projects and assignments, and all this money on school for nothing! i know i probably shouldnt have gotten my hopes up, but when people tell you these things for years as a kid can you blame me for believing it? i feel like i missed the boat.

for now i just want to work my part time job over the summer and try again for fall co-op, but i am honestly not expecting much to change. im feeling very depressed and discouraged, i feel like everyone's being completely toxically positive about the situation im in and its not helping. either they dont know how bad the market is, or they are just lying to me about it. 

im sorry if i sound like a spoiled little shit, this isnt a pity post, i just have to get this out there and vent, because this is taking a toll on my mental health and getting in the way of academic performance at this point, and i feel like no one IRL wants to listen to me. please tell me im not alone here...",2024-03-23 03:31:21

As this sub has grown, we have seen more and more resume review threads. Before, as a much smaller sub this wasn't a big deal, but as we are growing it's time we triage them into a megathread. 

Since this is a new rule, any existing resume review threads may remain, but going forward, **all resume review threads will be deleted.**

In addition, scheduled posts will also contain helpful resources for resume's, including formatting, templates, and general guidelines that will hopefully provide some answers to some questions.

viaele,Worth it to go back to University at 27 for CS?,"Hey, I am thinking of a career change and CS seems to be the best fit for me if I was to go back to University. About me: I am Operator with a 2-year diploma from a polytechnic and have worked in the oil and gas industry for 5 years. Tbh, I have a pretty cushy job and still, I wonder if it is worth it to make a career switch. Some pros and cons of my job:

Pros- 

1. Can easily make upwards of 120k and even north of 250k depending on overtime worked.
2. Lot of ""ass-time"" on the shift.
3. Extended number of days off with a compressed work schedule, plus most companies offer vacation, benefits, pension etc.

Cons-

1. 12hr shifts and shift work (rotating between days and nights) can take a toll on the body as the years go by. Also proven to reduce life expectancy on an average.
2. Working around dangerous/toxic chemicals, fixing things in -45c weather for long periods of time, stuff can explode at a moment's notice(although rare).
3. The only industry in which you can make a decent living is the oil industry, which as you know, is volatile at best. Cyclical nature of job security. Also companies get 3000+ applications of a job and its very old-school ""who you know"" which can make it frustrating in a job search and not a lot of jobs out there.
4. Work can feel very tedious and repetitive, not a great deal of satisfaction as it is not very mentally enticing (to me at least). I feel that Im holding myself back for a nice paycheque.

In grade 7 they made us do QBasic and I loved it, Im also taking CS50 and loving it so far. I love the technical troubleshooting and the ""digging deep"" part of my job very much but it comes by rarely. I would be ok with making 2/3's of the pay if it was something that gave me a good deal of work satisfaction and a good work life balance. What are the job prospects, TC, future outlook and the experience for CS professionals in Canada? So I wonder, if it is worth it to do the crazy thing and go back to Uni.",2022-06-22 17:21:31

s48z6t,Offering referrals to a top paying company in Canada.,"I have roughly 4.5 years of experience and recently started with this company as a mid level/L4 SWE. It's a fully remote job (you can work anywhere in the US/Canada).

My total compensation is now around 320K CAD (220K CAD base, the rest in private equity). Not sure about bonuses, I didn't get a signing bonus or know what year end bonuses look like.

And before I'm asked, it's not FAANG. It's a unicorn. FAANG doesn't actually pay the best in Canada on average, they lowball Canadians hard. FAANG offers for mid level tend to be only 200-250K CAD total compensation (sometimes a bit higher on rare occasions).

Anyway my company is growing fast and I'm looking to refer strong engineers. Unfortunately, the company isn't currently hiring more L3/Juniors (just a temporary freeze) but is hiring mid level + engineers rapidly.

ou02lv,Is Indeed and Linkedin fine for job searching or should I be looking elsewhere? Where did you find your jobs?,"Indeed seems like it has a million job postings but it almost seems too good to be true to the point that I'm weary of their legitimacy. It's basically always small companies and when I visit their website it's actually difficult to even discern what their company does. Their ""about"" section just contains a few wordy paragraphs with the words ""offering solutions"" scattered throughout and cheesy stock photos of racially diverse smiling business people on every page. After reading the whole thing I still honestly still have no clue what they do.

I would personally prefer to work somewhere that doesn't sell software as a consumer product. For example I have a friend who works for chain gym as a programmer at their head office, he helps maintain their app and develops new features for it and such but it's not really a ""product"", that sounds great to me. That or working on a companies internal systems.

My issue is that those jobs don't really seem to post on places like Indeed, and when I go to their websites directly their are like 5 pages of job postings for Senior devs and literally none for Jr or entry level.

xrubap,"My Experience, Advice, and Data From Applying to 481 Junior/Entry-Level Jobs","## My Experience

My background:

- Graduated with a BSc Software Engineering from the University of Calgary back in 2020 with a 1 year internship
- Almost done my MSc Neuroscience from Western University in August 2022
- 0 years of experience (YOE) excluding internship, 3 YOE if you count my masters (I was programming almost every day but not up to industry standards)

As you may have guessed, my specialization is in AI/ML but I have frontend web dev experience (React) too. I used two resumes when applying to jobs, the [first one](https://i.imgur.com/xlE7aBH.jpg) for a few months before switching to [this one](https://i.imgur.com/qaXYk0W.jpg). Since I would graduate my master's degree in August 2022, I started applying in January 2022 (8 months early) but ramped up the number of applications in April 2022 (4 months early). Since January, I've applied to 481 positions and have tracked every application using an Excel spreadsheet [here](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Arj2dG0rohj6ekZ34vSVE3LPRMg?e=HQttNB). Here's the breakdown of the applications: [Sankey diagram](https://i.imgur.com/JalZPFv.png).

My strategy was to apply to the prestigious and dream companies first because if I got an offer from them, I would take it and stop applying. I didn't get any offer from them so I relaxed my requirements. I suspect that my early applications (Jan-Apr) were too early for most companies as they didn't want to wait 4 months before hiring someone. It's also different for master students because graduate students may delay their start date due to delays with their thesis (one startup told me this). I should have been hired after 173 applications as I completed all stages for one company but they never got back to me with an offer. I was in the final call with the recruiter discussing their equity structure but no verbal or written offer was received. My mistake was not reaching out afterwards but I suspect they found someone else that could start right away and hired them instead.

I was so close to ending my job hunt then and there, but it would take another 300 applications to actually get to the end. There were many crappy interviews and companies that I went through but I eventually got two simultaneous offers: one for 64k base and one for 75k base. I asked the 75k offer for 85k (email below), and they came back with 80k base (93k TC). I accepted it. The position is software developer in C++ and Python and I was hired at Intermediate Level 1. I've been working there for a week now and can finally relax.

Applying to hundreds of jobs is mentally taxing and the stress builds up the closer you are to graduation and as the rejections pile up. I've felt disappointed over my interview performance, disheartened that nobody wants you, angry that you have to re-enter your resume information again and again, and now relieved that I'll never have to go through this again. Along the way, I've learned how to optimize the application process and to stay sane. There are many myths and misinformation about applying to junior/entry-level software developer positions that I didn't realize until I started applying or learning from experienced devs.

## Stages

The application process for software developer positions can be broken down into five general stages:

1. Submit resume
2. Online assessment
3. Phone screen
4. Onsite
5. Offer

The first step in the process is finding a position on a job board or company website and applying to it. Expect to make an account for almost every company you apply to and to annoyingly enter the same information as on your resume. Some automatic resume parsing systems work well (Lever!) while others don't (Workday); fix any errors and submit. From here, you'll most likely never hear back from the company but if you do, some companies (e.g. banks, Cisco, Amazon) send you an online assessment or jump to the phone screen. From my experience, most online assessments are a waste of time and even if you complete it, there's no guarantee that the company will respond. But at this stage you can't afford to be picky so complete them.

The next stage is the phone screen which is usually a 30 minute online video call with the recruiter. They will ask general interview questions like ""Tell me about yourself"", ""What do you know about the company?"", ""Why should we hire you?"", ""What are your salary expectations?"", and ""When can you start?"". These questions are used to quickly filter out any candidates that are out of their budget, don't fit the job, can't start when needed, or have poor social skills. This isn't hard and as long as you don't have any red flags, you proceed to the onsite.

The onsite is when you're tested on your programming, system design, and cultural fit. You might have multiple 4-hour onsites or just one 1-hour onsite. In general, the longer the onsite the greater the compensation. If a company interviews like Google, you should expect Google-levels of compensation for your time. Interviews are used to de-risk candidates by testing technical competence, checking cultural fit, and setting a baseline for comparison with other candidates.

Assuming you pass the onsite, you receive a verbal or written offer. The offer has your start date, compensation components (base salary, equity, bonus, sign-on bonus), title, etc. I believe to always negotiate the offer (evidence [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDj5Qg4sL6E) and [here](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/)) but you do you. The risk of rescinding the offer is very low but still [there](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/wqbfn9/offer_rescinded_while_negotiating/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). If you do decide to negotiate, here are the tips I followed ([link](https://youtu.be/cbngWLr7BC4), [link](https://youtu.be/s75AeaTt0UM), [link](https://youtu.be/u9BoG1n1948), [link](https://youtu.be/fyn0CKPuPlA), and [link](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/)).

## FAQ

- Q: What's the best way of applying to a job?
	- A: Referrals are the best way because someone has vouched for you. Hiring is a risky business and not all signals (resume, interview, experience) are weighed equally. Referrals are highly valued (e.g. referral bonus) because most candidates aren't a good fit and having someone that already fits signals another person that may fit. ""Birds of a feather flock together"" as they say.
- Q: What's the best website/job board to apply?
	- A: A recruiter actually tested this ([link](https://youtu.be/4pKGmMSg40s)) and found LinkedIn and Google Jobs to be the best. However, if you're struggling to get responses then apply everywhere you can (e.g. Indeed, Glassdoor, Monster) since you can't be picky. It's also preferred to apply on the company website over job boards.
- Q: What should my resume look like?
	- A: Use a standard template because the recruiter will know where to automatically look for info. You want to make this as easy and lazy for the recruiter to say yes or no. But don't focus too heavily on having a resume that passes the automated parser because no matter how well-formatted your resume is, it'll fail on some system. So just have a clean resume that passes human eyes.
- Q: Should my resume have my address?
	- A: The advice used to be ""no"" but with the rise of remote work, recruiters find it helpful to know your residing city. Different timezones and regulations matter for remote positions so include your city if applying to remote positions.
- Q: Is there a difference between computer science and software engineering?
	- A: For the majority of companies, no. Some companies don't even have ""software engineering"" in their education-major section.
- Q: What's the junior starting salary?
	- A: It ranges from 50k (non-tech local) to 150k (FANG). It depends on the city, company, amount of internship experience, education, etc. Among my ten software developer friends, most of our starting salaries were between 60-80k.
- Q: When should I start applying?
	- A: It depends on the company. I've heard of offers one year before the start date, but my experience has been that applying four months before graduating to be optimal. Think about it from the company's perspective, when you put up a job posting you have a need right now to fulfill, not a need 8 or 12 months out. If it's between an ok candidate now or a potentially great candidate one year later, most companies pick the ok candidate because they're good enough and can add value now. Large companies can afford to send out offers earlier as they're always hiring, but most companies have hiring seasons. Applying early also means greater competition as the company can keep the job posting up for longer, decreasing your chances of getting an offer.
- Q: Why is the junior market for software so bad when everyone says that software is in demand?
	- A: That the software market is hot is half true. It's true for experienced devs where they can apply to 10 positions and get 5 offers, but it isn't true for junior devs. The junior level has been saturated for years due to bootcamps and increased awareness of the compensation in software. Read more about it [here](https://www.notonlycode.org/nobody-hires-juniors/) and [here](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/advice-for-junior-software-engineers/).
- Q: How much should I LeetCode?
	- A: Enough to solve mediums for most companies. Most non-FANG companies ask simple technical questions or provide take-home assignments. My hardest interview required recursion while my easiest was string splitting.
- Q: Which software dev position is easiest to get into?
	- A: Testing and analyst roles are easiest while any specialized role is difficult. For me, my machine learning applications had the worst response rate while my general SWE and testing applications got the most responses.
- Q: Can I apply to remote USA jobs?
	- A: Yes but it comes with a caveat. The number of job positions opens up massively (there are only so many remote and local jobs in Canada), but that also opens up more competition. As a Canadian, you can work remotely in the US without requiring a visa or sponsorship (since you won't set foot in the US) but the response rate for my US applications was abysmal. But this is an option if you run out of Canadian companies to apply to. Europe and Asia also exist but I didn't try for them.
- Q: What titles did you search for?
	- A: I used this LinkedIn search query ""(software developer OR software engineer OR machine learning OR data scientist) NOT (senior OR staff OR principal OR technical recruiter OR lead OR manager OR sr)"". Yes, LinkedIn search does allow for logical operators unlike Indeed or Google Jobs.
- Q: Local vs remote jobs?
	- A: Local is much easier because you're competing with fewer candidates and can come in-person. Training a junior remotely is challenging.
- Q: Are cover letters important?
	- A: I wrote 11 cover letters out of the 481 applications and none of them got me a phone screen let alone an interview. So I find them worthless at the junior level and always tried to never submit one.

## Negotiation Email

For the curious or to use as a template, here's the email I sent to negotiate my offer:

> Hi [recruiter],
> 
> Thank you for the offer. The offer you extended was strong and right now my decision is between you and a competing offer from [other company]. It's a difficult decision for me, but if the base salary was increased to CAD $85,000.00/Yr, it would make your offer much more attractive. I'm a great fit for the position given my experience with Python and previous internship experience. I also know that [hiring manager] was looking for someone with data analysis experience, and I believe I bring a lot of relevant experience given that my master's degree dealt with analyzing complex data. So, although I've received another competitive offer, I do love the work environment and mission of [company] and think that it would be a better overall fit for me.
> 
> Let me know your thoughts.
> 
> Thanks,
> Brainiac777

And the recruiter's response:

> Hi Brainiac777,
> 
> Hope you’re having a great day thus far! I just got off the phone with [hiring manager] and we are willing to increase your offer from $75,000.00/year to $80,000.00/year (this is subject to management approval but I see no issue with this getting cleared). This increase will also take your performance bonus from $3,375 to $3,600 and your profit sharing from $6,750 to $7,200 (assuming we hit max EBIT but we have been recently in the past couple years). You will still be entitled to 15 days’ vacation, an $800 health/personal spending account, and 2% RRSP matching (which goes from $1500 to $1600 with this increase). Benefits will likely be the same as they are variable year over year.
> 
> We came to this number for your salary based on three factors: experience, internal equity, and market value. While it is not $85,000.00, we have annual salary reviews every October so you will not be locked in at $80,000.00 forever (many people in our company see an increase within a year or two of employment).
> 
> Finally, [hiring manager] expressed to me in our call that they would both really would like to have you on the team. They believe you possess a very valuable skill set and think this position would give you the chance to continue to develop it. Although I’ve only worked here for just under 4 months, the growth I’ve felt I personally is exponential. I am confident that working under [hiring manager] would sincerely help you with your career progression and professional development. Although not monetary based; it is truly such a great company to work for😊.
> 
> Please let me know what you think about this and if you have any questions I can answer.
> 
> Kind regards,
> [recruiter]

The main points of negotiation are to: be respectful, have leverage (walking away, competing offer, returning to school, staying at current company), negotiate other levers (vacation days, bonus, equity, benefits), and understand there's a (small) risk of a rescinded offer. There's much more to negotiation but don't worry about it at the junior level.

## Data and Statistics

Each application and its status can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Arj2dG0rohj6ekZ34vSVE3LPRMg?e=HQttNB) (fun comments for some of them). Here are my stats (take it with caution since it's only one data point):

- 481 applications
- 10 (2.1%) online assessments
- 16 (3.3%) phone screens
- 7 (1.5%) onsites
- 2 (0.4%) offers

**TLDR: Applied to 481 jobs in 8 months and accepted an 80k offer. Getting a junior/entry-level software dev job is very hard and requires hundreds of applications. Be willing to sacrifice time, effort, location, remote work, and pay if it doesn't go your way. Good luck!**",2022-09-30 06:35:12
x6sqfp,Does anyone works in tech have a second job?,I am currently starting a job in Montreal for a developer job at 50k.

w69cd3,Is this type of WLB common?,"I’m currently interning as a SWE at a semi large company. There’s a very good chance I get a full time offer once I graduate. The pay for a new grad is about 70k but they have really good WLB. 

They have unlimited PTO. Vacations are approved like 95% of the time, so it isn’t just there to cheat us out of paying out our vacation days. It’s 100% WFH with the option of going into the office whenever we want. They’re also very flexible with having to take off a couple hours throughout the day. People regularly take off an hour or two to pick up a friend at an airport, leave early for an event, or even just to go for a run. Also, I haven’t seen anyone have to work OT a single time.

We have a Google, Facebook and Microsoft office but they are all specialized in AI. Correct me if I'm wrong but they're only/mostly hiring machine learning phd people.  I am trying to find those big paying jobs at minimum 100k+ salary but they seem very rare. I keep reading on reddit that the market is hot but recruiters are only contacting me for junior positions or jobs at 50-80k range.  I've straight up been told from a recruiter when asking for 100k+ that those salary were more for people with at least 15 YOE?? From /r/cscareerquestions , it seems a good method to find a good job is to simply grind leetcode and apply to FAANG or FAANG like companies but I don't any of them in Montreal. Situation seems very different compared to Toronto and Vancouver where they actually have FAANG companies hiring new graduates with insane compensations.

Are they any companies in Montreal with high salary hiring people mostly based on interviews instead of experience? I am very motivated to grind leetcode and study but again, I have not witnessed any companies so far in my interviews who are offering positions without significant relevant YOE.

I understand I will probably not be exceeding the 90k mark as an entry-level in Canada, from my research getting promoted is not as often in Canada.  


I have watched many tech influencers in the US promote the fact that job hoping can really elevate your salary and can be used as a leverage point into increasing salaries as fast as possible, however, I genuinely don't think it can be done in Canada, firstly due to the fact that not that many roles actually open up in Canada, and secondly companies don't compete for higher salaries as much in Canada, the most I have seen entry levels make is like $110k, correct me if I am wrong, if there is someone that can shed any light to this topic? it would be greatly appreciated!",2023-11-10 03:49:56

14d2f6g,Job offer rescinded for interviewing with another position at the same company,"I'm a new grad in the process of job hunting and recently had an offer rescinded, and I want some outside opinions on it because I'm getting mixed opinions on whether what I or the manager did was justifiable or not.  

To start, I originally received a LinkedIn DM from manager A for a QA position on their team. I had gotten through both interviews and was in the reference check stage when I received a DM from another manager (manager B) at the same company, also reaching out for an interview. The positions were the exact same, except they were on different teams and involved with different products.  

I was already fairly confident that I would get the offer from A, but I thought there was no harm in doing the interview anyway, so I accepted. During the interview, I briefly mention to manager B that I had talked with manager A about their team, and B doesn't ask me any further questions about my involvement with A. When B asked if I'm considering any offers at the moment, I say no because I hadn't yet received an offer from A. That's all I really divulged about my status with position A. This was partially because I didn't think it would be important to mention as the teams seemed segregated, and also I was taking the advice that people usually give which is to be vague in interviews about competing interviews/positions.  

The same day after that interview, I receive an informal offer from manager A. After a few days of us working out the details, manager A asks to call me. On the call, they tell me that they will be rescinding the offer because they discovered that I had interviewed with manager B, and that I didn't properly communicate to B about how far in the process I was with them. They also mentioned it was a company policy that a candidate could not be involved with multiple positions. I apologized, saying that I honestly had no idea it would be a problem and that I was not asked about it so I assumed it was fine, to which they responded that it was ""common sense"". They explained to me that they have access to all applications and they can see, for example, if someone says in interview that they are only interested in one position but also applies to multiple positions at the same company. I was quite shocked and upset after the call, as it seemed to me that I was being accused of being dishonest at worst and stupid at best.  

At this point I'm not really looking for advice for getting the offer back as A was quite firm, but as I am new to all of this I'm wondering how normal this is and what/whether I should have done something differently. I'm also wondering if this should be considered a red flag, as some people have mentioned to me that companies should have a centralized HR system to avoid miscommunications like this in the first place.

125qv6a,Is mass applying as effective in the Canadian job market as the U.S?,"I see a lot of posts about people in the U.S. applying to hundreds or even thousands of jobs. To me this seems crazy as a Canadian. Some days there are not even jobs to apply to. I suppose that in the U.S. it makes a bit more sense since it's 10x the size of Canada so there would probably be 10x the jobs to apply to.

However, it still seems weird to apply to jobs asking for 8-10 years experience as a new graduate.

I was a 41-year-old on the edge with no will to return to the demeaning grind of my previous industries regardless of how much they paid me.  When I discovered talks of people becoming self-taught web devs, I thought I'd found a lifeline out of my depression since I'd always loved coding, did a few years of Seneca College about 20 years ago in LAMP stack and had been coding as a hobby in every job I'd had (and some C# in Unity as a hobbiest game dev).  I started with freecodecamp to get back to basics, then graduated to Full Stack Open and did over half of that course.

Fast forward to today, due to time concerns and running low on finances, I stopped progressing on my FSO course and started working on a full stack project that I'm almost done.  But I'm freaking out now because I just realized all the opinions I got were from cscareerquestions and not the CAD version!  Now I'm afraid that even when I'm done this project, and even if I can do leetcode mediums (in like an hour or so...), I might not be able to actually find a job in Canada.

150aui1,Suggestion for new grads finding it hard to crack the entry level ceiling.,"This is a page from my life. TLDR, so take it for what it's worth. I graduated during the great recession. Tech companies were shrinking their work force twice the rate that the banks were. There was absolutely no jobs for new grads and the punters at that time were saying this will last for at least 5 years. So I got into customer service and tech support. I was taking calls and explaining to customers on how to install a router, yes small office home office (soho) was a thing in 2007/08. Plus, I was also helping HR with admin work on converting paper documents into digital. Data entry. A job that also requires to take calls from company employees asking about HR questions. It was a 10hr job paying just above minimum wage at the time. I was thinking I'll be doing this for 3 years. 

But guess what, 10 months later, I got a call from the tech company that I interviewed with while in university. Resigned here and joined that. The lessons learned in the 10 months in customer service gave me a 5 year worth crash course of office elements like politics, task priority, stress the older folk go through, internal rivalry, organizational lethargy etc. Things that I learned there, I still have value today. 

So here's what I'll suggest myself in your shoes. Don't listen to the doomsday sayers. This one is not different. With an increasing but also ageing population, technology is a key factor of society to solve problems. So jobs will come. But for the time being, I would get into any job that in a Office Setting. Trust me on this, there will be things you learn that is absolutely valuable. If you know tech, then you would be the person people will reach out to solve system issues. Build that relationship. 

And if you are really lucky, like some of my tech friends, ended up with people who they had met in customer service jobs. There is a dynamic there.. the techie engineer who likes things vs the high empathy customer service associate. So you never know.

The entire call lasted for around 6 minutes in which they asked me questions like what are your skills, software development lifecycle and some more. 6 hours later they send me an email with offer letter. 

I have convinced myself that this is a scam, No way in hell can they just give employment to a new grad developer just like that, without testing any technical skills at all. No leetcode type questions, no what about this tech or this stack. No nothing.

11shr9t,"Trying to get foot in the door junior software engineer jobs in Toronto, Ontario Canada any advice?","Hi everyone,

I graduated from my bachelor's degree program (life science major computer science minor) a year and a half ago, and I've been actively searching for junior software engineering roles and internships since then, but I've had no luck so far. I've applied to a lot of positions, but most of them either require more experience than I have, or I don't hear back at all.

I have done some open source contributions, some research work for 6 months where I developed an experiment in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and have also developed several personal projects. Some languages/frameworks I have worked with include HTML/CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, React, PHP, Java, Kotlin, and Python. I feel like I have a good foundation in programming and I'm eager to learn and grow as a developer.

I was wondering if anyone here has any advice for me in terms of finding junior software engineering roles or internships? Or, if there are any other steps I can take to improve my chances of getting hired? I'm open to any suggestions or feedback. I have applied to around 400 software engineering/front-end developer/back-end developer roles so far.

The majority of people I have spoken to (who work at companies like Google, Intel, Mozilla, and some startups in Toronto) have told me my resume looks fine for a junior swe but it has still been tough hearing back from companies. I'm not sure what else I could work on and I find it's becoming harder to not question that perhaps I need to move in a different direction. It's also been a rough ride mentally.

I have interviewed previously with companies like the Bank of America, and a few smaller startups. I did hear back from Amazon recruiters on 2 separate occasions only to get ghosted after responding to their requests for a quick chat.

I am searching for roles in Toronto, Ontario Canada btw. Not sure what to do or where to go from here. I feel like things are not going anywhere and not sure where else to turn for help.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you so much in advance. You are all awesome and I am happy that a community like this exists where people can have a discussion on these topics.",2023-03-16 02:38:53

Unlike when I first stepped into the job market, I've been getting a lot more responses and many more recruiters initiating a conversation now that I've had a bit of experience.

However, I'd been comfortable at my old job and never spent any time studying interviewing questions and doing leetcode (big lesson learnt, ALWAYS be on leetcode!)

There are only so many ways you can render components in a React app, or create APIs that perform CRUD on DynamoDB or PostgreSQL... DS and algorithms just never became relevant in my job. My old job had a system design interview, my interviewers later told me I did really well on it, but again, no DS and algorithms.

I don't want to squander some of the opportunities from referrals, should I just spend a couple weeks and focus on leetcode before I apply anywhere else?

16jg3j8,Got rejected after a system design interview,"Hi all,  


First a bit about myself; I have 10+ years of mobile development experience. The role I applied too, and was rejected from was a Senior mobile developer role who was to kickstart their mobile product development from the ground up.   


There were 3 rounds, the final round was the system design interview. Here are some highlights:  


1. They didn't expect that I would ask about whether the app I am designing supports offline mode prior to me doing the actual design. 
2. They were surprised that I asked about **which different markets** the app would support. 
3. They did not expect that front end mobile device would or should also have an **API Health check mechanism**. I explained that if your BE (micro services/server etc) are down we don't want the app to crash or act in erratic manner. It seemed they did not agree with this. 
4. They did not understand why I have added a **caching mechanism** in the app and why it's even needed. While I did explain why I believe it should be in the app ( **prevent data loss during unstable network etc**) I dont think they agreed with what I explained here as well. 
5. They asked if I have done UI testing, I said I know how to do it but no one has ever asked me to write UI tests, only unit tests. Again a very surprised reaction 😲   


The feedback at the end was:  


*We noted some* ***inflexibility*** *when communicating and designing and* ***lack of testing experience****. We would have liked to* ***see more engagemen****t about choosing the right design, and evaluating trade-offs between options.*  


So my questions are:  


1. If the interviewers are unaware and dont really understand why a specific function/feature is needed **do I need to cut it out completely**? And redesign the app without it? I dont think anything I said was over-engineering and it should be very common regardless of whether you making a POC or a large scale enterprise app. 
2. **What does 'inflexibility' when communicating and designing mean here**? Does it mean I didn't explain my design decisions properly? or I didn't take their feedback on what I should be designing?
3. If asked about UI testing, should I just straight up lie and say yes I have done UI testing and pretend.   


Any feedback will be appreciated. I have been searching for a job for the last 6 months and have no officially given up. Going to start door dash/ uberEats etc as soon as I get accepted - but just for future reference would be grateful if I can get some tips on what went wrong.

14ktcrp,New CS Grad Struggling to start career in awful job market,"Hello Everyone,  
  
I am (28M) recent graduate with an Advanced Diploma in Software Development and Network Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I had the opportunity to gain real-world experience through three co-op terms, each lasting four months. These positions varied from a Software Developer role at a major bank to a Site Reliability Engineer and a Full Stack Engineer at a startup.  
  
Eight years ago, I initially embarked on a path towards an Electrical Engineering degree, but soon realized it wasn't the right fit for me. The journey back to academia wasn't always smooth, but I am proud to say that I not only returned but also successfully completed my post-secondary education this time around. The hands-on co-op experiences I gained along the way have been invaluable.  
  
Despite these accomplishments, the job market has proven quite challenging. I have been actively applying for entry-level positions, tailoring my resume, and cover letters for each opportunity. I have utilized LinkedIn to reach out to recruiters and applied to multiple postings on job boards. In addition, I sought assistance from my network, leading to several interviews. However, feedback has frequently highlighted a desire for more experienced candidates.  
  
To be honest, I am really frustrated. I feel like I made a huge mistake on not pursuing my electrical engineering degree and till this day I feel upset about it. I know I may not be as intelligent as these CS graduates from Waterloo or whatever, but I know I am knowledgeable and I can provide worth. I have made a few small personal projects and I have attended a hackathon. I am interested in this field and I really want to pursue this long term.  
  
In order to enhance my skill set and marketability, I have been taking additional Java courses on Udemy as a refresher, as my primary focus to date has been on Front End development. I am keen to delve deeper into Back End Development now. I have also considered volunteering my skills for a non-profit organization to further broaden my industry exposure and experience.  
  
I am reaching out to this community to seek your advice. What actions should I take as of now? Where should I focus my efforts? Does my level of education gatekeep me from current opportunities?  
  
Thank you all in advance for your help.

A 28-year-old recent graduate with an Advanced Diploma in Software Development and Network Engineering is seeking advice and job opportunities.

A bit of background:  I did a degree at UofT in Mathematics and Statistics and graduated in 2020. Since then (and a little before)  I've had a decent career in software sales.  Over the years, I found myself missing the abstraction and rigour of that of my degree and started to feel a bit out of place.  This really prompted me to reevaluate my situation and I took a CS class as a non-degree student and absolutely fell in love with it.

I saved up and decided that the best route for me would be to self-teach since I have the STEM degree already and couldn't stomach a 15k price tag on a non-guaranteed bootcamp situation. I've been self-teaching for the last 9-10ish months and have made quite a few front end projects.  

At this point, I've probably sent out 50-60 applications for various front end development opportunities and have heard crickets.  I know the market isn't exactly thriving right now and competition is likely quite cut throat.  

I've also recently began a front end engineering volunteering position to hopefully gain some experience in the field.

Could anyone provide some advice on what I can or should do to strengthen my application?  I would really appreciate some guidance here!

sjlrb2,Quebec versus rest of Canada versus US,"Greetings, I am in Montreal TC 85k CAD with 7 YOE (4 at my current company).

After reading a bunch of posts from here and the other sub, it is evident that I am not just massively underpaid but plain abused in terms of salary, or did I just let it all get to my head?

I see new grads getting 80k CAD, I see people with 2-4 YOE get 200k over some remote job.  I tried interviewing a few months ago with a few companies and their offers were even lower than 85k in Quebec. Should I just forget this forgotten land all together and try to find a remote job?

1bom2kf,"Lost, overwhelmed, and don't know what to do. Looking for sincere advice. ","To preface: I will be graduating from Sheridan with an Advanced Diploma in Software Development and Network Engineering, I have 3 coop terms under my belt, 2 IT positions (help desk and it admin) and one Junior Application Intern. I have a 3.1 GPA, nothing too horrible but nothing good, and I don't know what to do anymore because everyone is telling me that my diploma is useless, as I will compete against degree holders; and I won't get a job when I graduate after the summer semester. 

I know I want to work in tech as a software engineer, I know I want to work in big tech, and I know now that my diploma means nothing. 

I have looked at my options at completing a degree, mainly McMaster's degree completion program and Western Governors University's Software Engineering program, I have heavily looked into this but I can't find a set in stone answer if that's what I should do or start applying for and looking for jobs with my diploma.

If I do go the degree completion route, what degree do I go for? WGU will help me finish the degree in less than a year's time, McMaster will take me two years. 

I am just so lost, I want to start grinding leet code and prepare for interviews and spam apply but I don't even know if I will get past the screening. 

Some people suggested I lie about my coop position titles and just put in ""Information Technology Coop"" and lie about the responsibilities but that just sounds scummy and wrong, and I could never do that. 

Any and all advice is appreciated.

17fw2n2,Does having a master's degree make it more challenging to find a job?,"Hello Reddit,  
I have read a few other Reddit posts about this, but I still have conflicting opinions

  
Basically, I was advised to enroll in a Master's program in CS, which is a project-based program. I always enjoy doing projects and I want to expand my network so I thought it would be a good choice. Besides, I do think I lack knowledge even though I have a year of experience already.  
  
However, a few of my friends told me that having a Master's degree will make it harder for me to find a job since Canadian law requires companies to pay more for ppl who have the degree. This means companies won't hire people with master's degrees for entry-level or junior positions (Which is where I'm at right now). Some ppl even told me that even if I negotiated to lower my salary, they wouldn't take the risk of getting lawsuits. How true is this in Canada?

193spdp,"Advice about ""diploma mill"" school on resume","EDIT: TL;DR  Which would be the better option in this case? Not having a CS degree on the resume along with not coming from a blacklisted school but at least have non-tech degree from well-known school, or having a CS degree but from a blacklisted school?

Domestic CS student here. Just got the news that my current school is under fire, unfortunately because of a group of international students paired with the rampant cheating among them. And because of that, I'm now having second thoughts about having this school on my resume, but then that means that my CS degree won't be seen.

Here's a bit of my background: 

I graduated from UofT in 2021 with a BSc with a major in Psych, and minors in Socio and Stats. In that same year I decided to do a CS degree at a school that's been increasingly called a diploma mill these past few months, though it wasn't being called one when I entered (sorry, a bit embarrassed to say the school name, but I think it's easy to guess which one). 
Last year, I landed a co-op with a non-tech company, but a recognizable name. I'm currently doing co-op again with the same company for another 8 months, which means I would have 3 terms of co-op experience, though I'm still hoping to do another 2 terms before graduating.

Because of my current school being increasingly called a diploma mill, several things have been running through my head.

The first one being that I consider omitting my current school in my resume and just having my UofT degree on there. The only thing possibly holding me back from doing this is because I originally opted for this degree back in 2021 to avoid being potentially filtered out from tech jobs for not having a CS degree. But now that there's been talk about employers filtering out all grads from ""diploma mill"" schools (even though these schools are accredited) I'm now worried about having this school on my resume. 

Here comes my main question: Which would be the better option in this case? Not having a CS degree on the resume along with not coming from a blacklisted school, or having a CS degree but from a blacklisted school?

Additionally, I was thinking of potentially transferring to another school, but I only have one term left of courses to do and I don't really wish to do even more courses as a result of transferring to another school.

Honestly, this situation has made me pretty anxious about my future prospects. I've never committed academic dishonesty in either of my degrees, but it sucks to feel like collateral damage because of the situation with my school.

Any advice on this is greatly appreciated.",2024-01-11 04:15:40
16dh8lm,My opinion on Developer Volunteer positions,"If you are offered a volunteer position when you are rejected for a full-time salaried position, please do not take it.

I see my friends doing it out of ""well I need any experience I can,"" but god it's so predatory. This is only a good idea if the company is doing non-profit work like charity or open source software, but if the company is making ANY PROFIT AT ALL, please just walk away. There are so many other options you can be spending your time in, and actually be self-fulfilling.

I first started noticing companies doing this when my fresh grad friends were talking about it, and now I see them not too rarely. My friend has been doing ""volunteer work"" at a for-profit company, FOR A YEAR. She puts in maybe 10 hours a week, but sometime does ""volunteer"" during weekends when her part-time job for the next week is making her too busy. It's insane how anyone thinks it's okay.

Yes -- you do get your experience in coding in a team environment, yes -- you do learn on how a company's work flows. But no matter how you coat it, it's free labour. The job market is tough, I get that. But please, you need to value your time more, and working for free for a company making money off of your free labour, is just not a good idea.",2023-09-08 17:51:44
15tsbzh,Am I being petty or is this a bad manager?,"An individual (SWE) was promoted to a managerial position (EM) likely due to their competence within the team with a tenure of under 2 years. Their promotion followed the departure of the previous EM. The new EM inherited a capable team that produced results with little oversight. This allowed the EM to engage in additional projects within the company, garnering favor with executives and leading to further promotions.

However, the rest of the team did not receive similar recognition or promotions, despite over delivering on all projects the team owns. Instead, the EM made empty promises of raises and promotions in exchange for certain tasks, which were never fulfilled. This pattern continued for about two years, with the EM offering excuses for the lack of follow-through.

12e91eh,Struggling as a New Software Engineering Graduate in Toronto and FDM group,"As a recent graduate from a software engineering program in Toronto, I'm feeling unsure about whether or not to accept an offer from FDM group. I'm currently working as IT support for a big company in Toronto, but they don't have any openings for junior software engineers, so moving up in the company isn't an option for me right now. In addition, despite applying to over 200 junior positions, I've only received 6 interview and being not getting accepted, it’s being six months now.

I know that FDM group offers a great opportunity for me to gain experience in the field and develop my skills, most likely I will be working in a big financial company, but I'm concerned about being low balled with their salary offer and potentially limiting my options for future job opportunities. At the same time, I'm feeling frustrated by the lack of job openings for junior software engineers in Toronto and worry that I may be stuck in my current role for an extended period of time if I don’t leave this position and grab FDM opportunity.

At present, my annual salary is $60,000, but if I were to join FDM, I would only earn $45,000 in the first year and $50,000 in the second year. While the decrease in pay is certainly disappointing, I'm taking a calculated risk that by the end of the first year with FDM, I'll have gained enough experience to receive a job offer as a mid-level engineer with a salary of around $75,000 to $80,000(heck or even a junior position at 60k). It's worth noting that the job offer from FDM is for a full-stack position.

I would love to hear from other recent graduates or professionals in the industry who have faced similar struggles and how they navigated these challenges. Should I take the offer from FDM group, or hold out for a better opportunity? Is it worth it to get a 15k salary reduction in exchange for gaining experience and potentially having more job prospects in the future?(I don’t have kids or wife to support and 45k will allow me to maintain my lifestyle but without saving much money, my whole monthly expense is about $2400)

I already have a small portfolio (which is very rough around the edges). But I once reached out to a startup company and the CEO said that he liked one of the projects in my portfolio. (I did not make through to the second round though).

Should I just continue the minimum wage job or if I should stay with my parents for a year and pretty much devote my entire day to coding (practicing leet code, building more portfolio projects, learning more frameworks, etc.)? As well as applying for jobs? With the minimum wage job, I can devote very little time each day to these things.

For my second coop work term (Jan 2019), I only had 4 months of work experience, did like 50 applications, got 7-8 interviews and multiple offers. Now with that coop work term experience, I did almost 500 applications, over 10-12 interviews and no offer so far. I have done a lot of mock interviews, did 130 leetcode problems, had referrals, and had really good interviews but it seems like it is almost impossible to get an internship now. My friends who work at FAANG and with whom I practiced Mock, told me that the best way to approach a problem is to give them a suboptimal solution, then work with your interviewer to give an optimal solution, and even if you can't, if you share your thought process, they will take you in (one of my friends couldn't solve a faang problem but talked out his thought process and got the job at that same company). Seems like it is no longer the case. Interviewers want an optimal solution at the first try, and if I work with them, I just get rejected. I recently had an interview with SAP where they gave me 2 problems, i gave them optimal for the one and suboptimal for the second one and my interviewer told me I did really well, and I was really good at communicating my thought process, yet I got rejected.

My other engineering friends even in this job market didn't have to go through that many interviews, and some coop programs (especially civil, mining and geotechnical) have almost 100% placement rate (meaning almost everyone who was in the coop program secured a work term this summer), and the bar to get into the coop program is not that high to begin with.

&#x200B;

I don't know, I chose software engineering because I really loved making small web and mobile apps, and always wanted to know how video games work, but it is really burning me out right now with all this interview prep and the disappointment I am getting after getting rejected even though I felt I did really well. It's endless cycle of rejections. I really want some advice as to what should I be doing next? Switching to some other engineering field? Go to grad school? Just give up? I am also really concerned as to whether I even have a chance to break into the career if this is the stage of internship interview, then a new grad is almost next to impossible.

1ahrymw,No SWE internships 3rd yr college. How screwed am I?,"

First post on this sub- I just honestly feel really lost and need some hope that there's light at the end of the tunnel. I did well in high school but when I entered college for CS, I just really lost myself in addition to doing bad academically (like HORRIFICLY BAD). Now I'm in the second semester of my third year and things are starting to get better- doing better in school etc but I'm just realizing how far behind I am now. I knew how important internships were coming into school and yet I hardly tried to get any. Now I'm about to enter my fourth year and have no SWE internship experience and even though I started applying this week, feel like there isn't much hope for me to get enough experience before I graduate (and it's incredibly unlikely I get an internship this summer anyways as most companies have closed their posting). Meanwhile all my friends are getting internships at Google, Meta, Amazon, or really cool startups and while I'm really happy for them (I genuinely am, it fills me with so much pride for them seeing how far they've come), I can't help but feel despair at my own circumstances for how far I've fallen. I just don't know what to do with myself. Even if my grades are great this semester and in future semesters, I can't make up for how bad I've done in previous semesters (though my degree will be 5 yrs), I have no job experience, and a shit ton of student debt. And yet part of me still hopes I can break into Big Tech for internships and make my parents proud even though that seems impossible now. I'm just lost. I just wish I could have been better but still have a little bit of hope i can turn my life around. Any advice for how I can do this?

17sdv2o,Unpaid Software engineer internship or Implementation Specialist at a Healthcare Tech Company,"Hello Reddit,  
I am currently working as an unpaid intern for a pre-revenue startup, this has consisted mostly of learning the purescript and rust programming languages and pair programming with a senior developer (whom i like) I just started the internship and so far am enjoying it ! I am happy to be learning and gaining experience especially since I have not been able to find a job since graduating in may of this year with my CS degree. I also enjoy the fast pace of the startup and how much i have learned in such a short time since starting the internship.  
There is a possibility that it could turn into a paid position in q1 of next year but that hinges on them performing a successful funding round, and also wanting to hire me after the internship is up. Regardless I am confident that I could get a good reference from the experience and list it on my resume. And afterwards would be in a better position to land a role in 2024.  
I have been offered a position for an healthtech company but the role is not engineering, it is an ""implementation specialist"". Essentially it will be manually configuring software for the hospitals that purchase it. it pays not a lot but is remote. The company is much bigger (150 employees) , has been around for >10 years, and are hiring because the last implementation specialist moved into a data analyst role within the company. I know people at the company who have worked their for a number of years and have told me good things. my goal with taking this job would be to do a good job and move into a software engineering role with them when that role opens up. The hiring manager who hired me is aware of this aspiration.  
my concern would be if this role takes me in the wrong direction or makes it harder to become a software engineer. if I take it I would have to quit the other internship early.  
I want to be a software engineer, what would you do?  
PS. I am currently living at home and have a great relationship with my parents, so don't need to necessarily make money right away, which is why this is a harder decision than it may seem on the surface.",2023-11-10 21:08:41
16nw7pr,Feeling the doom (recent May 2023 CS graduate) - Looking for advice to keep me sane,"Hello all, you've probably heard the story, recent CS grad struggling to find a job. I am located in Alberta, but have been applying to anywhere in Canada. I am trying to keep optimistic and but also trying to get a realistic view. I undertook this as a second degree so I have a bit of work experience under my belt, but only one especially related work term maybe from 8 years ago. 

I know no one can predict the future, but are there any previous ""cycles"" of hiring and not?

Also any recommended job board or site to search for jobs? I am currently using LinkedIn and Indeed and would like to hear any other options. I am open to relocating. I am also open to remote options internationally.

I have been trying to keep my skills sharp through LeetCode and slowly learning React (since there seems to be a disconnect between what is used in today's workforce), but any other ideas on how to make my resume more attractive is appreciated.

So far I  have taken 2 OAs, and I ended up choking on both. I often figure out the solution maybe 20 minutes after the deadline, but I completely  blank out during them, it felt like I had to know the answer before even seeing the question, any advice on that part?

Any advice to help me keep sane would be greatly appreciated!

Their onboarding process has been super smooth and well organized and there seems to be a lot of support and really friendly/helpful senior staff.

My first ticket is converting a get lambda into a spring boot API. In theory it's pretty simple, but I keep getting stuck because I don't actually know spring boot basically at all and just getting connected to AWS DynamoDB to run the original lambda locally took like 3 days to figure out. In school all we did was download a zip file off Blackboard and then resubmit a zip file a week later when we were done, it feels like half the challenge here at actual work is figuring out how to actually start coding.

It doesn't help that another noob who started with me is doing basically a twin ticket, it's almost the exact same but it's 'get'ing a different table in DynamoDB. She's an overachiever, very smart, etc. and since I'm working with her it just feels like what I'm doing is pointless because she's been 5 steps ahead of me and already has whatever I'm struggling with done like days before. We could just take what she did and change the names and it would work for mine. Since were doing twin tickets it would make sense for them to match up, so when we did our pull request we changed a bunch of shit in mine to match hers because apparently it was better - so really why did I even do my ticket?

Issue is I can't tell if she's actually an over achiever or if she's normal and I'm just really bad.

I'm really unsure of what the expectations are here or how good I'm supposed to be, other people tend to talk about things in meetings that I don't know anything about - they ask questions with a lot of technical terms I would never use.

I speak good enough French that I can understand most things and could definitely get by if needed, but it's not really smooth or fast enough that I'd fit in seamlessly. I would love to improve my French through work if I can, but I feel like I probably have lower chances of getting hired by a francophone company.

My GPA/transcript aren't very good, but I am genuinely passionate about coding and good at picking things up quickly. I haven't started grinding LeetCode or anything, mostly bc it seems boring and tedious, but I am prepared to start on that if it'll be helpful for technical interviews. I've done courses in data structures/logic and stuff so I am relatively familiar with theory topics, but it's been a while so I probably couldn't do anything specific without being able to consult Google, i.e. in a technical interview setting.

I have two summers worth of internship experience, both at the same major bank in Canada. However I don't think these positions are huge assets- one was for performance testing (most of the 'coding' was just fixing outdated scripts) and one was working in test automation development. So the latter position at least had me developing scripts in a testing framework and I did a little work with Python as well, but it wasn't exactly a software dev internship. I also have two semesters of working as a teaching assistant for an intro to programming/data analytics course. 

As for side projects, this might be my downfall as I don't really have any noteworthy projects. I will be working on a capstone project to do with generative AIs next semester, so I plan to put that on my resume, and I could probably list a group project or two from past courses, but I don't have any side projects that I've completed independently. My main struggle is I'm not very creative/good at coming up with projects, I'm much more of an \~implementation\~ type person, but if it will hinder me not to have any I'll try to put something together.

I also don't really have anything on my Github, and my Linkedin is set up but I don't have anyone added on it/don't use it actively. I was thinking maybe I should start looking for jobs on Linkedin and such as I know a friend in the city was able to land a position that way, but I am super unfamiliar with how that platform works and how to attract recruiters. 

Anyway, like I said I am really really hoping to be able to work in Montréal after I graduate, but I am really worried about landing an entry-level job in general and I feel like it might be even harder in Montréal due to the language thing. I would probably take any job offered to me as I'm happy to do something a little soul-sucking in exchange for living there, but I do also have aspirations of making good money/working for bigger companies eventually. However I know with my grades/lack of side projects/experience I am probably not landing any FAANG positions right out of the gate, so I am just looking for anyone's advice/take on my situation and how I should move forward as a soon-to-be new grad!

Is Data Science even good enough for SWE jobs? I looked at the academic calendar and there’s a good amount of cs courses but it’s also filled with math and stat courses. But the CS degree at Windsor has only CS courses.

After Elon's layoffs I read a tweet from a former Facebook employee claiming Meta is overstaffed. 

He doesn't understand why the company needs 70000 employees. Many were also claiming that companies have over hired. 

I'm also seeing claims stating that some are only working 15 hours and productivity is low.

ydow2d,I quit my job 6 months ago,"I was an intermediate software developer at a small company. I was working on .Net/C# and Python applications. I hated my job towards the end. 

I was working on a solo project at work and it drained my mentally. I worked all day everyday and slept for 4 hours on most days. I did not have time to find another job. I reached my breaking point and quit my job in April 2022.

In Jan 2022, I lost my grandmother due to covid but I couldn't go back to my country. I hadn't visited my family in 3 years so after I quit my job I went back to stay with my family for few months. 

I came back last month and started applying to data analyst, data engineer, software engineer and developer roles but I'm getting rejections every single day and not even one interview. 

I am terrified of the recession people are talking about. My last job was my first job in Canada and I was able to get OAs every week during my job search. But now nothing. 

I don't know what I am doing wrong. I am scared of the growing gap on my resume. I don't want to vent out to my family about the situation I am in so I thought I could come here and rant. Thank you for reading!",2022-10-26 04:29:15
xbz1iw,"Starting new job at Amazon as SDE-2 next month, what else should I do to prepare?","Last month, I was extended an offer by Amazon for an SDE2 position at AWS. So far, I've been completing my on-boarding tasks assigned to me, as well as trying to figure out relocation logistics for myself. 

I've also been talking with my manager on how to prepare for my new job. He's linked me to a couple of videos about the product I'll be working on and he'll be given me some more AWS documentation to read. I plan on asking him some more questions later this week. 

I'm a little nervous jumping into this role, because SDE2 covers a wide range of years of experience and I only have a little less than 2 years of experience. I actually applied for SDE1, but recruiter decided to give me an OA for SDE2 instead, and then I just kept going with the SDE2 loop until I ended up with an offer. I don't have that much experience with AWS in general, only dabbled with a few AWS services in my own side projects (mainly just S3 and Dynamo), and watched the AWS cloud practitioners course during my last job.

I'm based in montreal and making like 81k base, 90k ish TC right now having about 1.5 years of internship experience and 1.1 years of full time work at my current employer. 

I am trying to learn new tech stacks outside of work right now, particularly go and webdev for the website I'm building. At work I get fantastic feedback, and I'm due for a raise soon.  

I think I'm getting paid decently given my experience, but I also feel like I should be able to make a lot more. I don't want to be stuck writing Java or legacy code so I want to switch gears into fullstack development. I've been learning nextjs, graphql, golang, MongoDB and reviewing things like react and docker. I want to learn how to deploy my website using kubernetes and cloud based tools. Learning these technologies are fun for me and I've been really enjoying it. I feel like this will help me break away from my current Java based role. 

On the other hand, I'm not really spending much time practicing leetcode or anything right now or coding interview stuff. I haven't ever really applied to MANGA companies because I've been too intimidated by the whole process. Should I be spending more time on leet code?

umrlmt,Since joining this sub I have become more confused than ever.,"Hi all,

I am a backend Java dev living in Montreal, Quebec. My current position is as a Senior and my company is encouraging me to transition to a Lead position. I got this job while in school and have been there for 6+ years.

I really like my current employer. They treat me very well. I have full flexibility in terms of WFH or going in to the office (I still have a permanent desk there) and I have unlimited vacation days.

Right out of school I was paid $62k. After I few years, promotions and raises, I was still being paid under $80k. At this point, I was getting calls from recruiters nonstop and I knew I could make more, so I asked them for a bigger raise and I got it. They bumped me up to $94k and will hopefully get a bump later this year, though not expecting a huge increase.

To be honest, I am living pretty comfortably. I have done well with investments and such in the past too, so I have a great house, and my wife works too, so we have a nice lifestyle for our children. And Montreal, up until fairly recently, was not a super expensive place to live, so $94k honestly goes a long way.

But ever since joining this sub and reading about some of the salaries thrown around here, I have gotten so confused. I knew I was underpaid before, but I thought I was doing ok now. After reading some of the posts here, I am wondering if maybe I'm being short-changed still.

I really do like my job. It's very chill, I am still learning things and I get to work with talented people. The workload is pretty light, outside of the occasional crunch time, so I don't find it stressful at all. And I value the flexibility and vacation time I get here (I take probably 6 weeks/year).

I have never worked another job in this industry (I did work in another field for 8 years previous to this job). I don't know if the perks I get at this job are common or not. And I don't know how realistic some of the salaries thrown out on this subreddit really are, because when I check glassdoor, most java devs in Montreal get paid around 80-90k or so, and I am right around the average pay grade for a senior according to these figures.

I'd love some insight from other Montrealers in particular.

Thank you,",2022-05-10 20:13:36

teyx70,"PSA: If you are applying to University, look for a program with Internship OR Coop","[https://technationcanada.ca/en/future-workforce-development/career-ready-program/](https://technationcanada.ca/en/future-workforce-development/career-ready-program/)

The government subsidizes employers up to $5000 (50% of wage) for students interning in tech.

But here's the game changer: you have to be in COOP or on Internship. 

Many schools don't have co-ops. Some universities offer ""proof of internship"" but not everyone offers them. 

I used to believe that ""Waterloo coop doesn't matter, I can find jobs on my own"". The reality says otherwise.

For example, at my school, McGill University, there is an option for a ""science internship"" but you have to be registered as CS major, not SE major. I had to change my major.

In summer, I don't think there's the ""science internship"" option, making it much harder. [Correction: there’s an option]

Small to medium sized employers care about expenses. If you cost 50% more than the other students with coops or internships, they mostly won't hire you. I experienced this first hand. 

Bigger employers don't care as much, but you need previous internships to get the bigger internships.

Thus think twice before deciding your program. 

Hopefully that helps. If I made a mistake, feel free to correct me.",2022-03-15 20:05:01
t9fz12,How do mediocre Canadian companies paying a pittance for senior/staff manage to hire a single developer? I genuinely don’t get it,"I remember years ago when being a dev in Canada meant you had to accept a joke of a salary compared to people doing the same job in big US tech cities. But now that many companies are paying 400/500+ for seniors/staff in Canada what possible reason is there for anyone to work for all these Canadian startups that balk at even breaking 200k. And I know there’s a ton of them, my LinkedIn is full of recruiters talking up there compensation then why you dig in a bit you find out they think 130k is “market leading”.

Yet the fact all these Canadian companies do exist and do have engineers working for them makes it clear they do find people willing to work for peanuts. My question is why? What is going through people’s heads that they’ll lose potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars compared to what they could be earning fully remote at Meta, Bolt, Wish, Brex, InstaCart, etc? Do they just not know any better?",2022-03-08 12:41:43
rhv0tw,Does self-teaching lead anywhere in Canada?,"Like some others posting here, I'm interested in making a switch to software/CS because my current job is unfulfilling. I have a B.Eng in Civil with a couple years of work experience, so my education and experience aren't as geared towards technology as other disciplines/fields. I work in CAD/Civil 3D all day developing models and designing, but practical coding opportunities are limited.

Looking on subreddits like r/learnprogramming, the impression seems to be that self teaching can lead to a junior role if you're motivated and commit to developing side projects. On the other hand, I assume most people saying this are American which is a bit different than the tech sector in Canada.

Is it worthwhile to complete Udemy courses (or similar) to develop skills in web dev or other fields? Can it lead to real career progression beyond a few outliers?

Going back to school is an option for some, but racking up additional student debt and committing to a multi-year program in my late 20s is significant. If self teaching outside of full time work can lead somewhere meaningful, that would be perfect. A bootcamp is another option, but likely something I would consider after self teaching for a while to make sure this is the change I want for my career moving forward.",2021-12-16 17:03:24

192v2ri,Next Step: Advancing My Career in Tech After Years in Consultancy,"Hi there, looking for some insight on how I should go about continuing my career in tech. 

I received an advanced college diploma (software) 3 years in school + 12 months of coop 7 years ago. Almost immediately after graduation I got a job at a Toronto based development consultancy and have worked on various projects ever since. 

My pay is pretty good at 115k but I’m starting to worry a bit. I’ve been at the same company for my entire career. The constant context switching when moving to different clients can be a bit exhausting and the expectation to be an expert in everything is prone to imposter syndrome. 

I haven’t created many side projects because I feel like I’ve given my clients everything instead of focusing on my own projects after work. The fear is that I get let go at some point and have nothing to show for when applying for another job. Not only that but I also only have my college diploma. 

I feel a bit silly asking this when others are desperately looking for a job but how do I go about feeling less trapped at my current position? Would it be worth it to get a degree in cs though an online accredited university (transferring my college courses) or is my diploma and experience enough?",2024-01-10 00:50:21
18xy6sf,Is it time for me to move on?,"Hi guys - looking for advice from all you awesome, experienced folks here. I have been working at a software organization for a few years now, and my salary has been mostly stagnant (barring one event during the pandemic where company rolled out increments to prevent people from leaving - remember the silent quitting/jumping the ship frenzy? :) )

I have been consistently getting great feedback from my managers but looks like the company doesn't want to promote people easily (I don't even know what that means). Also, since the market has adjusted now, the company doesn't feel the need to give good hikes to the engineers because why give hikes if you can hire for lower pay grades?

I am kinda split on should I stay or leave? I have been slogging my ass off (so much that I don't even have time/energy to consistently LC for a jump) but haven't had any promotions or nice consistent hikes coming my way. Looks like this year is going to be another such year.

17wzkjd,"New Grad Dilemma, Software Engineering or Technical Sales","I am very grateful to receive multiple offers in this market as a new grad. 

I am in a huge existential crisis. For context, I am a passionate aspiring Software Engineer about to graduate in May. I love software engineering and building products and am especially looking forward to building a strong career that fulfills my love of engineering as a whole. 

So what's the problem? I have a SWE Rotational Program Offer from a very large multinational Canadian insurance, which is a 2-year rotational program to learn in different domains. Salary: 90k + ~7k bonus

I got an offer today from an infamous 'Big Blue' company for a Technical Sales Role. 
Salary: 137k OPE (70/30 split base/commission) + 1.5k sign on bonus

Both jobs same location, hybrid.

The difference in salary is making me feel like an idiot if I reject it. I feel like I might regret having a high-paying, relatively stable job later. I don't mind selling, but I love programming, something that I won't be doing a lot in a Tech Sales role.

Also worth mentioning that the Big Blue company told me I could switch to a more technical role after 12-16 months of joining, and that internal switching is quite common, but I don't know if I want to enter my first job, just to wait to switch to another job.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What would you pick/do in my situation?",2023-11-16 22:35:00
17igvnw,Should I graduate with a Computing Science Diploma early instead of staying in school for 3-4 years more and get my Bachelor's of Computing Science Degree?,"My background:

I started learning how to code and learn about tech at around the age of 15, and I have done freelancing throughout my high school period for various projects, after graduating school, I worked full time as a Backend Developer for a blockchain project.

I was making 70kCAD/yr right after high school, after the gap year I decided getting a degree in CS might be worth it. I left my blockchain job after about an year and got another job as a full-stack developer (making 124k/yr CAD right now) working remotely for a health education company.

I am good at full-stack development and know all the good stuff when it comes to JS/TS/React/Node/Go, and studying in school for CS (I go to Thompson Rivers University) feels like I am learning nothing, all my peers are very new to programming and all our courses teach the most basics of stuff.

My end goal in my career is to start my own SaaS company and not follow the corporate ladder, so as soon as I am out of school, I will be focusing on my own software company while I work any decent job that pays the bill.

Now my question is, is it worth it for my to still go and complete the CS degree (which would take 3 more years to complete) or should I just graduate after 1 year with a Computing Science diploma and leverage my past experience to find a tech job and then just focus on building my own SaaS?

Again, my goal is not to climb the corporate ladder, it is to start my own thing, and I know I am capable of doing that as I have taught myself fairly well how to build good apps.

**Edit post** \- Thank you for your insights everyone, I think getting a degree is worth it, and 2-3 years is not a lot of time in the long run if I can attach the label of a degree to myself for the rest of my life. I will continue to progress in my skills throughout school and be ready once I graduate!",2023-10-28 16:03:42

 I’ve been working as a tradesperson ever since I graduated high school about 15 years ago. I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis when I was about 21-22 years old and have been suffering with it to varying degrees since. It’s gotten to the point that I’m concerned for the term health and functionality of my body. 




 I probably should have switched a long time ago but it’s a family business and they’ve expressed to me that if I leave there’s a very strong chance they will sell out/close up shop. I was never guilted about this and it’s not a game anyone is playing to get me to stay. It’s just the way the cookie crumbles. There’s big manpower issues in my trade.




 Now that the lore is out the way, I’d love to poll you guys about how I should proceed. I’ve always been interested in and had a love for tech. I’ve integrated quite a few things into our business over the years in an effort to improve efficiency and stay on top of what’s out there. Any chance I get to work on something from home on the computer I’m the happiest I can possibly be. I would love to make this a career for my health, my families happiness and my sanity.




 I’m super green when it comes to coding. I made basic HTML sites when I was a kid and built some terrible flash games with friends when we were 12-14 years old and I barely remember anything. I worked my ass off the last decade and a half to be the best that I could possibly be at my job and it’s left me behind in the tech world.



 What would be the best route for someone with my background to take? I want to code so I can work remote. I love where I live. My family network makes it impossible for me to move from rural Alberta because I would rather do any type of menial job than rip my children away from our home and their family. Our family is tight and we live to look after each other. My parents had rough upbringings and they are flipping that script for my siblings and our children. I need to make my career work remote.



I see so many comments about boot camps being either the best idea or total waist of 15-20k. What I really need is a no-bullshit list of steps to take to make myself employable in an efficient time period. I’d rather not go back to university at my age because as I’ve posted up, I don’t feel like moving is an option for my kids. I’m more than willing and capable of doing the work required of me, it’ll be tough but I’ve been outside in -35 for weeks on end, 12-14 hours a day to make a living. I know I can do this.



If anyone is willing to mentor me I would be forever grateful. 


TL;DR: early 30’s person working in trades the last 15 years looking to switch careers because of rheumatic disease. Information all over the place and lacking in general for Canadians. Would love mentorship.",2022-09-20 17:56:44

ucfnhf,"Job hunting burn out after about 2 months and wondering if I should give up for the time being Sorry, this post has been removed by the","I have been working for around two years as a mobile developer (mainly internships and full-time positions) in React Native mainly however I feel like I am not gaining exposure to practices (e.g. CI/CD) which are needed for my field. Currently I am working at a tiny startup with little to no mentorship and am desperately looking for an entry-level position (mobile or web development) at any company in Canada (or US remote) that could provide me with mentorship and growth opportunities such that I can become a much better coder and maximize my contribution. That is not to say that I am not looking for learning opportunities on my own (e.g. working towards getting an AWS certification, took a React course to address any gaps I had in my knowledge, eager to implement automated testing using Jest and Detox, and looking to better my web UI skills). I have applied to around 100 places and, while I am receiving callbacks (sometimes have interview day after day in a week), I find that I am constantly flunking the technical interviews. This can range from some trivia questions such as what is the React Native bridge to asking to solve a coding challenge (not even of medium difficulty). I will admit my mistake was going head in without thorough preparation at some times, but every rejection seems to be taking a toll on my mental health.

I guess if I was to give up, I would dedicate time exclusively to CTCI, LeetCode, and upskilling (e.g. getting better at native mobile development, working on CSS skills, and generally working on acing tech interviews).

To some extent I am told it is a numbers game but as more and more interviews pass I am finding it harder to believe that and am beginning to believe that whatever skills I have developed were worthless at the end of the day.

Otherwise not sure about what to do and not sure how exactly to proceed. Is it just keep applying, improving, and hope something works out, or take a step back so that I can put everything into perspective and hopefully come back way stronger. With the latter case, not sure how that would look like as every company has their own tech stack, etc.",2022-04-26 15:49:27

I'm sitting at a offer of 75k for a junior backend position (same as my current job but slightly different stack) but its onsite (currently im remote). To be honest, i'd rather continue working at my current job due to remote work. My CEO is very cheap and being frugal due to the market being bad. For example I have extended healthcare in my contract but the CEO kept making excuses to not give me it. Like made me wait 3 months after my probation period was done. Then would say ""we might have to cut your salary if you want this"" despite it being in my contract... After 5 months he agreed to give it without salary cut.

oo94ju,Question about the state of CS and tech careers in Canada,"I've been reading a lot of online articles about how Toronto is the ""Silicon Valley of the North"" and how tech careers are getting better in terms of career growth and pay in cities like Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. However, reading some of the comments here and on r/cscareerquestions paints a not-so-positive picture of Canadian tech careers.

1. I wanted to get first-hand information from people who have been working in Canada about how satisfied they are with their careers. Are salaries actually increasing every year or is that a temporary phenomenon due to remote jobs?
2. Will cities like Toronto ever be able to compete with the US for tech careers? I'm not expecting any Canadian city to ever match Silicon Valley, but do you think that they can compete with cities like New York, Boston or Seattle in the next decade?
3. How does Canada compare to European countries like Germany, Netherlands, UK and Sweden for tech careers?",2021-07-20 19:25:53
m09rcw,Welcome!,"Welcome to the cs career questions of Canada subreddit. We are geared towards specifically answer questions for Canadians.

""Wait, but, why? Why not just stick with /r/cscareerquestions"" ?

I have been around that sub for awhile, and while most advice is pretty universal across the borders, there's a couple reasons I decided that maybe it would best to actually have our own sub.

&#x200B;

1. **Our employment labour laws are different**. A lot of advice there sometimes revolves around this idea of ""At will employment"" which is a US law stating that as a company they can fire you for any reason at any time, so therefore you are able to quit for any reason at any time. Two weeks is a courtesy. *However*, This is not the case in some provinces. If employers wish to fire you, they have to give you notice (unless you are under probation) and vice versa, you have to give them notice if you wish to quit.
2. **Education and Salary requirements**. These do differ across the border. While yes, a degree at UWaterloo will land you a job everywhere, no one really talks about the effects of 2-year diplomas, bootcamps, for-profit schools and lesser known Universities in Canada (but are also good). Additionally, there is a huge difference in salary between us and the United States. FAANG salaries and qualification standards can be different up here. Most of our cities do not have a very strong FAANG prescence, if any at all.
3. **Differing Companies and Industries.** There are some distinctly large companies who's HQ's are in Canada that are worth mentioning and talking about (most notably, Shopify) which again, we could benefit from hearing more perspectives pertaining to the Canadian market.
4. **Engineer.** This dreaded discussion centres around how Engineer is a protected title in Canada, whereas in the US it is not. The use of this title with out a P. Eng is still hotly debated among governing boards in Canada, but the consensus is that it is up to the strictness of the provincial governing body to regulate this.
5. **We allow school posts.** I think our education system is different enough (such as cost) from the US that this warrants we talk about it here.

# WIKI IS A WORK IN PROGRESS 

Feel free to ask to contribute. 

That's all for now. We are welcome to all questions as long as they conform to our rules. We are constantly adding to the wiki. We'll probably need more mods if the sub gets more traffic, but for now it's probably fine. If interested, definitely send me a modmail and I can add it to the sub.

* Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience
* Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below) and pick STRONG action words. Do not pick weak ones - ones such as ""Worked"", ""Made"", ""Fixed"". These can all be said stronger, ""Designed"", ""Developed"", ""Implemented"", ""Integrated"", ""Improved""
* Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense
* Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. **Using an IDE is not a skill,** but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not. **VSCODE IS NOT A SKILL**. Neither are Jira and Confluence. If any non-CS person can open it up and use it, it's not a skill.
* Overloading skills - Listing every single skill, tool, IDE you've ever opened is not going to appeal to recruiters and will look like BS. Also remember that anything you list is **FAIR GAME TO TEST** and if you cannot answer that deeply about it, remove it.

17u3mvo,How to gain optionality in your career ?,"With all these tech layoffs going on and employers trying to take advantage of poor job market by over-working employees is making me question future career choices. 

It seems to me that traditional roles are over crowded and if you donot have FAANG on your resume it is hard to stand out in the job market. You can be laid off at a moment's notice and can spend months looking for another job with no guarantee you will find another similar paying job, you may have to take a pay cut and work at a lower level. Many companies consider tech as cost center. 

I am not looking for a very high salary but a career path where if one loses a job you can find another one in a month or two. If for some reason my workplace starts turning into a toxic workplace I should be able to quit without stressing too much if I will find another job. If I get bored of my job, I should be able to land job at another organization. 

In summary,  career path where you will always have work to do and where you donot need to become a lifer in government to have a semblance of a job security. One should be able to change jobs every so many years. 

I was thinking specializing in Salesforce might be a good idea since not many traditional SWE want to do it and it seems Salesforce developer have their inbox filled with recruiter email. In Salesforce you can do certifications and separate yourself from masses. One may or may not be able to crack FAANG but with enough effort one can always become a 15x certified Salesforce developer. 

Any thoughts are welcome ?",2023-11-13 05:17:36
17fsqyy,Feeling lost after graduating - Bait and switch Jobs,"Hi Reddit,

Apologies for the same ""idk what to do"" post that comes up here weekly.

I'd like to discuss my current career situation and seek your insights. I graduated from Halifax and relocated to Toronto with the expectation of an analytics role, but it turned out to be primarily data entry and a support role at a retailer.

The job itself lacks excitement, and the pressure to meet high expectations often leads to overtime and, unfortunately, errors. My managers frequently remind me of the competitive job market, even though we're understaffed and overworked.

I consider my skills as a developer to be average, but I'm contemplating graduate school next year, with a focus on either programming or UX development, both of which I'm genuinely passionate about and currently working on projects related to.

I'm at a crossroads, and I'm uncertain about my career path in this city. The decision to move here was significant, and I'm torn between persevering in the hope of improvement or exploring other opportunities in the area. I'm committed to staying in Toronto and not considering a move to a smaller city.

I'm actively looking for new job prospects, but securing interviews has been challenging. Consequently, I'm considering the idea of quitting and returning home for a few months to concentrate on personal projects. But, this would potentially delay my Permanent Residency, something I'd prefer to avoid. I'm making efforts to get  relevant certificates and dedicate my weekends to working on projects. The idea of going back home to focus on my projects is becoming increasingly appealing.

Any feedback is appreciated, thank you in advance.

Edit: Forgot to mention I was a TA for a web dev course for 3 years during my University and have 3 internships.",2023-10-25 01:04:51
171op6o,Feeling miserable at the job that I chose after getting two job offers [UPDATE],"I previously wrote [this](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/s/DiTsRX1fqP).

After two months, I’m more miserable than ever. There’s no work-life balance in the team. The manager and teammates who I thought were nice are now treating me like shit. I have to work night and weekends unpaid. I rejected a higher paying job because I thought life here will be more chill after the depressive state that I’ve gotten after two months of depressing job search. Now I’m not sure if I’ll pass probation. I feel so shit right now, what should I do 😭

The pay in my current job is very much less than and more more stressful than my previous job 😭 I wasn’t even laidoff, I resigned voluntarily early this year thinking I could’ve gotten a better job 😭

How do you overcome such irreversible decision…",2023-10-06 21:44:29
16n8zlr,Just sharing my experience in applying for Senior engineer positions,"I have been applying for many big techs and start-ups in Canada since Feb. I am going for higher mid to senior engineer level. I don't track how many of them (about a few hundred positions perhaps). But I have only  32 recruiter callbacks, a few did not move forward after initial calls. Out of the remainings, I passed all online coding rounds (if any) and passed & failed here and there at the 1-2 phone screening rounds. Among the passes, I moved to 7 virtual on-site... and have failed 6... Among these are Meta, Apple, & Stripe, and a few start-ups.

I have gone through the process with the big ones like Meta, Apple, Google, TikTok, Zynga, Stripe, Pinterest, Dropbox, Confluent, Ripple. About to start with Amazon, Reddit, Lyft, Spotify.

From this experience, I realize that, in this climate, companies do look for almost-perfect candidates, and it does feel like they look for ways to trip candidates up, for ways to reject them.

I was able to solve almost all DSA/Leetcode questions in those rounds (Meta has 2 questions/coding round), but it is almost always the System Design that killed me. I have read lots of materials on this, from the familiar TinyURL or Twitter designs to more complex ones like Distributed Locks, Distributed storage, etc. In the interview, I can always draw up the basic high level design and explain my decision.

Some time the feedback is that I did not discuss trade-offs enough, other times when I did talk about trade-offs, they said I did not have conviction when making my design decisions (not sure what to make of this). 

In one particular start-up, they gave me a simple React repo and asked me to implement a feature live. Note that I don't have a single YOE in FrontEnd/React, and their rationale was to assess how I could navigate a totally unfamiliar codebase. Being an experienced engineer, I was able to Google search for some stuff, while sharing the screen so they saw what I was searching. I managed to get it working at last, with some hints from the interviewers (mostly because I am not fluent in JavaScript). The feedback on that round: They think I have difficulty navigating the documentation, and I did not collaborate with the interviewers. LOL, this was a senior position and most of the daily technical problems we face, we usually just Google it ourselves. not sure what they expect. Also, about the difficulty in navigating the doc part: well, duh, they gave me a code base in a language I'm not familiar with.

There are a few more ridiculous things that I went through here but I have already ranted too much. A lot of the time, I think the interview is just to satisfy the ego of the interviewers and not to assess the candidate's ability.

My background: 6+ YOE, Backend engineer, working at a big e-commerce company in Canada, working on many user-facing features and with distributed systems.",2023-09-20 01:58:26

1530355,At what point should I just give up?,"Im a mid level developer with 5ish(2x2.5) years of experience since graduating in 2011.  Also I’ve been a professional poker player in between each and during my past dev jobs and solely since I left my last job in early 2018.

I essentially quit poker last fall/winter to study, leetcode practice, work on projects and just prepare for interviews.  

My mind of thought was just if I dedicate myself to the job process things should go well and in a few weeks or months I should be able to get a job.

Now roughly 6ish months and 500ish job applications later I still haven’t found a job and I just have no idea what to do at this point.  

I’m used to getting maybe like 20-25% callback/interviews in the past and now it’s probably like 1-2%.  I’m not aiming for FANG jobs, I’m aiming for mid level dev jobs, I’ll work for under market rates and I’m without a doubt a better developer then I was at my past two jobs.

I have no clue whether my poker break is the issue or it is the market, or both…

How do I proceed at this point?

I don’t want to go back to full time poker but I think at this point I might just do that for 6 months and try again for dev jobs in 2024.",2023-07-18 14:31:21

I am also in dean's honour list and have 86.5% major (last 4 semester) gpa, and was told by my academic advisor that I will be in top 5% in the entire Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty. However, my luck is not clicking with big name tech companies and my resume is getting rejected at initial stages.

I got my resume reviewed a lot of times and posted it in this sub and other subs and all said I have a very impressive resume. I also applied via referrals but that didn't help me in any sensible ways. I have given up getting anything from those faang companies as intern/new grad.

So I just want to gain some insight from people who couldn't secure a new grad/intern role at any faang companies or any other major tech companies (IBM, SAP, Splunk, Lyft, Uber etc) but later secured a role after few yoe.

1. Is it a faang company or any other major company that you secured your offers from ?
2. How easy/difficult was it for you to get/secure an interview?
3. Did you apply online or a recruiter reached out to you on Linkedin/email/phone?
4. How difficult was your interview? Were you able to provide the optimal solutions to your problems on the first try when interviewing?
5. How long was your interview and how many rounds?
6. Was there any scaling/role changes (for example you interviewed for SDE ii but they gave you an offer for SDE 1)
7. How long did you prepare? What was your preparation schedule (like 2 hours/day doing leetcode, 1 hr/day doing system design etc)?
8. How many leetcode have you done (I would really appreciate if you list something like x amounts of easy, y amounts of med, and z amounts of hard etc)

*Also:* get AWS, GCP, Azure certs - they're the only ones worth anything and actually help your salary range, according to my bosses.

1523660,Self-taught Jr dev on my team isn't progressing and isn't making steps towards improving. I don't think he's cut out for this field.,"I was hired onto a team as a Manager at a small startup. I act more like a lead AND manager, but my title is Manager. It is my first time formally coaching others, my previous role was as a lead but the people part was managed by a staff engineer.

Education isn't a hard requirement on the team, and my boss really likes self-taught developers because they're very cheap to hire. Sometimes we get better than we bargain for because of that. He hired this Jr who was originally in the Marketing department. He's been a junior developer for 3 years now, and he will probably stay as a Junior developer for a while.

Unfortunately, he isn't putting in the work to catch up to some of our other Jr's (including interns who are still finishing college) in terms of technical knowledge or problem solving skills. I generally enjoy mentoring Jr developers, including when they ask question. My issue with the Jr is when he comes to me with problems, he doesn't ask good questions.

I don't mean in depth ones, but I mean stuff that can be googled he asks me instead of searching for answers. Instead of problem solving himself, he comes to me anytime something breaks, or doesn't work and has tried nothing. I try and prompt him to problem solve on his own to start with, but he just messages me like crazy that he doesn't know what to do. If I tell him he needs to try and figure it out on his own, he is passive aggressive and threatens the deadline of the project. 

I thought he was at least OK solving bugs. But recently I found out that if he doesn't know the answer immediately, he will just go through the team roster and ask them one by one until someone tells him exactly what to do.

When I pair programmed with him to build a new feature, I find he just copy and pastes existing code in the code-base, but doesn't put any effort into making it reusable. The minute a task is novel, he's completely lost and I have to walk him through the most basic things. We also have a project that's on a more modern, slightly different language and framework and he clearly cannot adapt to the new tech stack at all.

I have given him feedback and resources to improve, but he hasn't made any effort into doing them. When I teach him technical concepts about design or reasons why, he just says ok he'll make sure to do that next time but never does. He makes excuses or apparently doesn't understand what I've sent him (won't find this out until he hits the same problem that I've already tried to coach him on). With 1 on 1's I've had with him, I've asked him why he wanted to go into coding and if he liked it and he said he did, but I don't find him to be particularly passionate or curious.

I've spoken to my boss about the situation, and even asked about potentially letting him go but my boss likes him too much and says his communication skills are very good with the business, it's my job to coach him. I'm at a loss though because he's not doing anything to improve and the whole point of putting my efforts and resources into improving him is so that he can be more Senior. I can agree that his communication skills are very good. He would be well suited for a business analyst, product or project manager role, but he is not cut out for a developer role. 

We currently don't have any performance measures or feedback (part of my job) and I am currently building it with HR + my boss.

In the meantime, what more can I do here? Is there a nice way to structure feedback to tell him he should pursue a different career path? I do feel like I need to lay out expectations with him first. What would be the best way to set independent problem solving as a goal so I can show my boss he's not hitting them?",2023-07-17 14:14:47
149sfod,"Just for my own sanity, would someone mind giving me a little insight on the current job market for new grads?","As the title says. I've still got a year or more to go until my graduation and I'll be honest, I've gotten a little sucked into forums like these. I've got no co ops yet but am planning on doing one before my graduation + a couple stupid projects. Obviously leetcode goes along with this.

I guess my question is, there are \*some\* jobs right? When people complain about being 300 applications deep into a job search with nothing to show for it, are these people holding out for a 60kCAD+ job?

119ciz1,At a bit of a crossroad...,"Hi everyone,

I'm a mid-20s mature student doing my first year of CS at UofT.

Now that my first semester is over (and having received a 62% in Differential Calculus), I've come to realize that I haven't built the proper mathematical foundation to be succeeding at a school like this ([see this post for additional context](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/uli4c1/i_will_be_attending_utm_this_fall_for_comp_sci_as/)) and that I'm going to need a lot more time to develop my math skills before I feel competent enough to tackle my program's prerequisite courses.

I do find myself capable of handling the CS-related courses (and enjoy them quite a lot), but I feel like my current standing in math presents a major road block to my success.

I've been debating applying for [York's Digital Technologies program](https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/program/digital-technologies), as it's far more hands on and would allow me to earn a salary while I learn software development (80% experiential, 20% training). The difference here is that I would receive a BASc rather than a BSc, and would lose out on all the other benefits that the UofT name brings.

At this point in my life, I do feel like York's program makes more sense to me, as my main interest is to eventually build web applications and other software, and the money is also a bonus. On the other hand, I feel like if I spend more time at UofT and develop my math skills that I could potentially reach my program requirements. However, this would also just delay my eventual transition into the workforce, which I'm not super keen on.

What would you do if you were in my situation?

Any and all advice is super appreciated.

**EDIT:**

Thank you everyone that responded and for the words of encouragement. I’ve decided I’m going to stick it through and allow myself more time to work on my math skills. 🙏🏼",2023-02-22 20:52:26
117hgn1,Renege AWS for Ford counteroffer?,"I’ve been in Ford for 7 months after graduation as a contractor SWE. Fully remote and chill. No complaints at all.

Still seeking other opportunities as it’s still a contractor’s job. Got AWS ng L4 offer last August. Start date is this March.

Gave my 2 weeks’ notice to my manager at the start of February. He congratulated me and said it’s a pity they are losing me. Two days later, skip of my manager reached out. He offered a transition to full-time and an almost matched tc.


TC breakdown:

AWS: 114K base + 33000*2 sign on for two years + 110k rsu in 5:15:40:40 for four years

Ford(current): 94k base

Ford(new): 114K base + 30000 sign on.


Pro-Ford:

1. Fully remote, while for AWS I need to relocate to Toronto. Rent will almost outweigh the comp gap and I can’t live with my gf any more.

2. Remarkable WLB and great team.

3. Job security would be better imo. No pip and no expected layoffs.


Pro-AWS:

1. Big name on resume. Important especially in early career.

2. Possibly exposure to more transferable knowledge, comparing to having more domain knowledge in Ford.

3. Already signed it. Will possibly be put on blacklist if I renege.


Any advices would be really appreciated! Have been thinking about it for a week and still cannot get a conclusion.

1b9w3dg,Looking for some advice on quitting without a job lined up to enjoy life for a bit,"Getting this out of the way first - I recognize that I am in a very privileged spot to even be considering this, and I am _not_ trying to flex on anyone my current financial status or situation.

---

I've been considering quitting my current role without anything lined up to enjoy life for at least a few months before hopping back on the job hunt and wanted to get some insight from anyone who might've been in the same situation.

Currently 27 and haven't taken a break of more than 2 weeks in the past 5 years and am feeling like my current position with my company just isn't it.

### Current Company

I'm arriving at 1.5 years with my current company, and have had 4 managers, survived an acquisition and survived 2 rounds of layoffs and making about $125k right now. Of my team, I'm the only one left from when I joined and am currently informally merged with another team since the team I used to work with got blown up multiple times.

During my entire time here all I've done is put out fires and play customer support for another team (spend days investigating workflows of old employees, digging through databases looking for data and keeping the lights on, etc).

I've delivered maybe 1 minor feature during my entire time here and started on like 5-6 different initiatives to ""improve"" things that were eventually all shot down and shelved. I'm currently a Google sheet monkey who spends all day documenting things or just slacking off.

Due to being acquired, there have been talks to have my responsibilities and domain folded into the parent company. Because of that, I've basically been doing zero work for the past 6-7 months and have been feeling the brainrot. On top of that, I've learned just about zero new skills during the entire 1.5 years here since they had layoffs a month after I joined and my entire team except for me, a junior, and an intern was kicked.

### Weighing things out

I've been considering sandbagging while applying for jobs for a while, but what's really pushing me to quit and not work for a while was the passing of my father last September. He worked his entire life and never took any time off, and I'm still coming to terms with his departure. 

Perhaps I'm depressed, and just being pessimistic and need therapy, but all I'm feeling right now is the urge to go and enjoy life for a bit. Financially I'm stable enough and have 6-7+ years of living expenses saved up and invested, because I never spent any on myself and was taught to penny pinch everything.

On the other hand, just anecdotally I completely understand how rough the tech (and in general) job market is right now so this seems like a really dumb idea. 

It might seem asinine that I'm considering leaving a cushy do-nothing wfh job making $125k just to ... do nothing in life with no job planned.

Anyways, thanks for reading this wall of text and I'm interested in reading anyone's insights.

Cheers.",2024-03-08 18:59:33

18rvh2a,I wish I knew this sub 9 years ago,"I know life is always filled with regrets, but this one kept popping up in my head every now and then. It’s not really about this sub or Reddit in general. It’s a metaphor regarding making a bad decision without consulting anyone else.  I just want to share (rant) my story with someone, and this sub seems the most relevant.

10 years ago I graduated from a top university in Canada with master degree in engineering (not cs). I had a hard time landing a job, either because there is not many opportunities in this city, or I don’t have good enough background (undergrad out of Canada in a different major). At that time I already knew quite some programming, but I never considered it, because I thought it’s not as fun as real engineering.

After about 4 months of job searching, I finally got a job, an entry level job in the engineering field (which means a high school student can do). My bi-weekly pay check after tax is roughly $1024. For this job i moved to a different city and rented an apartment with 1y lease.

I actually didn’t do well in this job, made quite a few mistakes. As a result my probation didn’t complete successfully. They extended it from 3m to 6m. I was very grateful because I knew I was bad, but I really need a job.

I don’t know exactly when but probably between 3m and 6m, a friend from school contacted me. We took the same algorithm course and I helped her a lot. She already graduated and was working at Faang. She said she can vouch me to apply there. I guess it meant referral? 

The logical response was of course to seize the opportunity. I believe I could land the job without much effort. It was 2014.

Shockingly, I politely rejected her immediately . What was I thinking? First of all, I thought my then-employer was very generous to me, I should wait at least one year to quit. Secondly, I had 1y rent lease that I thought I must not break. I actually knew the compensation would change a lot, but I still rejected (probably didn’t consider the salary much).

If I knew Reddit, I could have asked here. Or at least I can ask some close friends. But no, I didn’t mention it to anyone and silently continued my “promising” career.

Ironically, I did switch career after 1.5yr. Started at a start up and now I’m a senior at one of the biggest tech companies. (Why I didn’t join big tech at first is a different story. I was kind of brainwashed by my startup colleagues that big tech is boring and the pay difference is small, which is totally wrong).

I cannot stop thinking if I joint faang 9 years ago, how it could change my life. Maybe I’m in America now, I am probably at least staff today.

Anyway, enough rant, we cannot remake old decisions. I made many bad decisions, most of them due to my limited knowledge, or I cannot predict future, at least I did my best. But this one, I just cannot get over it because it was clearly a bad decision, and I knew all the facts, but still made it.

Today I see many people asking questions here, even some no-brainer ones. But I’m really happy for you. Asking advices from anyone is always better than not asking at all.",2023-12-27 08:00:07

**My Background:** 

I have been applying to jobs in Toronto for about 3 months now since graduating with my CS degree and have not had much luck in terms of getting interviews. Part of this is because we had our first baby two months ago so I have only managed to apply to like 100 jobs so far.  I think part of my issue is that I need to rework my resume, but I also feel like I need one more really good project to help me stand out. 

I think I need to learn a little more to create this project and am trying to decide the best place to invest my learning time. 

**My Experience:** 

I have the most experience in Java from my degree (built two desktop applications with JDBC/JavaFX/MySQL)  and I built a small project with Python/Flask since graduating. My degree really only taught me the basics of web dev so I am learning all that on my own. I can make an ok looking frontend with CSS, Flask/Jinja templates, but I don't know React or any other frontend frameworks very well. Also, while I learned a lot of Java I never did a Java web project. So I need to learn something like Spring/Spring Boot to bring my Java skills to the web. I have also been learning vanilla JS as well and am starting to feel pretty comfortable with it. 

**Spring Boot or React First?**

I hope eventually to learn a decent amount of both of these but, given my experience, what do people think will be the most time-efficient framework to focus on for an app that will impress employers? Should I work on building a back-end focused Spring Boot App that talks to a database and does authentication and all that? Or should I maybe focus on building a React focused app that talks to some exsiting APIs or something so I don't have to worry about too much of a backend? 

Also is it generally more plausible that I will get an entry-level frontend or backend job? That will also inform my decision making. 

Thanks!",2022-12-14 15:59:03

z6lb3d,Best way to showcase projects if I don't currently have a website? (student),"I currently have two projects I showcase on my GIthub (a tower defense game, and a calculator designed to calculate a weighted total for students' grades in class)

I know I should make my own website as another project to show off on my resume and a way to showcase the projects better, but ever since I took a multimedia web design course two semesters ago, the thought of writing HTML/CSS makes me feel so bored before I even start, and I currently don't want to get into web development

That being said, on the other hand, I know I need anything I can get my hands on when it comes to jobs, as i'm looking for my first internship right now. Would making a website help me get a job in something not related to web development? Do hiring managers or recruiters look at that stuff for first-time interns? 

As an extension, are there other/better ways to show off my work in general? I feel like github doesn't do a great job at showing stuff off, but I'm probably just doing it wrong and need advice there too",2022-11-28 03:19:23

I can work from anywhere as long as I attend the meetings and finish the tickets on time. Although I’m still unsure about entirely moving ships, I was curious as to how common these kind of jobs are?

Think I’m just nervous regarding the process of moving from my first job in the middle of what people are saying is a recession headed towards us.

wm0hif,When is a contract position worth considering over permanent positions,"I’m making roughly $95k salary in Canada with just under 1yeo. I also have a pension plan and health benefits. I was just contacted for a government contract position paying $60/hour with a 12 month contract and likelihood to extend another 24 months. 

To me this seems like not even close to enough to consider leaving my current stable position. When I factor in vacation, health benefits, and pension, the raise to $60/hr, with little job security, seems negligible.

But I’m wondering if maybe there is a number I should be considering? I feel like with my experience, it might be hard to find a number that works for both parties. But perhaps they have a lot of room to go up. Would it be worth it potentially at $80 or $100 per hour? I’m guessing they wouldn’t even entertain these numbers for a junior.",2022-08-11 19:50:58

tk9qgp,Are salaries in Toronto still low?,"E: Sorry, the title seems a bit dickish. I should actually write - ""Have salaries in Toronto increased significantly in the past few years""?

I moved out of Canada a few years ago and currently live in Germany, primarily for travel reasons. I need to make a decision on whether to apply for a permanent residency/pension refund within the next two years or so. Obviously, coming back home is a strong desire.  My only problem is that when I was looking for jobs in Toronto post graduation, the salaries were mind-bogglingly low. As a new grad with strong co-op/PEY experience, I was offered an average of about $60,000 at some shops, capping out at $80,000 at a larger financial firm. After rent and expenses, it made no fiscal sense to stay in Toronto or work for a Canadian company as, while I wouldn't be **poor**, I would still lack some comforts.

My current compensation in Germany is pretty good, but I pay a significant amount more in taxes and health care, totaling near 45%. Coming home would lessen that tax burden **significantly** (iirc, approximately 25% or so), but I'm not confident that I'm able to match German numbers without joining a FAANG-type firm.

So, I'm going to be entering my third year of university (at the University Of Windsor), this Fall, and I'm coming off of completing my second internship.

My goal is to complete 5 internships by the time I graduate (I graduate in May 2024). On top of internships, I'll have a 3 year long research project with a professor from my school's Biochemistry Department. This project will encompass Machine Learning (NLP), Data Mining, Web Development, and some other CS topics. On top of that, I will be doing undergraduate research with some other professors from my school's CS department.


The companies that I've interned at are quite small, but I've learned ALOT during this time. My goal is to work at one of the big banks / fortune 500 companies.


Now... the thing is, I was wondering, how much do new grads usually make in Canada... is it unreasonable to expect 80k - 90k in Toronto, 75k - 80k in Ottawa, and about 70k in Montreal for non faang companies, but bringing lots of experience + many projects (research and side projects) along?

1bqv5ir,Unable to sell current experience.. how common is it to get grilled on recent projects in interviews?,"I just finished 1 year at my fresh grad job. However I don’t really have an understanding of my project. It’s a vast enterprise project with 25-30 services and I only did smaller easier tickets assigned to me. Outside of those I have zero clue about anything. The team lead and senior devs do all the code reviews and client meetings. We gave 2 devops guys and seperate testing team that handles integration and other types of testing and devops work. I just wrote some small features and associated unit tests. I haven't taken ownership of any feature and the tickets that I did do, I have no clue how they fit in the grand scheme of things.

Feels like I have nothing I can say to sell myself in interviews. Recently was asked about technical challenges/interesting bugs and I had nothing to say as essentially my job has been to do crud operations, parse json and use Kafka and api calls. Even if there’s challenges I encountered they aren’t memorable and were easily solved using ChatGPT or googling.

While I am good with leetcode and framework/java theoretical questions, I think I’ll bomb the interviews where they ask me to describe my project and impact.

This is also a consulting firm and the seniors are always busy in meetings and we are rushing towards delivery. So I don't think I can bother people and seek mentorship.

Just to tell you my background story, I did U of T CS as a second degree. My first degree was in life sci.I graduated without ANY internship. Therefore, I just joined a WITCH-like company and currently working in a bank. 

I am SEVERELY under-paid. The company is paying me only half of what they get from the bank...Approaching the time of graduation I knew I was severely under-qualified and just joined the company despite all my acquaintances/friends/family suggesting me not to join.

 Looking back, I think decision to go there was not bad at all since the recession hit.So I worked in the bank for 1 year and 3 months now. 

I work with VERY VERY obsolete technology and WLB here is great. They don't want fast-paced working vibe. Everything is slow...My manager said he wants me to work here for long term and will convert me to permanent from contract whenever he can. Honestly, I don't mind working here long term despite it being looked down on (I know all you developers here preaches to go for ""top-tech"" company). However, I know that I cannot 100% rely on whatever he says. If something happens and he decides to not to convert me, all fault is on me in the end.

I already have some knowledge of tech-stack being used in financial market - Springboot, SQL, React, Azure etc... I also solved around \~300 LC questions, currently reading Elements of Programming Interview.

I know all you developers here are paid good amount of money ($100k+) working in tech but honestly, at this point I just want to earn enough money to sustain myself. What should I study in my side time? 

I don't care staying in a bank for rest of my life getting paid around 80\~90K even...I really don't want to be left unpaid EVER! My family members are so toxic... I don't want to get support from them at all. Also, I'm old, 30-years old... The people I joined the bank with have coded since they were 16 years old -\_- and they joined this company too... (Bruh..) My first line of code was written when I was 25.

Pretty much what the tittle says. I have grounded leetcode and grokking for system design. Also prepared examples on the LPs. I have only 2 years of experience so kinda nervous about system design interview. Any tips before the on-site??

up6s3f,How do you guys plan out leetcode questions before coding?,"so im just your typical unemployed new cs grad trying to do leetcode in hopes i can get a job

I've done about ~100 leetcode questions. Below is my general approach to every question:

When I approach a leetcode question I first try to figure out what the question is asking before I start coding.  After that I just brute force it. I think about possible algorithms I could use and just write. Most of the time my first submit would error, I then would go fix that error (usually some missing edge case) then submit again until I get it right. 


So this is terrible during interviews I realized. I had a interview today on that didn't use a compiler instead used google docs. The question in hindsight wasn't hard just very lengthy in detail (the topic was 'attention to detail')  but I just paniced under pressure. Ended up taking the full 45 minutes to get it (there was a 2nd question also, needless to say I failed). If it were leetcode, that would be simple. I just run it, it would say it errors. I fix the error and go again.

Looking to get rid of this bad habit

tx0e3k,I guess I asked a very low salary for a software developer😳,"Girl with impostor syndrome check 🥲 haha
So, I have a bachelor degree in Comp in brazil with 3 years experience working at a aeroespacial company developing software-security systems. Basically worked with C++ and c# /python for some in-house application. Mentored interns and employees, were responsible for 2 in-house applications.

Just arrived here in Canadá as a student (to get my OPEN work permit afterwards) but as soon as I opened my LinkedIn some recruiters has reached me. ( I always tell them I am under student visa and that I would need sponsorship to be able to work full time) 

So, the recruiter of a big company from Canada (I won’t say the name, but it’s big ) asked me my salary expectation. I said 70k 🤡

Too low right? Hahaha no way to fix that? 

Thank you ❤️

UPDATE:

When I was in the last round of interview I talked with the recruiter and explained that I was new here in Canada and everything… explained that I was also doing Amazon interview and they said that the salary was better…She told me they would never pay me what I asked, because it was very low to what they pay even for recent grad.

t2aysj,Resign right after joining,"Hi guys,

I am starting my new job in 2 days. Yesterday I received an offer that I cannot refuse (+50k than job #1).

In job #1 offer, it says that I have to give 2 weeks of notice. There is another part mentioning ""termination without cause"" and it says that if I am still on probation then they can give me 3 days notice and kick me out afterwards.

Does that mean that if I give my 2 week notice, they can just fire me with 3 days notice?

I know it sucks for company #1 but company 2 is way better I cannot not accept that.


Will my few days of employment at company 1 affect my background check in the futur?

spjl8u,300+ applications very few responses looking for advice,"I've sent out 300+ applications since December looking for a summer internship, but so far have only received 2 OA's and 2 interviews.

About my application process, I've been using Simplify to apply for 90% of the jobs since it speeds up the process for me. I don't have a cover letter attached to any of my applications (not sure if this could be the reason for my low response rate). I've also tried messaging university recruiters with no success so far. I have mainly been applying for US companies, but I do have a fair bit of Canadian companies thrown in the mix, but haven't gotten any responses from them either.

skhr2q,Severely underpaid and lacking motivation. Looking to jump ship ASAP,"I am a software developer with 10 years experience making 80k in Ontario. I know what y'all are thinking and before you say it I am very much aware how underpaid I am and currently trying my best to jump ship. But I have a few issues 
1. I was on a long leave for a year and was not hands on in that period and hence I need atleast 2 weeks to a month to prepare for interviews.
2. I recently joined back my company but was forced to take on a new role which is on the devOps side ( I am a full stack dev) and hence my current job doesn't help me much to prepare.
3. The new role is quite demanding and I really couldn't afford to take much time during my work hours to work on my coding skills.
4. Having 2 young kids pretty much keeps me occupied even outside of office hours. I prepare at night everyday but that time isn't enough.
5. My biggest issue is I have zero motivation at work. After seeing all the salaries posted here and other places and knowing how I am undervalued just makes me want to quit already(I asked for a pay hike and downright rejected)
6. Sometimes I think about quitting my current job and search for a new one as both happening parallely is not working.
7. I have a pretty good reputation at my current company but that doesn't translate to paycheck and I am worried I am going to mess it up by not working like before.
8. I attended a few interviews already and due to my lack of preparation was not able to land any offers so far.

I have a good resume, getting a lot of calls, have no issues with behavioral and conversational technical rounds, but I really lack in hands on coding and also my take home assignments. I just need that prep time before going in for more interviews.

I am aiming for anywhere between 120k to 130k CAD, so definitely not aiming for FAANG tier companies. 

I am at the verge of quitting which at the same time I cannot afford to. I am so tempted to take some vacation time to prepare but I just joined back so it will raise suspicion. I would really appreciate any suggestions. Thank you!",2022-02-04 16:36:21
sjxbkp,Overwhelmingly stressed at a full time job (2 years) should I switch roles/companies?,"(posted on CS career questions, would like to get more insight here if possible/allowed. Reddit mobile had no option to crosspost from what I can see)

# Background:

  
I am in my mid 20's working at IBM for database support for the past two years(Markham). My salary as it currently stands is \~90k Canadian a year. Before IBM I was a computer science student at a Canadian university, and just coasted by due to my at-the-time untreated ADHD. This resulted in me getting \~70s in all of my courses, and having 0 portfolio, next to no studying and no learning outside of class really. I was also unable to secure any coop position during university. After trying to find a job post-university, I finally managed to land a job at IBM (In which I thought was a dev role).  


# Current situation:

  
For the past year and a half, I have been so stressed at work (High stress job in general, workload piled up, ADHD) so much so that I stopped eating, drinking, had to start therapy (Which I am still doing), and so stressed that I can barely function outside of work (Can't even do dishes or chores most of the time, have to eat out all of the time. Thankfully not diagnosed with anxiety or depression). The stress is always constant to this day no matter if I get my backlog of work down or not. This has caused me to take a ton of sick days for mental health, get extremely rusty in my programming related skills, and falling WAY behind my peers in terms of education and growth in my role. I don't have the mental energy to to study about the job I am in, let alone look into switching.   The job itself is stressful, where some other coworkers are stressed and one even going to the hospital for mental health reasons.


This job is killing me, but I am supporting both myself, and my girlfriend (she makes 45k currently - also looking to switch jobs). With that I have managed to JUST finish building a 6 month emergency fund for the both of us (High I know, but looking at the situation I think its justified). I am falling so far behind at work, taking constant sick days and never improving at my role as well as forgetting more and more about what I learned from university.  


Just recently I have been contacted on LinkedIn for the first time from recruiters from Microsoft and Amazon about joining them. I am absolutely stuck. In one hand, I don't know if just therapy and keeping at work will resolve the issue, and continue to do my current job until I can eventually branch out (If, I don't get fired by then). In the other, I have 0 professional experience and have no clue on what jobs I would even like (Either at a Dev role at IBM, or another company). I also heard through some friends that the Big N are just as stressful, if not more, but I am unsure if that kind of dev workload I would be able to handle vs a support type role. That and being essentially unable to just leave and study, and having no time to study day-to-day. I also know that my manager has the potential to block a transfer to a new team if I am not doing well enough at my current role, some co-workers in dev at IBM told me that they were blocked sometimes for a year or two.  


I am spiraling  out of control, and I have no clue what to do. My job is killing me but I need to stay in a higher income role to support myself and my GF. I am too burnt out to study and catch back up at my current role, let alone study to switch jobs either internally at IBM or to another company. I do not have the skill set currently to just switch now as I was not a good student and most concepts/programming knowledge has gotten lost/extremely rusty. As well as having 0 professional experience in Comp Sci other than in my current role of two years. I read the posts in the wiki regarding burnout, and I really do like my managers and the job can be interesting/fun SOMETIMES its just I am at a loss here still.   


# TL;DR

  
Very stressed at current job, too burnt out to enhance any skills, not much professional experience, and rusty at the skill set I do have. Not sure what my best options are. The three options I have come up with are:  
1. Keep my current role, and work with my therapist. Continue trying to catch back up if possible (So far, 1.5 years with no luck)  
2. Switch to another IBM position internally  
3. Start applying to other companies (Big N potentially)  


Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated",2022-02-03 23:07:32

Like the title says I've been failing some resume screens for Canadian jobs at places like Intel and Amazon direct through their websites. Haven't heard much back yet from my US applications but I'm not holding out given the failures here.  

&nbsp;

I'm just not sure what I'm doing wrong? I've posted my resume to the CSCareerQuestions resume review thread and the only major feedback I managed to get was to remove my summary of qualifications. On the other hand I've heard conflicting feedback on this point. In fact this exact style of resume is what got me into this career being self taught with a relatively good response rate ~2 years back. I usually word the summary based on the wording from the job posting (this is an example from the latest job I applied to) tying it back to my experience.

&nbsp;

Or maybe it's something else entirely? The Canadian market is this intense? The order is wrong? My resume is off in some other way? I'd really appreciate any honest feedback.",2021-09-22 20:28:42
pafonf,Toronto CS job advice,"Hello guys I graduated last summer from university of Toronto with math major and CS minor, I have done 300+ leetcode questions in total over the years, 194 mediums and 38 hards. I have written most of my codes in python, only one Cs project using Java and I learned HTML js , css and react recently by myself. I have no intern or coop experience at all and all my projects written in python are kinds like scripts that do simple analysis on stock returns on my simple strategies. 
One project that is a bit complicated is a go game program that I wrote with pygame but with shit ui. I also have some degree of knowledge of database language such as sql but I could write difficult queries, I have not yet learnt many sql functions except the basic ones such as count, avg.

For js I can do leetcode with it never built a website with it before but I’m planning to. 

For CSS I know the basic ones, have not touched transitions and animations at all. Hope I won’t be touching it in the future cause I’m not an art person.

I have no knowledge on backend at all, but would learn node js or django.

For leetcode, I haven’t practiced for a while now, the last time I did leetcode was like one month ago. I did 2 weekly contests, I can do the first two with easy but struggle to come up with optimal solution for the third and fourth

My plan are as follows:
Learn more about Java through oracles;
Follow YouTube video to recreat couple websites using react;

Redo famous leetcode mediums and hards;

Build my own website using the tools I mentioned above.

So my question is how confident should I be after I have done above? Cause right now I have zero confident in my skill set for the job market. And I have no  idea how much am I worth to employers.

nz1ieg,Canadian software development contracts how to?,"What is everyone's experience with contract roles and how to do it all in Canada?

From what I understand you need to incorporate, and get an hst number.

You bill out your hours worked, money enters the company account.

You can buy equipment, etc with the company and you're not using up your personal post tax money.

Then it makes sense to get some of the money into your own personal pocket with being taxed at least as possible, otherwise a full-time job could be more lucrative.

From what I gathered a good plan is pay yourself $46,000, then dividend out weekly from the company.

Also during the first half of the year you have to pay both employer and employee cpp contributions.

For example, this company does have a Canadian office, but the position is working for the US-based team. I am hearing anecdotes of people who are able to do this due to covid and some of the companies more willing to hire remote positions. If that is the case, what is the compensation like? Especially, if you are working directly on the US team. It only seems fair that you'd get the second option below.

Cases: The same position in Denver, CO has comp range of $120k-$150k USD.

2. Do you ask for the exchanged rate of \~$145k - $180k CAD?

I know that languages dont decide these salaries and companies do but still, if this is true, it might help saying something about the companies who choose .net


Dont get me wrong I like .net and working with it is fun, also I know its more important to be a good programmer and have a solid foundation instead of following the next thing but as a junior developer I want to look at future opportunities both in salary+ job opportunities wise.

And (from what I saw) there seems to be more demand for java devs and some people/surveys say that their salaries seems to be a little higher, I usually looked into java since I used it in university and familiar with it.

There are resources who claim the opposite too but I saw the first case more than the second.

So I got a few questions.

1- do you think there is a difference in salaries of .net developers and java developers?

2- do you think .net is rising in demand and usage (+job opportunities)?

3-should I consider switching your java while I dont have a lot of experience on .net or keep going with .net?

Thank you all for reading. Looking forward to hear about your opinions!",2023-12-03 15:21:58

166mjh0,Feeling misled/catfished at my new position. Looking for guidance/advice/to vent,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

I applied to this company that was accepting 2 year contracts for interns. It was lowkey tough to get into but I got selected for a placement. Not my first choice when I was applying but the market is tough and I did want something new to kickstart my career.

I got placed into a team where I would be working with Java, JS, Python and a bunch of cool stacks on all these different projects - which all seemed dope to me. A few months ago I met my mentor ahead of time who told me he was lead of the infrastructure/deployment team which sounded really sick and DevOps is something I want to get good with.

Fast forward to now. I recently started and I've found out that I'm pretty much not going to be working with any of those stacks or languages because the main project we work on is developed using some proprietary, older tech that only needs infrequent maintenance (no new features really). On top of that, my mentor has now been switched out from the infrastructure dev to the lead Business Analyst and I've been told I'll be shifting over to the BA team bc the development side doesn't have much work for me - so now I have no idea if I'll ever even learn the DevOps stuff. All I've pretty much worked on is some Excel spreadsheets and training for reporting.

I'm feeling pretty upset ngl. Not to hate on BA's but it's absolutely not for me. If I wanted to work as a BA I would've applied to a BA position (which I did not). I don't really know how to proceed - I am an intern so I feel like I shouldn't be putting up a stink this early. But I also don't want to sink my career and passion for the field. I worry this will harm my willingness to apply myself. Looking for some advice.",2023-08-31 20:47:02
15uydbu,Indian consultant/recruiter agencies: are they scams?,"Hi all,

I was let go 3 months and still job hunting. 

I am contacted daily by Indian recruiters about job contracts. They seem to be contracts for actual companies (e.g banks, Bell) but I’ve been told that often times they are just trying to collect information on you and the position isn’t real. And I’ve been really put off by some even texting me when I fail to pick up.

15e8ttf,What is the point of networking if you’re asked to apply online anyway?,"I reached out to a few recruiters, previous co-op employers, friends and family working in various companies and whoever is in my network for new grad or entry-level to mid-level open positions and almost everyone has asked me to find an appropriate position on the career site and apply. Am I asking them the wrong questions or are they misunderstanding me?

I want my resume to be looked at by a human. I’m pretty confident if a recruiter sees it, they will likely want to schedule an interview. But everyone simply asks me to apply online which I’m already doing or already did. One of them at least sent a referral invite (but it went to the company’s career page again).

I’ve been doing this since February-March (I expect to graduate next month) and any recruiter or contact I talk to simply says “You have an impressive resume, apply on our career site”.  I do that and get no response, making ‘networking’ seem pointless. The other response is usually “we don’t have open positions for your role currently”. One person actually reached out and told that I was overqualified for a data engineering position (I would have taken it).

I am really not sure what to do. I’ve only reached out to people who liked me in the past and who I was helpful before. But most of them seem dismissive and plain unhelpful. Am I doing something wrong? Or is it just bad luck? Or cover for something they don’t want to share (not a good resume, no opportunities available, problem with race/disability/immigration status)? I’ve got my resume and LinkedIn profile reviewed by multiple career centre staff members and I’ve only had to make minor changes. They say my resume is good and I shouldn’t have problems getting a good job.",2023-07-31 07:11:07

14iv05d,ML Engineer: Stay in Norway or return to Canada?,"I have 2YOE and a master's in statistics. I work for a small-medium stable ""startup"" in Oslo and was recently promoted to team lead for ML.

I grew up in a small town in NW Ontario, but lived in Alberta for four years before leaving to Norway for studying and working. 

The work is fine, but after 4 years in Norway I'm debating a return to Canada to be closer to friends and family. The social culture here is tough to adapt to. I miss the NHL. 

How is the machine learning scene in the ""smaller"" cities? My preferences tip more towards Edmonton, Calgary and Winnipeg than Vancouver Toronto and Montreal. I'd be happy to stay in modeling or even switch to a more MLOps-focused role, and honestly would ever be interested in a more general dev role. I just want to continue to be paid well to code. 

Is it possible to have a comparable quality of life with a similar position in Canada? 

Some more context:

-I make about $95k CAD total compensation, but that keeps dropping because the kroner is tanking

-I pay about $1600 CAD a month for rent, all-in

-I don't drive here because the public transit is legendary, but I kind of miss driving culture. I grew up behind the wheel like every small town Canadian lad

-I'll miss the five weeks of paid vacation, but I have to use two to three of them for visiting family anyways. And my company is counterintuitvely against the grain with the whole ""work-life-balance"" thing in Norway, tech in general seems to be at odds with the Norwegian work culture... I don't know if this is sustainable long term",2023-06-25 19:34:05

I'm eyeballing other careers where I can get some use out of my existing C++ knowledge, or alternatively ramp up to 'good enough for someone to pay for me to do this' level in some other language.

Questions:
-Where (other than embedded, high frequency trading, or games/entertainment media) is C++ even used?
-Of those, which places are reasonably going to be trying to fill junior positions?
-Alternatively, what other careers are ones I could pivot to? Webdev seems like the obvious one, but also clogged right now(between remote work and the tech layoffs lately).

I should note I'm not *super* concerned about maximizing my income - I've got a minimum threshold, but I *was* going to be okay with a gamedev salary, so obviously I'm not shooting for the moon there.",2023-04-25 11:31:57

11yzarl,Deposit required for recruiter and general recruiting questions.," I'm a recent graduate who due to financial pressure had to go straight into a trade (guaranteed job) after graduation. However, I wish to obviously utilize my degree and pursue a career in tech. Though due to work and other responsibilities, I've been left with little free-time to balance searching for jobs, working on projects and studying leetcode type interview questions.

I was reached out to by a recruiter on LinkedIn working for ""SunnyFuture Career"" recruiting agency based in Canada (I'm Canadian). I am extremely ignorant of all things related to working with a recruiter so I wish to ask a couple questions and potentially find answers from people who have.

Firstly, while nothing specifically stood out to me, it seems a little weird to be reached out to by a recruiter via LinkedIn direct message. When I have my resume and contact information readily available on my profile. Is my caution warranted or is this standard, as previously the only direct messaging I've received was obvious scams.

Second, the recruiter and contract state that an initial deposit of $200 is required with a month of salary due in payments after a job offer is received. From what i've gathered recruiters generally charge \~15% of one's salary so this seems reasonable. And the deposit while expensive given my current situation seems like a reasonable payment structure for a recruiting agency.

Lastly, I would like to hear about any positive experiences from other (preferably Canadian) agencies anyone has worked with to successfully land them a job.",2023-03-22 22:33:27

vxrvr8,Full Stack Dev that is forced to work on Automation Test,"Hey guys, I am full stack developer working for a big consulting company. I have about 1 YOE. My base salary is around 60k CAD.

Recently the client isn't happy with my performance (which I completely disagree and many co-workers can vouch for me) so the manager put me in the automation team since they noticed I am good at that (automation with selenium). They didn't give me any feedback until it was too late and their decision was set and stone. I know I can grow in there because a lot of dev (including me) needs more practice on testing. But I could potentially stay on this project for 3+ months, which is not the full stack dev path I had hoped for.

My manager is looking for another mandate for me, but no promises on how long I will stay on my current mandate. It will take at least 6 weeks for sure (so starting September). I heard people not having a mandate for 6 months (worst case). Other colleague might have priority for a new mandate over me, because they've never been to one compared to me.

Should I consider other offerings? I also have to pay a penalty if I do leave, because of a contract that I signed (7k CAD) that gave me free training. I will never sign a contract like that in the future. I know I can get offers for around 75-80k CAD right now.",2022-07-13 02:09:20

vf2aao,"Rejected from coop, entering my third year. Scared.","Hey all. Just looking for some advice from my fellow canadians.

I had a rough first semester at Uni making my GPA was too low, and I couldn't do co-op. I'm now entering what will effectively be my third year, and I'm very scared. I feel completely screwed and like it isn't possible for me to get any work experience before I graduate, and I understand how hard it is to get new grad without any experience (in a market of people who all completed multiple work terms through co-op). 

I'm working on projects on my own time, leetcode, etc. I'm trying to get more involved. I'm doing everything I think I can do, but nothing feels like it will be okay. It eats me up inside every day. I feel like every listing I see says co-op, co-op, co-op or is for a US based role that I can't apply for. 

I can delay my graduation up to 2 years by taking semesters off/lowering my courseload. I think this is probably what I will do if I can't pull anything for this academic year or next summer.

I don't know, I'm just so scared and I want to hear from others. Should I delay graduation? Should I just drop out and take a trade? I love Computer Science and I've always wanted to do SWE and build things, but it seems like I've failed before I've started.",2022-06-18 09:07:36

Had a small portfolio with a react project and some other small JS pages that I did in class, nothing too crazy but found a job that I've been at a couple of months. 

My company is not tech centric and I primarily work with my boss. The codebase is quite dated with jquery, php etc. I am looking to switch but afraid of how much more react/JS I need to know before even applying.

I understand this might be a good starting salary though based on my limited experience but I'm afraid I'll become unhireable if I stay here too long and I need to be in a junior developer role in an actual software development setting with git, testing etc so I can actually apply to software dev roles in the future.

160awoc,Should I risk my job that I like for a chance at career advancement?,"Edit: To be clear this is not an immigration question. Both jobs are hybrid in Toronto Canada. 


The situation;
I'm working at the moment with 1.5 YOE at a big 5 bank. A recruiter earlier reached out to me for an interview, and I have made it to the final round of interviews at a large American investment firm. 

I'm trying to decide, if I do manage to receive the offer, if this current job climate is right for taking this sort of role. 

For context;

TC:
My current TC ~90K but my manager has said he will be recommending me for promotion. This is 85k base 5k bonus. 

The TC at the fund will be significantly higher at 125k; 110k base with a potential 15k bonus depending on the funds performance and mine. And the pay bump from Junior to a higher level is more significant than at the bank.

However, my main concern aside from the factors listed below is the prospect of being let go prior to obtaining 3 yoe. I am somewhat unfamiliar with SWE roles at hedge funds but I imagine they are volatile based on the firms performance. Big banks historically have very stable positions and my position at the moment seems very secure. 

The 3 YOE will make it possible for me to be comfortably in the intermediate developer range and is also necessary for me to work in America in the future. Both will significantly improve my hireability. 

**more info**
The work;

What I love about my current job is the autonomy and breadth. We create internal tools used by developers and I've gotten the chance to work with a lot of tech and build a lot of cool things. Aside from my awesome coworkers this is the favorite aspect of my job. 

At the fund, I'm going to be working on a variety of trading systems in a much more focused back end role. They seem to have a more rigorous engineering team and the work seems challenging and interesting. Building trading systems that deal with immense throughput and concurrency challenges seems like it would stretch my skills as an engineer even more than my current job.

Work life balance;
My current job wlb is basically perfect. Aside from when there is the occasional delivery sprint or production issue, overtime work is completely up to me. They are also really liberal with time off and understanding of life situations. 

At the fund, based on my research online, a common criticism is that you are expected to work a lot more. Many engineers have commented about having to work weekends consistently and an overall aggressive work culture. Also based on online reviews it seems many people have commented about a toxic work culture in teams, and political challenges working with traders as SWE. 

I already have a personality that is oriented towards working hard (evenings, weekends), and the bank gives me the flexibility to do that without the pressure of expecting it.",2023-08-24 19:01:37

14dh9nq,When is it time to move on?,"I’ve been a web developer a little over 2 years and I’m seriously questioning my abilities, competency, and mental health to the point of moving on from this field entirely.

I have a diploma but no CS degree which may be part of the problem. During the past 2 years I’ve only ever held jobs at agencies working with WordPress the majority of the time. I’ve been laid off (currently employed now), switched companies, etc. but I’ve had the same nagging feelings at all of them. 

If I’m being brutally honest with myself, I’m not that good. I struggle with basic functionality and tech, I take too long to finish tasks, and  I feel mostly lost with how things should work. I even struggle to write or even read code sometimes, and end up relying on ChatGPT to help me. WordPress to me seems pretty low on the scale of difficulty and is certainly much, much less complex than many of the technologies I see mentioned here. WP and a few other CMS platforms cover the entirety of my professional experience. If I’m struggling with these platforms I’m certain I’d perform poorly outside of a CMS domain.

I haven’t had any toxic experiences with managers or bosses and I’ve never been talked to about any lack performance (yet) so I don’t think it’s the people. It might be the agency environment overall (I’ve had regular experiences with things such as minimal testing/QA and a lot of tight deadlines/work). I’ve tried to dig into React/Typescript several times in an attempt to transition but I’m getting burnt out to the point where I don’t even want to look at code at the end of the work day.

My mental health is certainly suffering and I need to speak to someone for help. Irritability, anxiety, and obsessing over (code) problems outside of work have become a regular occurrence. The long hours I spend trying to figure out things probably doesn’t help either. I’m getting to the point where I can’t even enjoy my weekend anymore because I’m focused on what comes on Monday.

This may not be the best place to be asking, but has anyone transitioned out of development? Maybe to an adjacent field (Design/UX, project management, etc) or left the field entirely? I’m not sure how much longer I can do this job.",2023-06-19 15:11:09

uylid9,Anyone here done WITCH?," 

I graduated 2 months ago from UTSC for bsc of science, software engineering (technically I graduate in june since thats when the graduation is held). I have no professional experience. Yes I know I'm dumb for not taking advantage of uni.

I been applying non-stop for 6 months (even while still in school) I had about 4 technical interviews which IMO I did well in all of them (sorry if this sounds cocky not my intention they were just very easy that anyone even in 1st year cs should be able to do ).  Sadly, The company didn't want to move forward with someone with no experience or they probably found someone with a better portfolio. 

I'm now trying to do WITCH companies. My first choice, Revature. I was close to signing with them...

For those that don't know revature offers 45k for 1st year and 60k for 2nd year and you're paid minimum wage while in training / the time taken for them finding you work. You have to pay 36k if you choose to leave within the 2 years (the reason I'm not signing). For the record, I'm perfectly fine with the salary in fact im willing to work minimum wage just to get experience, I'm just afraid to sign a contract that has such a large leave rate like \~36k (my entire student loans totals 16k so more than double that).

So basically, I'm just searching for a WITCH-like company that isn't oppressive like revature..",2022-05-27 00:19:27

t58x05,Should I negotiate starting salary?,"Hello! :) I'm graduating this year and just received my first full-time job offer and I'm wondering if it's a net benefit to me to negotiate my starting salary. I know you're already screaming in your head ""YES YES and YES"" but please hear me out, I've found lots of similar posts but I feel my situation is a bit unique due to my personal connections to the company...

So I'm going to school in Ottawa, Canada and graduating from undergrad CS in April. I interned with a local startup last summer and had a wonderful experience, the work was very interesting and the people / work environment was awesome. Just today I received a full-time job offer letter over email from them (full-stack software developer position starting in May, 63.7k CAD base salary, run-of-the-mill benefits, working hours and in-person vs remote is flexible & up to me) which I am super thrilled about.

I plan to accept the offer, but I'm unsure of whether negotiating for a slightly higher salary is worth it even though it seems like a good idea at face value. Obviously I would love more compensation (who wouldn't!) but some factors are holding me back:

\- (unique (?) to my personal circumstances) They have been truly awesome to me, taking a chance on me with my internship last year, which was my first one. I aspire to be a competitive athlete in biathlon and they kindly agreed to sponsor me for $750 this year to help cover some of my travel expenses, and are offering flexible work hours to accommodate this. Since it's a small startup, I also got the chance to know everyone at the company VERY well and I'm on very friendly terms with all the employees, including the higher-ups who sent me the offer. Is it worth risking being on good terms with everyone just for a potential few extra k? Also,

\- I don't currently have any other job offers for leverage, nor do I anticipate receiving any in the short term

\- This is my very first full-time offer/position and if I'm being completely honest, I don't know what I'm worth at this point (is 63.7k CAD good??)

\- I have never needed to formally negotiate for anything before (would it be done over email since they sent the offer that way, should I offer to call them, etc)

\- The fear that they will rescind the offer (unlikely) or have a long-term tainted view of me after giving what they think is a fair offer

\- The fear that if I were to ask for a higher salary and get it, that my performance 6 months / 1 year down the line may not reflect this higher salary and make them question my worth

Maybe I'm overthinking this and just anxious about heading off into the ""real world"", but I really want to make the best informed decision here since it could have an impact on my entire future career. Please let me know your thoughts on the situation, I would be grateful a million times over for your help and perspective! I'm really looking forward to jumping into industry :)",2022-03-02 20:07:25

sfzh68,Previous startup is sketch with equity after I left,"So about last fall I left a startup based in Canada after working there for 2+ years because of the terrible engineering culture, being overworked, and low pay. It was good for my career because it was my first real dev position and I was able to build and learn a lot so thats where the value really came through. After about 2 years though I felt capped and because of the low pay (65k CAD) i knew i had to leave for greener pastures with everyone saying it was hot for mid levels. I ended up taking that advice and started to interview prep while also going to my boss and explaining to him why I deserved a raise to at least 110k CAD so I can be at market rate. Obviously i knew this was a stretch but based on there answer i knew what direction id be going. So they ended up raising me to 80k and provided a 1 year plan where i could slowly increment my pay by hitting some big targets. After seeing what those targets were, which were kind of senior levelish stuff i was like i could also just dip and make way more doing the same stuff. Being early in my career i know i need to start making the $$$ now so i can retire early. I spent the next month hardcore interviewing and just barely meeting my sprint goals and landed  job with \~150% pay increase doing the same kind of stuff. Im obviously much happier now at a place where the ppl are more fun, work is more exciting, and im being paid my worth.

Now before i left my previous company i had about 0.6% of the company in vested stock options. I asked how i could exercise them and the CEO said he’d follow up because he didnt know how and needs to talk to the lawyers. They also expire after 60 days (which i had to ask for) and ever since I left he never provided me with a way. I kept asking him week after week to remind him and he’d just say hes busy or the lawyers are working on it. When it was close to 60 days i asked for an extension which he gave in an email and have needed to ask for another one (its about 70 days now).

199aufk,"Recommended preparation for job searching in software development, Southern Ontario/ Remote?","Heyo,

I was hoping to get a couple of pointers on how I can prepare for job searching, and make myself look like a desirable candidate for junior-mid level development positions.

I have \~2 years of experience centring mostly on full stack web development with a focus particularly in Python based frameworks and technologies (Flask, Django). All of these positions were found through my universities co-op program, so think internship/junior level responsibilities. Now that I'm on my own though, I'm floundering and don't really know where to direct my focus in order to look like a good candidate and land a role.

Background: I graduated from Toronto Met (f.k.a Ryerson U) with a bachelors in compsci in 2022, and kept on a role where I was working as a part time contractor from June 2022 - March 2023. Unfortunately, I had severe burnout from undiagnosed ADHD and ended up leaving my position to attempt to pursue a career switch to UX Design before really understanding why I felt the way I did. Post therapy + ADHD meds, I feel super ready, mentally healthy, and motivated to pick up work as a developer again, but I'm in a position where I don't feel I have much to show except for my previous experience. Basically, no portfolio, no side projects, and I feel a bit rusty on my concepts generally.

I'd really appreciate insight into how I can get back up to speed and look like a desirable candidate within this market.

What I'm currently either working on, or thinking to work on:

* Developing a personal portfolio website + blog. I'm working on something within the MERN stack.
* Practicing coding challenges, I started looking at the NeetCode 150 challenge set to brush up on algorithms and data structures
* Side projects I am thinking of: would love to explore shaders, I love design and art - the space has a lot of opportunity to combine those interests with CS concepts & code
* Applying to positions, mostly on LinkedIn so far.

I would love a few pointers with the following specifically:

* How would you approach preparing yourself if you were in my position?
* Do you have any recommendations for quality resources that detail ideas for side projects?
* Know of the job boards to focus on within the Southern Ontario / Remote dev market? Also, any recommended search terms for finding various software development roles, particularly geared towards the junior level?
* Just general tidbits of advice?

I really appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read through all of this, I'd love some pointers. Thanks <3",2024-01-17 23:13:19

17s3qb5,Timing to switch job,"Given the current market and economy, do you think the timing is appropriate to switch jobs?

In context, I work for an american multinational company that pays above the average salary for my field of expertise (embedded) and for the number of years of experience I have in my province, but recently they did a sudden layoffs and bonuses have been entirely cut. Employees are overall depressed by the situation. The company is not doing badly financially, it mostly seems like a move to make the company financially attractive to investors and potential buyers. I am not sure what will happen in the future but work/life balance is very good overall.

I don't hate my job, maybe a bit boring but overall my current colleagues are nice and my boss, even though non-technical, cares for us and tries to shield us as much as possible from the typical corporate bullshit. I am critical to a project so I don't believe my job is at risk right now, but you never know.

I recently got an offer form a smaller consulting company where some friends and colleagues work at and it seems like a nice place. They are willing to offer 10-15% higher than my current total compensation at the cost of essentially no insurance, which my current company fully pays for me and my GF.

My problem is given the market tech market seems to be narrowing a lot and the financial outlook in North America does not look too great. I feel like moving to a consulting company as a newcomer is a gamble as if things go sour financially, I will one of the firsts in the list to get slashed.

I am not in a bad spot financially, but I still a mortgage and my GF job outlook is not good currently.

17r2sj0,How much do you trust Glassdoor ratings? (and/or help me decide whether I take this offer),"tl;dr I'm considering job hopping, new company has a much better Glassdoor rating than my current company but I don't know how much to trust it. Jobs seem very similar otherwise.

Full story: I'm a 6 YOE frontend dev in a low/mid COL city. I've been at my current job for 3 years, not FAANG but a big enough company. Comp/team/WLB are all good. Remote, flexible hours, not many meetings. It would be a dream, except the company is making a lot of decisions I disagree with both in business and in operations and the eng culture is rapidly declining. It's still a chill job but I feel no ownership. Just hacking shit into a terrible codebase to make features that feel pointless but sound good to shareholders - and half the time the project is cancelled near completion because some higher-up gets a bad tea leaf reading or whatever the equivalent is for the investor class. I can't complain about my day to day life but I have no pride in my work at all. Also, as with everywhere, the company had layoffs and handled them terribly.

I've been casually applying for jobs for the past few months and have an offer from a late stage startup. It would be a ""lateral move"" because the comp is similar (base salary slightly lower, equity much higher but they aren't public yet). So that's fine. Team seems fine, the product is fine... everything's just kinda mid? The engineering culture seems better from what I could gather but you never know what it's truly like until you're inside. I was gonna pass and wait for something I'm truly excited for, but I decided to try to gather some more data first.

On Glassdoor, both companies are sitting at a pretty average 3.5. But then if you filter to see only reviews by engineers, my current company drops to a 3.1 (thousands of reviews) whereas the new company goes up to a 4.6 (hundreds of reviews) and a 100% CEO approval. That's... a very high rating.

I just don't know how much to trust that. I know there's some astroturfing on Glassdoor but across hundreds of reviews over several years seems unlikely. Also the fact that the main average is low but the eng rating is high makes it feel less likely to be faked.

Anyway. Any thoughts are welcome. Some people (including some of my closest friends/family) think I'm crazy for even considering changing jobs because my current position is so cushy, but also I don't have other friends in tech and I feel like I need perspectives from other people in this line of work. Obviously all of my friends who work in healthcare or restaurants or whatever are telling me to cling to this job for as long as I can. Assuming no more layoffs I could probably just coast here for many more years...",2023-11-09 02:31:44
17ewl2i,Seeking advice/options on junior folks getting higher than my base ctc.,"Hello folks !! 

TL;DR : Juniors and others in lower designations who are in contract(I'm a FTE) seem to be getting paid more than my base pay and I feel like I've been disrespected and seeking advice on potential next steps.

I'm here seeking advice and some information around my situation which I don't know if this is right forum. If so I apologize and do let me know and I'll move this to the more apt forum 

Context : I'm working at a medium tech company in BC. My total ctc right now 180k(150k base + 20% variable bonus) with 9YOE. I'll be completing 1 yr at the company in a few months. The company doesn't usually employ new folks as a FTE, unless they really like someone, so when I got interviewed and was looking for other opportunities they offered me a FTE. In my division, from BC, I'm probably the only person who's an FTE in a development role (ignoring architects, managers and above ). My immediate manager is also on contract, I don't report to him, I officially report to the division head/manager.


I don't know if this pay range is in a good ranger or not. I've considered this as a decent pay range, which with the current rising cost might not particularly be decent. But I'd probably like to know about this as well.

Right, so I'm a senior engineer and a team lead in a high visibility role among other 3 similar teams to revamp their current systems to bring in more revenue for the company next year. I have about 6 devs who I over see for most implementations, i primarily design solutions working with my architect and pick up complex pieces of the design and implement them. I'm enjoying the work, no complaints there as I get to work and say in many aspects. The people I work seniors and juniors with are also pretty nice and awesome. Never had any issues. 

I had a mid year review and my base was increased to 156k so now, my total ctc is around 187k. Naturally other folks also got a few raised even though their on contract. Because I've got a nice relationship with others, a junior of mine, confided in me to get a better rate pay for her and that is what has caused my uneasiness with this. She's some who joined a few months after me, in fact I took her technical interview for the team. 

Her total pay with her current rate(actual in hand rate, not the rate which includes her contract company pay) is about $80 (it was $78 before the increase). Assuming there are 260 working days in BC, the total pay she gets is 166k. Which is above my base. And she also confided that the reason she wants more is cause another person is currently getting $85. This other person is not on my team but in one of the other teams and I also had taken the tech interview. So $85 equates to 176k which is now close to my total ctc. He too is on a similar position to her and at a lower designation than me.

I'm absolutely livid at this. I met my division head and indicated I'm not happy with my current pay. I did not communicate my knowledge of the other pays that's being handing out but bluffed that I have another potential opportunity that has come up. To which he just mentioned oh well that's the current market and some generic words in the terms of it would sad to see you leave.

Now this would make total sense, if I wasn't performing upto the mark and I've only been doing an okay job. And here is where I'm super pissed. I've been recognized in the past 6months as one 2 outstanding performers in my division. My manager and architect have been consistently communicating that I've been doing way above what has been expected and better than 95% of the folks (My project manager and architect have been at the company for over 3 years). I've received nothing but praise. I've even been mentioned by the vp of technology of the company in his bi monthly email to the whole technology team around the globe for an outstanding job for one of the recent solutions that has gone live( which i partially designed; implemented the complex pieces) and have had zero bugs and downtime.

I'm just flabbergasted at my situation and this turn of events. So what do you folks advice I do ? I honestly feel betrayed, disrespected and disappointed with all of these and I cannot make sense of it. Is this a FTE vs Contract thing which is the norm or out of the norm ?

I know the first option is to seek out another opportunity. Which honestly I've started to grind leetcode again today. I don't consider myself genius and a hardcore DS expert to grid into the complex DS questions or into the big tech companies. But I suppose I'd need to grind and try if I'd need a substantial raise. But I'm not convinced on the working environment like my current company or my previous company which were amazing and best in my career so far.


Another issue is my bonus pay comes only in March, so I'll be losing out on the 30k. I've been told by other FTEs they've always got the 20% and at times 30% outside of the contracted 20% as well. So I don't want to lose out even 10k in this economy. 

I apologize for the lengthy post and I also realize I'm a bit selfish as I know a lot of folks on here are actually looking to get some opportunities than currently having nothing. I truly sympathize with you and I know I'm being selfish about my venting around this.

Thank you for your patience if you've read this ! And Apologies for typo's and if what I've tried to communicate has been way too lengthy and messy.",2023-10-23 22:06:48
17bmh3v,Is it worth sticking with a non-dev job in a big company and switch later or look for a new job?,"Hi Everyone,  
Thanks for reading! I graduated in June in my computer science bachelors and have started working at a company in September. It's a big company. It's also a great company! I got the job through a recruiter that reached out to me on liknkedin that I ended up meeting at an event. I never sent out tons of CVs on linkedin or messaged recruiters, just did that. I'm very grateful for that don't get me wrong.  
  
I was burned out while getting the job during my last school sem and I wasn't able to express my interest in programming as much as I should have, so I settled for any job the recruiter handed to me. It also did mention c++ and some other languages in the job description, so I wasn't too concerned. I had 2 web development internships, and also had a computer science associate's degree before pursuing my bachelors, so I had a big portfolio of projects and an internship beforehand.  
  
My co-workersand manager are nice, salary is a little above average, things are mostly good! The only downside is the job has nothing to do with development, which I was very excited to do and I felt like I really improved my skills over the past couple years. I really miss it. Not having a dev job after 6-7 years of schooling, tons and tons of projects, and doing 2 internships really bums me out. I would do it as a hobby but I already have other things that take up my time (sport and creative outlet). Everytime I talk to my manager I do tell him that I want to be a developer so he knows that.  
  
The job is basically software support that has to troubleshoot problems that customers have with one of the products our company makes. It mainly involves communicating on jira, and reading very large manuals to edit giant config files with what the customer needs. It's quite niche and let's just say if I did that job for a year I don't expect it to make an impression, or enhance my dev skills.  
  
However, the company is giant and does have dev roles pop up all the time. I have two people I went to schools with that also just got hired there as devs, and I'm extremely jealous. I'm afraid to reach out to other departments and ask because I don't want my manager to find out.  
  
There is a silver lining to this though. Apparently, in a few months, I could be a developer in the same team helping to work on an internal tool that helps automate our job. Obviously, before that I have to learn to do the job itself first.  
  
The question for me right now is do I tough out the job and stay until I can perform the dev work, do I reach out to other departments nicely and ask if I can work in them instead, or do I reach out to my connections and apply at other companies to start being a dev sooner and maybe even get paid more?  
  
tl;dr: 6-7 years in school for 2 degrees and tons of projects, 2 dev internships, only landed non dev job in big company with lots of dev jobs. In few months can transition to dev role in team. Not happy about current task, but management and team are nice. Do I wait a few months, try transitioning internally, or find another job to be dev right away?  
  
Thanks a ton for your help!",2023-10-19 15:56:39

I have been only applying to internships and fulltime positions for software, research and data (analyst/engineer/science) positions at any company I see in Canada (some in US). 0 OAs and follow-ups besides those one-way interviews or behavioural surveys.  

I talked to some of my friends that has graduated and is working in tech mentioned that it might be my degree (econ major at a mediocre school) that is holding me back especially during this market. Lately, I started applying to hackathons/networking events to see if I can make some connections at these events. Is there anything else that you guys have tried and found to be effective?

Should I change my field or stick to embedded?","I am an engineer from Hong Kong, I have a master's degree in Electronic Engineering, with 2YoE in embedded engineering with C. but I also have experience with Python. I have done a lot of other Python projects in my spare time: editing audio and video, writing scripts, and working on a GUI for my company. My goal is to find work in Toronto, and if not Toronto, then Ottawa or Vancouver.

My question may be trickier here, as my need to relocate makes me less desirable than local candidates. I am currently living with my aunt in Taiwan and would like to find a job before I move. [I have already applied for an OWP(Open Work Permit) and received the letter of introduction](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/open-work-permit-hong-kong-recent-graduates.html), so visas won't be a problem.

My questions are:

* Should I relocate first to improve my job prospects? Or should I find a job first, as it's harder to find housing in Canada without a job?
* Should I look for embedded jobs or entry level Python positions as there are more opportunities for backend/DS/ML engineers? I haven't found many embedded jobs. (This is also down to personal preference, I really don't want to work with embedded systems again. The SW tooling is terrible, most embedded code bases have abysmal standards, and the pay is low).

Linkedin search hasn't been useful, when I search for Python jobs I get a lot of unrelated tech jobs like Kafka and Golang. What should I be doing on Linkedin?

13hmo9m,Am I being PIPd? New grad almost 6 months into my new job (on 6 months probation),"Working as a backend dev at a job I really dislike (barely feels like software development at times. I barely touch actual code). I’m learning absolutely nothing and I need to leave asap, I just took it since I got laid off from my dream job. Been here 5 months, on probation. All I’ve heard so far on my monthly performance reviews is, great job, keep it up, no complaints etc. suddenly, I was told at my latest review, “you’re very enthusiastic, you get your work done very fast (it’s the only feedback I receive, that I’m very fast with finishing my tickets, and how impressed people are with how fast I am). But I’m lacking in critical thinking and independence, and I might get my probation extended by 6 months. Is this a PIP? Should I look for another job?

From my end, there is some truth to that. I have needed some hand holding, but I’ve certainly gotten better over the last few months. I wasn’t pushing myself extremely hard or working late hours, etc because all I’ve gotten were positive reviews. I assumed that although I needed help, it was within the appropriate amount that new grads need.

Some background information about me:

\- I am domestic, so I am very fortunate about my circumstances compared to those who are international

\- I am approaching my mid-twenties

\- I am in Toronto area

\- I have completed 2 years of university at a program not completely related to CS (science related)

\- I cannot go back to said university due to low GPA(lol)

\- I do have a little bit of software experience as I did have to take a computer science class in university 

I am relearning my computer science class from university in the mean time while working the dead end job I'm currently at right now, so hopefully that should help warm things up before I go back to school.

11ajiyd,Contractor vs FAANG FTE,"Hi there,

I am a FTE at a FAANG in Canada making about 135k per year TC. 

Recently have been chatting with a recruiter from a contracting agency who offered me interviews for a few roles which he said pay 85-90 per hour so 170-180k per year. 

The pay bump is very tempting. Also knowing I will get the cash every month and not have to wait for stocks to vest or worry about trying to hit the top end of my annual bonus range sounds nice.

My use of benefits is usually just a few dental checkups per year.

I guess maybe the saturation only applies at entry level. But most people cant rise above entry level if they cant find a job due to the high demand. 

Is it more beneficial to learn a low level programming like C or go more in depth into backend with Java or Go? Would I be more employable?

I lucked out a year after graduation and have two years of experience working in DevOps with Azure, the caveat being I didn't end up doing much and just did sysadmin work for the most part. The only reason I took this position was it was the first place to give me an offer after a year of searching.

I want to get into dev and made some react projects here and there to understand more of full-stack development and utilizing hooks for state management. In the end I took a chance and joined a remote position at a US start-up doing full stack with React,Node, and MySQL; this position ended up lasting 3 months. I was hired on the basis I would be trained and not thrown into the fire right away but that all ended up being a lie (startup life am I right?). I finished the big feature they wanted and suddenly I'm let go because ""Your manager isn't happy with your progress"". Nothing was ever discussed about my lack of performance and I'm left to assume it's just an excuse to let me go. 

Over the past year I've interviewed a lot for various types of web development positions and even actually passed some technical interviews only to be met with ""Sorry we can't extend an offer we need someone more senior"" FIVE times. I'm not sure if I'm unlucky or what, I have no interest in ever going back to DevOps as I don't enjoy it and have always wanted to get into development but I can't seem to break out into a dev position in Vancouver or even in Canada.

zj3dka,Transitioning from Public to Private Sector As a Sr. Developer,"I have been a Public Sector employee since graduation - got lucky with a summer placement that became a full-time job. In the last 8 years I've moved from support analyst (3 years) to technology project developer (2 years), to technology project specialist (3.5 years). I make just north of 6 figures.

I am not a project manager. Basically, due to the government generally being under-resourced, I:

* Gather requirements.
* Document business processes
* Architect solution (data model diagrams, design diagrams, mock-ups, etc.)
* Design / Develop UI
* Develop full-stack applications (front and back end) - including DB as well
* Integrate with existing enterprise systems
* Work with / outsource specific requirements to consultant partners
* Facilitate all testing
* Roll out releases
* Debug and support
* And more...

Basically, I do everything technology-related except specific project management documentation and designing accompanying reports (although I provide queries and data sources for these). I love what I do.

**The problem is:** I am relatively young and am capped out at my current salary (highly regulated in the government) unless I go into project management - which I don't want to do. This is why I'm looking at Private sector. 

I am worried my experience doesn't map well to specific job postings in private, as I sort of did everything myself, whereas private sector has dedicated roles for many of these jobs. When I look at these more specific roles, they seem to pay less than what I'm getting. I also feel I would be pigeon-holing myself by taking a role like this.

Does anyone have advice on how to make this leap, and leverage my experience to get the best possible salary? What roles would be the best fit? Which roles would have the best career progression opportunities for someone who always wants to be close to the actual code?

Lastly, are the salaries posted on indeed accurate? They all seem depressingly low.",2022-12-11 18:41:43

I always dismissed them because I thought it was sort of like a "" \_\_\_ for dummies "" service. As in, it was meant for people who wanted to put in absolutely no effort themselves and didn't know how to format letters or do basic tasks.

But off late I'm starting to think that I'm not as competent as I think I am. As in, there's something seriously wrong with my approach and I don't know what it is. Because I get the feeling that as soon as companies see my application or profile, they want to distance themselves as far away from me as possible.

Think about how you'd react if you set up a business meeting at a huge company and someone showed up in flip flops and a one piece swimsuit. You would see that as an immediate red flag right?

yam726,This seems sketchy to me," For context, I'm a recent graduate in Vancouver with an EE degree. However, most of my co-ops have been in web dev with mainly react as well as some mobile development for a final year project course.

Recently, I applied to a job on glassdoor for what was titled a full stack developer position for a start up. The salary range they listed was 35-45k a year for 20-25 hours per week with the option of full time. They didn't seem to ask for much in terms of years of experience, and most of the skills I had seemed transferable, so I thought I'd apply. During my first pre-screening interview, I didn't think I had answered questions very great and the vibe I got was that the interviewer wasn't very impressed with my experience. Fast forward a week later, I was surprised to receive an email to do a technical interview. Again, during the interview, I was grilled and I felt my solutions to the coding portion were very mediocre, I guess I explained my thought process and what I was trying to do well enough. Needless to say, I was surprised to get an offer.

Upon examining my offer letter and email, they claimed they had a 2 month long probation period, as I would expect with most companies. However, what seemed odd to me was that they had said in the offer that full time salary was ""offered upon completion of the probationary period with the specific amount determined by job performance"". Which I interpret as not being paid during that period. I reached out for clarification upon this probation period and they had told me the probation period was ""back paid"". Meaning that at the end of the period, I would be compensated for the period worked in a salary range they gave me of 38-68k. However they never explicitly wrote these numbers in the contract and I'd essentially be working without pay for 2 months.

I'd like to gain experience in full stack development, however due to how long they've taken to reply to emails, I had no choice but to accept a SDET offer I got the same day and I start soon. They had mentioned a weekend availability would be ok, I could not turn down the SDET role as I really need to be working right now.

svq18n,Picovoice Interview - Graphic Designer,"Today I saw Picovoice's job post again and I'd love to share my experience for your reference.

I applied for this position a few months ago. After one week I applied online, I received the **pre-screening interview** questions. Two of these questions were related to html, css, javascript; one of them was to redesign their website; one of them was to create a logo for their product. You got to choose **3 out of the 4 questions** and finish the task in one week.

I put a lot of efforts and solved the pre-screening interview questions. In order to make the widget fully functional (web development question), I pushed myself to learn deeper javascript beyond basic html, css, javascript. They replied after **one week**, and told me I got to the second visual on-site interview with the CEO and the engineers there. It was **THREE HOURS** long and they tested my skills again. 

I got declined after this interview due to my gap in the web development. I completely understand that but I feel they could have done the second interview before I had spent one week on the pre-screening design and development. I felt my time wan't respected. Maybe in their opinion, their 3 hours are more valuable comparing to my one week. Just a heads up, they expected one graphic designer to finish **the load of work** of one front-end web developer **+** one UX/UI designer **+** one graphic designer. It is quite common in a start-up company though.

You'll see the **same job posts** every month/ every few months. Overall, my thoughts and feelings are very subjective. Please feel free to make your own judgement. I just wish I had read through the Glassdoor interview reviews first.",2022-02-18 19:19:54

\- I'm about to graduate from a good Canadian uni in April with a CS and Statistics double major.  
\- I have two 4 month internships from 2017 and 2018 and one 16 month fullstack internship from 2022-2023.  
\- I've built and deployed a small fullstack ML project that visualizes different regression models.  
\- I've been applying to about 15-20 jobs (entry level and new grad SWE) per week since the new year, revised my resume many times, and am still getting no interviews.  
\- I spend a good amount of time on each job application, as I try to write good cover letters and tune my resume for each application. I'm also spending a good amount of time on leetcode. This takes a significant amount of time and effort each week, and I can't help but feel that I could have better used this time to upskill and work on new projects.  
\- I am privileged as I can live with my parents for the foreseeable future and don't have an immediate need for a full time income.  
\- I'm considering making one of my ideas into a small startup. I'm not well connected enough and likely won't be lucky enough for it to become really big, but I'm hoping to at least be able to make a few hundred dollars a month with my limited marketing expertise.  
**Question:**  
Should I put job applications on the backburner for a year or so, and commit full-time to this idea? I can make a small company out of it and ""hire"" some of my friends. I can then put my ""company"" on linkedin and use my experience as a founder as work experience on my resume.  
This feels like a more constructive use of my time, as I would better spot in terms of work experience once the job market settles. **Is this a viable strategy?** I'm confident that I can build and market something useful, and even if this startup ""fails"" it can fill the work experience gap until I find a job.  
Any advice is appreciated!!",2024-02-18 19:47:28
19b41ne,"React vs Angular, frontend framework of choice for COOP","Hey everyone, I am looking for a co-op this coming summer and fall, and I would like to ask which one I should focus more on.

I researched on Indeed, React has around 400 jobs in Ontario, and Angular around 300, I like Angular more, but I do see companies like Kinaxis and Nokia use React.

From your experience and opinion which is better than the other in terms of job/co-op hunting?

Thank you for sharing!

Update: 

Thank you everyone for sharing their thoughts, I am still torn between React and Angular, I know React got more jobs, but I feel Angular the battery included is so powerful, I am very comfortable with Svelte already so state management is not new to me, and I did have experience with React, I will still give myself a try with React and build something simple, especially React, Redux project.

To be honest, the components, passing data between parent and children are the easy part, the **hard part,** and my most frustrated part with React was the state management. I am by no means a good frontend developer yet, but I just feel the **state management** is the ***hardest*** part of frontend, and I do feel Svelte and Angular have upper hand because they have an official way to do it. 

With that said, I will spend an afternoon do a quick tutorial with React and pick one, to be honest, I am trying to get a co-op position, I am much rather being master of one than Jack of all trades. My goal is to focus on Java development (Spring boot mainly) and I would like to be a backend centric developer, and I hope to use a mature, stable Frontend Framework to be my go to frontend solution.

Again, thank you so much for sharing your thoughts, I will figure it out and pick one of them, or just make 2 projects 1 with Angular, and another with NextJs with the same Spring Boot backend! who knows?

179el0z,Just laid off from my job and thinking about next steps,"I'm suspiciously calm about this situation. I'm just calculating the next steps here.

I have 5 years of experience as a full-stack developer. That was 2 in a mid-size start-up (first job, didn't know how much I could ask for so I was underpaid), 1 in a large corporate (which paid pretty well but I didn't particularly like) and 2 in a new startup (the one I just got laid off from). I mostly worked with Node and some front end frameworks. Honestly I don't know how much I can expect from my next job in the current state of the market and I have no idea where my capabilities rank among people with similar experience. For that reason I've also had problem asking for a raise. So I think I need some guidance on how to proceed.

The rest of this post might be out of the scope for this sub - I'm also considering not finding a regular full-time job for a while. I can live on my savings for at least 6 to 8 months, and I'm working on my first indie game project to sell on Steam (not in a popular genre so I'm not expecting to turn a huge profit) and I can probably look for some contract work from established studios as a sole-proprietorship in the meantime. At the end of the day being an indie game developer is the career path I actually want to be on. I know it's hard, which is why I've always had a regular dev job while doing that on the side. But I've been losing a lot of sleep and frequently forgetting to have my regular meals when I had to do both. So if at all possible I do not want to rush back into that situation again (which is probably why I'm calm about the layoff). But I'm also worried I wouldn't be able to catch up with the current state of the tech stack if I come back to a regular dev job a year later.",2023-10-16 19:36:45
16ryqlr,"Need advice on if I should pursue AWS certification, and which one? For a better role career wise.","Hi there,

I have been planning for a little while to get some AWS certification to pursue my growing interest on cloud computing and hoping to land a better job and with a better pay. I am currently studying for the Cloud Practitioner exam and after that I am planning to do Solution Architect certification in the future.

I currently work as a Web Dev for the government for a little over 1.5 years and have a base pay of about 68K excluding bonuses. Current stack includes JS, TS, PHP, XAMP, Oracle and SQL DBMS, GIT and GITLab, Framework Laravel, Vue, React.

I have been working in this role fresh after graduating university and did a 8 months Software Developer coop before that. This job was a blessing in the unstable job market and I was comfortable, work life balance is quite literally amazing! Until now, I feel like I am not challenged enough. And getting too comfortable and quite frankly bored sometimes, also by industry standards around I am earning pretty less. Which making me think to change roles in the near future. 

Met with a friend who is also a web dev this weekend who works in a different city, is currently undergoing his AWS Developer Associate certification and has been promised a pay bump from 80 to 98K next year (he has a bit over 4 years of experience in the field). He has been encouraging me to look into AWS for a while now and talked about the ever growing cloud computing platform and its advantages. 

I started learning and studying for the certification a little over a month ago and have some questions:  


1. After the Cloud Practitioner cert. which certificate should I pursue given my experience and knowledge in web development?
2. Is AWS certs worth it and continue? Or should I continue with other front/backend certs offered by Oracle, Meta etc.
3. Is AWS certified professionals in demand or are a very saturated role? 
4. Any other role or certification I can pursue if AWS is not a good fit given my experience?

Thanks in advance guys!

15qye5k,How to become an efficient and talented programmer,"Okay here’s the thing. My journey in software development has been extremely rewarding and intuitive. I’m currently going into my fourth year as a comp sci major and I’m currently on an internship in a fintech startup. I’m a software developer intern and I’ve been doing extremely promising work. We hired new full time devs and I’ve been helping them learn and debug too. I’m developing a project, in collaboration with the stakeholders, catering to their requirements. We’re a small team so everyone does their own thing, fixes their own issues so as an intern I try my best to not reach out to senior devs with programming questions unless direly needed. 

I’ve also been assigned another unfinished project and I’m fairly fast at wrapping my head around the codebase, understanding how it’s working, what connects to where etc (thanks to gpt 4).  So my question to the senior/experienced developers is - how does one become an extremely good software developer ? I want to reach my potential so that after my degree is done I can land a FAANG level job. I’ve been studying for az900 cert to add to my Arsenal. I’ve also been contemplating contributing to open source projects so I can master the process of understanding a large scale codebase fairly fast. How and what should I study to become proficient and efficient in coding.

Also, I am genuinely unsure of the subfield I wanna pursue as a career. I love software development as full stack  as it is fun and allows for creativity. However, I’ve also taken a strong interest in data science/ ml engineering and cybersecurity/devops Eng. I have to dive deep into one of these (if not all) to become proficient cause I can’t be jack of all and master of none. How do I decide when I’m this indecisive because everything interests me because of my curious personality. And how do I reach my peak potential? 

Any advice and insights will be highly appreciated, thanks!!!",2023-08-14 15:48:12
15qi525,6YoE Software Engineer feeling lost. Need advice.,"Hi.

I'm looking for career advice or suggestions, maybe a different point of view, on what I should do with my career. I feel lost and have that constant feeling that I should be doing more.

I'm a software engineer, mostly backend, with 6 years of experience, 25 years old. I started working in 2017 backend dev at a software factory in Latin America, after graduating with a 2 years diploma in software development. At the same time, I was trying to get an IT bachelor's but dropped out because it was a joke, the teachers were incredibly bad, the program was outdated, and education quality in Latin America is inferior generally. My goal at the time was to move to Canada so I could get a proper CS bachelor's and work in a better market, so I focused on learning English better and moving to Canada, never stopped working, with different companies.

Finally moved to Vancouver in 2021, and started working as a software eng contractor for a gaming company, making $62/hr (120k/year). Now I'm still working as a contractor, for a fintech, making $65/hr (126k/year). I don't feel particularly motivated about the company, kind of okay with my income.  

I have always dreamed of working for big tech, and I would love to have a better income (like everyone else). In January of 2023, I started studying at SFU, with the goal of getting that CS bachelor, but it's been extremely difficult to keep up since they don't have evening classes. Also, my experience with the programming professors so far has been BAD, they just don't teach well. I feel like I learn more by buying books and reading them by myself or enrolling in some MIT online open courses. Which is what I've been doing since I can't attend the lectures. So far, C++ is the only thing that is new to me, after the two CS courses I have completed.

I know here in Vancouver we have Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, Slack, etc and their recruiters frequently reach out to me, but I never take the interview because I know I will fail them because of my lack of practice solving coding problems and system design interviews.

Some part of me wants to drop out of the bachelor's, again, and dedicate all my after-work hours to preparing for big tech by myself, I feel confident I can do it and I typically understand new concepts easily, but it's hard to be consistent feeling this lost. Another part of me wants to think that getting that bachelor's (no idea how, since pausing my career is not an option) and be ""prepared"" for big tech or whatever I may decide I want after that (research maybe? idk).

I use to feel lost the most when I spend the day working on advanced backend problems related to event-driven architectures, microservices, cloud computing, etc and later that night I have to deal with my professor and TA that are giving me bad marks because I didn't use the same coding style as them, or because the TAs didn't catch they were marking all assignments based on the wrongs answers and now I have to tell them and they will need to fix grades for all students again. That happens often, and I just feel like I'm wasting my time.

15aacin,Resume Inflation among junior devs?,"What kind of experience do you expect out of a Junior FullStack dev with 1YOE? We see big words in resumes all the time, but are the interviewees able to hold that standard in interviews? And do you as an interviewer hold it against them or is it so common that you just assume the candidate is probabaly half as worth as their resume? What are some things that you like to see in junior dev resume? I try to stay humble with my resume (not that I have fancy experience, its essentially just CRUD) but that doesn't seem to be taking me far",2023-07-26 16:24:09
1548yng,Regarding jobs in Ontario / Canada,"Hey all,

I recently made a move to Canada from residency. I have 3 years experience as a Full stack developer and looking for roles here. Although, I have only been here and applying for a month and a half, I am quite baffled to be rejected for junior roles even in smaller companies (I am ready to take a hit since I am moving places). I do not have a degree in comp sci (rather in design) but have working experience.Taking all of this into consideration, I am also considering doing a course a computers diploma at Seneca, but not just sure if it's the best way to go about it.Is a comp science degree mandatory here ? I find this to be very different from the European market, where i started and they usually looked for candidates that fit well.Any suggestions, insights would be great.

14qwc9t,Thoughts on FDM Group placements in Quebec?,"Little context here. I’m a recent engineering grad with a little over a year out of university and yet to find a job in my career. I live in Northern Ontario with my parents and work at a restaurant for now. I applied for FDM (a WITCH company that makes you sign a 2 year contract and threaten you with a fine if you leave before) and stated that I’m available for relocation anywhere in Canada, and it basically boiled down to Toronto or Montreal. I know their breach of contract fine is not enforceable in Ontario but is it the same across Canada or if I get placed in Montreal will it be likely I need to stay the full 2 years?

I might get an offer soon and am weighing my options. I know im not exactly holding the best cards and a role with them could help me launch a cybersecurity or cloud career with the experience gained, both of which I’m interested in pursuing. On top of that the market in Canada isn’t really helping.

What are your thoughts? Did anyone sign with them in Montreal and what was your experience? I’m at a very low point in my life and maybe this is my only way out but I would rather not get stuck with them for 2 years considering the salary.",2023-07-05 01:10:23

120yqox,"BA Graduate , seeking advice","Hello /r/cscareerquestionsCAD

I’m a BA graduate with a arts degree that hasn’t gotten me great job prospects. I’ve been working and saving money and taking an introduction to python 100 day bootcamp by Angela Yu on Udemy. 

I feel like due to the incredible WLB and TC, I would love to learn CS and hopefully graduate and get a job with a BSc in CS. 

A few questions - I have several options that I’ve been weighing and I’d like to get some advice on what to do. I didn’t do too well in HS so I’m currently looking into fulfilling my HS math and science prerequisite courses with https://www.ilc.org/

- Get a standard 4 year BSc at a commuter school (York and Ryerson would work) as I live in Markham and cannot move. 

The pros here are that I get a solid education with decent co-op. The cons are that it’d take me 4-5 years to graduate - leaving me with nothing but a BSc at age 29. 

-Do a online postbacc in 2 years at Algoma University accelerated program or Oregon State University post bacc. 

This would cut down the time it would take me to achieve a BSc however the co-op opportunities wouldn’t be as great and I’ve heard that the teaching / help you get from these programs is nowhere near the material you’d get from a real 4 year program. 

-Bootcamp/Self teaching 
This is probably the option I would least like to do just because its supposedly really hard to find a job in todays market with ATLEAST a bachelors degree. I also question my self ability to self teach and also stay motivated and on track. 

Any advice in terms of what I should do between those 3 options or anecdotal stories of success in Tech from a career transition would be extremely helpful for me. Its been rough in the job market and I am really just seeking a better career WLB and TC wise. Even if it means sacrificing my life for the next couple of years in order to study and become proficient at coding.

Thanks so much in advance /r/cscareerquestionsCAD",2023-03-24 21:08:28
11kx0xc,Seeking advice on navigating a career path in the industry,"I am currently facing a dilemma in my career path in the IT industry. Although I am on the verge of completing a two year Computer Programming Diploma at a public college and have studied a variety of programming languages such as C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Phyton and DBMS using Oracle SQL, I am still uncertain which direction to pursue.

I find web development to be a bit tedious as I struggle with design elements and tend to spend a lot of time on CSS. I have also tried learning React and Next.js, but it has left me feeling more confused than before. Moreover more and more people are joining this field so I am uncertain of it's future.

While I have finished studying C++, I find some of the more complex aspects to be challenging and feel frustrated while solving problems.

I couldn't give enough time to Python as it wasn't included in my coursework. I have completed only the fundamentals which were easier for me to learn because I knew C++ already.

I found Database to be straightforward, but I haven't dived deep into it yet. So I am not sure if I should shift my focus towards it.

As I prepare for upcoming co-op opportunities I am struggling to select my domain and build projects to prove my skills, I am unsure which path to take.

I am hoping to gain clarity and explore my options further, as I value finding a fulfilling career that aligns with my interests and strengths. Any guidance or insights would be greatly appreciated.",2023-03-07 11:40:30
11db2hc,Working At a Startup,"I have been offered a position at a start-up by one of the entrepreneur clubs at my University. It is very small (Basically a group of 20+ people from all different majors bringing different skills to make this application/business come to life) I will not get paid for this position but I get to do it during coursework which is nice since I don’t have to take time off or wait until spring/summer like a conventional internship would make me do.

So I guess my Questions Are

1. Should I put this experience on my resume/LinkedIn? (I will be using lots of very relevant technologies and modern tech stacks as well as be very involved in the development life cycle)

2. Is startup experience valuable or even considered as actual software engineering experience or at least equivalent to an internship?

3. How exactly do you explain a startup to future recruiters/hiring managers do they like to hear this kind of experience? Or is it better left out of the conversation/resume

4. It is a very dedicated team and I think that it has potential to go far but what if I’m the future the start up fails, will my experience not count if the startup ceases to exist?",2023-02-27 12:48:44

10wf9i3,Is A Speech Impediment A Deal Breaker?,"Some time back I applied for a software role at a tech company and got accepted for the first round. They told me that they can schedule an interview ASAP. When I was listing my availability, I also requested accommodations for the interview process - Extra time because I have a speech impediment (a stutter).

Ever since I made this request, I feel like they've been acting strange. It took almost a week to even confirm a date for the first interview. Then just 3 days before the interview, they tell me that the managers are considering cutting roles (and this was one of them), so they cancelled the interview.

I can't help but think that this happened because I told them about my stutter. Firstly why did it even take so long to schedule the first interview? In the past, a first interview was scheduled in just a day or two.

Did they think that I might not be able to do the job because I'm not efficient at verbal communication? I've always thought that it wouldn't be a big deal in software because so much of the communication happens through document writing, emails and apps like Slack? After all its not a public speaking role or even a phone related role (like tech support).

Or were they worried about causing controversy regarding the legality of how disabilities are factored in during the interview process (in Canadian law) and didn't want to take me further because of potential problems?",2023-02-07 22:30:03

Edit#1: Thanks for all the comments, it really helps gain perspective. I understand the oversaturation at entry level and the current layoffs is creating a highly competitive market.

* Behavioral questions such as ""tell me a time when"" (this one I know what to expect)
* A link to a google coding contest
* Understand high scale architecture

So I don't exactly know what to expect, because from other redditors, they seemed to have a 30min phone call explaining their OA and a few behavioral questions.

**If you have already submitted your salary in previous threads, your data was already input** so no need to submit it again.

Note that **there is now an option for remote US positions**. I have noticed there were positions placed under the location that are actually remote US. US positions pay more just due to our conversion rate alone, which skew location data.

I input and sanitized as much as I could, but there were some inputs I have not yet sanitized. I also added some new questions, so not all the data is input.

I am not a big fan of the way Google Forms chooses to display results, so I'm working on better visualizing the data, but you can view the results as it is presented. I'm really, truly sorry it is so terrible to view.

uyt3o0,Job prospects for new grads with no co-op experience?,"I’m graduating in June and have started applying for jobs frequently with little success. Throughout my degree I was dealing with other issues and I did very little outside of school in terms of personal projects, but I did my best to keep my grades up and I will be graduating with a 3.7 GPA. During the coop application period I unfortunately also missed my deadlines and was not able to secure any internships, so I’m graduating with no experience.

I’m currently grinding LC and sending out as many applications as I can. Other than this what should my plan be in order to secure experience? Should I aim for internships (Are there a lot of internships available for new grads? I tried searching but most of them are aimed for coop). What are the chances that I will be taken on for a junior position?

ub8jy0,Do tech companies in Canada treat software engineers/developers as first class citizens?,"Hey r/cscareerquestionsCAD

Recently I've been on the job hunt again and I've looking to apply at companies that I've compiled as places I would like to work for over the years. Going over the list I noticed one thing in particular, most of the companies I wanted to work for are US based companies. 

This got me to think why so? I mean of course pay from US based companies are obviously much higher but I think really it's just a side effect of something else I noticed. Most of the companies I had on my list treated software engineers as first class citizens. What do I mean by this? Well engineers are basically treated with the utmost respect in the company and is reflected by their pay, perks and benefits. 

A personal anecdote, I've interned for multiple companies in undergrad, both Canada and US. I found that the tech companies I worked in the US treated me better with better mentorship, projects, pay and benefits compared to my time in companies in Canada.

That being said what do you all think? And please list down some tech companies you think that treat engineers/developers as first class citizens so I take a look and add them to my list lol.",2022-04-25 00:37:08

Here is my current progress:

Leetcode: (Started about 2 months ago — 30 easy 15 medium 1 hard) currently going through 16 patterns from [educative.io](https://educative.io) Planning to work on Blind 75 after this.

JS, HTML, CSS: Going through materials on [javascript.io](https://javascript.io) to really understand the core concepts. I am quite comfortable with HTML and CSS. Also, am working on problems from [BFE.dev](https://BFE.dev) whenever I have time.

React: I am confident about its concepts and application as I am using React at my workplace. Occasionally read materials about optimization technique, component structure, state management and etc. I am trying to use my work hours to brush up on my skills around technologies on demand (E.g. Typescript, TDD)

I graduated from CEGEP (college in Quebec) and received my DEC in 2018 in a 3 year technical computer science program. My school sent me to an internship at a company in Longueuil who offered me a job and I accepted.

I've been at the same company nearly 4 years doing full stack development using Java, JSF, and Postgres. I'm currently paid 63k which I feel is severely low and I want to find something much higher paying this year. I also feel like the stack I'm familiar with is really limiting me since it's so outdated.

My concern is my degree, which is basically one notch below a Bachelor's (I'm not sure what a DEC is equivalent to everywhere else).

For the past two years, I've also been working as a manager in a gym, and as a waiter in a restaurant. I earn much better money as a waiter, but I've kept my manager job mainly because I believe that it looks good on a resume, which could prove to be very useful for my future CS career.  
   
Lately I've been feeling pretty bored of my job as a manager (as a waiter too, but the pay is extremely good, which makes it much more bearable). Today I did calculations and if I was to drop my manager shifts (13h/week) and replace them for an equal amount of waiter shifts, on a conservative average, I would earn an extra 700$ CAD / month.  
   
I am pondering what the best choice to make is and I would like to read your advice. I could drop my manager job and earn an extra 700$ per month, which represents 12,600$ over my 1.5 remaining years as a student. The thing holding me back is that I don't know how much impact it would make for my future career to have a resume with 2 years as a manager, then solely being a waiter, compared to having a non-stop 3.5 years as a manager followed by my first CS job.

Should I apply as a generalist or frontend? Would it possible to apply as a frontend and then later on switch teams/roles assuming the company allows?

Additionally, please **REVIEW RESUME POST STANDARDS BEFORE SUBMITTING.**

# Common Resume Mistakes - READ FIRST AND FIX:

* Remove career objective paragraphs, goals and descriptions
* DO NOT put a  photo of yourself
* Experience less than 5 years, keep your experience to 1 page
* Read through [CTCI Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) to understand what makes the resume good, not necessarily the template
* Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience
* Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below) and pick STRONG action words. Do not pick weak ones - ones such as ""Worked"", ""Made"", ""Fixed"". These can all be said stronger, ""Designed"", ""Developed"", ""Implemented"", ""Integrated"", ""Improved""
* Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense
* Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. **Using an IDE is not a skill,** but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not. **VSCODE IS NOT A SKILL**. Neither are Jira and Confluence. If any non-CS person can open it up and use it, it's not a skill.
* Overloading skills - Listing every single skill, tool, IDE you've ever opened is not going to appeal to recruiters and will look like BS. Also remember that anything you list is **FAIR GAME TO TEST** and if you cannot answer that deeply about it, remove it.

First of all what in the bloody fuck, there were people who signed up new leases, who hired people to move their stuff and now we are backtracking every decision we ever made. I honestly don't understand what goes through their thick skulls. and mark my words, come January they  will look at these new developers and be like ""oh hey sorry the business is running low again due to sth and we are going to lay you guys off"" when everyone would have moved and sold their dogs off because they don't have time for themselves. Like why tf ??

second things, I honestly don't know about this but is there a union for software developers?? if there is then please let me know but if not, then why not?? why don't we as software developers unionize?? if we do then we can wield powers that can make companies pay us properly can make software standardized and make them think twice before laying us off.

Sorry but the union of software developers holds the power to protect the privacy of its union members.

I don't see why not making a union up here would be not beneficial to us. But again please feel free to correct me if I am missing sth important. I feel bad for all who got their start date delayed by the rainforest company. I hope your days ahead are fair.",2023-05-16 04:59:09

12qluho,7 YOE backend dev - should i take the QA automation job?,"Moving to Ontario canada next month and my current organisation is offering a java + selenium QA role in canada (no TC talks as of now)
I have 7+ yoe dev experience as fullstack ( java + angular) and recently backend (java + AWS)
How bad is the job market for someone like me? Should i compromise and take the QA role or take the risk it and come to canada without a job?
Also, if i do take the qa job my title will include “qa” in it. Will that be a problem when switching back to dev roles?

10sx8ec,How many technologies/tools should a Jr. Software Dev realistically know?,"Just got off an interview with a company for Jr. Software Developer position.

I have a little under 2 years of Web Development experience and have been looking for a change and new challenge recently so I applied for this position a while ago. Totally forgot about what technologies were in the job description, when I reached out to the recruiter for a copy to refresh my memory I was never provided a response. Safe to say I went into this blind.

I found the interview was going fine, asking me about my work experience and how I would approach problems, etc. Pretty simple stuff. 

Then one of the people on the call began to ask me my experience in various technologies and tooling. Again, pretty standard to ask someone this but in this particular interview I felt like the list was never ending and I felt dumb on a few occasions where I had to say I had zero experience (or never heard of it) with that particular technology or tool. (Ex. Guidewire) It honestly felt like at one point he was just throwing buzzwords at me to make me feel incompetent. He even proceeded to specifically ask me if I knew was Tomcat was at one point.

Additionally, what level of Azure expertise is expected to for a Jr? I can do a few things in Azure/DevOps, like set up pipelines, but currently in my organization we have people who’s job is dedicated to working with Azure and setting up environments and running deployments.

This is more of a rant I guess than anything. Just felt like I knew nothing after this interview. Again, I did go in very blind so that is my fault for sure.

zdn1lh,"Need advice on what to do next... 2YOE, small company, no motivation","I have almost 2.5 YOE as a full stack dev making just under 75k in Toronto (remote, but I've been living as a digital nomad in South America for a while).

The company I work for is a really small (3 devs + owner) startup and the tech stack is mediocre at best. Sure, we use Django, Typescript, React w/ Ionic, but we have the following problems:

\-no CI/CD pipeline

\-no automated testing (tests are manual, but the manual testing docs are outdated)

\- no code reviews or PRs

\-mandatory meetings are at 7pm, twice a week and go on for 1h30 (senior can only meet after hours, see below)

\-virtually no documentation (just a few outdated onenote docs)

Sure, I could show initiation and solve these problems, but I'm so demotivated that I'm not going to bother.

I work on my project by myself and we haven't gone live yet, meaning I have a tendency to get sloppy and develop lazy programming habits.

Honestly, our team is a total mess, and at this point we have so many products for such a small team (server in my boss' basement, 3 apps, networked IOT devices, web dashboards.. etc.) that I feel like I'm just maintaining someone's passion project. 

The other 2 devs are a junior and a senior dev who works full time for another company (boss' friend).

Most importantly, I feel like I'm harming my job prospects by staying here.

I have no experience with AWS, CI/CD... etc., but then again, I should be doing that in my spare time, right?

Boss keeps telling me I'm making good pay for my YOE especially considering that not everyone would allow me to live as a digital nomad.

Not sure if I'd be shooting myself in the foot if I jumped ship, considering I'm finding my job (and life) so boring and depressing, I might not have the motivation to adapt to a new company.

But then again, I might be gas lighting myself and could probably use the shake up to boost morale.

What are your thoughts on this? Is 72k good at 2.5 YOE + 1 YOE coop? 

Will I never find a job again if I continue to live as a digital nomad? 

Am I hurting my career prospects even if I was physically in Canada? I haven't learned anything new over the past 2 years... and my skills are starting to atrophy.

Thanks in advance!",2022-12-05 22:57:12

z2em3v,Should I take This Offer?,"Hey everybody, 

I'm on the fence for this offer and wonder what people think. 

Graduated from WGU with my Bachelors Comp-Sci in September. Put out \~40 applications, got one interview/offer in about a month of searching. Had to take a break searching after the first month cause my wife had our first baby!! Was happy to have found something before I became a dad, but now I'm not sure if I should go through with it. 

Thing is it is one of these consultancy places. Not FDM but similiar. They are saying 3-5 months of training with some minimal pay. I still have to interview with their clients so no gaurantee when I actually start the salary position. 

From what I can tell the training is all stuff I could learn on my own. I also don't love the terms of the 2-year contract. They say I can't look for other jobs during training, even though there is no guarantee of when they will place me. They also have some vague language about liability for damages if you break the contract, even though charging money for breaking contracts was recently ruled to be illegal in Ontario. When I do get placed there are steady raises every few months but pay starts very low around 40k. If I finsihed out the contract I'd be making like 70k by the end. 

I know its not the best deal in the world but should I take it given my situation?  (situation recap: degree from non-elite school, late-thirties career-changer with a new baby at home, general recession vibes around the industry right now). 

Do people think I could do better if I just keep applying/learning/leetcode/buidling projects on my own, or should I just run with this and see where it takes me?  

Thanks!",2022-11-23 03:55:59

After that, I start to study computer science in Canada, and I got an internship. I working there for almost one year. I used the DevOps Engineer title in my Linkedin profile since 2018. Right now, my boss told me you cannot use the Engineer term in my job title. You should have studied a computer engineering program to get this title. There is no other title (You can search in google ""What is difference between Devops Engineer and Devops Developer). 

I know they want to pay less due to my degree is not in engineering when I graduate. Also, my teammate and I are doing the same jobs, and they want to separate our hierarchy and salary for this reason. Also, my team mates wants that but I don't want that.

wlyetd,Am I screwed,"I am a current UWaterloo student with one course remaining before I graduate. Here is my backstory: 
I got into university during September 2016 for a biology program with coop, dropped the coop thinking I would want to pursue medical school and it would be best if I focused on my grades. 

Unforuantely, I ended up fucking up pretty badly dropped a lot of classes from first to fourth year and my transcript those years is just a shit show. When covid hit and everything went online I leveraged that to somehow finish my courses that I didn’t finish, this ended up costing me two extra years of my life, in a simple honours science undergrad degree. 

However, I still have one remaining elective to complete, for which I can pick anything, and I have now joined a bootcamp which runs July-Cctober at General assembly in Toronto for software engineering immersive.

I don’t know if I am trying to over achieve but I have truly changed my work ethic, removed toxic friends from my life entirely and I am trying to focus, I also had un diagnosed ADHD for which I am being treated now. I have a goal in life of getting a job in silicone valley or a tech hub in the US. My degree once it is completed will be a BSC in honours science with a minor in biology. What is the best route for me to get to the US. I am struggling to find meaning and to know if I will ever make it but I thought I would post here to get any advice.

ulacse,How can I break out of being a C++ developer?,"I graduated from Waterloo CS 5 years ago with a 3.9 GPA (converted) and every job I've had since then has been desktop application or driver development in C++. After graduating I kind of ghosted everyone and after getting in touch with friends I've found a lot of them are making 300-500k TC doing distributed systems. I've even found that some people are pulling 200 to 300k entry level in the current market.

I've noticed a trend where C++ salaries are very low with minimal benefits eg I currently make 100k CAD and have 2 weeks vacation, no sick days, no benefits, etc as a senior developer. I've seen job ads offering 150k to 200k for nodejs developers with only 1-2 years experience, and these are very small companies to boot.

I've tried sending resumes to get into entry level FAANG companies or small companies doing backend development but I've had no luck getting interviews, almost like my resume just gets tossed in the trash. Consequently, any C++ role I apply to I instantly get interviews and offers. So I know my resume isn't problematic.

Currently I've solved 150 leetcode easies, 700 leetcode mediums, and 100 leetcode hards. I'm familiar with OOP, I've studied system design, and I've gotten familiar with backend development by doing courses on Udemy and by making my own scalable microservice version of Google docs with distributed data structures using nodejs, docker, kubernetes, graphql, react, terraform, modern db's and msg queues... etc.  I've studied multiple books on microservices, distributed systems, web development, etc and I have expert knowledge of operating systems.

Given an interview, I feel like I would have a very high chance of passing a junior or senior role at a FAANG company.

What should be my next steps? How can I break out of C++ and get into more modern fields? I want to increase my compensation, but I feel like I've hit a wall and can't go any further because nobody will give me a chance. I've even tried applying to US companies stating I'm willing to move. No dice.

1abo8xk,Looking for advice for which path to take for career switch,"Hello fellow Canadian programmers.  This is going to be a long one, so please bear with me. I will post the TLDR at the end.

As the title suggests, I'm looking to make a career change. My current background is in trades (CNC machinist/CAD detailer). I live in Ontario, Canada. 30 years old, who will be working a full-time job to pay for mortgage and bills during study. Motivation for career changes is due to wanting a change in lifestyle and the career growth and satisfaction that comes with programming.

I'm aware of the current job market in tech. I'm aware of the time and effort I will have to put in, but I need a starting point. I don't want to do multiple programs or courses and be stuck in what they call ""Tutorial Hell"". I'm a slow learner, so any fast-paced university or full-time bootcamp might be difficult for me.

I will try to break it down and simplify below what my goals are and where I currently stand. I'm looking for recommendations for resources that can help me achieve my goal.

* **Career Goal: Work as a full-time Web Developer (can be front-end or back-end for starting). (The end goal is full stack.)**
* **Time frame: anywhere from 2 to 3 years; it could take longer depending on life, the job market, and the time I put in.**
* **Current Experience with code: None, 0 experience at all. I Watched the 3 crash course videos on HTML,CSS,JS** [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&list=PLillGF-RfqbYeckUaD1z6nviTp31GLTH8)**. I Haven't typed a single word of code.**

Current resources and pathways I have researched or considered. From the listing below, what gives me the safest and most straightforward path to achieving my goals listed above?

**Free bootcamps I have considered:**

* The Odin Project
* 100devs
* freeCodeCamp Curriculum
* CS50: Introduction to Computer Science from Harvard

**Paid bootcamps I have considered:**

* BrainStation - Software Engineering Bootcamp Online - $16,500CAD
* LighthouseLabs - Online Web Development - $14,000CAD
* The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp - $139.99CAD
* The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024 -$169.99CAD

Or any Canadian colleges that have a good program and has Co-op. Must be online. I'd also like to note, I'm not looking to work for google or microsoft or anything crazy, just any startup or small company would be great for starter.

So there you have it. Again, I'm aware of the time and effort I'll have to put in. I just don't want to start with X but then realise I should have started with Y. I appreciate all the feedback.

**TLDR: 30 years old, living in Ontario, Canada. Want to switch careers into web development. I want to do it in 2–3 years. 0 coding experience. From the provided resources and pathways above, which will give the safest and most straightforward career path to land a job as a web developer (front, back, full stack),.**

&#x200B;

**Final EDIT\* First and foremost, I'd like to thank everyone for providing their detailed feedback. It was really helpful in making my decision. Verdict is, after all your recommendations, I will get my feet wet by trying the CS50, odin project or any free resources first. Was recommended to learn back end software like Python and Node, and then get into front end like HTML, CSS, JS and React.js. I will continue to work in my current career looking for ways to improve and how i can implement code into it. I still have hopes 1 day I will be able to obtain a position in web dev and will work towards that, at my own pace. Thank you!**",2024-01-26 17:47:30
18zeie6,Need Career/Life Advice,"I’m in my mid 20s female from northern Ontario and work for the public service as a permanent employee making about 70-75k/year not including overtime. I’m not sure where I’m going with my career anymore, wanted to get into management and got there but still feel unsatisfied so am looking for advice. 

I’ve always been more of a technical and “tech” person, being basically the mini IT person for people I work with even though it’s not my job. Growing up I had fun using RPG maker to create a Pokémon like game, creating websites, building my own PC, etc. But never coded, just modified code as I thought I wouldn’t like it. However, in June 2023, I noticed a problem in my team’s work and had a program idea to fix it so decided to learn what I needed in VBA for MA database during my personal time and created the application including debugging in a month, unfortunately did not get picked up at work due to lots of red tape in PS but got recognized for my contribution. Since then I did CS50 to learn more about computer science in general and can confirm that im deeply interested in coding and more specifically programming (create, design, debug…), and really wished I tried/realized it sooner.

PS has CS related jobs but requires a degree as well as 2-3 years of work experience in a tech related field and I don’t have either since I joined PS fresh out of high school. Plus again lots of red tape so not sure if I’d find satisfaction.

I’m debating on leaving the PS to go to school for Computer Science at a university to later get a job in tech preferably programming but besides losing on a DB pension and all other benefits, it also means:
- I’m missing English and Calculus pre-uni credits from high school so would have to do this online prior to applying which I don’t mind.
- Move 5 hours away to go to university and rent my house in the mean time. Live with spouse’s family temporarily.
- Work somewhere else part time or most likely, not at all to focus on studies especially since I’m super interested in learning.
- Accumulate student debt.
- Dedicate 4 years of my life and graduate in summer 2028 or 2029 at almost 30 years old with no field related work experience unless I get co-ops or internships which would be my goal.

Plan would be to also work on projects, but with how competitive the CS field is right now, I feel so late to the party :(

I’ve been obsessing over looking for information online but despite the big cost and risk, I still feel stuck with making a decision. Comes to a basic question on what’s more important… working in a field of interest/love or having a job that offers good pay, benefits, overtime, paid time off, amazing pension…

Finally, I know the market is saturated right now but I’m confident that will change in a few years anyway.

Any advice/opinions would be very appreciative, thanks a bunch!

TLDR: have good job that sets me for life but don’t feel satisfied and debating returning to school for CS which I recently found deep passion for. Looking for advice and opinions.",2024-01-05 18:58:49
18unwrq,Stay in tech or go to safe job with pension?,"Currently I’m earning around 150k working in a mid-tier tech company.  I should be up for promotion in the next 12 months.  Promotion should get me around 200k assuming I hop to a similar tier tech company, which is far from a certain thing in the current job market.  
I have an offer for around 120k at an extremely stable organization.  This job comes with a DB pension of which I pay 10% of my gross salary; 25 years of service will get me 50% of the average of my 5 highest earning years indexed to inflation.  If I take this job I don’t see myself ever leaving and I don’t see my pay increasing much beyond inflation.

&#x200B;

Additional factors:

* I’ve been disciplined in saving and investing so the DB pension probably has less value to someone like me.
* Current job is stressful, I’m always 1 bad performance period away from being let go.
* Working in tech is fun, my input is taken seriously on major decisions - my experience outside of tech is that technical workers are order takers who get very little autonomy.
* I’ve seen that ageism is very real and I’m close to the stage where I’ll start to face it.
* My current benefits are much better than the offered role.

  
The 30k difference is not a lot but I feel like there’s a large opportunity cost.  120k minus pension contributions really isn’t that much anymore, and it’s roughly what I’d be stuck at for the rest of my career (plus inflation adjustments).  Taking the offer protects what I have but closes the door on higher career satisfaction, potential for early retirement, and potential to provide my child(ren) with a better start.  
I’m hoping someone who has faced a similar decision can weigh in and tell me what they did and how they feel about it.",2023-12-30 19:46:04

140hjpb,Do Canadian companies outsource tech jobs?,"It seems outsourcing is much more prevalent in US than Canada.  My company was considering outsourcing and I thought it was not a good idea. 

I see several reasons for this

- Canadian salaries are not much different from Indian salaries. For example, it is not uncommon to hear Indians in India earning 80k to 100k CAD, 150k and 200k are possible but in higher management and in large companies. 

- There is a cost to outsourcing, hiring and retaining. Cultural and language factors and time difference cause loss of productivity. Hiring talent is not easy and you need to interview more.  There are legal and accountacy costs as well. 


- Size of Canadian companies make it harder to outsource. Smaller organizations will have needs for smaller tasks. Like if you only need 10 front end developers the benefits of outsourcing doesn't outweigh the costs. You are relying your main business to outsourcing.

PS: Some people are saying Canadian salaries are higher than Indian salaries. Yes they are higher in absolute terms. But if you hire competent people you will need to pay higher salary in India too = 70% of Canadian salaries. India tech salaries have ballooned in last 7 to 8 years due to collaboration with US.  If you adjust for lack of productivity due to factors made above outsourcing to India doesn't make any sense.

He said that the third interview is more like just choosing which team I will be on. So the real interviews were mainly the first two.

However, I gave my availability for the next 5 business days and now those days have passed without an email back. I have emailed this other recruiter a new set of 5 business days to reach me but still have not received an email back.

I am unsure if this is just because she is not receiving my emails or if they just picked another candidate and are now ghosting me. Basically, I am just asking if should I email the first recruiter and ask how the process is going (He was able to see my emails for the first interview)?  If so, how should I structure the email?

10m67gc,Moving between big banks,"I’m new to the industry and I’ve read for forever that moving companies increases your compensation much faster than staying at one company.

So with that said, I’d love to hear if anyone has moved between any of the big banks, how much their compensation increased, and if it was a lateral position move or higher title.

I already know the annual raises will be very disappointing so it’s also a good way to come up with a number at the annual review that I’d be happy with. Thanks",2023-01-26 23:41:35

I have been in the role for 3 months now and I want to start to thinking about next steps in my career so I can prepare adequately..

How honest should I be? The truth is I found the work kind of boring. At times it was frustrating due to devops/IT limitations. I wasn't properly challenged. I don't like the product and frankly speaking I did not enjoy working for it.

But the company overall is nice and they paid me well. I want a callback offer from them primarily as a backup option. 

What should I tell him?

I think I did decently well but not sure if they would want me back full-time. Would being honest with my manager be in my best interests or not?
For reference, he has been a good manager I would say. He hasn't given me a reason to not rely on him. I just didn't like the work/product and struggled at times to be motivated.

wgzvmp,"Resume Review Thursdays - August 8, 2022 - Megathread","Apologies the first one was late

As this sub has grown, we have seen more and more resume review threads. Before, as a much smaller sub this wasn't a big deal, but as we are growing it's time we triage them into a megathread.

**All resume's outside of the review thread will be removed.**

Additionally, please **REVIEW RESUME POST STANDARDS** **BEFORE SUBMTITING**.

Standards:

\- Remove career objective paragraphs, goals and descriptions

\- DO NOT put a  photo of yourself

\- Experience less than 5 years, keep your experience to 1 page

\- Read through [CTCI Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) to understand what makes the resume good, not necessarily the template

\- Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience

\- Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below)

\- Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense

\- **Properly anonymize your resume or risk being doxxed**

\- Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. Using an IDE is not a skill, but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not.

I’ve read that it can be isolating when you are the only person working remotely with your SF/NYC team members working together in their respective offices. I know folx say performance review and work should remain as work regardless of remote or in-person, but I can’t help but feel it’s gonna be rough.

For example, if there is a 25 year old with 2 years of relevant experience and another candidate in their 40s who switched to SWE 2 years ago, would they automatically consider the younger person?  When does age become a factor in your opinion?

vnv1yv,Should I switch to a new company?,"Hey, I am a SWE with +3 YOE. I'd like to ask everyone's opinion about my situation.

Recently I got an offer from a US-based startup, and I felt good about passing the interview at that moment but now I am lukewarm because they are not being transparent about the deal they offer me.

For example, they said the compensation comes with 1,000 shares and I asked them what percentage of my shares will represent the company. They told me such information is not released to the level I applied for but what they can tell me is that ""it will be worth hundreds of thousands dollars one day.""

I don't actually expect to make millions of dollars from my stock options but my level of trust in the company has gone down. Also it made me think about the possibility of them being a toxic employer.

Here are brief pros and cons of staying in my current company vs joining the new company.

**The new company**

Pros

* Higher base salary (about 80% more than what I currently make)
* Interesting work

Cons

* Even smaller team size than the current one in my domain (meaning I would have to do a lot more work)
* 3 months probation period (they have the right to fire me for any reason)

**The current company**

Pros

* people are nice
* the workload is more predictable and I can spend time on looking for job searching and interview prep

Cons

* I've lost my motivation long ago.
* Many engineers in my team are constantly leaving the team. (as a result, my responsibility is slowly growing.)

I've been teaching, internationally, at IB schools for several years. I'm from Alberta, and a Canadian certified educator in BC and Alberta. A year or two back, I got an offer from my school to ""teach kids to code."" I said no problem, it seemed like it would be fun, and I would get to learn some stuff along the way. I started by combining materials on [code.org](https://code.org/), FreeCodeCamp, TheOdinProject, and CS50. I just wanted to facilitate a fun environment for kids to learn.

Then it turns out I really started to like it and started taking a slow look at actually finishing TheOdinProject myself. Between teaching and other personal endeavours it has been slower than I liked, but I feel I could finish everything up, and do so at a reasonable quality level that I would be happy with, within a few months if I just focused on it.

I'm now at the point where I want to return to Canada to be closer to my friends and family here. Honestly, teaching in Canada is a mess and teaching internationally has been getting worse for years for reasons I won't dwell on. The opportunity to go remote, into a field I enjoy, is compelling. I suppose I am just worried about taking the step where it may leave me without income for a while.

tf2vjb,SWE @ Goldman Sachs or Arista Networks?,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently in my last semester of undergrad and looking for some advice on where I should begin my career as a new grad. In the past I've interned in a variety of roles (sensor integration, embedded systems, full stack, networking etc.) and my undergrad is in Electrical Engineering but I'm trying to break into Backend development and infrastructure oriented roles.

I have offers two offers and I'll list below some of the factors at hand for comparison.

* GS
   * Salary: 90K (base) + 7.5K (relocation) + discretionary annual bonus
   * Team: Business & Regulatory Services (specifically Tax team that develops tax software)
   * Tech Stack/Tools: Java, Spring, MongoDB, Spark, Kafka, Kubernetes, some Python for scripting. Development environment is primarily on windows, servers are on the cloud running linux
   * Location: Toronto (my preferred location of the two)
* Arista Networks
   * Salary: 90K (base) + 3K (relocation) + 4K USD (stock/year) + annual bonus
   * Team: Routing Team (working on implementation of routing protocols on switches, CLI commands for configuring switches etc.)
   * Tech Stack/Tools: Go, Tacc (variation of C++ used internally), Python for writing unit/integration tests. Development environment on Linux
   * Location: Vancouver

As I was discussing with them in an interview, they brought up salary, and I was kind of unsure what I should ask for, with conversion, years experience, etc. They said to simplify it, let's talk in CAD.
For my next job I was looking for $70k/yr or higher, so I had mentioned that and their reaction seemed like I wasn't asking for a lot. After talking a bit more I mentioned, $80k/yr and they said that's fine as well without any hesitation.
I have another interview coming up with them, so if it all goes well and they give me an offer(or just for future context), should I be asking for more? How much more in your opinion?

For some context.
I have 3 years experience, currently paid $60k/yr in the game development field. If it makes a difference as well, I am a C++/C# programmer, and that's what this job would be.

-Basic projects. However, next semester will be working on developing an app which will be used by engineering students to borrow equipment from the school as part of my engineering design class.


-Decently proficient in C, C++, CSS, HTML, Java, and Python.


-General member in Queen’s Space Engineering Team (satellite sub-team) and Queen’s Website Development Club.


-Have been practicing LeetCode.


-Poor network.


-Will probably finish this semester with a 3.3/4.3 GPA (I’m not using this as an excuse for my less than stellar GPA, but my father died and I’m wondering if this is something that can be taken into consideration by employers).

188n6cu,Should I go back to school to get a CS Degree?,"Hello, so I've been programming for a little while now, and graduated from college about 7 months ago with an IT Programming Diploma  
  
I landed myself a decent job, not fully programming, but I do some programming. (Support Engineer role), and things are going well. I'm concerned however that in the future, with the state of AI, and the oversaturation of new developers, I will have a hard time in the future without a CS Degree.  
  
This diploma has courses from the university in my province from computer science, but its more-so just the practical stuff. This means I can bridge into only 2 years of Computer Science. However, as I have a job, I feel my experience will make it easier to land any other jobs in the future.

I'm 26 years old and going to be 27 in a few month and just recently applied to a few colleges (arround the GTA and a few schools in Alberta.) for computer programming related courses that have co-ops.  
I know a 4 year  CS course at a university would be the better choice overall but it's not financially feasible (will be taking osap for college in ontairo and whatever student aid alberta offers if accepted there.). 

But now that I've applied and I'm just waiting on if I'm accepted or not I'm starting to feel that maybe it's not worth it and I wont really get anything of it - A real sense of dread since I'm already a degree holder but never found my footing in said field and ended back up in retail hell (Costco) and this would be my Fourth go at college>! (dropped out twice, ""thugged it out"" for the third time to get a diploma that ended up not panning out )!<

I really enjoy web programming and started self learning with resources like:  


* CodeCademy
* FreeCodeCamp
* Udemy Courses
* Local Bootcamp>! (waste of money & time, if anyone reading this is planning on a bootcamp DON'T DO IT)!<

I've been on my Journey for about a year now and know the basics of web development (simple js, CSS,HTML,React.js and basic git version control) - Like i said i really enjoy the web aspect of it and would like to become a full stack dev or a front-end / back-end focused dev. Of course I'm interested in learning other languages like C# and python but I think i really hit it off the first time around with JS.  


But as of lately with Work at Costco picking up again i don't have as much time as I used to to build really simple projects to keep my skills sharp and I'm definitely starting to get rusty, and lose motivation to keep coding small scale projects with the limited free time I have outside of work and daily life activities.  


I'm really struggling to find out if it is it too late for me to keep this learning journey going. I've read that the co-ops is what really makes or breaks it in this field. Will the 3 year course + co-op get me at least an entry level job? Is it really worth trying to compete with young wiz kid CS grads who are already solving hard level leet code questions?

17z19x9,Pivoting to tech as a math graduate,"Hello!

I'm currently in my final year as a math student at U of T. For most of my degree I thought that I wanted to go to grad school and stay in academia, though I've recently decided that after I graduate I want to try to break into the tech industry. 

All of the coursework that I've done is in pure math - I have very little exposure to applied math. I have a pretty minimal programming background; I took a couple CS courses on Python and Java in my first two years, though I haven't used any of the skills I gained since taking those courses so I've forgotten most of what I learned.

Regarding experience, the only work experience that I have is a little over two years as a teaching assistant for first year math courses (calculus, linear algebra, intro to proofs).

I am unsure how to go about moving into tech after I graduate. Broadly speaking, what I've been told before is that I should relearn how to code and make side projects. But it's unclear to me how exactly to go about these tasks; something I've looked into is coding bootcamps, though the ones I've looked at are pretty expensive.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2023-11-19 16:48:15
17mih4r,Coop job offers and bad new grad job market,"Alright so I have 2 coop offers (better than nothing definitely), only problem is that they both have a January start date.

Coop #1 is a more Business Analyst at a bank kind of role involving PowerBI and SAP, however they were kind of vague about what my job duties would be - as they talked about some AI guidelines with me. It is nice as it is in my city. It is only 3 months however.

Coop #2 is a more Data Analyst role and a bit more technical R&D kind of thing at a phone company. However, it is in a different city, which means I will have to relocate for the coop position. It is 6-8 months however.

Also my situation is that I'll prolly be graduating during Coop #2 since it is 6-8 months long or right after Coop #1 ends. I mention this because I also am looking for new grad, however new grad job market seems to be dead, so I'd rather have a coop than nothing. Moreover, I am interested in SDE but I am having problems finding SDE coops let alone SDE new grad positions.

I'm not sure though, should I go for the longer coop because it is longer (and delay in wait for a better job market)? As for salary, it is a wash both are offering within 50 cents, one is offering 24.5 and the other 25 per hour respectively. 

Also, I need help finding new grad positions, I am clearly struggling. I do have previous coop experience too, in a more R&D position and not exactly SDE (around 12 months worth).",2023-11-03 00:36:18

151taml,Am I crazy/in the wrong here? How to navigate unprofessional and unsupportive manager,"Less than a month ago I started a new job as a at this company in Toronto. The company seems great however the department or perhaps the team I'm working on is just a mess and my boss/manager seems completely incapable of basic project management and is borderline unprofessional. On my first day I met with some people from HR and they were great! I was excited about the company up until I met my manager. Within the first 5-10 minutes of meeting he somehow was mocking one of the people on the team because they were confused about which API version to use. He was basically saying how ridiculous it was that he was blocked on that and kind of making fun of them and saying how they've been having problems with this person. Keep in my mind this was quite literally my first day on the job and I literally haven't spent more than 5-10 minutes with this manager. Why the fuck are you telling me this and I'm literally just an intern. Immediately this was the first red flag.

&#x200B;

I was also looking through the google calendar of the other new hires that i was on a call with them and HR and they all seemed to have meetings with the team and the manager and check-ups and so on and I didn't get any of that, mine didn't introduce me to shit, that was whatever tbh.

&#x200B;

I don't think the rest of what I'm about to say is as terrible as this but it still made me quite uncomfortable and unhappy with the job. This manager literally seems like he has never run a dev team ever and has absolutely no fucking clue what he's doing. First of all, no project management software like Jira or Asana or anything is being used and everything is kind of up in the air. This man just assigns 'tasks' and they talk about bugs and other issues with the software over meetings and don't even document anything. I think I've seen him try to use excel to keep track of some of this but it's just still a complete mess. Also this manager feels more like of a ""I'm in charge"" type of manager rather than a leader or a team lead or something. He always misses the team sync-ups and whenever he's not in them literally no one else in the meeting is talking, they've all got their cameras turned off and muted. He comes into the meeting and starts dictating what to do and so on.

 The tasks I've been assigned are admittedly stupid but it's fine whatever I'm an intern, sometimes I do ask for clarification because sometimes they're vague and don't make any sense but he sometimes is also incapable of providing proper explanation and often fails to give any context around what I'm doing.In addition, there's never any clear deadlines on when these tasks are due he will just keep bugging me on slack saying ""update????"" or ""send me it?"" and stuff like that. Twice did the following scenario happen and it really bugged me. So just the other day he assigned me a 'task' at 12:00 PM, I replied and said sure I will get to it. Now on that specific day we have a company town hall that we attend that goes from 12PM-12:30/12:45PM and then it's usually when I take my lunch break (we are entitled an hour lunch break and get to decide when it is). So after the town hall I take my lunch break until around 1:30-1:45 and I go ahead and so some work on my 'task', we then have a team sync-up at 2PM and when he asks me about how my tasks is going I go ahead and say what I've done, he then shares his screen and looks with what I've shared with him and is audibly dissatisfied with the fact that I haven't finished it or haven't gotten a good chunk of it done and says something along the lines of ""it's been 2 hours since I assigned you this task"" in front of the whole team. At the end of the meeting he tells everyone to leave the call and just for me to stay. He goes on how we are working for a company and we need to work 8 hours a day and how he never assigns people to do stuff after work hours and what not. I respond like brother 1st of all we had a town hall 2nd of all I took my lunch break and 3rd of all you never specified when you wanted it done. I told him if he's not happy with my work that I have done for the last 2-3 weeks then just tell me and that this is not the first company I have interned in idk why he has to tell me all that bs. This is the 2nd time something like this has happened. The way he approaches it makes it seems like I'm not doing any work at all and his tone and attitude is just extremely annoying.I just want to know if this sounds normal or if I'm crazy or somehow in the wrong. 

&#x200B;

This is not the first time I've worked in a dev team in a tech company and all my past experiences have largely been positive and the teams that I have worked with were all very friendly and supportive and I have always gotten positive feedback.I know the whole situation isn't that terrible but just kind of want to hear what people think and how I can approach this situation and what stuff I should work on. To be honest if this wasn't an internship that i desperately needed as part of my degree requirements to graduate I would have probably either asked to transfer teams or I would probably just confront the manager about my issues with him and the whole way the team is run and just quit.",2023-07-17 06:01:18

14lsejp,I had my first ever Laid-off last week. I am in a crossroads with my career path and I would like some opinions. [Thorough Post],"Hi all,

I'm in Canada. This was my first ever job out of college (Bachelor of Engineering - no PEng) and I am handling it pretty well so far. I kept my cool (I'm surprised of my stoicism), did the paper work for EI and the severance. Then I started looking into upskilling. 

**About me:** Let me step back for a bit. I studied electrical engineering, specializing in electronics. By 3rd year , my love for the traditional engineering (civil, mechanical, electrical) had died down, but I figured that I made it this far, why not keep it going and use the degree as a means of being ""seen"" by recruiters. Thankfully, I did most of my co-ops in the realm of programming, whether it be C or Python, or dealing with databases (SQL) - among other things that naturally come with it, like Jira, Git, etc. Not to brag, but 2 of those were in very well-known companies - and it really helped me secure the job that I got right out of college. 

Because my program was in electronics, my only other option was to get into software because I did not want to go back to study something else - I wanted to stay in the software realm because of previous experience. I thought that these days, studying software needs no degree and just a few online certificates and some personal projects can really help me upskill. 

My first rodeo out of college was involved with data analysis and engineering. They helped me learn about the foundations of cloud engineering and I was in the middle of earning 2 cloud certs (Azure fundamentals and AWS Foundations), when I heard the news. I had some work with clients here and there as well, but nothing went deep. The market wants pragmatism not just knowledge. Some people that joined were miles ahead of me either because they studied software or because they worked with data before. Can't control that. 

**My problem:** I am at a point where I am stuck (or at least I think I am). Today, E.I. reached out to me and said that I need to focus 90% of my time on applying for jobs and 10% on upskilling and they can audit me randomly to check. Otherwise, no money will be given. Hear me out:

A. I don't want to go back to electronics - in fact, I *hate* it (if I go back in time, I would only go for software engineering) 

B. My experience with cloud stuff is foundational and if I keep doing those certs, maybe I can be qualified enough - but it's going to take time - and I haven't experienced it fully enough to be confident in interviews 

C. While I was employed, the only time that I ever used programming was Scala.....yeah. And that means I have forgotten how to do coding interviews or side projects for the programming languages that actually matter, like Python. SQL is also something I am interested in doing. 

**Now**: I am doing 2 courses and awaiting an exam. Awaiting the Azure fundamentals cert exam. Doing the AWS course and the google cybersecurity cert course on coursera - I picked this because it promises to teach Python and SQL and then teach you how to apply it for the purposes of cybersecurity. These courses are great, but with EI breathing down on my neck, I need to apply for jobs. If I apply for jobs and fail the interview, where is the guarantee that there will be another interview ? If I keep studying, will there be government support ? What if it takes 2-3 months to study and that gap raises alarms for potential companies? 

Do you think I should go with what the government wants me to do, or should I keep doing the courses first and gain some confidence? What do you think? 

Getting laid-off didn't freak me out, but this is !",2023-06-29 02:19:13

Interview time has come around for me again (senior dev 8yoe) never used them on the job (probably won't ever) but yet I find myself learning them before the interviews again to be asked about them knowing I'll never use them. 

I get they are simple to ask but really wish interviewers would move away from these and ask more day to day tasks like design a rest API for example.

I guess this post is just a moan and also curious to see if other Devs actually use them. Tempted to just be honest in the interview and tell them I didn't learn them off for this interview as I don't ever use them.",2023-05-21 17:57:06
13f53qp,Being put on a performance improvement plan at work. I have questions.,"Hi all,  
  
I'm currently facing a difficult situation at work and I'm hoping to get some advice from the community here. I work at a startup in Canada with a small number of employees. Today, my manager informed me that I'm being put on PIP due to some issues with my work. I admit I have been slacking at my job due to a general lack of motivation. I think at some level I lost faith in the product that the company was creating, and also I was not making the compensation I hoped for. At the same time, I think I became a bit complacent living with my family, and didn't keep myself prepared for interviews to jump ship. I guess I felt I could rely on them in the worst case scenario. I'm a software engineer with about 3 years of experience and this is the first time I've been put on a PIP.  
  
I'm not sure what to do at this point. Should I put effort into the plan and try to improve my performance, or should I resign from my job and focus on preparing for interviews? I'm worried that if I put in a lot of effort into the PIP and it doesn't work out, I'll end up being fired anyway. On the other hand, if I resign now, I'll have to explain to potential employers why I left my previous job. I'm also not sure if I'm entitled to severance if I'm fired, my contract with the company is a bit vague about it.  
  
Something else I don't really know about is - if I get fired for performance reasons, does this come up in background checks that potential employers conduct? If I resign during my PIP, can the fact that I was on PIP also come up in a background check?  
  
I'd like to hear from anyone who has gone through a similar situation or has experience with PIPs. What did you do?  
  
Thanks in advance for any advice!",2023-05-12 00:23:22

Additionally, please **REVIEW RESUME POST STANDARDS BEFORE SUBMITTING.**

# Common Resume Mistakes - READ FIRST AND FIX:

* Remove career objective paragraphs, goals and descriptions
* DO NOT put a  photo of yourself
* Experience less than 5 years, keep your experience to 1 page
* Read through [CTCI Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) to understand what makes the resume good, not necessarily the template
* Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience
* Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below) and pick STRONG action words. Do not pick weak ones - ones such as ""Worked"", ""Made"", ""Fixed"". These can all be said stronger, ""Designed"", ""Developed"", ""Implemented"", ""Integrated"", ""Improved""
* Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense
* Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. **Using an IDE is not a skill,** but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not. **VSCODE IS NOT A SKILL**. Neither are Jira and Confluence. If any non-CS person can open it up and use it, it's not a skill.
* Overloading skills - Listing every single skill, tool, IDE you've ever opened is not going to appeal to recruiters and will look like BS. Also remember that anything you list is **FAIR GAME TO TEST** and if you cannot answer that deeply about it, remove it.

11js4c7,Job with no experience,"Heya everybody

So im currently in my 2nd year in cs in a 3 year program (april 2024) as an international student and i wanted to have a little guidance.

Summer is coming and unfortunately I havent contributed much to my side projects, my resume is rather empty so I don't really know if summer internships are really possible so some thoughts are stressing out that i hope to be answered:

- I want to take a gap semester, preferably after fall term to be able to apply for internships, I will use this summer I have to grind LC and projects. I dont know if this is allowed or will this affects my pgwp or not but I just want to squeeze in an internship before I graduate.

- Let say I graduate on time and applying for jobs. I don't care about the pay, I desperately need a job even if its like 30-50k cs job. How viable is this? The ultimate goal is to get a PR but I desperately need a job with my crappy resume with no internships.

197fquh,Which career path would you take?,"I'm lost.. I used to think I wanted to be a developer (worked 1 year and did a bootcamp prior) and on paper it made sense. However, the amount of joy I get from building a website isn't near the amount of suffering I go through. Also, it feels like it's not a match in terms of personality.. I'm the type that won't read documentation and just do trial and error (like im still struggling with flexbox...)  
I've always been a techie and a passionate of products in general (Apple, apps etc, I notice lots of details and use all the tips and tricks in depth..) Everytime I start a project, I'm excited for finding the perfect brand, domain name, the logo, the vision and experience our client would have. But when it gets to coding it's really hard for me to put in lots of work.

I have also worked with quite a few different tech stacks and done projects. I know that I would be easily able to fill a Jr. Dev position as I am right now and probably even be able to handle something higher.

But, I'm extremely unskilled at networking, talking to people, building connections, and selling myself. Whether it is my resume, my LinkedIn profile, or talking to people in person - I always feel like I'm being too obnoxious whenever I try to brag about myself and end up not saying about most stuff.

From what I've heard, job applications may get you stuff once you've applied to like 400 openings or something like that but it's having a good network that will guarantee good opportunities and fast.

Now I know that it's not gonna be like magic, I'll have to learn that skill just like I learned any other - but I need help on how to get started, what to learn and how to practice. Just the general roadmap if you will.

I have an arts degree (+ some CS, math, stats for beh sciences and research exp) and thinking of returning to school to pursue data analytics. The options are second degree CS programs at UBC/SFU/U of A (all with coop), data analytics diploma with internship at Langara, data analytics certificate from UFV (+ coop), CST diploma from BCIT (potential coop), or applied data analytics cert from BCIT, in that order. 

UBC BCS is the best choice program-wise, but it's also the most costly, competitive, and probably the most demanding. During my undergrad at UBC I also struggled with networking the most due to large class sizes and high competition so I wonder if getting the diploma at a college or BCIT but being able to network more easily is a tradeoff worth making given the importance of networking in finding a job in the field. Previous posts usually recommend CS due to its versatility, but is that still true if I don't see myself switching into more technical roles, or is CS overkill in that case?

I don't think it's gonna last the year which is not really a concern to me but I'm worried about how a dead no name startup looks on the resume.  


What should I do? I'm aware I can probably exaggerate the dev work on my resume for the QA job to get something better, and it's actually a pretty good company, but I'm worried about the QA.",2023-07-27 18:42:21
159f2vh,Get involved with community,"I've found that I couldn't care any less about my current job or any potential ""better"" jobs after this one because I don't give a damn about what most/all of them do. I wanted to find something that I cared about personally, hopefully to pursue in my career, but at the least, to be a project I can be a part of.

I think I'd be most interested in addressing transportation issues, housing issues, or the lack of community (imo). Would anyone have any resources I can start with or know where I can connect with others interested in the same? I know about Civic Tech Toronto and Code for Canada but haven't had much luck with that

For context, I'm a junior web dev but I am willing to pursue/learn other technologies for projects that would need it

1543r8t,How to land a FAANG COOP in BC,"I am currently starting my second year as a CS student at sfu. (Third year uni student, transferred from business to cs joint major last year).

I’m planning to land an internship for fall/spring 2024/2025 which is over a year away. 

My goal is to land an internship at Amazon but I understand the competition is rigorous and I shouldn’t expect the moon.

My question is, in the next 6-12 months what can I be doing to really boost my chances at getting an interview. Aside from personal projects what helps?

I was thinking of joining the robot soccer club, doing a 2-3 hackathons, and I am currently a peer tutor for intro cs classes at my university.
 
Would this be enough for me to land the technical interview?

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!!

14xglc3,On what basis are we judged in final face to face on site interviews,"  
As most of the time we are checked on our technical skills even before reaching on location interview phase. Then what is basically that they choose the final candidates on. Like I know there are tech questions and some companies even have different rounds only for tech and other are behavioural questions round. So my question is when a person has cleared the tech skills round then in final rounds do they only look for our soft skills, or they try to mark us on minor tech mistakes that we make throughout the whole process or they just check only years of experience. Basically what is it that we need to excel at to get the job?",2023-07-12 06:52:39
14vvi5b,Advice on CS vs Medicine in Canada,"Hello, I recently got accepted to a Canadian medical school, but I've been struggling to decide whether to attend or not. I made a post on r/premedcanada (https://www.reddit.com/r/premedcanada/comments/14u8sv1/need\_advice\_reconsidering\_med\_school/0) asking for some advice, and now I'm here to see the other side of the fence.  
  
To keep it short, I am very introverted, have a slight aversion to people, am very good at math and physics (majored in undergrad and had a high GPA), love problem-solving, enjoy leetcode (at least the easy problems that I can solve with little-to-no CS background), and I certainly wouldn't mind sitting at a computer for extended periods of time (I basically do that already). Plus, being able to work remotely and from home is a big plus.  
  
However, I am not a big fan of the job stability. Even if I worked extremely hard and got into FAANG, I wouldn't have guaranteed job security, like, ever. I wouldn't mind getting laid off in my 20s or 30s, but it might be rough when I'm 40+ and have a family to support. Also, the job market is terrible right now, which is fine since I'd need to do a second undergrad in CS (thinking UBC BCS program) and by the time I finish it might be better, but it does seem like tech is strongly connected to the overall economy, and again, is less stable than medicine. As well, in terms of meaningful impact, it seems as though most of the highest paying jobs are the least meaningful (i.e. FAANG) and most of the most meaningful jobs are low-paying. Please correct me if I am wrong here, as I'm not 100% sure if this is true.  
  
Personally, my reason to apply to med school was to become a radiologist and work on medical imaging research. Now I'm debating whether I should become a computer scientist and work on computer vision/image processing/machine learning research for AI in medical imaging. I've taken a look at a few courses and at the undergrad level I think I can handle it but the grad-level courses seem way beyond me. That might change once I get the prereqs down, but would this career path make sense? There seem to be way less jobs in this field than software engineering/web dev.  
  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2023-07-10 14:24:25

Long story short, based on how they say the market is now and and how I don't really have any work experience or impressive projects, I figure it would take me a significant amount of time from now until I land a first job. In the meantime, recently I had some sort of offer from someone I know for a generic office job. I have yet to discuss the details but for sure it's gonna have nothing to do with developing. I already have a massive amount of gap (3yr) after graduation for personal reasons which must look really bad already on my resume, and I'm not sure if I should spend as much time as possible to make my resume look better i.e. do more projects or at least have a random full time job to make money and just use my remaining free time to improve my skills. Would working such job have any negative/positive impact on my job search for tech later on? Do you think it'd just mean more gap on my resume and a mundane waste of time?

1amy2jz,Structured interview prep for senior+ level learners,"Hi there! I'm a mid-career senior developer and I'd like to feel more prepared for interviews for my next role. My experience is primarily backend supporting complex web apps. I find interviews quite intimidating so it's tough to muster the internal motivation to study after work without any structure. Is it best to just create my own roadmap and study plan, or do you know of a good book or pre prepared study plan that's suitable for mid career? I've gone through a bunch of Cracking The Coding Interview ages ago and the behavioural stuff at the beginning was useful, but the questions were more Leetcode style and missing the system level stuff I'd expect in a senior/staff level interview. Leetcode style questions are definitely part of the plan, but I need to be better about describing large scale projects I designed and handling system design questions.

I almost want something like formation.dev but for senior/staff roles, but it's not really aimed at me. I imagine it's tougher to coach senior+ level role prep because experience gets more niche as you go along and qualified instructors for the technical stuff get more expensive.

19anpgi,"FDM rejected me after assessment, not sure what to do next","FDM asked for an ‘interview’ followed by a technical assessment, both of which were extremely easy in my opinion. But then they sent me an email one day after writing the assessment saying they are unable to move forward due to my assessment results and that I may reapply after 90 days. I don’t agree with it because it was the easiest assessment of my life and I performed well above any test, answered all questions with extremely detailed explanations and examples, and I’m pretty sure everything is correct.

I was hoping this would work out in my favour. I’ve submitted almost a thousand applications over the span of 10 months and I have had no luck except for a 4 month internship role post graduation. My previous co-op employer isn’t responding to my applications there and my internship employer didn’t take me in citing budget constraints. I have networked with people extensively and have people who work in tech roles in big banks, telecom companies, insurance companies, basically everywhere and they’ve referred me (at least they told me that they have put in a word with the hiring manager) or I applied with their link they sent me but nothing has worked so far. I’m not just doing easy apply; I’m tailoring every application or at least sending an appropriate resume version (data engineering focused resume for data engineering positions, ML focused resume for machine learning engineer or AI roles, etc.) with each application. I’m even writing cover letters for applications requesting it (mostly government or university roles). I have been applying throughout Canada and the US, and even to some international roles, so I’m not really tying myself down to any place and being open to work

My FDM application was extremely desperate, my plan F backup to consider only if plans A to G failed (which they did), and I was strongly debating it because I made more money as a student and in a co-op term in 2022 than what they were offering in their SECOND year according to my CRA notice of assessment. I also have 5+ YoE, 4 research papers, a bachelor’s and a master’s in CS, many certifications, co-op and internship experience, multiple projects on my GitHub, won multiple awards, lots of leadership and volunteering experience in school and enough skills to do any sort of technology related job with ease. I also am a native English speaker and have working proficiency in French.

I’m defeated and I have no idea what to do if I’m not even able to get selected by FDM of all places. It wasn’t even any LeetCode medium or hard assessment; the questions were about stacks, arrays, inner joins and how to address an email to someone if you don’t know their salutation. I refuse to believe that I failed that assessment.

I literally don’t know what to do because I have no income anymore and no family here to fall back to. I don’t know how I’m going to pay next month’s rent or credit card bills or how I’m going to feed myself. Two degrees in CS, 5 years of work experience, 4 research papers, and yet I’m on the brink of homelessness. I even got my full driver’s license even though I only take public transportation and got a Smart Serve certificate to apply for service jobs but no luck there either.

This difficulty in getting any sort of job is completely opposite of what I experienced 2 years ago when I was applying for co-op roles. I didn’t have any publications, didn’t graduate, had less work experience, and my resume was really bad compared to the one I have now. I submitted like 30 or 40 applications, didn’t tailor my resume, skipped companies that asked for cover letters or copy-pasted some template I wrote, and probably spent a couple weeks applying and I got 5 interviews and one offer after my application cycle (probably about less than 3 weeks to get responses). I even cancelled an interview from a big bank because I already had an offer. It was the total opposite of what I’m experiencing now.

I’ll probably be looking into going back to school for a PhD or get into studying nursing, trades or trucking if I can figure out how to get a full-ride scholarship for them.

EDIT: Adding an anonymized version of a resume I am using mostly for reference: [https://imgur.com/a/r6JwV5D](https://imgur.com/a/r6jwv5d)

EDIT 2: I am mostly focusing on roles like data scientist, machine learning engineer, data engineer, and data analyst.

I am also applying for financial analyst, quantitative analyst, etc. type of positions because I have extensive experience with financial data.",2024-01-19 16:56:17
199tox1,which certifications should I pursue while job hunting: AWS or Azure?,"Hey everyone!

I'm currently on the job hunt (for full-stack roles) and am seeking some advice on certifications. A recruiter suggested that AWS certifications can give candidates an edge, particularly in consulting roles.

However, after doing some research and talking to friends working in the Big 6 and other Fortune 500 companies, I've noticed a trend towards Azure.I'm aware that my sample size is small (only 5-7 people), and I understand that once you're proficient in one cloud platform, transitioning to another can be manageable with the help of documentation. 

I'm leaning towards getting the AWS Developer Associate certification and then tackling the Cloud Resume Challenge using AWS. But before I commit, I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences, particularly in the context of the Canadian job market.

15vu25w,From Self-Taught Programmer to AI Enthusiast: My 3-Year Journey and a Dilemma,"Hey! I wanted to share my journey over the past three years, from being a newbie in the world of programming to diving deep into AI, and seek your advice on a current dilemma I'm facing. Grab a coffee, this might be a bit of a read, but I promise it's worth it!  


Background: I'm in my early twenties, living and studying in a bustling Canadian city. When the pandemic hit, I found solace in coding. What started as a side gig soon became my main hustle.  


**Year 1:** My initiation into the world of programming was filled with countless small projects. I dabbled in logical coding, data manipulation, and UI creation, getting my hands dirty with Java, Python, HTML, and CSS.  


**Year 2:** My confidence grew, and so did the complexity of my projects. I ventured into APIs, database structures, and even the web3 space, creating basic plugins for NFT marketplaces and arbitrage notifications. My first taste of the professional world was an unpaid 4-month internship with a European startup. The experience was invaluable, especially learning Agile methodologies. But, the lack of income made it unsustainable.  


**Year 3:**  With dwindling funds and juggling school, I embarked on my most ambitious project yet: a social media trend analyzer. The goal? To determine the perfect formula for viral video promotions. This project stretched my capabilities and laid a solid foundation for my skills. Just when things seemed bleak, a chance social encounter at an event landed me my first job.                                              

Over the year, I specialized in backend development, mastering AWS CDK 2.0, creating secure APIs, and honing my skills in TypeScript. I also explored frontend development with React hooks and Vue 3. But what truly captivated me was AI. From generative AI to creating AI-driven web apps like art generators and smart chatbots, I was hooked. With 65 hours a week dedicated to coding for 2 years, I've gained immense experience.

Throughout these years, my creativity and proactive approach have been my biggest assets. I've consistently pitched new features, many of which have made it to production. 

This hands-on experience has given me insights into the entire lifecycle of a feature, from ideation to deployment.

I'm currently working almost full-time for a startup. While I love the flexibility, the learning opportunities, and my colleagues, the pay is a concern. I started at $20/hr, and after a year, got a $2 raise. No stock options, no bonuses. My annual gross is $35k cad. When I look around, I see entry-level positions offering $50k-$60k. 

Given my experience and dedication, am I being shortchanged?I understand that my minor in computer science might not command a six-figure salary, but does my hands-on experience compensate for it? I'm also pursuing a business degree in IT and prepping for an AWS architect solution certification.

Is my current job undervaluing me? Should experience be a worthy substitute for formal education? I'd love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, and any advice you might have.Thanks for sticking around till the end! Cheers!",2023-08-19 22:46:05
15nfjp1,Got pipped from Rainforest. Is there a canadian version of FMLA,"Hey all,

I just got news that I'll be pipped from Rainforest. I'm wondering if there's a Canadian equivalent of FMLA and if anyone used it before, what was their experience like.

# Common Resume Mistakes - READ FIRST AND FIX:

* Remove career objective paragraphs, goals and descriptions
* DO NOT put a  photo of yourself
* Experience less than 5 years, keep your experience to 1 page
* Read through [CTCI Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) to understand what makes the resume good, not necessarily the template
* Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience
* Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below) and pick STRONG action words. Do not pick weak ones - ones such as ""Worked"", ""Made"", ""Fixed"". These can all be said stronger, ""Designed"", ""Developed"", ""Implemented"", ""Integrated"", ""Improved""
* Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense
* Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. **Using an IDE is not a skill,** but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not. **VSCODE IS NOT A SKILL**. Neither are Jira and Confluence. If any non-CS person can open it up and use it, it's not a skill.
* Overloading skills - Listing every single skill, tool, IDE you've ever opened is not going to appeal to recruiters and will look like BS. Also remember that anything you list is **FAIR GAME TO TEST** and if you cannot answer that deeply about it, remove it.

151eas2,"Got accepted for Software Eng Technology, Technician, and Soft. Eng Technology- Artificial Intelligence at Centennial College","Hello,  
I am a domestic student and recently got accepted for the above programs at Centennial. Firstly, I wanted to get accepted into a fast-track program because I am almost in my mid-20s and did not want to spend three years in school but the college rejected my application for fast-track option.

  
Now I am considering doing the Software Engineering Technician program which is 2 years and has no co-op but I was thinking of doing an internship during summer break. I was wondering if that would be an intelligent choice. 

  
I have seen a lot of people recommending staying away from non-co-op programs.   
The only reason I want to go back to school is for internships. 

  
I should also mention that I have been learning to code for 2 years. I am decent in Python and know the basics of Javascript. I have also built some projects and interviewed for a few companies including Shopify (got rejected in the last round) but then this whole recession situation happened and I stopped getting replies from companies.

  
I also have a full-time job which I cannot quit as I live on my own. So, I also wanted to ask about the coursework, study pressure, and how many days a week we have classes approximately.  
If you have other programs or college suggestions that'll suit me well, please leave them below.  
Thanks in advance!

14x7f3e,Scared about graduating with little to no work experience,"I attend York University and am enrolled in the CS program. I was trying to get a summer internship during my second year (2022-23 school year) without being in the co-op program but I was unable to get any interviews or anything despite applying to around 100-120 job postings (some of which asked if I was in a co-op program, and I said no since I wasn't at the time). Near the end of the winter semester, I figured out why my co-op application wasn't accepted initially and that was fixed for me. However, it was too late.

Now, I have been applying for fall co-ops and thought that I should have a chance now since I can say ""yes"" to the questions that ask if you are in a co-op program. But, it's the exact same as last semester. I'm currently taking 4 summer classes cuz I was hoping to keep my degree somewhat on track to make up for the lost time I would have during the fall semester with the co-op, but now I'm skeptical if I'll even manage to get a fall job.

I'm incredibly worried that I may not graduate with as much experience as I wanted. I was hoping to have a 4-month summer internship after both my second and third year, then start hunting for new grad positions during my 4th year. But as of now, I am a semester ahead and only have 3 semesters left after August, so I will likely graduate Dec 2024 instead of Apr 2025 if I don't get a job soon.

What the heck should I do? The issue is that with York, I also need to have had my first co-op before exceeding a certain amount of credits, and I need to stay a full-time student, so the fall term is literally my last chance to get a job with the co-op program. If I don't get a job, nothing happens to my degree but I won't be in the co-op program which I'm guessing would mean I would only be able to find a summer internship and even those will be difficult to get. Can anyone please advise me on what I can do? I really don't want to graduate without internship/co-op experience cuz I've heard it can be crazy hard for new grad recruiting.

I have some experience working with the MERN stack, java spring (although I kinda copied a video for my side project, but I did learn from it), and typical HTML/CSS/Javascript. I also know python but haven't built anything with it before. Any suggestions on what else I can possibly learn to be more marketable?",2023-07-11 23:38:19

13de3g4,Bootcamp grad looking for advice to determine between my current choices,"So a little about me, I went to a Bootcamp in Toronto for web dev in July last year. My primary motivation was a love of IT and personal regrets after my parents pressured me into not taking CS in uni because I wouldn't be able to compete with the smart kids. 

After finishing my STEM degree, I had considered pursuing a second degree but the career counselor at my university outright stated that I wasn't going to be able to because my degree was a science degree and no university was going to issue me a second science degree. I researched some CS and SWE programs but the ones I looked into all did not accept continuing students outright or required additional courses to be taken to be considered on a ""case by case"" basis. My father was and is still convinced I can just get accepted into a CS program somewhere at the undergraduate or master's level, and has offered to help finance it.

The bootcamp itself was actually fine, but due to personal circumstances, I haven't been able to fully invest in job searching post-bootcamp. So now I'm seven months out, with 2 undeployed PERN apps on my github, unemployed, and bleeding money from my student loan payments. 

&#x200B;

So right now I'm looking for some genuine advice: 

1. What should my current priorities be? Applying to a bunch of jobs while building projects? From what I understand, the current prospects are pretty terrible and my savings can only last 4ish months tops.
2. Is a temp agency like Altis a valid option at this point? I can deal with the pay cut but I know nothing about how long I would be contractually bound or even if they will take me.
3. As stated above, my parents have offered to finance some further education. Is this a viable option? As in, can I even get into such a program and would it help me in the long run?",2023-05-10 02:42:48

So lately I’ve been thinking of going back to school, I’m interested in business/ entrepreneurship and tech at the same time(though I don’t have any background in tech) so I’m debating between a MBA or get a undergrad degree in comp sci (since I don’t have background in comp sci, most universities won’t allow entry to master of comp sci, hence I put BSCS) 

But now, the problem is since I’m already 26, if I take the comp sci path, that’ll be another 4 years of time spend on school, by then I’ll be 30 and will be competing with a lot of younger new grads with more tech experience going into the labour market 

For the MBA path , it is great too but it lacks the tech aspect of knowledge and the future is technology, and so studying that will give me lots of advantages 

So I’m stuck between these two paths

1aq8wni,Thinking about going back to College/University to work in SE/AI during late 20s/early30s and potentially move to the US,"Hello,

Been thinking about returning to school to make a switch from UI/UX Design, this time to either college/university for a bachelor in Software Engineering.

I somewhat have ""3 YOE"" but have been unable to find a job in over a year due to today's job market.

The other getting tired of the collaborative environment and dealing with people in general and them not really knowing what they want exactly in a product. Programming would be a better way to work solo without interacting with multiple people (still but less than what a UX Designer does) and match my personality.

I (back then it was easier) was able to score interviews without much difficulty in 2021, after a couple  months of applying and interviewing was able to land a position at a consulting firm but without going into much details it was not really it and was ""laid off"" 3 months after the start date, afterwards it was still possible to get interviews however it was way harder to get hired, the main excuse was ""you don't have enough work experience"" and also because of discrimination (the short experience didn't help either). However, some recruiters from the company to which I got laid off from have reached out back on Linkedin in the last year but didn't really want to go back working at this company,

Therefore, went the freelancing way and was able to do a little project but then got laid off again in December of 2022. Ever since it's been very hard to get a position in over a year.

Which brings to the idea to potentially go back to University/college.

A little bit of a background:  
I went to a 2 year adult vocational program in Graphic Design but in all honesty it was pure shit and it turned out to be a diploma mill (I didn't know at the time despite having done some research about the school).  
During the course there was a brief introduction to HTML/CSS/BootStrap programming and found it pretty interesting in general.

The cons for not going would be this pretty much:

Financially it'd be pretty brutal to go $40k in debt for an education (if that seems to be more or less the cost for such degrees) and don't want any student loans. Could potentially get some loans and bursaries.  
Dilapidated almost all of my whole life saving on this school and cannot really afford to redo it financially.

Never been to University/College in my life and honestly it'd be really hard to go back at it when reaching your late 20s/early 30s (especially the social aspect of it). It'd be also hard to balance finance/school/social life. 

And then eventually when you graduate, you'd be unable to find a job be still told ""sorry we can't hire you, you don't have enough experience"".  Especially in today's job market and also the uncertainty around it within the foreseeable future with AI on the rise and how it will affect the job market.

Also the thing I find with universities/colleges is that they sound to be more Ponzi schemes/businesses who only want money from people rather than being learning institutions (speaking from experience).

On the other end, there are not much options and I'm stuck doing low paying jobs just to survive for now.

But one of the main reason would be to potentially move to the US temporarily on a TN visa.   
That'd be one of the main reason to attend university (if not the most important).

In the case this would have to happen, I'm just unsure which college/Uni to attend, an English school such as Concordia/McGill would be ideal or even Dawson would be ok but could consider a French Uni such a ULaval as they offer the SOEN program online/remotely  (I'm a francophone btw). Those unis sound not to be diploma mills at first but unsure if that's the case.

However there are some questions;

Is math a huge deal during this program? Never really been good at it.

How hard was that for you to balance everything together (finances/social life/ work/etc...)?

For the people who have done this in the last couple years, how was your experience? Were you able to land a job afterwards?

Do universities have US recruiters coming here and there to do some hiring?

Was it easy to get a job in the US and move there after being just a fresh graduate? 

In the meantime, I'm planning on learning programming with Codeacademy or CS500.

Thanks in advance for all the answers!",2024-02-14 00:07:15

18v350s,should I take the offer for proprietary tech? 1.5 yoe,"consulting firm, 1.5 yoe

might face layoff due to a lack of projects, I heard I will be kicked away if having no project for 4 months, so I have \~5 months before laying off.

got an offer for proprietary tech, absolutely nobody on the market uses it, but it is a solid developer role, I know someone in the company, it's just like those firms developing software products, but in a language nobody else uses.

harsh code review, strict dev process, strict tests, the practices for development look good to me.

the biggest concern is the technology they are using, is it going to be a dead end? Am I going to be useless on the market? I saw some people saying ""language is just a tool and you are still a dev"", but is it really true? I mean C experience is useful for a C++ role, and Java experience might be useful for a Python role, I can understand this part, but is it true for proprietary language?

Do you guys I should join and jump away 2 years later? (need to stay in town for another 1 year due to family issues... and not sure if HR will consider me as job hopper so 2 is a comfortable number for me to put here, advice is welcome on this as well)

I've quickly started to realize that as much as I loved learning about civil engineering at school, the job industry is completely different and I'm at most only able to tolerate it (my job is pretty chill so I don't absolutely hate it, but I by no means enjoy it or feel any fulfillment from it). I also did a 16-month co-op during school and had the same experience.  
  
One thing I've always had in mind (even in high school) was studying Computer Science. I even applied to Computer Science programs in grade 12 but ultimately decided to go into Civil Engineering instead. I took a Python course in my 1st year of civil and absolutely loved it. I've always been fascinated by tech and I am so curious to see how we advance technologically in the next 20 - 50 years. Anytime I hear anyone talking about their experience in SWE or CS either at school or at work, I always envy them and think to myself along the lines of ""oh that's sick, wish I could also have these experiences"". On the other hand, I've never ""wished"" having the same job as anyone in the civil industry, and I've talked to MANY people across many specializations.  
  
Here's my dilemma. The university I went to offers a B.A.Sc. in Computer Science as a Second Degree in only two (2) years (4 semesters), with the option of also doing co-op (the school has its own co-op board). Although the co-op option does not guarantee you a co-op job, it definitely increases your chances of finding one significantly, along with searching for one yourself. Additionally, the salary ceiling for Civil is not only extremely low, but is also a very slow climb. As opposed to CS, which has a much higher salary cap and a very fast acceleration rate from what I've heard.  
  
However, I've been following CS subreddits on here and they are flooded with posts from new grads talking about the state of the job market, how they can't find a job, how THEY are looking into making a career switch, and it's honestly been very demotivating. I can't help but think that me wanting to switch into CS is a ""grass is always greener"" situation for me (and now the grass isn't even green on the other side after reading all these posts).  
  
But since I've started working and earning/saving money, I've gotten pretty much completely immersed in planning financially for the future (just bought a car, looking into opening a HYSA for the short term future, etc...). My dad always warned me that if I ever wanted to go back to school (for a masters) that I should always do it immediately after my undergrad, because once you start getting a taste of money you'll never want to go back. I'd be going back for another undergrad, but I am feeling the root of this advice very heavily right now.  
  
The job I am at currently is a very small company with (10ish employees) so I work directly with the owner who is extremely flexible in general. Many employees have previously worked part time for him while completing their degrees, so if I were to start the CS program in September 2024, I am almost certain I could switch to part time and work whenever school is light, so the loss of income wouldn't be 100%, maybe 50% at most. But this would kill the current savings rate I'm at, and any money I'd probably make during school would go towards my car/entertainment/food etc... So I'd essentially be pausing the financial plan I've made in my head for the last 5 months.  
  
By the time I graduate from the CS program I would be 25 still living with my parents, which is fine at 25 but since I wouldn't have been saving that much idk how many more years it would take to move out. Plus, I could fully have shit luck in the CS job market and those 2 years going to school for it would have gone to waste (along with any tuition money I would have to fork out The thing is, I believe OSAP should be covering the bulk of it since I would be considered an independent student when I start, but there is no way for me to know how much I would be getting in grants until I've started the program...  
  
TLDR: I'm 23 with a Civil Engineering degree making $65k before taxes and want to switch into CS, which would take another 2 years. I could be working part time during those 2 years to cover bills, but my financial planning would be put on pause, and there's a chance I could be paying a good amount for tuition depending on OSAP... Do it, or not?  
  
Thanks in advance for your thoughts/opinions!",2023-11-27 15:42:52

All resume's outside of the review thread will be removed.

**Properly anonymize your resume or risk being doxxed**

&#x200B;

Additionally, please **REVIEW RESUME POST STANDARDS BEFORE SUBMITTING.**

# Common Resume Mistakes - READ FIRST AND FIX:

* Remove career objective paragraphs, goals and descriptions
* DO NOT put a  photo of yourself
* Experience less than 5 years, keep your experience to 1 page
* Read through [CTCI Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) to understand what makes the resume good, not necessarily the template
* Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience
* Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below) and pick STRONG action words. Do not pick weak ones - ones such as ""Worked"", ""Made"", ""Fixed"". These can all be said stronger, ""Designed"", ""Developed"", ""Implemented"", ""Integrated"", ""Improved""
* Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense
* Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. **Using an IDE is not a skill,** but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not. **VSCODE IS NOT A SKILL**. Neither are Jira and Confluence. If any non-CS person can open it up and use it, it's not a skill.
* Overloading skills - Listing every single skill, tool, IDE you've ever opened is not going to appeal to recruiters and will look like BS. Also remember that anything you list is **FAIR GAME TO TEST** and if you cannot answer that deeply about it, remove it.

17ijs1p,How common are such things in the industry?,"So, I just recalled a situation with a friend of mine where he was interviewing with a company for I believe a Data Analyst position, last Nov-Dec. Now, he had 7 yoe and was doing a Diploma in DA from a university (not some random college).  
  
When the interview got over, the recruiter told my friend that he was ""overqualified"" for the job and they were looking for DAs that have 2-3 YOE. Now, this personally makes me happy because I only have 2 YOE.  
  
So, is this a common thing or it just started nowadays ? I mean, what else could this indicate? My friend works for another company now, so it's not that he was bad at his skills and they were looking for a reason to reject him. If this is a common occurrence then I am a bit relieved since it is a bit unfair to compete with seniors for these roles. I am turning 25 in a few months so there is just no way for me to have 6-7 yoe.",2023-10-28 18:24:53
1757hg5,Data analyst internship vs working on personal swe projects,"I’ve just started my computer science degree this fall without prior programming experience. It seems early to secure a SWE internship for next summer given my very limited knowledge and how early the hiring period starts. However, I have prior experience with BI tools like Tableau and PowerBI. I'm considering leveraging this for a potential data analyst internship next summer, especially if I learn some SQL.

I'm wondering if a data analyst internship would benefit my future SWE internship applications. Or perhaps I should dedicate my summer to upgrading my coding skills and working on personal projects. I'm hesitant because data analyst positions look less focused on coding, and I am aiming for a SWE career, but realistically it’s the only internship I can get after my first year. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!",2023-10-11 06:32:25
15u10l8,The best route moving forward?,"I’m 26 years old.

What I’ve got: 
1. Certificate Computers and Information Technology (30 credits, McGill) — [Courses](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2023-2024/faculties/continuing/undergraduate/programs/certificate-cert-computers-and-information-technology)
2. Major in Political Science (60 credits, Université de Montréal). 


What I can (probably) get:

I can ask Université de Montréal to combine those two previously mentioned programs and award me a Baccalauréat par cumul (translates to multidisciplinary bachelor). 


What I want:

I want to build on the knowledge I have from the McGill certificate (courses linked above) as well as gain some additional academic credentials (diploma, degree, etc) in the CS field to learn more, become more proficient, succeed. 

Me currently: 

Admitted to Concordia University in a random Certificate program as a stepping stone to an eventual CS bachelor’s. I would be taking some prerequisite math classes (calculus/linear algebra) and then requesting to transfer internally…at which point I will finally be able to fill out the transfer credit form and see if I can get anything credited. They’re already telling me “ahhh your McGill certificate might not be creditable” yadayada. Meaning I might just be wasting my time at this point, hoping I’ll be able to not start everything over when I might still end up having to.    


Problem:

Without the combining of those two programs, I don’t even have a Bachelor’s. 
If I do combine the two programs to get a Multidisciplinary Bachelor’s and then go to do a second bachelor’s degree in CS somewhere, I will have to spend another 2-3 years (because transfer credits are limited for second degree students). 


Question/thought process: 

What is the best route for me? I don’t feel confident enough off the strength of the McGill certificate to attempt to dive into a graduate program like OMSCS from Georgia Tech (online) if they would even have me. At the same time, I feel like there would be a lot of redundancy in starting a second bachelor’s essentially from scratch. Advisors from Concordia/McGill have proved pretty much useless in helping me, their main line of responses being: “just sign up for your classes, once you’re in a CS program you’ll be able to fill out the transfer credit form and see if you can get any credits transferred!”. This means I can’t actually make an informed decision in a timely manner. 

Are there any recommendations you can make that would not require me to move outside of the Montreal area and that would cater to my specific situation?",2023-08-17 21:52:43
15stapg,Rollercoaster Ride of Miscommunications and Offer Delays: My Experience with a Job Application,"I wanted to share the rollercoaster of events that I've been through during my recent job application process. I applied for a position at a company and received a quick email response from an HR representative the very next day, indicating that my profile had been submitted. Excited, I took the initiative to connect with the HR person on LinkedIn, and to my delight, she accepted my request. I reached out with a message expressing my interest in the position and my eagerness to learn more about the process. However, I received no reply at that time.  
Fast forward a month and a half later, I noticed that the HR person was active on LinkedIn. Deciding to follow up, I messaged her again, only to receive a surprising response. She mentioned that I had been rejected after an interview, and as a result, I couldn't reapply for the next six months. Confused and certain that I hadn't been interviewed by the company previously, I clarified the misunderstanding. She swiftly admitted her error, apologizing for mixing up my name with other candidates.  
Feeling optimistic, I inquired about the next steps in the process. After some communication, I was sent an email with potential interview dates. I promptly responded with my availability, eagerly anticipating further instructions. However, after a two-day wait, I found myself emailing once more for an update. The response I received the next morning was unexpected: ""Hey, we were scheduled to interview today, I thought I sent you confirmation but I forgot."" Still determined, I confirmed my availability and proceeded with the interview process.  
Miraculously, I managed to navigate through all the rounds and received a job offer on August 8th, with a planned start date of August 21st. To seal the deal and join on time, I needed to sign and return the offer letter to HR by August 10th. Here's where the story takes another twist—due to a technical glitch, my offer couldn't be submitted into the system. Consequently, my start date had to be postponed to September 5th. HR assured me that I would receive the offer letter early in the following week.  
However, it's now been almost half a week since then, and I'm still eagerly waiting for the offer letter to arrive. The anticipation and uncertainty are starting to get the better of me, leaving me both excited and anxious about this potential opportunity.  
Has anyone else experienced a similar rollercoaster ride during their job application process? How did you manage the twists and turns? And any advice on how to handle this waiting game would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for letting me share my journey with you all!",2023-08-16 15:39:03

15aiwtw,"What are general rules in Canada about finishing off work with old company while overlapping with new company (completely unrelated, non-compete not an issue)?","I have accepted an IT offer with a major Canadian bank, set to start end of August pending all checks.

There is a bit of awkwardness as I am on vacation for ten days mid August which may affect the timing of my two weeks notice and my older company, much smaller and not in finance or banking at all. 

I want to aggressively document all the processes I work on.  A competent DBA they hire will easily figure things out.  I don't mind doing after hours, etc.  But with the timing of my vacation, would it be prudent to negotiate a delayed exit where after hours for X days overlapping into my new work (and weekends, I don't mind), I document everything with my team I can think of?  

Not documenting this is not an option; the company would be crippled.  I will have a very honest talk with them about this, why I'm leaving and for similar reasons to previous DBA leaving, who is much more experienced and capable than I am.

155vrfr,Need help deciding best option for my future... please help.,"Hello friends,

I'm in an interesting situation and really need your help and advice as this is a huge life/career decision.

I've recently been accepted to into a Government of Canada IT apprenticeship program. The program would last for 2 years and pay me 33$/hr, work 4 days of the week and have a day off to self-learn things I do on the job. I would be working in a ""Software Developer"" position. At the end of the program, I would be encouraged to stay and be transitioned into a full-time role.

I was also accepted into Software Engineering at a great Canadian University. I would be given 1200$/month in living expenses, all my tuition and books paid for along with a 5000$ scholarship to start. I would also receive 2500$ every semester from Quebec. 

My main issue is I can't properly compare the **Work Experience** vs **Education** and how that would benefit my career in the long run. I have already completed an intensive 1 & 1/2 year intensive software development program where I was able to get a Software Dev. internship under my belt so I already have decent experience. My goal would be to work as a Software Developer and both these routes should get me there I just need to evaluate what would maximize my earning potential.

I am able to defer my acceptance to University to 2024 and explore the apprenticeship program which I think is the best option. Any advice would be really appreciated thanks for your time :)

Users create content and sync it to a database that is accessible and shared with other users. Includes user management system, and a fairly complex pubsub architecture to connect many devices together in realtime.
   * Built a simple React Native app that is a small journal for a specific use case.
   * Wrote fairly complex software in C++ for ATmega2560 and an HMI screen that communicates over serial to create an interface that connects with a PC over serial connection, similar to the first apps mentioned above.
   * Built various websites over the years using Wordpress and some simple ones from scratch that utilize flex box and responsive design. Limited experience with bootstrap but I understand it. 
* 3D printing manufacturing and CAD experience. Designed successful 3d printed designs using CAD and sold thousands of them.
* 35 years old

11g4zsh,How would you decide between government vs private in your late thirties?,"I am senior dev without about 5-6 years of full time professional experience as a software engineer and another 2 years as business analyst before that.  I am in BC and employed as a senior developer by the federal government and I make exactly 100k per year (underpaid I know) and I am on contract (i.e. not a permanent employee, no pension contributions).

I am in my late thirties and closer to forty, and I've been offered the option to become a permanent employee and join a DB pension plan.  I don't want to become a manager/business analyst/product manager (was a BA before and didn't like it).  I only have about 250k saved for retirement, which I feel is very low, (esp now that everyone is saying that you need like 2M to retire in Canada), and I am a renter, single, no kids.

I feel I have to either commit to government, mainly because of the DB pension or option, or try my luck by targeting Fang/Manga-like companies in the hopes of making a much higher salary as a software developer.  

So I need to figure out what to do: stay in government long term with a low salary but better retirement prospects, or jump into private in the hopes of making much more money?

How can I decide what to do?  How can I decide if job hopping in the private sector from now until retirement will be worth more than staying in government for the DB pension and supposedly lower workload?

Any feedback would be appreciated.",2023-03-02 15:06:34
11afpeu,"Confusion about career choice, I hate when I cannot focus on one thing. can you please give me some advice?","

Hello Redditors, I am studying software development and network engineering diploma from some college in Canada and I will graduate in May 2023. Since childhood I am very fascinated from computers. In 7th grade I came across HTML and CSS. I was so surprise by the technology that helps in building webpages so that I created lots of clones like Google webpage, facebook etc. then I came across JS so I learnt some of that and created some games and added some interaction on webpages I created. I learnt some of C++ and did some basic projects on that. While in the college I realized that I have interest in networking and cybersecurity so I start studying that on sites like Tryhackme and Hackthebox and passed comptia Security+ and eJPT certifications.

After that I started preparing for other cybersec certs but then suddenly I become so much interested in software development and started learning Springboot and react and made 5-6 big projects in that, then I realized from certain places that leetcode is very important for problem solving skills and passing interviews so I started grinding leetcode, after solving 200 questions I realized cloud is emerging technology so I studied and passed AWS cloud practitioner, right now I am preparing for AWS certified developer associate. 

Right now, I have interest in cloud and perhaps I will develop new interest in some technology in future, I cannot focus on one technology and get expertise in that.

 What should I do? Either cybersec, software programming, or something else

I have heard from somewhere that being jack of all is the sign of mediocrity. Even I am not jack of all. 

Thanks for the guidance",2023-02-24 02:09:45
116wa3c,Why Are Diploma Holders Locked To A Certain Range Of Careers?,"Something I've noticed here is that if you only have a CS diploma (and not an undergraduate degree), you will only be considered for roles like tech support, QA tester, etc. Not software engineer roles.

But why though? If a diploma holder can solve leetcode problems and has a thorough understanding of OOP, couldn't they also do the job?

I've looked at the syllabus for a lot of diploma programs and undergrad programs, and there's a big overlap. AFAIK undergrad programs cover a lot more math, while the diploma programs leave that out and focus on the code. Is this the main reason why?

It seems to me that people in this industry treat certifications like you would in the medical field or the aviation industry. In the medical and aviation field, you are putting people's lives in the hands of a professional. Because of that high risk level, you need that professional to go through government approved training because otherwise they'd be a threat to public safety. So if someone does not pass through that training, I can see why they would be barred from getting into that role.

But the software industry does not work that way (for the most part). They just need good coders. So why is there so much barring taking place?",2023-02-20 03:15:36

191ob4s,Would a Masters in CS or ECE hold more value for a career in Healthcare?,"Hi! 

My longterm goal is to get into a BME type role involving programming medical devices/technology or working on the AI/ML side of things. Currently, I only have a Bachelors in CS. 

Would it make more sense to pursue a Masters in CS, or a Masters in ECE?  In both cases, the courses and thesis would be relatively identical, and both would come with a specialization in AI.  The only real difference would be the name of the degree on paper.  The ECE degree would also be 4-8 months longer. 

Will the name of the degree make a big difference or am I overthinking things?  This decision has been stressing me out for months now and I need to make a decision asap, but I dont know anyone in the field so idek what a typical EE job would look like (ie whether it would be more software or hardware focused).

I went through depression, did not want to complete studies and almost gave up at times. One of the Computer Science courses I have complete have grades below 60%. Most of them between 60-70%, and only a few of them have A. I have failed a few math courses, as well as one intro to logic for CS courses. I am finally graduating in April 2024. However, my cumulative average would be around 65% and CGPA around 2.6 out of 4. I have barely completed any projects, except a few group projects regarding software engineering and cybersecurity.

Or if I should focus on something else, specially due to the recent job crisis. I am willing to even do volunteer work in related to the game industry to gain some experience, but I have zero idea where to get one.

18pag35,Advice for where to go next in my career?,"Hi everyone,

After my internship and school (graduated in electrical with comp sci minor), I've been working for about three years now. The first year I was doing pretty high level semiconductor hardware verification, lot of mundane and repetitive work, and since then have been working for a automotive company in a SW QA and testing automation role.

Since starting here, I've been able to do a lot of cool stuff I didn't really know too much about including:

* developing test cases

* automating them in python

* creating CI/CD pipeline

* actually developing automation libraries for myself and other teams in the company to use, ultimately contributing to a testing automation framework

* took on many scrum master activities (Host daily stand-up and retrospective, and a few other meetings)

And other than our Product Owner and Manager, I'm the go-to guy within our team to learn about our teams operation or request to get something done from outside of our team. You want to know if we're currently tracking a particular bug, understand how a piece of our code works, or get an idea of our timeline, I'm your guy. That being said, I can clearly see that there's so much more to learn, its just a matter of picking something and going for it.

I'll be honest, up until know I've been more or less going with the flow, and simply trying to put myself more out there and increasing my participation as my base knowledge has increased and I've become more competent. But honestly, this isn't the career I thought I'd have (even though this job is the most interesting and fun I've had so far, so no complaints) and as such, I'm not really sure where to go from here. My first thought is to increase my skillset, learn some new technology, but I feel like that's useless unless I have a clear path forward or a target to achieve in terms of a career. Like most I imagine, I want to be able to grow myself as a irreplaceable employee, increase my salary over time, and have fun doing what I'm doing.

At the end of the day, I guess my questions are:

* How do I figure out where to go from here?

* What skills would be useful to develop?

Sorry for the vagueness in my questioning, I'm just a bit lost, and any advice would be helpful, even if it doesn't directly answer the questions above.",2023-12-23 17:25:43
18hy2bi,Need advice on how to temper BA/PM expectations.,"Hi there, I have a question. I've worked the same place 2 years since I started as a co-op. When I started, it was 2 senior devs and myself. Now, one of the senior devs is preoccupied (the one with the most experience) with some other projects. I was mostly doing the same Angular work as him if I'm being honest anyways so I basically picked up doing all the tasks he was doing for the front end/integration side of our new application. Honestly I'm learning a lot and things are going good.  
  
Now, to split things up even further, my best friend senior developer who was working with me on the new application has also been assigned to finish a few tasks on a form we (were) creating together.  
  
So now the new application basically falls on little old me (barely 2 years exp). They want the whole thing to be done (front end, mobile responsive, integration, data structure/API work) by mid February and launched in April. I literally just got the Figma last week and it's barely got all the pages, never mind finalized requirements. There's no repo for the code yet, we don't have a database, we have no DBA/architects to work on it, and no UX designer at all it's our BA doing it.  
  
I don't know how to tell them it's probably just not possible, especially if we have 3 devs and I'm literally the only person working on it. We usually have tight deadlines but this feels silly.  
  
I heard them saying ""yeah OP is the only one working on that right now."" so they totally know about the dev shortage lol  
  
Any advice on how to handle this/temper expectations? I feel like they're just promising the business shit willy nilly without even knowing what goes into the dev side.

So I can see how dev career could potentially be THE career for my life. Many of my friends encourge me to try learning web dev.

I see that entry-level market is overly saturated and even experienced developers are struggling finding new job. So I am wondering if I should dive into this path. What do you guys think? Would you say that the job market is too saturated right now that it's too late to get into it without a CS degree?

# Common Resume Mistakes - READ FIRST AND FIX:

* Remove career objective paragraphs, goals and descriptions
* DO NOT put a  photo of yourself
* Experience less than 5 years, keep your experience to 1 page
* Read through [CTCI Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) to understand what makes the resume good, not necessarily the template
* Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience
* Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below) and pick STRONG action words. Do not pick weak ones - ones such as ""Worked"", ""Made"", ""Fixed"". These can all be said stronger, ""Designed"", ""Developed"", ""Implemented"", ""Integrated"", ""Improved""
* Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense
* Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. **Using an IDE is not a skill,** but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not. **VSCODE IS NOT A SKILL**. Neither are Jira and Confluence. If any non-CS person can open it up and use it, it's not a skill.
* Overloading skills - Listing every single skill, tool, IDE you've ever opened is not going to appeal to recruiters and will look like BS. Also remember that anything you list is **FAIR GAME TO TEST** and if you cannot answer that deeply about it, remove it.

So I am a new immigrant to your fine country, straight from HK (with 10+ years of Mobile dev experience). I came here about 3-4 months ago and since then I have been able to get to the final round of 3 jobs (while I have applied for tons more!) , all of which I was rejected from.   


2 of them gave me a reason, which I didn't agree with but fair enough. The 3rd on however did not, and simply wrote me an email that **""We regret to inform you but we are moving forward with another candidate"".** 

I did sent them a ""Thank you for considering my application"" email, and  **""could you please give me some feedback on what and where I was lacking""** (not in those words but more professionally). I however did not receive any feedback. 

So I would like to know 2 things:  


1) Just curious; How common is it for companies to give feedback as to why the applicant wasn't selected? It's not very common in Hong Kong but as the first 2 gave me feedback I assumed the 3rd on would as well.  


2) Since I did not get any feedback, my assumption is that the job went to someone who was asking for less money than I was. Would that be correct? Or could it be some other reason? (Cultural fit perhaps?) For reference **Their range was $80K-$110K, and I had asked for $100k negotiable.**

   2. Hybrid, 2 days in office and 3 days remote permantently. I would not have to move for this location.
   3. Relatively modern tech stack, React and C#.
2. Senior Programmer Analyst at one of the Big 5.
   1. 87k to start. No mention of further growth opportunities.
   2. Hybrid, 1 day a month in office but I live 4 hours away from this office. Hypothetically, I could stay where I am and just drive to the office every month but I was told that this hybrid model could change to be more in office - so I may eventually have to move to the GTA.
   3. VB, and in process to migrate to C#. While I was talking to them, I don't think their codebase has version control or they deploy very good SWE practices.
   4. I actually applied for the Programmer Analyst but they bumped me up to a senior role for higher pay?

I don't know what to do here. So many different things that I can do. I'm thinking:

1. Bring the Big 5 offer to the local company to raise my TC. I will do this for sure. But at what TC is it worth accepting their counter offer?
2. Reneg on the local company and take the Big 5 offer.
3. If the Big 5 company goes hybrid every week, then factoring rent and expenses will bring it line with my 1st offer.
4. Just to be clear, ignoring TC, I'd rather work for the local company as I think their work is more interesting and uses more modern tech.

I have a total of 16 months of internship experience in testing / software development, 12 months of which were in Canada. Since last October, I've been actively seeking new grad, junior, and other relevant SDE positions in Vancouver and Toronto that require less than 2 years of experience. I have sent out more than 350 applications, but got interviews from only 2 companies so far (I was able to progress to the 3rd round for both).  In the interviews, people seemed concerned about my experience in Singapore and my brief departure from pure CS. I feel like what meant to be an exploration of a possible career path seems now stabbing me instead...

I understand that the job market is currently not at its peak, but I can't help but feel anxious about my situation. I have tried all the job search suggestions I am aware of:

* Every day I've been applying for all new entry-level jobs on LinkedIn and Glassdoor.
* I've had my resume reviewed by my friends, ex-colleagues, and the school's career service. 
* I've been trying my best to customize them for every job posting.
* I've been reaching out to HR on LinkedIn after my application (never get any response).

I'm at a loss for what more I can do and would deeply appreciate any advice, feedback, or strategies that could improve my job search. Thank you very much for taking the time to read my post and for any guidance you can provide.

192q2ly,Using offer from contract position to negotiate for raise at FTE position?,"I've been approached by a recruiter for a contract position that would pay 1.5x my current TC. I have almost 3yoe and have been with my company for almost 2 years, I enjoy working there but the raise this year was incredibly disappointing given how much I delivered.

Both positions are hybrid. I'd like to go through the interview process and use the offer letter to negotiate for a higher raise, I know it won't be 1:1 value but maybe I can get a 15-20% raise with it, is it possible or should I do it with another FTE offer letter?",2024-01-09 21:24:00

 I initially started my degree in CS but failed out afterwards because of mental health. I finished my degree though in something unrelated.
I'm a Canadian citizen 

I'm thinking of going back and doing a second undergrad in CS which would take roughly 2 years to finish. Looking at SFU, UBC (probably not though because it's exactly like UofT), or Athabasca.The alternative is to get into a masters program but even that is hard for me to achieve with my shit CGPA. People have recommended OMSCS at Georgia Tech, but tbh I don't know if I'll be accepted.

The school I'll be doing my second degree at is most likely going to be a no name school.

Why am I doing another undergrad? Qualify for a TN visa, move to the US more easily, have some semblance of stability in life

Cons: I'm ending up with most likely the same job in the end.

Do you guys think this is a good idea?",2023-12-05 21:05:22
188kbhi,"What's a decent path to entering the Game Industry in Engine/Tooling, from sorta New Grad","Greetings,  
Not main account.  

I'll give background first.  
Graduated from a local college in a Comp Engi program \[Mix of Hardware and Programming\](3Year Diploma).  
During my time in post secondary, I landed a FSWEP role at a federal department doing Full-stack and continued working there.  
Once I graduated, they had no slots for me, which then I transitioned into a Admin/Dev Salesforce role on a different team. Within that role I created Flows and Custom Lightning Web Components (SF vers. of web components).  
Recently, I left the PS to a Private company in where I maintain a Network lab (Add new devices, adjust connections on devices and troubleshoot issues from DEV/QA teams regarding lab hardware, inventory, etc..)  

So the timeline look like this:  
Student Full-Stack \[3 years\] ->  
Salesforce ""Dev"" \[11months\] ->   
Lab Tech \[Now\] \[Aiming to stay for 1.5-2years\]  

As you can see, I'm transitioning into more an IT generalist, which is fine, but my original idea was to work in the Game Industry as a Programmer. Once I looked at the Salaries for these roles, I doubled back and looked into Software.

But throughout the years of post-secondary, I keep coming back to the idea of working in the industry, and reviewing upcoming game trailers re-sparks that interest \[Recent one being Marathon\].

So my current idea is to self study CPP in the evening till I come proficient in it, and start developing my own engine using Online tutorials and Blogs. From there, recreate a few classic arcade games/my own to develop a portfolio, and start sending resumes to Med-Large Studios in two years time.

To anyone within this space, does that sound doable? My background is mostly within Web Technology, but my diploma gave me experience in lower level development (C/C++/Assembly), and due to my lack of a degree, I don't think I can apply to other studios within the states.

# Common Resume Mistakes - READ FIRST AND FIX:

* Remove career objective paragraphs, goals and descriptions
* DO NOT put a  photo of yourself
* Experience less than 5 years, keep your experience to 1 page
* Read through [CTCI Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) to understand what makes the resume good, not necessarily the template
* Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience
* Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below) and pick STRONG action words. Do not pick weak ones - ones such as ""Worked"", ""Made"", ""Fixed"". These can all be said stronger, ""Designed"", ""Developed"", ""Implemented"", ""Integrated"", ""Improved""
* Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense
* Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. **Using an IDE is not a skill,** but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not. **VSCODE IS NOT A SKILL**. Neither are Jira and Confluence. If any non-CS person can open it up and use it, it's not a skill.
* Overloading skills - Listing every single skill, tool, IDE you've ever opened is not going to appeal to recruiters and will look like BS. Also remember that anything you list is **FAIR GAME TO TEST** and if you cannot answer that deeply about it, remove it.

179bcrt,How to Successfully Transition a Research Master's into Industry?,"Hi all!

I am a recent CS Master's student graduate looking for a job. I have a relatively strong research background in AI+Healthcare with 3 publications and 5+ years of research throughout my undergrad and master's. I was an Honour's student throughout my degrees and have lots of extracurriculars and personal projects. I have strong references as well as a suite of book reviews, workshop attendance, etc.

My friends and supervisors told me how bad the market was and that I should stay in academia, but I foolishly thought that as a high-achieving CS student, I would have no problem finding a job. I didn't want to pursue more education and felt that I would find a way to make it work in the job market.

In practice, I have found that my options are very limited. For most research positions I am underqualified (no publications at top-tier ML conferences, Master's instead of PhD), and there are very few health-sector AI jobs where I could leverage my experience. For many other tech jobs that could maybe tide me over in the meantime, I have the wrong skillset. I did research for all my Summers in my undergrad, so I have no co-op experience and cannot be a software developer or programmer. Even when looking for simple jobs to tide me over while I continue the job search (secretary, assistant, etc.), I am overqualified and rarely hear back. Although my education record is good, no one seems willing to take a chance to hire someone like me who doesn't have a strong experience base coming out of school but could potentially learn the relevant skills on the job.

I have been focusing on data science or data analyst roles since I have the coursework background and am a proficient programmer in that niche, but the market seems super flooded and I can barely get an interview. I have now had 400+ applications and a handful of interviews over the last few months and am no closer to landing a job. I've spent my free time outside of sending applications towards learning Tableau, grinding leetcode, practicing SQL, and studying statistics. However, I so rarely get past the initial stage that I can't really put these to use. 

Do you have any suggestions? I have been sticking to applying to Canada since this is my home country, although I have American citizenship as well and feel that I may be forced to look for work there too. Am I really as unemployable as I think? Is there anything I can do to boost my chances? Pay doesn't matter much as long as I can feed and house myself. Feeling pretty down.",2023-10-16 17:21:15
16rf6gx,Looking for advice on department/role to pursue within SWE at a large company,"So I am currently doing a 4 month program/bootcamp that is sponsored by a major company here in Canada. Essentially we are trained from scratch in Java, SQL, as well as some front end languages. We are then placed in different departments throughout the company and varying roles. I have friends who have participated in this before and they said you need to vocalize the path you want because most people end up in Quality Engineering/Testing if you don't say anything.




I was originally planning on pursuing the DaaS roles and becoming a data engineer as one of my friends who did this last year did it but we got a presentation from most departments a few days ago and I am thinking maybe I should weigh my options more carefully.


These are the departments/roles available:
- Data as a Service
- Full Stack Engineer
- Cloud
- Business Systems Analyst
- Architecture
- Quality Engineering
- Software Enablement
 -Mainframe


The reason I wanted to be a data engineer was I was previously a data analyst and had some familiarity with SQL and my education background is a Bcomm with a focus in Information Systems (Can be seen through courses I took but my school doesn't formally show focus). Now I feel like I may be limiting myself by choosing data and it may mess up the important things I want from my career. 

I know I should probably pick what I am good at but now I am realizing I am not particularly great in either Java or SQL and I will learn them both through the job so its not like I will come in as a data wizard if I pick DaaS.

Essentially there are a few main things I am hoping some of these paths will fulfill more than others and I was hoping if I could get peoples opinion.


1. I would like to know how Full stack engineering pays on average in your experience vs data engineering and maybe if one has a lower/higher ceiling then the other? 

2. I am Canadian and would like to move to the states in the coming years so I was wondering if any of these fields tend to yield an easier time getting a visa (t1/h1b) as a Canadian moving to the US?

3. If I work as a data engineer am I boxing myself out of working trying to find a full stack/traditional software engineering role in the future or vice versa?

Thanks for the insight ahead of time!",2023-09-25 01:46:54

16be1st,Bachelor/ Master CS Degree for Switching Career,"Zero prior experience in software engineering.   


I got a BEng degree 1 year ago from a top 100 University outside Canada. (with a 3.23 gpa out of 4.3)  I can full time study my following degree but I have to stay in Canada in the next 3 years.


Im looking for the best way to pivot my BEng Degree for getting into the industry.  


Route 1: 2nd Bachelor Degree  
Pro:   
a) coop   
b) better foundation of knowledge  
Con:   
a) most time consuming I might need go Master eventually if I’m interested in specific field like AI for being a MLE.

examples for 2 years programs: 
UBC BCS, McGill BScCS, SFU BScCS, McMaster BASc  (they are claimed to be 2 years but take more than 2 years)


Route 2: Master Degree like OMSCS

Pro:  
a) master degree

b) I’m interested in AI. Deeper understanding into specific field.

Con:

a) require a lot of prerequisites (around 1 year of self study with only a MOOC credentials), which is the reason I consider 2nd bachelor  

b) actually quite time consuming as OMSCS only allowing Part time studying  

c) poor foundation? (not sure doing the list from [https://omscs.gatech.edu/preparing-yourself-omscs](https://omscs.gatech.edu/preparing-yourself-omscs) will be enough or not)  

d) no coop in current job market

e) I don’t see any Canadian Universities offering a Master degree for switching career.

I still can not decide I should go 2nd Bachelor route or Master Route.

Edit: 
I do realize the state of current job market. But I’m hooked with Computer Science. I would like to learn the knowledge and I even prefer a more theoretical program rather than practical (prefer BSc/ MSc).",2023-09-06 07:52:33

1656nw9,How to approach the final stage ‘meet the team’ interview?,"UPDATE: the meet and greet was pretty casual and fun, we talked about my tech interests, personal projects, previous experience, hobbies etc. and I got the job one day later.

Hey guys!  


I'm excited to share that I've made it to the final round of interviews for a swe position! I've successfully navigated through the first phone interview and the three technical interviews, and now I'm gearing up for the 'meet and greet with the team' interview. This is new territory for me, and I'm looking for some insights and advice from those who've been through it before.  
I'm curious to know what to expect in this final stage. Are these interviews typically more on the technical side, or do they lean towards a more informal and casual conversation? Should I be ready to delve into specific technical topics like Agile methodologies, microservices, etc.? Or is it more about gauging how well I'd fit within the team dynamics?  
I've done my research and am ready to discuss my past experiences, including how I've utilized Agile methodologies and worked with microservices. But I'm also wondering if they'll want to get to know me on a more personal level, asking about hobbies, interests, and what I do in my free time.

I have also prepared some ""team culture"" questions and technical questions for the team to get to know them more.  
For those of you who've been through this stage before, how did it go for you? Did you find it was more technically focused or more about your personality and fit with the team? Any particular questions or scenarios you were asked that stood out?  


Finally, I'm curious to hear if any of you reached this final stage and then received a negative response. If so, what do you think might have contributed to that outcome? Was it a misalignment in team culture, a lack of specific technical knowledge, or something else entirely?  


Your insights and experiences would mean a lot to me as I head into this interview. Thanks in advance for your advice and support! 🙌",2023-08-30 06:16:26

133xizm,Changing Careers from Pharmacy," Hi  all, I'm a 34-year-old pharmacist in Ontario with two degrees  (undergrad and professional) and 8 years of experience, seeking advice  on a career change. Despite being a pharmacist, my pharmacy job in a  specialized area has led me to work on programming projects over the  past 3 years, using mostly self-taught skills.

I've built and integrated the following projects with our pharmacy management system:

* B2B online client portal
* Shipping and inventory management applications
* Other industry-specific tools

Through  these projects, I gained experience with Python, SQL  (MSSQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite), PHP/HTML/Javascript, and more. While I'm  aware of my current knowledge and the areas where I lack expertise, I  believe that with dedication and self-directed learning, I can close  that gap.

I'd like to explore how  my pharmacy background could help me land a job in a tech-focused  company, possibly related to machine learning.

Considering my self-taught programming background and pharmacy experience:

1. What are my prospects for pivoting to a full-time developer role or a related job in the tech industry?
2. Would my pharmacy experience provide a unique advantage for entering the tech field?
3. Are there any additional credentials or courses I should pursue to improve my chances of getting my foot in the door?

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",2023-04-30 17:16:56
1307zsb,24M trying to make career switch!,"Hey /r/cscareerquestionsCAD, 

I’m a degree holder (first degree was Bachelor of Arts in Criminology) and I’ve been accepted into Algoma University’s online accelerated second degree Bachelor of Computer Science (BCoSc) program! 

From what I’ve heard its not too great of a program due to low admission requirement (hence why I got in, they just wanted a C+ GPA in first degree) and some of their staff are bad at teaching / have bad material. 

HOWEVER, It does offer an accredited 3 year general computer science degree in less than a year. 

At 24 I can’t afford to / want to grind hard for a year to get better high school marks to go to  a university like York U for 4 years. 

I decided to apply to this program (expecting to get denied) while learning Python. I’m now done 3 parts of mooc’s java course (on part 1 atm) and having alot of fun and enjoying it! 

However especially in todays tech market , I’m not sure how far a 3 year bcosc degree w/o co-op would get me. I slacked off heavily during my undergrad and thought I wanted to become a police officer but my attitude towards that career has changed.

What should I do /r/cscareerquestionsCAD? I considered a bootcamp but many have told me to get a accredited cs degree to get past the resume screening process. Am I overthinking this entire process? If I spend a year of my life and 10K + on tuition and don’t get a job it won’t be good for my situation. I do understand CS degrees are valued but i’d prefer to do something like being a junior dev.",2023-04-27 03:03:31

No time like the present to do what you want, right? Well, I've been the past couple of years studying my a\*\* off while working full-time and I got myself an internship position for the summer and another for the fall as a SWE.

I am a chem eng with 7 yrs of experience in the canadian manufacturing sector and here I am about to quit my 90k job to go to an internship as a SWE at a decent company in my region! I'm bringing with me a nice bag full of soft-skills and some hard skills learned in my college diploma I will be finishing in December, and also by myself with my personal projects. 

My salary will be cut in half as of next month, but hopefully in a few years I'll be back to the point I am right now and with some experience in a much better career! (for me).

I am a big believer in networking and creating a connection with your next potential employer/colleagues. I was once told that you hire attitude and train aptitude and so far that thinking has never failed me. I hired new grads in my previous career and that's the way I found the best fitting candidates. Hopefully someone will see the same in me now that I will technically be a humble new grad in technology :D.

As of next month I change my LinkedIn to my new career and turn on the networking mindset again! The mission is to get a return offer from any of my internships and to be employed by next January. 

I will be (hopefully) starting GeorgiaTech's OMSCS in January as well, so the plan is to make projects, network, and actively apply to positions. Did I say networking enough?

I prefer not to pursue a development path at the current company (even though it's a viable career path and my manager is open to that possibility) because of the large amount of technical debt, compensation, and other issues at the company and it being an older stack I'm not too passionate about (.NET) so if I can transition into a dev role elsewhere if possible it would be great. I have always been more interested in programming than in IT even though my experience and credentials are IT. I have a full stack nodejs/react/mysql project that I've been maintaining for over 3 years with hundreds of thousands of users and a small amount of income as well, and I have been able to scale it across multiple clusters. I have familiarized myself with CI/CD workflows and git-based project management and versioning, I have written documentation and developed APIs, at my work I use MSSQL and so I have written a few queries as well as made a VBA script to automate a work task. I also have several small scale coding projects in PHP and even some C#. Due to my lack of professional experience in development I have been unable to secure a role in this current market. Please inform me of the possible choices going forward:

1) 
Continue to invest time and commitment into my full stack project as well as learn other frameworks and technologies and develop projects, learn leetcode, refresh my knowledge on CS curriculi like data structures, algorithms, etc for perhaps a year and reevaluate, building my skills while hoping the future economic climate improves in that time

2) push for a promotion at my current work and enter into a .NET developer role and use it to gain software dev experience which I can then use to transfer elsewhere

3) 
stay in IT and aim for various IT related roles like networking, windows server, sysadmin, DBA, etc, and work on getting various certifications


4)

Leave everything and start all over in a completely different industry in the anticipation of a worsening tech climate and hoplessness and go back to school or learn a trade 


5) 

Use my knowledge and success of building a successful full stack application to launch a business and attempt to earn passive income through experimenting with various ideas (this full stack project earned me about 10k/year in passive income but it unfortunately no longer profits because of lack of upkeep and code rot over time and me not caring due to various mental health issues",2023-10-25 19:28:56

16x8g56,Seeking Advice: Considering Transferring Universities for a Computer Science Degree,"**Tldr:** Considering transferring from a local university to a prestigious one in Ontario or BC for a Computer Science degree. Worries about degree value, networking, job market, internships, and financial concerns. Seeking advice on whether to stay or take the leap.  
  
I've been thinking about the idea of transferring universities recently, and I could really use your insights and opinions on this matter. I'm currently in my 3rd year Computer Science at a local university in the province Saskatchewan, Canada. But I'm contemplating a move to a well-known university in either Ontario or British Columbia. Here's what's on my mind:  
  
**1. The Degree Dilemma:** I believe that obtaining a degree from a different university might be a game-changer compared to my current situation. I am wondering, do degrees really matter once you've graduated, in the Computer Science field? The possibility of getting into debt and living a more expensive life isn't appealing, but if a different university could substantially enhance my degree's value, I'm willing to make the sacrifice.  
  
**2. Networking Opportunities:** Besides the degree, I'm also eager to expand my network and connect with more people. I suspect that other well-known universities might offer better networking prospects compared to my current location. What do you think about this aspect of transferring?  
  
**3. Job Market Concerns:** The current job market for new graduates is pretty bad, and delaying my progress in university could potentially mean spending an extra year or two before graduating into a more favorable job market, hopefully. Although there are no guarantees, I'm wondering if it's worth starting over (likely not all my classes will transfer) to secure a better degree and build stronger connections.  
  
**4. Internship Worries:** I'm currently doing my first 1-year software developer internship, but honestly, it feels a bit underwhelming compared to what some of my friends and others have on their resumes. I've got this feeling that if I transfer universities, it could open up a whole new world of internship possibilities. Sure, the competition might be a bit tougher, but I'm thinking the potential payoffs could be worth it. What do you all think? Do you think exploring internships in a different university scene might be a smart move to level up my career game?   
  
I have been talking to my friends and family about this, and it's been a mix of opinions. Some are all for chasing dreams, while others are saying, it’s just a CS degree. Which I agree with but I can't help thinking about all the exciting possibilities that come with switching to one of those other universities I mentioned earlier.  
  
Some of my friends are telling me it might not be the best move. One big reason is living on my own. I've always been with my family, so the idea of going solo is a bit of a curveball. And then there's the money side of things. If I make the switch, it looks like I'll be taking out a loan and dealing with some debt. I get the whole financial wisdom, but honestly, I'm a bit torn.  
  
So, what's your take about this situation? Do I stick with my current university, finish up my degree here, and see where life takes me? Or do I take a chance, maybe start over in my second year at the dorms, and deal with student debt in the hopes of landing some internships? Please let me know  
  
I'd greatly appreciate any advice. If you've been through a similar situation or have thoughts on transferring universities, please feel free to drop me a message.  
  
Thank you in advance!

**Context:**  
I'm a final year CS student (University of Toronto). I just finished a 16 month internship (full stack web dev). I have a lot of projects unrelated to web dev, and only one full stack web dev project. This project is complete, but is not deployed anywhere and can only be run locally (there are instructions on how to run it in the readme). This was the project that got me my internship (I had to present it to the interviewers). It's a pretty basic MERN app with some nice styling, state management, and auth0.  
I currently have two in progress projects, one which will take me about 60 more hours to complete, and one that will take much longer.  
I have very little leetcode experience. I've taken a data structures and algorithms course at my uni, but it was more than a year ago.  
I will only be taking one course in my final semester (January to May 2024). So, I am looking to start apply to jobs with a start date of January 10.  
I don't think my portfolio and general profile are competitive enough right now. I will be satisfied once I have another completed project and a stronger leetcode competency.  
**Question:**  
I want to know whether I should  
a) spend the next few months working on my in-progress projects and properly preparing for interviews (using the tech interview handbook) and apply once I have good leetcode competency and another project  
b) start applying now and continue bolstering my application on the side.  
Option B seems to be better at face value, but I'm concerned with losing certain opportunities by applying to them earlier on with a weak resume. If I wait a bit longer, I would be a stronger applicant for these opportunities. On the other hand, I've heard that Q4 is good for hiring, so I might be missing out on opportunities that may disappear before I'm fully prepared.

I'm at a significant crossroads with my education and career choices and could really use some wisdom from this community's experienced individuals.I've developed a strong interest in consultation, with a focus on Salesforce. This has led me to contemplate furthering my education in the field. However, I find myself undecided between a 3-year degree and a full 4-year degree.

There's another critical element in this decision: my family could greatly benefit from financial assistance. The quicker I graduate and begin working, the sooner I can start helping them. This gives the shorter duration of a 3-year degree and its faster pathway to the industry a very attractive prospect. However, I don't want to compromise the quality of my education and potential job opportunities.

An important piece of information to consider is that my university has given me the option to graduate with a 3-year degree now and return later to upgrade it to a 4-year degree by completing the additional credits. This seems like a flexible arrangement, but I am unsure if this is a common practice or how it may be perceived by potential employers.

If you've walked either of these paths, I'd greatly appreciate your sharing your experiences, especially concerning the Canadian job market. What was your experience like in landing your first job, career growth, and opportunities?

More specifically, to those in consultation or working with Salesforce, do you find a 4-year degree more advantageous?

As I navigate this crucial decision, I'd value your insights and experiences greatly. Thank you in advance for your advice and insights!

1518krb,Can I switch from DevOps to SWE? Feel like I am pigeonholing myself and not advancing my career.,"Title basically.. is it possible to switch? Working at Adobe at the moment as a relatively new graduate. I feel like my software engineering skills are slowly eroding away, but this is the only ""big tech"" company that I could get into given the current market.

Currently I am:

1. Mainly writing ""code"" that is just YAML and JSON configurations (terraform, ansible) with small scripts here and there in python
2. Not working on anything product related, just maintaining and creating cloud infrastructure and internal automations (CI/CD, monitoring / alerts, etc)
3. Working a pretty brutal on-call schedule
4. Have no visibility in the business. Management only seems to care about SWE and people working on the actual product

I would like to:

1. Write actual fullstack code, use object oriented programming, design patterns, etc. I miss writing real code.
2. Work on the product that the customers actually use
3. Have more visibility in the business, and not be seen as a cost center
4. Ideally no on-call
5. Actually use the skills from my CS degree

Hopefully that doesn't sound like I'm being too picky.. I know the market is tough and I'm grateful to have a job. But I want to be a software engineer writing actual code and working on the actual product, and I'm worried the longer I stay, the harder it will be to switch.

Also no hate to any DevOps folks... you guys are great. I just want to be an SWE instead.

If anyone has switched from DevOps to SWE, can you please help a brother out? What did you do? I've started leetcoding, but is that enough?",2023-07-16 15:06:02

14j7x7g,Early Career Software Developer looking for career change advice in Canada,"Early career Software Developer looking for a career change in a different industry. What should I do?  
English is not my first language so apologies in advance if this post doesn't completely align with how typically questions are asked here. But I will try to keep it as concise as possible. So here it goes,  
  
**My Background**  
  
I graduated from a top University in Canada with a Double Major in Computer Science and Economics but I primarily gravitated towards Computer Science and opted for a career in Software Engineering. I did not graduate in the best of times (thanks to covid) but after a few months wait, eventually got placed as a junior java developer. I worked there for almost a year and honestly, I did not have the best experience. However, the more I reflect on my bad experiences, the more i question myself whether or not everything that contributed to my bad experience is specific to the work environment or my own flawed perception of what ""WORK"" would be as a Software Developer. I hated the morning stand ups, the constant fast-paced sprints (especially joining as a junior developer. Sometimes it would take me close to a week to even understand what's going on in a ticket and bam its already week 2 and deadline is coming and i am all stressed). Unless I am completely off, I understood that any development team that is working around a product will have such pressure from management as the cost of a product not working in production is massive to the businesses that are involved. I would have mild panic attacks every morning before standups since everyone seems to have their shit together and in general, I just kind of hate the format. I would much rather give updates 1v1 or on via messages and get in calls on when needed. In general, I am not the type of person who likes to talk in the room unless it is absolutely required. Also, for some context, even though I was a junior and it may be due to a lack of experience but when I saw my senior managers on-a day to day basis, I did not look up to them. They are amazing and hard-working people, but I did not want that life 5 years down the line even if things went right on my part. I eventually quit. Moving forward..  
  
**Search for new career**  
  
I have also thought about development teams that work in R&D or something similar (that is not closely tied to a product). I still haven't had the chance to experience what working in a R&D team would feel like so any input on that is always appreciated.  
slowly over time, I realized more and more that in general, I like to code. I would often spend hours watching a conference on a new tool/framework or just about anything related to software Engineering in general. I switch between some of my pet projects sometimes and wanted to make a game for commercial purposes but some (or most) of them died out amidst my search for jobs for a living and the stress that comes with it.  
  
As a result, I started doing some research on how I can leverage my skill/love for Software Devlopment in a way that would let me stay connected to the field but not in a agile/scrum environment where the stress of work takes the joy of the field (for me at least). Looks like there is not clear answer to this as freelancing is a race to the bottom, any kind of work related to Academia requires unusually high Academic credentials to even be considered as a potential applicant, starting a small software company on my own is a different ball game (open to the idea but no clue where to start). Lately, I have been thinking how I can get into slightly non-technical or completely non-technical role where my expertise as a Software Developer may come handy but for most of such jobs, I feel like I am over-qualified for any of the technical help the job may require and under-qualified for the non-technical skills (Maybe some people are meant to enjoy Software development only as a hobby?)  
  
**My skillset and conclusion**  
  
So, I am quite in the dark right now when it comes to looking for a new career. I can only work in Canada for now. However, I am open to relocating to any province for the right job. Any input/suggestions based on my post is highly appreciated. I need some guidance from people who may have been through something similar or have the knowledge to shed some light on this. Thank you!

14hb50r,Advanced Diploma completely free for or Startup Job building full-stack application,"Hey all. I have a huge decision to make and I am almost lost.  
Background: 28 year old dad with 4 kids, wife and house  
I worked in the rail industry as a labouror for 6 years before getting injured. Because of this, I am going through workers comp who is covering my education (3 year advanced diploma). I am currently in my **second semester**.   
Before going to school, in my spare time I took 7 Udemy / coursera courses in full-stack and unity development, built some pretty big solo projects and gained a ton of experience. Because of this, I was honors list in semester 1, and semester 2, I am sitting at 90's across the board in all my classes. All while paying very little attention to class, and tutoring my classmates (certified with my school).  


I had an interview with a startup, who offered me a full-remote position at 80k. This is more than what worker's comp pays me (about an extra $1200 a month after tax), but I would also lose my paid for schooling. The job is building a website, and doing the backend API and database work. I would be building it all myself while the rest of the team handles the actual application.  I live in a very low cost of living area (not GTA or even close, really) and the position is full remote  


I have built full-stack apps before, and they sit in my portfolio. I DO feel like this is a bit out of my skillset, however I believe that I can rise to the occasion. I have also discussed them setting aside money in case I need to bring a contractor in to help me at some point which they have allowed.  


I am terrified of giving up a free ride in school to take a job and ultimately get in over my head. Any advice would be super appreciated. I know most people will say experience > school, but what happens if I get fired a month in?",2023-06-23 22:01:16

13dmvf0,"I live in Sweden, but in 2025 planning to start studying at a college in Canada.","I realized that I should have asked this here much earlier. 

Sweden is already my second country. As an adult student, I have recently gotten my GED. I don't particulary hate Sweden, but I would prefer a country where English is the first language much, much more.

I met someone while studying here, they're from Canada (they live around the GTA), and I'm planning to follow them when they move back home to continue their studies. That being said, my GED doesn't have incredible GPA except for highest marks in sciences and English which makes me unable to get into a uni. I could fix those grades, but at the same time even if I had, universities are just too expensive to start out with. Hence, the plan is to start at a college and if I don't manage to start working during or straight out of my diploma program, I will transfer my credits to a university. 

I'm looking to find out more information and answers to the questions that come to mind:

1. Which colleges around the GTA (1h commute radius) are worth looking into based on the quality of the program, job prospects, facilities, etc? Currently, my first choice is Sheridan.

2. I've been told that colleges aren't looked down upon by employers and they're especially great because of their Co-Op programs. I would love if somoene could tell me more about this.

3. What does the job market look like in the area right now?",2023-05-10 10:47:36

I’m not sure what to do next and just seeking for advice.

Did apply to other jobs and got to a final round interview for a SA intern position, but pretty sure I bombed the technical part.

I work for a company that I didn't initially want to join, but I saw it as a good opportunity since I was a newcomer to Canada. However, a lot has changed since then and I no longer want to stay with the company due to toxic relationships and bullying. I am actively searching for a new job, but I am hesitant to include this company on my resume as it has a bad reputation. I also don't want potential employers to contact them for a reference.

However, I'm concerned that my new employer may find out about my full-time employment history in Canada using my SIN or other means. Is there a way for them to access this information?

# Common Resume Mistakes - READ FIRST AND FIX:

* Remove career objective paragraphs, goals and descriptions
* DO NOT put a  photo of yourself
* Experience less than 5 years, keep your experience to 1 page
* Read through [CTCI Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) to understand what makes the resume good, not necessarily the template
* Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience
* Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below) and pick STRONG action words. Do not pick weak ones - ones such as ""Worked"", ""Made"", ""Fixed"". These can all be said stronger, ""Designed"", ""Developed"", ""Implemented"", ""Integrated"", ""Improved""
* Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense
* Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. **Using an IDE is not a skill,** but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not. **VSCODE IS NOT A SKILL**. Neither are Jira and Confluence. If any non-CS person can open it up and use it, it's not a skill.
* Overloading skills - Listing every single skill, tool, IDE you've ever opened is not going to appeal to recruiters and will look like BS. Also remember that anything you list is **FAIR GAME TO TEST** and if you cannot answer that deeply about it, remove it.

19ccygq,Postgrad options in Data Analytics,"Hey there! I have a degree in management engineering, been working as an associate product manager for 2yrs in retail, my duties are mainly oriented towards supplier management and category development. Always liked analytics but never took it seriously. I took some courses at CodeAcademy in SQL, Python, BI. My Excel skills are pretty advanced, can code macros and manipulate data w/o problems. 
 
Rn I’m trying to advance my career to something more data analysis oriented, but I feel I need more education on the subject. since I work FT and the current job market is not the best,  I don't think can quit my job to study FT CS. It looks like a certificate is my only choice. I believe my options are the uWloo Data Sc Certificate (WatSpeed) or the PL-300. Not sure about BrainStation or a bootcamp.

191w6kz,Math major and CS minor or extra 1-2 years CS major and Math minor,"Hi everyone so I’m looking for some advice on my predicament. Currently I’m in my 3rd year of a Math program at Queens’s but I’ve just recently decided I want to get into the tech sector for my career. I have taken a couple CS courses and I would be able to graduate with a math major and CS minor by December 2025. However I believe that having a CS major would set me up better for getting a CS job post grad.

Ideally I’d transfer into the Computing major at Queens for this fall and then finish April 2026 with a Computing major and math minor, but the issue is that I’ve heard that transferring into Computing as an upper year at Queens is basically impossible. 

So what I’m thinking is I can either a) Continue my math degree and obtain a CS minor as well. Or b) Try to be admitted into other Universities which have CS programs and hope that I can have enough of my credits transfer so that I can graduate with a CS degree and math minor sometime between April 2026-Dec 2026.

Additional info is that I have a job where if I worked full time I’d make 70Kish a year but there is not much job or salary growth within it. So I’d be able to financially support myself just fine if I didn’t land a job immediately upon graduating with the math major and CS minor. Thanks everyone!",2024-01-08 21:12:17

16piin4,What Degree/Career Should I Do?,"What degree should I get?

Just to dive right in, I’m trying to figure out which avenue to go down here career wise. Figured this would be a good place to ask.

So I’m about to graduate with Psychology degree (Quite random) and am trying to decide what to do for my next degree. For some context, I have some requirements I’d like my next degree to meet. 

A: I need to be able to find jobs from my next degree. I don’t want to get a degree that I then need to get a Masters or a PhD before I can actually get hired.

B: I do actually want to get multiple advanced degrees. So whatever I pick next, I’d like to be able to build off of it to a PhD or Masters (If it isn’t a masters already.) 

With that being said, my current interest is bordering around Data Science. I know everyone and their dog wants to get into Data Science, and it’s highly saturated (at least that’s what I’ve heard) but I figure with the proper education that relates to Data Science, a lot of doors open. I do enjoy both statistics and coding, though my knowledge of each is very mediocre and base level. I was thinking of getting an Applied Stats undergrad degree to prepare for a Masters in Data Science and Analytics, and then learn code on the side. But then I figured, with the stats I’ve already gained from my Psyc Undergrad, I could stand to learn more from the Coding/Computer Science side. However, the second I think that, then I think, “I’m going to do Computer Science, why not just go be a Software Engineer?” 

Anyways, my apologies for the length. If any of you have any advice or insight into any of these degrees or career fields, let me know!",2023-09-22 19:05:56

164hru8,CS Student - Potential Internship Opportunity In The Future. How To Proceed?,"Hello,

I'm currently enrolled in a three-year advanced diploma program in CS (might pursue bachelor after) and I have a great opportunity. I have been hired by a software tech-company that was founded roughly 10 years ago. The job I have been hired for is related to customer-support, basically troubleshooting and stuff. Its an entry-level, non-cs related job. Anyone can do it really. Here's the thing, I believe this will be a great opportunity for me to eventually transition away from this current role, and into a software-related CS internship, basically getting hired from within the company.

 Now I realize I will need to perform really well at the current job. Its part-time and can work up to 40 hours if I want. Its a hybrid-environment so we work from home and go into office couple days a week. Going into office would give me a great opportunity to meet others who have CS/Engineering related roles.

Do you guys have any general tips, suggestions or anything? Obviously in such a competitive field, this seems like a golden opportunity. How should I communicate my intentions about potentially getting an internship etc? I haven't started the role yet, will in a couple weeks. Thanks in advance",2023-08-29 12:56:48

14q7fsf,Friends say I messed up not choosing Waterloo,"Hi all,

I've been trying to navigate this topic mentally, and I appreciate any outside perspectives on it! 

TLDR: 

* CS new grad
* My friends say I messed up choosing a full ride + internship program at a low rep university (York University), over Waterloo software engineering
* I am staying at my internship company full time, but my friends say choosing this route had definite cons (e.g. low rep school on resume, weaker career start)

I'm lucky to have had the full ride and internship opportunity, but at the same time I'm having trouble refuting my friends' points and it's starting to make me feel regret and fear that I missed out. More details below!

----------

I'm a CS new grad, and I have some friends (still studying CS in other programs) who often bring up how I chose not to go to Waterloo software engineering and instead took a full ride program at York University, where I would intern at a Canadian company called Shopify. I spent a lot of time on the decision back then, basically I felt that the latter would have a better work life balance; I would be able to get a similar amount of experience (duration-wise) throughout my internship compared to multiple coops, and there was peace of mind of not worrying about school costs and job hunting while in school. Lastly I would be able to graduate in 4 years instead of 5, so perhaps the extra year might be beneficial e.g. accumulating full time work experience.

My friends tease that I fell for an ""easier way out"" (a less pressured uni experience), sort of implying it was a sacrifice of long term career. For example they say my resume will now always be that much harder to get past screening (e.g. screened because of low reputation school), I missed a stronger network of Waterloo grads, and I missed out on getting a stronger set of internships (e.g. in the US) that would have put me in a better financial and career position. 

One friend was saying they know Waterloo friends who are interning or have interned in the US, and over the course of multiple coop placements were able to earn at least what I did if not more, including what I saved in tuition. And that they also get bigger company names on their resume plus Waterloo school reputation. In terms of graduating a year later, they said taking the extra time is not that big of a deal since it meant a stronger career start (which is a strong indicator of career direction) through coop and reputation, compared to graduating earlier with a weaker start.

To take a step back, I did still enjoy having less pressure in my uni experience, but the recent chats with my friends have planted the thought that I've basically chosen a path that is more average (less pressure but less results), compared to people who accepted more rigour from Waterloo and are reaping greater rewards for it. I know in general it was a privileged position to be in either way, like I am grateful to not have student debt and to have a full time job where I enjoy the work. In the sense of gratefulness/privilege I feel like I don't have a right to concern about this, but despite that I'm having trouble now reconciling with the sense of ""what if"" and the sense that I did indeed mess up career-wise in some sense (e.g. a low reputation school permanently on my resume). 

I've been browsing here and r/cscareerquestions about it and while I've heard a lot of comments saying you don't need to go to a prestigious school to go to big US companies, I see other comments saying it definitely makes things easier (getting to interview stage, getting referrals from network etc.). And generally no matter how much I see the idea that school doesn't matter, I also always see comments where Waterloo is in the discussion saying Waterloo is a no brainer, it is on a way different league than every other Canadian uni, etc. so it feels like there is reason to believe it does make a difference. Is there anything off with my perspective on things? If it truly was a mess up in some ways, how do I deal with that feeling of comparison? Thank you for any perspectives on this.",2023-07-04 06:49:57

13qo1n5,Confused about BMO/TCS contract onboarding taking forever,"Just wanted to ask if anyone here has had experience/knows anyone with experience onboarding BMO as a contract developer, or have any experience with onboarding at WITCH companies ( such as Tata consulting). It's been almost 2 months since I accepted my offer and I still don't know when I can start.

I got a job offer early April for a contract aws developer position at BMO, with two consulting companies in between me and BMO:

( me -> idc technologies -> TCS (Tata consulting) -> BMO )

I accepted a job offer from idc technologies on April 13, the background check took a really long time and after it cleared it was sent to TCS on May 3rd. I've been given two false start dates already (IDC said I would be starting April 24th, which was false, and TCS said I would be starting May 15 which was also false). Person working at TCS said I would receive laptop pickup details by Friday May 12, and that they sent my information to BMO on May 3rd. 

I don't understand why TCS would give me that start date and tell me I would have a laptop by May 15, when my information hasn't been processed by BMO yet. I only found out when I called BMO on May 12 that I wasn't in their system.

HR person at BMO said it takes 2 days to add someone to workday, but the person working at TCS said it takes 10 days to ""process paperwork"". It's already been 3 weeks since May 3rd, and I'm still stuck in the ""processing paperwork"" stage. HR department at BMO cannot provide me with any information since I'm not in their system ( no employee ID created )

Part of me thinks the job is cancelled/fake since the onboarding is taking forever, but I keep seeing job postings by BMO online, and also other consulting companies posting jobs for a ""big 5 bank"" which I'm pretty sure is BMO. I've also received a call from another recruiter asking if I was interested in applying for a job with BMO.

I'm just really frustrated after being given 2 false start dates, and also no updates from TCS/BMO on when I can actually start :(  TCS refuses to give me any information from BMO so that I can follow up with them directly. Would love some opinions on whether this is normal or not, since I've never worked a contract job before ( only full time positions )

137vypx,Should I go for Cybersecurity instead?,"Hello! I’m just having an difficulty deciding what I want to do with my life and hope I can find some clarity in this group

To explain a bit about my background, I moved to Canada to study on a college and get a “formal degree” because in my home country I studied by myself and learned stuff for Front End Development.

Before coming here I was able to get a good job in my country as a Front end developer and I worked in the code base of good brands such as Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler, etc. but the sad thing is that I worked there just 1 year because I got accepted to this canadian college so I decided to quit and move here. Therefore I’m far for been a senior dev.

Since a know a bit and I believe I’m a “decent-average FE Dev” I thought on applying here for a job but seriously I have applied to tons of jobs and I don’t hear anything back from them or the jobs requieres like 3000 years of experience and for what I understand the industry is going through a weird phase where a lot of layoffs and stuff is happening.

Today, the college is opening a position for an IT Support intern and I’ll definitely apply.

Let say that the interviews go well and I get the position, using this opportunity, would you go all in and start studying seriously to become a cybersecurity engineer? Giving the fact that most cybersecurity engineers starts on this position and also it appears that dev jobs are oversaturated (at least the junior positions) or would you still try to get a dev job?

If you ask me “choose what you prefer the most” Then I can’t decide based on that because I haven’t work in Cybersecurity so I don’t how it’s like to work in there. I have slightly preference towards development but I don’t mind going after cybersecurity either

I’m currently considering TRU as you can go through open learning and take courses at your own pace (i.e. I don’t need to quit my job).

Factors affecting decision:
- have a family (dual income at the moment)
- currently located in HCOL area
- could possibly make the jump to SDE and/or more pay without a degree if/when the market picks up or the right opportunity comes up. Managed to land a few interviews, but still getting screened out
- prefer structured learning
- courses look to be about $1k each after fees, etc.

# Common Resume Mistakes - READ FIRST AND FIX:

* Remove career objective paragraphs, goals and descriptions
* DO NOT put a  photo of yourself
* Experience less than 5 years, keep your experience to 1 page
* Read through [CTCI Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) to understand what makes the resume good, not necessarily the template
* Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience
* Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below) and pick STRONG action words. Do not pick weak ones - ones such as ""Worked"", ""Made"", ""Fixed"". These can all be said stronger, ""Designed"", ""Developed"", ""Implemented"", ""Integrated"", ""Improved""
* Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense
* Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. **Using an IDE is not a skill,** but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not. **VSCODE IS NOT A SKILL**. Neither are Jira and Confluence. If any non-CS person can open it up and use it, it's not a skill.
* Overloading skills - Listing every single skill, tool, IDE you've ever opened is not going to appeal to recruiters and will look like BS. Also remember that anything you list is **FAIR GAME TO TEST** and if you cannot answer that deeply about it, remove it.

12uoiof,Unemployment vs Mental health,"Okay, So the story is a little bit complex. 

In the Jan of 2022 I got a co-op for 8 months. Everything was great, I enjoyed working there, my team mates were amazing and the work was also interesting. After my co-op term I was hired as a part-time Junior Fullstack software engineer, because I was returning to school for finishing my masters. I was hired part-time for the last term of the year and then I was going to continue working for them full time. In the January I started working as a full time full-stack developer.

But low and behold, two weeks in and company announces layoffs. They fired all the junior engineers which even my manager was against it. 

Now, from the January to this day I have applied to almost 200+ companies and gave 2 interviews. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to secure an offer.

In the late March, I was approached by a former colleague to help managing and developing their clients website as part time while I search for full time job.

Now, The story begins.

I started working with this client. Basically, it’s a website built in gatsby.js and I have to make changes to their pages according to their needs.

The problem is that this client is really hard to work with. We have a task management system and they always negotiate the hours I put in. Even though I might have spent several hours working on the problem I was logging what I think a senior developer would have logged. Almost 20%-30% less time I am logging then I actually spend. On top of that there is no fucking thing like set of requirements, they change the requirements while I’m working on the task. They have two separate environment and I have to manually copy all the changes to the production after doing it for staging. Plus, they constantly fight with me about the number of builds I have to do on their servers because I made a mistake (because they changed the requirement mid-way).

TLDR; The work is shitty and there is nothing to learn, I’m the sole developer working with this person and there is literally no motivation for me to do this work apart from money. (Which is way worse then what I used to get paid in my co-op)

I have enough savings which would last me about a year even with my current lifestyle. But the market seems crazy right now and I don’t see anything happening until like 4-5 months and that’s scaring me. On top of that this part time work is not giving me enough time to learn and prepare for interviews.

So, the dilemma is should I quit this job and keep myself a little bit happy or keep doing the work and filling my pockets with peanuts?",2023-04-22 00:33:20

1aj96me,Feeling stuck: Switching from cybersecurity to software engineering in today’s market? Is it possible or even worth it?,"Hey everyone, I’m feeling stuck lately. My path has been pretty scattered compared to most of you… I graduated almost 3 years ago (2021) with a degree in electrical engineering (with a software internship where I worked as a full stack dev). After I graduated, I got a job in GRC (governance, risk, compliance) in the cybersec space, which wasn’t really my cup of tea. It wasn’t technically challenging, and involved a lot of documentation, meetings, compliancy reports, vulnerability management, etc. A lot of excel spreadsheets and presentations but not much code.

After about a year, I moved into a new role within data security, which involves database/server scanning for sensitive information, setting up firewalls, network access and installing security patches, etc. While this has been better than the first role, it still hasn’t been nearly as technical and fulfilling as I had hoped. I still dream of being able to write code, and work in a dev environment.

While going into cybersecurity wasn’t always my plan, I started out making over $100k in TC and I always figured since I have an engineering degree (albeit in electrical engineering), some React/JS/Django experience from my internship, I’d up my skills, grind leetcode and apply for a software engineering job after a few years.

But now with the market gone sideways, did I screw myself by working in cybersecurity these past few years? I don’t have real software dev experience besides my internship that was 4 years ago and some personal projects I’ve been working on.

While I realize I’m super lucky since many people are struggling to get any job, I don’t want to be stuck working in career I don’t truly enjoy for the rest of my life, but seeing the posts here really scares me.

I realize I have to put in hard work but knowing that at my current skill level and relatively 0 knowledge about the interview process, what recruiters in tech value more, I really don't know where to find help apart from the generic ""grind leetcode, build side projects"".  
I get that, but at my current skill level I'm still learning DSA properly and can solve a bunch of easies but have trouble with a lot of other easies, whereas for mediums sometimes a very nonefficient algorithm clicks with me and i can solve it but other times I get so confused.  
As for side projects I've decided on a bunch that I could start doing to follow my passions, but of course they'd take a lot of time that being a sophomore, I don't know if I have time to do. I've already started to kind of accept that I won't be ""tech prepared"" enough in time to secure an internship this summer, and this gap will look bad on my resume consdering I interned (non-software) in first year.  
So I'm seeking advice on all this, aka how to improve, what should be a realistic timeframe to do so, and other general tips on my CS journey.

18evjd4,"Confused between which industry to target, Web vs Robotics.","Hi guys. So I'm currently studying CS at Ryerson (Toronto Metropolitan) University.  


I transferred here from overseas this fall. In the past I've done a fair bit of work with Web Development, both frontend and backend. Built projects, worked with startups, etc. And I've also worked with Robotics. Albeit, relatively very basic stuff compared to what goes on in the industry.

As for web, I've worked with Vue, Svelte, just vanilla JS, and ejs templating for Frontend. I've tried React and Next but really don't like it so didn't go deeper. For backend I've used Express, Mongoose, OAuth, and fundamental stuff like that mostly. I do really like designing and building APIs, but haven't really touched deployment and that sort of DevOps stuff too much (I know the fundamentals of hosting and deploying applications but that's it).

My most intense experience with robotics has been with the university Rover Team of my previous uni with which I also attended the University Rover Challenge in 2023. I worked both on Web to build a WebGUI for the central dashboard as well as worked on the Rover Firmware written with Arduino Libraries and Python packages for ROS Noetic to control the rover.

So now that all the context is here, I'm looking for advice on which industry to focus on. I've really wanted to work in Robotics for a long time, especially in new and creative stuff.

16g6vn1,Recent Biology Grad Interested in CS,"Hi all! I (22) recently graduated from a Biology program which I went into because I thought I wanted to become a doctor. In January I started to question my choice as the money and time involved didn't fit my goals and I lost the passion for the human body I once had. 

I've always been interested in computers and how they work, I messed with software for video games and consoles in the past to hack them etc. I took an Intro to Programming course in the summer from my university and enjoyed the course. I learned Python and have previous experience in R from my bio-stats courses. 

As im still young I was thinking of going back to school to get my BSc in CS. I would like some input on what the best course of action should be. I live in Ontario and the degree would take me 2.5-3 years to complete depending on internships etc. 

I would want to start school again in January 2024 or if needed September 2024. What should I focus on during this time period?",2023-09-11 20:49:07
16a0q1a,Starting 1st Year Computer Science - Seeking Structured Learning for Internship Prep,"
Hey fellow Redditors!

I'm about to kickstart my 1st year at university, majoring in computer science, and I'm excited but also a bit overwhelmed. I've heard varying opinions about the importance of academics versus self-learning in the field, with some saying it's 40% academics and 60% self-study. Given that I won't have the opportunity for a work term (coop) until two years down the road, I'm eager to make the most of my time and prepare myself for future internships, ideally with top tech companies like FANG.

Here's my game plan: I want to dedicate 8 hours per week to self-learning. I would love to commit more, but I also need to balance it with university assignments, maintaining a good GPA, and working a part-time job to cover expenses. My programming skills are at an amateur level, and while many recommend learning from YouTube videos, that method just doesn't seem to click for me. I thrive on structured courses with clear targets and timelines, a habit I picked up from high school.

Given all these considerations, I'm on the hunt for a comprehensive course or resource that can help me acquire the essential skills sought after by big tech companies like FANG. I'm looking for something that provides a structured learning path, similar to what I'm used to, and covers the foundational topics needed for success in this field.

So, dear Redditors, do you have any recommendations for such courses or resources? Any personal experiences or insights on how to balance academics, self-learning, and part-time work in the computer science journey? Your guidance would be immensely appreciated as I embark on this exciting adventure! 🚀👨‍💻",2023-09-04 19:02:18
15grnw5,Need Career Advice Tech Consulting vs SWE,"Hi all,

  
I’ll be graduating from Northwestern University (USA) in December 2023 with an MS in CS (my BS is also in CS from Northwestern. I’ve done 3 internships (2 SWE (Backend and Mobile Development (Android)) and 1 Tech Consulting). I’ve also been a TA for 2 years and did a bunch of projects/research.My current internship told us that they won’t be giving out return offers because the company goes through a bumpy period. I was fairly confident that I’d get it and am not sure what to do now.

I’ve applied to over 100 positions in the past 3 weeks and nothing. Now, I know that the market for new grad/junior SWE is terrible right. So, my question is:

Should I go work for a tech consulting firm (there won’t be much coding) for 3-4 years and then go back into SWE when the market gets better?

I’m okay with not working in SWE for some time. However, eventually, I want to work in SWE industry because that’s what I like the most. This is why I’m wary of going into Tech Consulting now? How will the process of going back into the industry look like after 4 years of doing something very different? Is it even possible?

I am okay with going for Entry Level/Junior positions after 3-4 years at Tech Consulting.I’d appreciate any advice, tips, suggestions, and/or personal experience.

Thanks!",2023-08-03 02:34:10
14nl19d,Resume Review - July 2023 - Megathread,"As this sub has grown, we have seen more and more resume review threads. Before, as a much smaller sub this wasn't a big deal, but as we are growing it's time we triage them into a megathread.

All resume's outside of the review thread will be removed.

**Properly anonymize your resume or risk being doxxed**

&#x200B;

Additionally, please **REVIEW RESUME POST STANDARDS BEFORE SUBMITTING.**

# Common Resume Mistakes - READ FIRST AND FIX:

* Remove career objective paragraphs, goals and descriptions
* DO NOT put a  photo of yourself
* Experience less than 5 years, keep your experience to 1 page
* Read through [CTCI Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) to understand what makes the resume good, not necessarily the template
* Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience
* Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below) and pick STRONG action words. Do not pick weak ones - ones such as ""Worked"", ""Made"", ""Fixed"". These can all be said stronger, ""Designed"", ""Developed"", ""Implemented"", ""Integrated"", ""Improved""
* Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense
* Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. **Using an IDE is not a skill,** but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not. **VSCODE IS NOT A SKILL**. Neither are Jira and Confluence. If any non-CS person can open it up and use it, it's not a skill.
* Overloading skills - Listing every single skill, tool, IDE you've ever opened is not going to appeal to recruiters and will look like BS. Also remember that anything you list is **FAIR GAME TO TEST** and if you cannot answer that deeply about it, remove it.

14n71hn,Would you take a lesser title for slightly more money and benefits?,"My friend who works with the city just shared a posting for a 'User Support 2' agent. This role pays $32.00 -> $37.00 an hour. If I were able to land the top of that band, that'd be $74,000 annually.  
  
I currently make $72,000 as a Software Developer II.  
  
I'm thinking that going backwards into a Help Desk type role would be a negative to my portfolio (since I've gone from Help Desk -> SD1 -> SD2), but this would also be a tiny bump in pay, better pension, and probably better working conditions. I think the hit to my work experience is not worth the extra benefits, unless I knew I could fast-track to get back into the development side in a year or so.

Pros:

* Going to meet new people which will help in better cultural understanding
* Better and interesting engineering product

Cons

* 5 days on-site
* 3 hrs of commute for the day

Company B:

Pros:

* Better quality of product with good e2e and UT coverage
* Remote work provides flexibility
* 35hr work week requirement

Cons:

* Fully remote can hinder my cultural understanding and better team bonding
* Product is 15 years old, and they have moved 80% codebase to react, and thinking to move the rest 20% to react in next year.

13hp29r,How do I know when I'm ready for a senior position?,"I have about 4 years of experience at Amazon as a SDE-2 on a team owning some fairly critical systems. I've led projects to completion, mentored new graduates to SDE-2 positions and interns to full-time hire positions. In general, I'm quite satisfied with my position but I do like to keep my eyes and ears open for better opportunities.

Recently I've been exploring leaving my current job at Amazon due to tech stack and career growth concerns. For the most part, these concerns are around pigeon-holing myself in the proprietary Amazon internal technologies rather than getting experience in more modern and broadly used tech. I'd like to avoid downgrading my compensation substantially, so this is leading me to look at positions in the USA or remote positions for American companies. These are almost entirely senior engineer positions however.

My concern is that I am unprepared for a senior position. That by taking a risk and trying to move into a senior SDE role I'll end up losing a great job and fail (and ultimately lose) at my new role as well. These concerns are largely around the ability to perform technically in system designs which is weak point I am actively working on.

11ctzse,"Just applied to Texas Instruments for their Software Engineer position in Downtown Toronto, any advice?","Applied to Texas Instruments a while back and they gave me an online assessment which was medium difficultly. Once I completed that, the following day I received an email from my recruiter saying they invited me to do a 45 minute - 1 hour HR round.

The HR round went great, they asked me several behavioural questions like:

""What skills do you want to build in the next 5 years?"", ""What technology would you have learned, but weren't able to because it's growing at such a fast rate?"" etc.

Then the hiring manager gave me a link to 2 hackerrank questions about manipulating an array and utilizing heaps and 2 pointer questions. The interview was scheduled for 45 mins to 1 hour, but I started at 3pm EST and ended at 4:39 so a bit over 90 minutes which is double what I was expecting. I started the second question at 3:45pm and solved it in 10 minutes and came up with the most optimal way of solving. Right at 4pm he gave me ANOTHER question which I wasn't able to complete due to lack of time, but had I been given more time, I could've easily solved it.

I received a perfect score on question 1, then for the second question I overlooked a piece of detail but quickly fixed the code and ran what I had and got half of the test cases. I explained to him if I had more time I would debug, write conditions to handle edge cases etc and he told me ""Don't sweat it, you were on the right track I'm sure you would've been able to solve it"" which was a huge reassurance.

The hiring manager told me they will get in touch in about a week, but I'm sort of nervous. Not sure if I made it to the next round, but I'm extremely hopeful. We spoke about salary range, the different technologies TI uses, the size of the team etc.

Now, my main concern is, is the next round. The final round is 2 hours in length and I have absolutely no clue what sort of questions they can ask.

I'm trying to land a summer internship in either data analysis or as a developer but since i have no 'relevant' work experience to put on my resume, it's definitely lacking as I only have some mid sized personal projects (nothing to really make myself stand out).  
I do however have experience in data entry in which I did work for a really reputable company while i was a student in my first two semesters. I also have another role in data entry for another very reputable company(one of the big banks in Canada) doing data entry as well.  
This leads me into my question. How bad would it be to change my title from Data entry Specialist/Clerk to Data Analyst intern. It wouldn't really be verifiable from the companies i would be applying to internships for and would probably boost my chances even just a little bit for landing an internship/co-op.  
I hypothetically could say that the company/ies I had worked for were accommodating and allow for me to transition into that role as an intern after I started school.

18ayx8n,What uni do I attend for CS?,"Okay I'm in a dilemma. I want to be a software engineer. I'm currently taking a gap year to figure out where I'm going to study CS. If I get into Waterloo, of course I'll go to Waterloo, but outside of that it's a little complicated:

From what I've seen on reddit, a universities co-op program, and by extension what industry experience you have once graduated is by far the most important factor in getting a job as an SE. (Just my impression, what do you think?) I'm trying to find the sweet spot between a good co-op program in a tech hub, that's not too expensive COL wise, and preferably isn't too far from my family (not a dealbreaker though).

Problem is the only tech hubs in Canada are pretty much Vancouver and Toronto. So my main dilemma is: 

**Do I attend a school in a city with cheaper COL but with worse tech opportunities (Like Edmonton or Calgary), OR do I attend school in a tech hub like Toronto or Vancouver and just deal with the higher COL (and therefore more student loan debt), but benefit from the greater amount of tech opportunities and big tech jobs?** (also the schools I've looked at in Vancouver/Toronto seem to have much better co-op programs than Edmonton or Calgary.)

If I go to a uni in one of the tech hubs, I rack up a lot more student debt, but I'll make 4-5 years worth of industry connections in a tech hub city by making connections at uni. And I benefit from more prestigious co-op opportunities (by prestigious I mean working for a company like Amazon vs working for a company like Teck. No hate to Teck though.) Jobs where software is the backbone of the company vs. just a necessary service to support the company's operations.

BUT if I go to a uni in a city like Edmonton or Calgary; I spend less money (therefore WAY less student debt), and there's no reason I can't just immediately move to Vancouver/Toronto after graduating right? I'd get co-op program experience in Edmonton or Calgary, and then use that previous experience to get a job anywhere in Canada? Or is it better to have city-specific experience?\*\*So here are my options:\*\*

UBC - requires you to get into the CS stream depending on your average from first year general science courses, I don't want to risk failing hitting that average and wasting that time/money (could just transfer to SFU if I fail, but I don't have a Chemistry 11 credit, so I can't get in unless I do upgrading). Great co-op program in the heart of a tech hub though, #2/#3 cs school in canada.

UofT - would be nice, it has a similar system to UBC, but it's average cutoff for getting into the CS stream is a little more forgiving. It is across the country from where my family lives though. (I'm from BC but closer to Alberta than Vancouver.) This isn't a dealbreaker. It's not like if I lived in Vancouver I'd be able to drive to my family anyway, I'd need a flight whether its from Toronto or Vancouver. Again, very good tech job opportunities, #2/#3 CS school in Canada, but high cost of living, more debt.

SFU - Basically UBC but without the annoying first year general science nonsense. I'm GUARANTEED to study CS if I go to SFU which is a MAJOR pro for SFU in my opinion. I still get the benefits of the Vancouver tech market, but with guaranteed CS admission, cheaper tuition than UBC, BUT SFU is apparently a hard commuter school with it being on top of a mountain. (Not a dealbreaker but not ideal).**NOTE FOR ALBERTA SCHOOLS:**

**Education spending cuts?** Can anyone tell me how Alberta's education spending cuts would affect my experiences at these schools? I've heard bad things about this.

UofAlberta - Edmonton is cheap (compared to Vancouver/Toronto). Edmonton is closer to my home than Vancouver, WAY cheaper cost of living/tuition compared to UBC or UofT. But the UofA SIP (Science Internship Program)/ and in general the Edmonton tech jobs scene is apparently terrible according to the UofA CS discord and a few opinions on reddit. Also if I understand correctly UofAlberta is like SFU in that if you're accepted to CS, you're guaranteed to study CS, you don't have to apply to it after first year, which is a bonus.

UCalgary - Calgary is cheap (compared to Vancouver/Toronto). Quite close to home. Same deal with SIP instead of a co-op program. (I'm not sure the difference really matters), but I don't know much about the quality of the co-op program. Anyone have experience with this? Also I think UCalgary DOES have the same system as UBC and UofT (applying to CS after 1st year).

**I'll be posting this in a lot of different subreddits, so can each sub give me info on your schools CS program (see questions below)? Or just your opinion on what I should do in general?**


1. How's your co-op program? Is there an internal job board? Are the co-op fees insanely high? Is it a waste of money/time? Is finding internships in your city incredibly difficult (obviously very difficult for EVERYONE right now, but is your city/uni worse than the norm?
2. How's your cost of living? What's a typical rent you can get away with in your city? (Mention anything, I don't care if you have 7 roommates, or you live in your own studio apartment alone, I'll take whatever info I can get.)
3. How's your campus life? Commuter school? Are school clubs active/fun? (obviously depends on the person).
4. How's the city life? Boring or tons to do?
5. Do you regret attending your school's CS program? What do you think the right choice from the options above is?

Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it, and I apologize for the long post.",2023-12-05 00:26:50
187xl8v,Am I doing okay? Need reality check...,"Hey guys. Hope you all are doing well.

I'm currently doing my Undergraduate in Computer Science at a Uni in Toronto. I transferred credits from my CS Undergrad back home (Bangladesh).

Now, I got into coding at quite a young age like when I was 10-12 years old. That's really really young for someone in my home country. Since then I've explored a wide range of fields. Web Development, Frontend, Backend, Desktop Applications, Mobile Applications, and Robotics are some of them. The most I've worked with is Web Dev and Robotics. When I say Robotics - it's a mix of both coding for Arduinos and ESPs as well as doing Python stuff for various higher level functioning (nothing lower level though like STMs). So far I really really love both Robotics and Backend, however I'm more interested in a career in Robotics. I also participated in the University Rover Challenge 2023 as part of the team in the University I used to go to back home. I contributed a lot of features and code to the system in just a span of 6 months and showed enough skill for the Advisor (professor), Lead, and Co-Lead to have been convinced that I was a must have addition to the team.

I do have a GitHub profile with various repositories about different kinds of stuff. I also have some experience working with Robotics, Ed Tech and eCommerce startups back home but those are very short experiences and neither of them are really around that much.

From what I can understand after talking to lots of devs, being in communities, doing projects and solving problems is that I am pretty good at at coding. I've been told that by some senior people as well and my problem solving/thinking has also been appreciated.

But whenever I go applying for internship roles or part time jobs I don't get responses and I also feel like I constantly fail to be up to date with the modern trends of the Tech market. I don't really understand a lot of the terms I get from other devs that I feel I should be familiar with. And I think it has largely to do with my learning being from mostly a purely practical approach and very little theoretical approach. I was using and making good algorithms and data structures well before I even knew what those actually meant.

Right now I'm trying to get part time developer jobs while I'm a student to get an early start on my career as well as earn some money but I feel completely lost by the lack of responses and from the lack of sense of direction. This keeps getting me thinking if I've just been built up to expect more than I'm worth by the people around me or if it's due to me doing something wrong like CV, Job Applications, or methods of approach.I would really really appreciate getting some feedback and perhaps reality checks from some industry professionals to understand where I'm going wrong. Any input is extremely welcome and appreciated.Thank you and sorry for the long ranty post but I felt like the context is important.

Was hoping to get some feedback on my career progression cause I feel like I'm at a crossroad of sorts.

Year 0 -> 1 salary: 55k (Job 1 )  
Year 1 -> 2 salary: 56k  (Job 2)  
Year 2 -> 3.5 salary: 110k (Job 3 - currently employed)  


I live in Vancouver and would love to be able to buy a not-shitty apartment in a not-shitty part of town but honestly don't know if that's even possible as a single person even with a FAANG-level salary in Vancouver anymore (unless base is above 200k CAD nowadays?)

Right now I'm pretty comfortable in my current job, however I feel like there's a very strong chance I get laid off in the near-term or the company just straight up goes under (start-up). So right now I'm in a position where it's essentially impossible to get a raise or promotion due to company finances, but I've shot out a slew of applications and have not received a single interview request (using my resume style that I've had zero issue getting interviews with in the past). 

Wondering how y'all think I'm doing as a fully self-taught developer and where I should expect to go from here in terms of salary as someone whose fairly ambitious. 

Also, wondering everyone's thoughts on how to level-up and plan for the future of in-demand software engineering skills. I am such a generalist and master of none that I think it might be better to focus on developing expertise in a specific part of the stack or industry instead of grinding Leetcode, so any ideas there?

I also try to implement design patterns wherever possible but again not at a stage where I can immediately identify which pattern I should use. 

Basically, I feel like I am lacking the rigour some folks with a CS background have. Also, I find myself window shopping CS courses, some that are super interesting and related to my field.

15cyfxu,Career Dilemma: Continuing remote contract or taking new government job offer,"Hello everyone,

I've been employed as an IT Support Analyst on an 18-month contract with an Ontario-based company since July 2021. Initially, I was assisting the IT Manager with daily activities while also covering for the IT Security Manager as he was assigned to an 18-month project. However, in September 2022, the IT Security Manager departed, and his responsibilities were divided amongst my co-workers and me.

Due to uncertainties with my contract and my significant other securing a job in Alberta, I relocated there in February 2023. Fortunately, I was allowed to complete my contract remotely. My contract was subsequently extended twice, first to July 2023, and then to December 2023, each time with the possibility of transitioning into a permanent position.

In June 2023, my manager discussed a potential permanent position with me, but it would require relocating back to Ontario as the plan involves being on-site four days a week. This role is projected to come with a better package, including added benefits such as an annual salary review and bonuses. It's expected to open around September.

Recently, a new IT Security Manager was hired on a permanent basis, which could impact my current responsibilities.

However, the timing is a bit tricky. The day my manager left for a two-week vacation, I received an offer for an IT position with the Canadian government. This job is a 12-month contract, offering a 5% better pay and has a clear intention of becoming permanent. I would need to start in mid-August, but with my manager away, I would have to give my two-week notice to his Director.

I don't want to burn any bridges as I've had a great working relationship with my manager, who has always advocated for my transition into a permanent role. However, he hasn't received much executive support. If anyone has faced a similar situation or can offer any advice, I would really appreciate your input. Thanks for reading and for any insight you can provide!",2023-07-29 17:54:56
15cbce2,Is learning CS overkill?,"Hello everyone,

I want to hear from CS professionals about my situation.

My basic background is that I will be graduating with a Business Degree in August, and I was recently hired for a government job (health authority in BC) for a staffing scheduling job. During the interview, the hiring manager said many of the staff schedulers eventually move onto other roles, and I liked that there is a pathway for a Data Analytics position down the line (atleast that's what she said). 

When I was having a hard time finding a job and was getting desperate, I was thinking about doing an online CS program from BCIT or any other place that offers flexibility. I figured with my previous co-op experience as a Business Analyst and programming skills will make me a solid candidate. But now that anxiety is gone, I am starting to think that it may be a bit of an overkill for data analytics. But, I found this online course about automating mundane office work with Python, so I might do that if my analytics path becomes concrete. 

Any  thoughts/suggestions from a programmer's perspective? For long-term goals, I want to stay in the public sector, maybe move to other health authorities or private company if the opportunity is extremely good. 

Any thoughts, comments, or past experiences are highly appreciated. Thanks for reading!

14t7pmg,"I'm A Laid-Off Engineer Who Wants To Switch To Cybersecurity Or Software Development - I Already Have A Bit Of Software Engineering Experience, But Not Much. Where Do I Go From Here? [Thorough Post]","Hi all,

Let me preface this by saying that I am in a little bit of a panic (not because of my laying-off - I was surprisingly very stoic and still am) because I am in a state of doubt. So with the hopes of getting as many answers as I can, maybe I can plot my next steps more accurately than throwing darts on a board and hoping it hits bullseye. Let me explain.

**Background**: I'm in Canada. I have a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering, with a focus on electronics(FPGA, embedded systems, circuit design, control systems, etc.), however, I quickly fell out of love with it when I reached graduation. I finished it - however, most of my co-ops were in high-level software roles (docker, pytest, DevOps, etc.) and for only 4 months each. Two of those were with internationally revered companies, which gave my resume the boost it needed. If you want a more comprehensive insight into my background, [I made a post about it right here in this subreddit, a couple of weeks ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/14lsejp/i_had_my_first_ever_laidoff_last_week_i_am_in_a/). If you participated in that thread, chances are a lot of the below information is familiar to you. So you can skip to the Current path part. 

3 weeks ago, I got laid off. The position was a Data Engineering and Analysis job - they promised to train us but most of their courses were foundational and the market wanted experienced people, not people who did courses. 

**Current Problems**: I am at a point where I am stuck (or at least I think I am).  I also don't want to waste time - I don't want to have a work gap on my resume. Hear me out:

A. I don't want to go back to electronics - in fact, I hate it (if I go back in time, I would only go for software engineering)

B. My experience with cloud stuff is foundational but it's going to take time - and I haven't experienced it fully enough to be confident in interviews

C. While I was employed, the only time that I ever used programming was Scala.....yeah. And that means I have forgotten how to do coding interviews or side projects for the programming languages that actually matter, like Python. SQL is also something I am interested in doing.

**My Current Path**: The software field is vast. And I have only a small insight into it because of my program (learned C, VHDL and Assembly because of embedded systems, then taught myself Python, SQL). 

I am currently doing 3 courses - 

1. AWS Cloud Foundations (finished course - awaiting exam for cert - then possibly doing the SysAdmin Associate course)

2. Google Cybersecurity Certificate on Coursera - which includes training in Linux, Python, SQL - about 40% done since starting 2 weeks ago

3. A python refresher course on udemy - about 60% done since starting 2 weeks ago

**Academics**: To make my situation even more complicated someone I know who did a masters in Software told me that I should go back to college and do a Masters in Software Dev or I.T. because it really helped him. In fact, a lot of people I worked with at my previous job had masters:

1. Would that be recommended, considering that I did not do a software engineering bachelor's ? 

2. If the market indeed wants practical knowledge, would more academic credentials help? 

3. In Canada, we have community colleges that offer professional certs (a semester), a diploma (2 years), or an advanced Diploma (3 years) in various areas, including in stuff like cybersecurity, IT, Data analysis and software development in general. CC's are good because they provide a lot of hands-on, but they are not powerful because a diploma < Bachelor's. 

**My Assumed Path - i.e. why I need your help**: 

Without any formal training, I don't know what path to take, but if it's anything, I know that practical knowledge >> theory, so I think my next move is to build a project using SQL and Python, however, concurrently, I want to upskill in as many areas as I can.

What I am thinking of doing next:

1. SysAdmin course on AWS then it's cert exam 

2. Either TensorFlow or Data Analysis with Python 

3. Either Web Dev or a new language, like C# or JS

My goal with these courses is neither perfection nor credentials, rather experience and confidence. I put my deadline to be the first week of August - when I should be Interview-ready. ***What do you recommend I do ?***",2023-07-07 13:43:19

I'm not sure if I'm being too confident to think that I'll be able to take on a MEng program after 4 years of work experience, or too pessimistic to think that I cannot :/
* Between college and MEng, how different is the job prospect? It would honestly be quite concerning for me to only have the salary of a college graduate at the age of 28.
* Do companies in Canada usually take into account one's prior work experiences in another country?
* Is it really \*that difficult to apply for co-op as some people say on reddit?
* Overall, is applying for a college program a better choice for me? 

I would really love any kinds of feedbacks or suggestions! All of them will be appreciated. Hope you all have a great day.",2023-06-19 18:23:22
14dii48,Looking for advice as a self-taught dev in this market,"Hey all, just wanna say thanks in advance for reading my post and sorry if its all over the place, any advice would be greatly appreciated, I'm a 25M for what its worth. I originally stumbled across CS in March 2021, decided to go the diploma route and enrolled in college for software dev in Sept 2021 but left after 1st semester for personal reasons. Beginning of 2022 is when I really decided to take it serious and have been going strong since. At this point, I feel pretty comfortable on both the FE/BE using the MERN stack because its what I've spent the most time in and if I don't understand something, I'm confident in my ability to learn and pick it up. I've also managed to get an internship at a consulting company that lasted about 8 months (just ended a few weeks ago). I've applied to maybe 30ish jobs but have gotten few responses and can't seem to make it past the preliminary phone screening/questionnaire. The farthest I got in the interview process was an CCAT assessment that wasn't even programming related. Right now, my plan is to learn WP development so I can freelance during the job search (while I continue to build more projects and hone my skills), or maybe get a job at an agency? (I feel the barrier to entry is a lot lower with those kinds of jobs and I'll take anything right now honestly lol). So my question is, should I continue down my path and grind it out? or should I go back to college to finish my diploma? idk if going the diploma route again would really help in this market though and it adds a few more years to the journey. Thanks again for reading.",2023-06-19 15:58:58
13yhtky,How many technical skills are required for this kind of project coordinator?,"Hi, I recently applied for a project coordinator position and got an interview, while I don't fully know how many technical skills are required and what is the role's position.  
  
This is an NGO for people with mental health issue, and the project is about creating an e-learning course for the service users using Moodle or Articulate Storyline. The job description stated that the applicants should be familiar with design-related software (like Premiere), as well as frontend knowledge (HTML, CSS, jQuery). It has only one interview and the interviewers background are not related to CS / IT at all.  
  
This is confusing to me because while they require applicants to have frontend knowledge, project coordinator seems not to be the person who is in-charged for writing code. The interview will not have code test too. I even didn't show any of my website project, just mentioned I am studying a CS master's degree and built website before.  
  
Can anyone who worked for similar position in NGO, or familiar with the job, share how many technical skills I should know?",2023-06-02 16:45:40

I'm gonna be spending the next few months in between vacation/family trips and some other commitments before I start my new grad full-time software dev job in January, and I've been trying to think of some ways I might be able to use my programming and tech background to make some money and spend my downtime. I wouldn't be able to work for more than 3 weeks straight in the summer and maybe over 2 months straight in the fall, making it a bit difficult to be hired by a company for such a short time frame, so I'd want to pursue something that either has a flexible/short time commitment, or something I can do on my own time. Here are some things I thought of so far:

- Find some short-term projects to do for local businesses or startups
- Tutoring
- Freelance web dev, although this seems a bit hard to break into with decent returns
- Developing some sites or apps and making money with ads or through a SaaS model
- Becoming a youtuber, lol

Since I graduated recently I think some might say I should just take it easy and enjoy my time off before I start my full-time job, but I do have some time set aside for that already! If you guys would have any other ideas for my situation I would love to know, thanks!",2023-05-24 20:16:42

1377flu,cloud engineering vs application development?,"15 YOE - 8 years as devops/cloud eng ; 7 years as developer (primarily backend)

Tech stack: Azure / AWS, python, terraform, SQL, kotlin+Springboot, shell scripting, Ruby, JS (limited JS experience), HTML, CSS (limited in UI/UX), jenkins, and bunch of other cloud/devops tools.

Currently working as cloud engineer.

For past 1 year now, I am finding it extremely boring - 'coding' is pretty much just terraform or yaml based configs - and terraform sucks when it comes to azure. Have only written maybe 200 lines of python code in past 2 years. Before that, I was heavily coding in python for 4 years.

I am making good money though - 150K+bonus.

At current rate, I am losing my 'hard' engineering skills rapidly. Either I bite the bullet, knock out the cloud certs and TOGAF and go for the 'cloud architect' / 'enterprise architect' role.

OR

I start working on picking up Java and springboot, gradle, SQL, etc. and pivot to backend java development at some bank / insurance company.

I reckon, where I am right now, it would be 2-3 years either track I choose. Plus, I don't know the typically base salary from banks/insurance companies for sr. java devs and java architects in Toronto/GTA.

I really need to motivate myself so I can get my sh!t together and get the cloud certs  - I just have AZ900 for now. And haven't worked on k8s either.

12r4s1k,Advice - 2nd degree international student,"Hello! I’ve been having a dilemma for a bit and needed some advice. 

I’m an American who decided to pursue a second bachelors degree in computer science in Canada (I’m unfortunately in a state where not many colleges/universities around me admit 2nd degree students). 

With the job market as it is right now, I understand internships and co-ops are important. I’m having a bit of a problem deciding on which university to go to so I would like any insight!

The main universities I have been looking at are UWindsor and AlgomaU, primarily due to their discounted tuition rate for Americans. Both have dedicated 2nd bachelors in CS for university graduates programs. 

UWindsor has a 1 year “3-year general degree” and 1.5-2 year “4-year honors degree”. I like it’s location as it’s close to Michigan. However the program does not have co-op. Should I risk attempting to get internships for the summer terms?

AlgomaU has similar options and has co-op but I’m unsure about the quality of the program. I checked their spring course offerings for CS and a decent chunk of it was online (I’d rather be in-person). However American students pay same rate as Canadian students which is a big plus. 

I’ve also researched just normally applying as a transfer student to other universities (USask, UManitoba, etc.), but the problem arises in transfer credits. According to their policies, I’d have to provide course syllabi for every class I’d like to transfer credit for. The website my school used for classes auto-deletes term info after a while (and so taking the syllabi with it). I could attempt to contact my school again for the syllabi but am unsure of the success rate. 

What should I do? Any advice is appreciated!",2023-04-18 21:18:22

128e9cd,Fairleigh Dickinson VS Northeastern VS Concordia,"Hello guys, I got four offers from those three universities, but find some difficulties about which one to choose. Could you share some pros and cons of these institute? Thank you!

As for FDU and NEU, I guess many people might not heard of before. Let me be more specific.

1. Fairleigh Dickinson University's Vancouver campus, Master of Science in Applied Computer Science. 

\-> Basically it is not a 'university', it is a satellite office of an American private university.

2. Northeaster University's Toronto campus, Master of Professional Studies in Informatics and Master of Professional Studies in Analytics.

\->  It is a satellite office of an American private university too.

3. Concordia University, Master of Engineering in Quality System Engineering.

\-> A public Canadian university located in Montreal.

&#x200B;

I'm current working as an Application Developer in my home country and my main goal of doing my master's in Canada is to get a PR. For each one I have some concerns:

* It seems that FDU is my best choice since BC province has the nicest pnp policy for STEM graduates. But I'm still worry about my future career, I'm worry about this degree wouldn't help me with my future job hunting at all and people might have never heard of it.
* NEU's ranking is much higher than FDU, and it provide CO-OP. But I'm not sure about the CO-OP, will the school provide some opportunities or does the student have to find their own? 
* As for school's name, real campus, Concordia is definitely the best choice. But to be qualified to apply to Quebec's pnp, you have to achieve B2 in French and have local work experience for at least 12 months. It seems so hard for foreigners. (so sad)

I've read that interns aren't technically considered employees since they don't receive benefits and they have a set time contract (please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm not sure if that means that I should include my current internship experience in my employment history or not? Does being an intern technically make me considered ""being employed""? FWIW, I've included my current internship in my resume when I applied for the position at the bank as ""Professional Experience"".

They also ask if they can contact my current employer: do I say yes or no? Should I let my current manager know about this in advance if I say yes? Is saying ""no"" a red flag, especially since I haven't had any prior experience in software dev?

11kprt6,Resume Review - March 2023 - Megathread,"As this sub has grown, we have seen more and more resume review threads. Before, as a much smaller sub this wasn't a big deal, but as we are growing it's time we triage them into a megathread.

# All resume's outside of the review thread will be removed.

Additionally, please **REVIEW RESUME POST STANDARDS BEFORE SUBMTITING.**

**Properly anonymize your resume or risk being doxxed**

# Common Resume Mistakes - READ FIRST AND FIX:

* Remove career objective paragraphs, goals and descriptions
* DO NOT put a  photo of yourself
* Experience less than 5 years, keep your experience to 1 page
* Read through [CTCI Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) to understand what makes the resume good, not necessarily the template
* Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience
* Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below) and pick STRONG action words. Do not pick weak ones - ones such as ""Worked"", ""Made"", ""Fixed"". These can all be said stronger, ""Designed"", ""Developed"", ""Implemented"", ""Integrated"", ""Improved""
* Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense
* Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. **Using an IDE is not a skill,** but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not. **VSCODE IS NOT A SKILL**. Neither are Jira and Confluence. If any non-CS person can open it up and use it, it's not a skill.
* Overloading skills - Listing every single skill, tool, IDE you've ever opened is not going to appeal to recruiters and will look like BS. Also remember that anything you list is **FAIR GAME TO TEST** and if you cannot answer that deeply about it, remove it.

As I transition into the next phase of my education, I have been  trying to seek a co-op opportunity in MERN stack development, but despite my efforts I've struggled to get a one.  
  
I learned about DevOps during my PGD, where I got the hang of Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, and GitHub Actions. I thought I'd explore co-op options in this field and landed a position with a company that helps industries deal with tough weather and terrain.  
  
Here's what they do: they help companies remotely manage stuff like generators and control electricity/fuel theft by collecting data from different equipment. Now, they want me to help them scale their servers using Kubernetes.  
  
In terms of the role, the company relies on physical servers to which data is sent by devices using Raspberry Pi to record data from generators. This data is then transmitted to the cluster. If a customer wants to access previous data in larger chunks, the company needs to scale their servers, which is where Kubernetes comes into play.  
  
My responsibilities will include learning how to configure and operate Ubuntu on a server, as well as scaling their bare metal servers with a Kubernetes cluster using K3. While I have experience working with cloud environments but never with this bare metal server scaling.  
  
Given the current job market challenges, I'm deliberating whether this role aligns with my long-term career goals. Would pursuing a career path in DevOps be beneficial in the long run, considering the industry landscape?

Am I too old and will be starting my career too late?","I'm 24 years old and already have an environmental science degree from UBC, but I have always really wanted a post secondary qualification in computer science as well because I have already self-taught myself quite a bit about programming since I was a teenager and now more and more want to have a formal CS education and pursue a career in tech. I honestly didn't do that well GPA wise at my last degree, so I already know I can't get into the UBC second degree program, so I'm looking at either a 2-year CS second degree at SFU, or if I can't get into that, the 2-year CST then the 2-year BScACS program at BCIT. 

However, assuming I go with BCIT, I'm really apprehensive about spending another 4 years working on another degree. I'm 24 now and assuming I start this September, I'll be 29 by the time I graduate, and I can't help but be worried that I will have missed out on precious time in my 20s to actually build up my career. If I graduate at 29 and only start looking for entry level programming jobs then, will that be a significant detriment to my potential career in CS? Will I be significantly less competitive than the 21 year olds who did the same program at BCIT straight out of high school? Since I currently only have service industry work experience and I assume my other non-CS degree will be totally irrelevant when trying to find CS jobs?

I also don't know what kind of transfer credits I'd be eligible for at BCIT. I did take two first-year CS courses and one second-year CS course at UBC (CPSC 110, 121, 210), but searching through BCIT's resources I couldn't determine if those would be eligible for any relevant transfer credits in the CST program or if that would reduce the number of years I'd have to spend there.

How much harder would it be to start a CS career from scratch at 29 if I don't have any existing CS experience? I know I'm interested in CS because I'd been interested in it since I was a teenager, but career wise is it something that would even be worth pursuing or am I better off trying to start a career *now* with my current degree? I'd really appreciate perspectives from other people who have completed one degree and then did/are doing another degree in CS.",2024-01-18 07:11:42

18pfc5b,Question about how to develop proficiency,"I'm a comp sci graduate from South America, and I've always wanted to eventually move to NA after having lived there for a couple years. I settled on aiming for Canada for a variety of reasons, but after graduating I started noticing I feel pretty lost in the tech industry, since my education was more focused on computational theory than anything practical. Maybe I'm just wrongly assuming everyone knows everything about the entire field and I need to as well, but I honestly have no idea how to even learn about the concepts used in practice in the industry or how a project might go about being developed. I see a lot of terms being used around like APIs and tech stacks, but even after learning the definition of these terms, I have no idea what working with them would be like in a real commercial environment. I've tried doing a couple ""follow along"" projects but they just left me confused and thinking that there's far more to it than was being covered that I would need to know.

One year ago I managed to get a job at a bank down here in the DBA team, due to the one small internship I managed to get during university(and that it is sort of a government job that you can get by passing a selection process that consists of just 1 academic style exam), but I don't know if databases are where I really wanna focus. I wanted to give programming a shot, and I believe I can get a sort of internal internship here with one of the dev teams, but I also recognize that a South American bank probably doesn't live up to the standards of Canadian companies.  That's why I was thinking of doing a Post Grad or Masters course in Canada to fill in these blanks and get me a headstart in eventually immigrating.

So I wanted to get your opinions on if I'm way off on trying this, if I'm better off going to a bootcamp or something, if I should really just hedge my bets getting experience in the bank, or, if the Masters/Post grad is a good idea, recommendations of places and courses would be appreciated. 

Thanks for reading, and happy holidays!

By the way, I wouldn't lose the job at the bank going off to do the Post grad/Masters. My position would just be ""frozen"", so I wouldn't be getting paid but could come back any time without needing to go through the selection process again.",2023-12-23 21:19:29

I recently came across a document that was given viewing permissions to anyone within the organization that had everyone's pay.

18hx79u,My plan to go from leader to IC by 2025,"My history: I was a developer mostly asp.net/C# until around 2015 when I went into management.   I’m actually a better developer now than I was back then when it comes to composition and testing.    My first management job was a Java dev team and was my happy place.   I could take a bug on once in a while, help developers through work and their careers.    Work with architects BAs and PMs.  The company later did a transformation and created scrum teams where managers were a step removed and only dealt with people/HR stuff.

Fast forward I climbed the corporate ladder and ended up a director where I hated how I told people what to do and didn’t get the satisfaction of being a part of building anything. 

I left for a manager web dev role at a bad company where I thought I would be part of a next.js rewrite but ended up maintaining a legacy Perl app and managing the dev team.

I left again for a software development lead role where I thought I’d finally made it based on the job description and interviews asking about languages and skills but I don’t lead a team or anything tangible.   I’m rather the directors “look into x” or get me a report of the dev projects person.

So now I’m giving up and wanting to go my developer chops back rather than find a lead/manager role with the hope of development. 

I have a portfolio which includes projects in python, node/express, flutter and react.    The python app is a kivy app that runs on a rpi which I’m currently putting into an iOS app in flutter.   The others are nothing crazy.     They are all part of my diy Photobooth that I rent out at parties and allow social sharing and texting of pictures.   

So this is the plan for 2024.   I get around an hour a night to myself so this is a slow burn  

1.  Relearn C# as my backend language using the book recommended on a different sub.  Make a windows version of my app to keep me engaged.   C# seems more popular in my area. 

2. Keep working at my current job since I have the title that says software development in it and take any training like Aws.

3.   Leetcode?

My questions if you made it this far:

1.   See anything wrong with this?
2.   Do you think I can jump back in as an intermediate?
3.  At this stage do I still put projects on my resume?
4.  Can a fairly new employee at a company ask for a demotion at some point?
5.   Am I doomed if I’m over 40",2023-12-14 01:39:24

My community college offers co-op and a pathway to transfer to a university. It is for computer programming and it requires math which I am honestly bad at. Would it be realistic to prepare myself to start in spring? Would that lead to a career in cybersecurity or software engineering? 

Or should I take my chances and try UX design which is more familiar to me. My college also offers a co-op program that leads to a degree in art/media design.

I’m in a bit of a dilemma I currently attend a college in Ontario studying Software Engineering Technology it is a three year diploma. I first started at the same school doing the two year diploma but after seeing how bad the market was in my final semester I decided to switch into the three year program so that I can be apart of their CO-OP program. 
The problem is after asking multiple times if I was eligible to switch into the CO-OP program and getting a yes from everyone I spoke to at the school I ultimately was not eligible since I had completed 4 semesters of the program (most of the courses I completed were from the two year program). I now don’t know what to do since I will be graduating sometime this year and I was recently laid off from my Technical Support Specialist job. I think it might be best to just finish the diploma with no internships or CO-OP and apply for a CS degree at one of the non-target schools in the GTA that do accept 3 year college diploma’s and move you into a CS degree (most likely will be placed into third year) but I feel like I’m stuck in between a rock and a hard place here. Most of the internships I have applied to have either not responded or sent a rejection email.

I am a 29 y/o paramedic who has been working for the past few years in Ontario. Although I do enjoy the jobs, it has become apparent to me that it is not a sustainable career moving forward for the next 20 years. I make \~ 2500$ bi-weekly after tax and it is decent money but there is not a lot of room for growth in this career trajectory. 

I have not finished my undergrad degree in health sciences but did relatively well in paramedic school due to being a goal orientated person. I have gained in interests in software field as I have friends and family involved in private and government sector and tend to envy their work from home/anywhere with an internet connection abilities. 

As mentioned before, I am a goal orientated person and do require structured learning. I have attempted self paced multiple introductory courses such as CS50 in the past. 

My question is what would you recommend to someone in my situation. I am able to learn and pick things up relatively quickly involving degrees of technicality. The aim is to put in work while also juggling my paramedic job. Would you recommend a university route? What are your thoughts on going the diploma route? What fields of CS would you recommend a new comer to focus on in this market?

 I am not looking for an easy way forward but rather need assistance in aligning my goals/north-star. An ideal situation would be to be working in western provinces of Canada and making my current salary or more.

16uzkc9,Community college vs Online University,"Hi again,
I was going to start community college (centennial most probably) from January 2024 for Software Engineering technology 3 years and have co-op. My main goal here is to land internships and get some formal education until the market becomes somewhat normal.

I have been learning code for about two years and was trying to land a position as self-taught but his year I stopped getting replies from companies at all. So instead of wasting more time I decided to get some formal education. 

But recently I discovered online universities like Athabasca University and CSU Global campus. That provide online bachelors in computer science and has nearly no major requirements. These are also accredited universities. And from what I heard bachelors is always better than college diploma.

I only have two concerns:
1. They both are text based but I think I can power through them.
2. Does not offer co-op. They are self paced so I think I can get internships whenever I feel ready I guess?

Would love to know what you guys think is the better option.

Since the situation is extremely bleak, and its almost next to impossible to get a job these days in my main field of expertise (i..e **Mobile Development with 10 YOE**) , folks that I have talked to have suggest I pivot to either of the following 2 fields:  


1) **Project Management**: Would it pair well with my current experience?. There seem to be several certifications available in local community colleges and even one by Google which is completely online: [https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management). Will any of these certs even matter or help my application for suppose a product owner type of role? Or should I aim for something else ? ( Jr product owner? not sure if something like this even exists)  


2) **Cloud computing**: Aws, Azure , GCP have several certifications available and there is a good amount of reading and learning material online. So the question is again, would this pair well with my experience? I would assume no, since I have only done some very very basic deployment related stuff on AWS using S3/EC2 etc.    


However even if it doesn't pair with my current experience, and I start fresh from 0, is this something worth doing in 2023..given the state of the market? Or is everyone and their grandma also getting Cloud certs and flooding the market?

I was very fortunate to do an UX internship during that time (no UI involved), followed by a UX research internship after graduating in 2022. What I learned that I am very open to various work in the tech field but my design degree was not ideal for current market.

I wanted a proper tech-related degree so I worked really hard to get in **UBC's second degree Bachelor of Computer Science Program** and **UofT's Master of Information (UX Design)** with the goal of doing Co-op (experience,  achieving an amazing degree, and opening more doors). 

**A**. I do not have any software engineering or IT experience but looking for jobs made me realize that there are simply less UX-related positions. UX for me is just a job, I don't hate it or love it. I don't know if excelling at first-year CS courses is indication I will do well in **CS** but I think this might be an amazing opportunity to increase my UX-related skillset or switch over to a field I might appreciate more.

**B.** I can forget CS entirely and specialize myself more in **UX** research and design through UofT's Master program, which focuses more on UX research. I think it can complement my design background and streamline my UX job opportunities. My only concern is, many Alumni of this program are struggling to find careers in UX positions and the program seems not highly-rated for a UofT graduate program.

13n40wg,2 YoE: pursuing an online second Bachelor's vs Masters program vs personal projects,"Bootcamp grad here with 2 YoE at FAANG and multiple non-STEM degrees. I've always intended to go back to school to do more studies in comp sci, and with my current work contract soon to expire and the tech market in its current state, I feel like now is a good time. I'm interested in WGU's BSc Comp Sci program and I'm fairly confident I can finish it in less than a year, at which point I can go on to pursue OMSCS or some other Master's program if I really feel the itch. Since WGU is a self-paced program, I can also continue applying for jobs throughout my studies.

One down side I see is that it might look strange to do a second bachelor's with my current background. I know with the right prepwork and finessing I can jump right into a master's program, but I'm concerned my lack of math and DSA knowledge will hold me back. Also, apart from the foundational stuff covered in a bachelor's program, I have very specific interests (game programming, graphics programming) that most masters programs don't cover in detail, so I feel I would be better off doing a BSc and self-teaching myself those things. As for WGU in particular, I know I'd be better off doing a degree at UBC or SFU (I live in BC), but I can't really justify waiting another year to be accepted into those programs (unless I land a good job relatively soon). I can also save a lot of expenses by doing an online program.

Another path I can pursue is to focus on personal projects and continue down the self-taught route, with the mindset that 2 YoE is enough to land a good job in this climate. I'd probably lose out on breadth but gain more in terms of depth of knowledge this way, since I can focus specifically on my interests. However, I think if I am going to stay in this profession over the long term it still would be a better investment to have a comp sci degree (better foundational knowledge, better leverage in salary negotiations, etc...). Having a comp sci bachelor's would also open me up to a TN visa if I wanted to apply to jobs in the states (I have a bachelor's already but apparently some immigration inspectors want a degree that is specifically related to the field of work to be eligible for the visa: [https://bdzlaw.com/degrees-diplomas-certificates](https://bdzlaw.com/degrees-diplomas-certificates))

I'm planning on working full time during the masters program. I also assume that might give me a little more credibility when applying for jobs rather than just a BA in a completely unrelated field but also don't want to be deceitful.

11t7ynr,Recruiter delaying technical interview for twice and went radio silence ever since,"Basically the title. I passed the first OA and the second recruiter screen. According to them, there will be a final face-to-face concoction of technical and behavioural assessment, which is fine.

They asked me for my availability for the first time. I gave them full availability for the next entire week. Then the recruiter said for some reason they can't make it. So I gave them my next entire week. Then a few days later the recruiter said it's off-limits for the hiring team and, again, asked for my availability. This time, I gave them my third and forth week availability, which, again, is just anytime in the third and forth week. 

It has been 2 days. Complete radio silence. No re-scheduling. No updates. At this point I am not even sure whether the recruiter is game or not. I guess some actions must be needed. I just don't know how to word my email. How should write this email?",2023-03-16 22:11:46

Both offer Co-op, however I have heard both bad and good things about both, so now I am confused which would be a better choice. Some say Seneca's COOP for computer science is better than Humber's, yet I would like to hear the opinions of others in this matter.

11558uk,Registering an internship?,"Has anyone had to ""register"" a summer internship with school?

The Montreal company with which I've accepted a summer internship says that I have to ""register"" it with school. I presume this is related to government subsidies.

My faculty's internship office said they can't do anything. My company knows that I'm not in a co-op and I'm not taking an internship for credit. It's paid, and just for the summer.

Since it's obvious from my post history anyway, I go to McGill.

Is it likely that this is a hard legal requirement for getting wage subsidies? 

I've contacted my company, of course, but I don't expect to hear back from them over the weekend and probably need to get back to finding a job in the US ASAP if there's even a chance I won't be allowed to work here.

To clarify, I'm not asking about anything visa-related. I'm an international student, but that's not my issue here. I didn't add a QC flair because I'm pretty sure the subsidies are from the feds and not the province.

1acury8,Seeking Advice on Getting Started – Looking for Tips and Motivation to Tackle the Grind,"Hey everyone,

To start off, I've been extremely insecure about my programming skills ever since beginning Computer Science at my University, and I have only barely made it through many of my courses. I don't have a footing in any path within Computer Science that I wish to pursue, whether that be frontend, backend, etc. Right now, as a third year, I am interning as a QA tester at a company close to my University because I was dead afraid of Software Development companies and their DSA questions mid-interview. I haven't had the best University experience either, spending it mostly alone.

With my subpar programming skills and my bad University experience, I have been constantly having thoughts of whether or not this field is for me, or whether I am 'wired' for this. I ended up watching Dr. Mike Israetel's video, ""How to Defeat Your Insecurity,"" and this sorta drove me to make an effort to improve at it. I started going through The Odin Project (and made significant progress), but I am struggling to figure out whether or not I should prioritize LeetCode for mastering Algorithms and Data Structures or the modules on The Odin Project. I even have a Cloud Practitioner course on the side, but I guess I am just overwhelmed with what to focus on first because it's all a mess.

I truly do want to improve and become a better programmer. If you guys have any tips on how I should approach learning and improving my portfolio and skills, I'd appreciate it greatly.",2024-01-28 05:02:06

18oyosn,Compsci vs Comp Info,"Hi all,

I’m looking to switch careers and go from Healthcare to Tech. I work in the lab analyzing samples and it’s not so bad, but I don’t see myself staying in this field for the next 5 years.

I’m planning to go back to school but I’d like to know whether it’s worth it to go to a college that offers Computer Information Systems as a two year diploma program that also provides co-op that can be extended into a Computer Information Systems degree (if I wanted to for an additional two more years) or just go for a straight up Computing Science degree (there’s an option for a whole CompSci degree that can be done solely online which I like but no co-op. And yes it’s called Computing Science). The reason I’m considering the Comp Info program is purely because of time - I like that it’s shorter and there’s co-op so I can get into (hopefully) working as a software developer (ideally) faster. 

Question is, will a Comp Info diploma (with co-op) be looked at less than compared to a Comp Info Degree? What about Comp Info Degree vs CompSci degree? Would the CompSci degree WITHOUT the co-op still be worth more than the CompInfoSytems two-year diploma WITH co-op? Is there a significant difference between the two? I know experience later on matters more but I’d like to get my foot in the door as quickly as possible and not waste time on a program that won’t get me to where I’d like to be. (Ofc knowing how the market is now it’ll be difficult, hopefully it’ll be better by the time I graduate in three/four years time.)

My first internship was in IT, second in Data and third in Software PM.

Now, most of my friends are applying for Co-Ops, which means, no studying and only full time working, thus extending the degree by an extra year. Now, I’m confused if I should go for a Co-Op as well OR will my internship experience be held equally valuable when applying for a graduate position? 

If yes, then I’d like to graduate on time instead of taking an extra year. 

Can anyone advise me on what I could do in this situation? I also feel stressed thinking - what if I get sth better as a Co-Op? Would I be missing out on that? etc.

17vyn1q,Seeking Advice: Relevance of NetSuite Consultant Role for Web Development Career Path,"Hi guys!

Quick background: I'm a Mechanical Engineering graduate, based in Montreal, transitioning to web development. Currently unemployed, I have two potential job offers and would likely take the first one that comes my way.

Opportunities:

Company A:

* New company specializing in ERP systems.
* They're looking to hire a lot of junior NetSuite consultants, so I have a good chance of getting an offer.
* Offers a tangible job, fully remote work, and is moving faster in the hiring process.

Company B:

* Offers paid graduate training programs with clients like Morgan Stanley.
* Due to my background, I would qualify for their Production Support program instead of their Junior Software Development program.
* Slower process, and the role is a pathway towards a job.

My dilemma is that I am not sure I would get relevant work experience from Company A, given that I would be working with NetSuite's SuiteScript, which is based on JavaScript, but is a proprietary language. Company B, however, would lead to production support and working with large applications, which may bring me more relevant experience for when I'd want to find a new role in software development, but they are waiting for demand from their clients, and I was told I may have to wait until December only to start the paid training program.

My ultimate goal is to become a software developer. Prior to coming to Canada, I obtained bachelor's and master's degrees in Physics and gained five years of experience in the tech industry. However, I did not have any programming experience. I made the decision to come to Canada to pursue my career goals. While in college, I learned Java, SQL, and web programming languages (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP), but I consider these skills I learned to be quite basic. During my Co-op experience, I have learned much more, especially in Python.  
  
I am now worried about my future career path because I have not had the opportunity to develop new features, and my confidence only lies in Python. I am wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and how you overcame it. Or does anyone have any suggestions? I am feeling quite lost at the moment.

14aiy4w,QE to Software Engineer,"Hi Everyone,

  
I have been working as a QE for about 2 years now at a Canadian bank, I have pretty good experience with UI automation, scripting, API testing, and overall debugging as a QE. I was wondering if anyone has made the jump from QE to Software Engineer & what it took. I have a background in Computer Engineering and have built a foundation in programming over these 2 years.  


Mainly interested in the position of Software Engineer, I was wondering: 

1. What did you take from being a QE as an advantage to give you leverage applying to other SE jobs
2.  What projects did you guys work on
3.  Other than programming languages, frameworks, and version controls knowledge is there anything else that's needed(From a programming perspective)
4.  Are there any certificates that you recommend?

  
I am based in Toronto, ON turning 23. I'm going to be grinding out for about a year going through different resources & leet coding, I'd appreciate any advice you have and thank you in advance.",2023-06-16 01:02:15

11g1bu0,What to do if your resume had wrong information on it and you were contacted because of that information?,"What to do if your resume had wrong information on it and you were contacted because of that information?

   Long story short, I have a position that is ""Planning and Development"" or glorified Self employed on my resume.  The only issue is it says 2022-present instead of 2023.  I have technically been working on websites since then but I've only done one website and it's not finished(Client refuses to move forward).  I also have jobs like teaching children coding between 2022 and now.

   The job is in C++ so It's unrelated to website development.  It's an entry level position and I don't want to ruin this opportunity because I've been searching for a long time.  I haven't found anything because my projects are mediocre.  I have been slowly making new projects in the meantime and this just came out of nowhere.

   I'm not sure what to do.  I didn't lie yet, and was honest about my experience.  I said I was improving my skills by trying new technologies(Websites and Python).  They asked about my current position and I spoke about a Game Jam I just did in Unity.  They didn't know I had experience in C++ until I told them it's what I studied in school.  

I am going to fix my resume regardless, this is just about how to fix a mistake I made.

Is there any way I can salvage this situation?  The interview is in 4 days.",2023-03-02 12:16:39

1aqyl8w,AWS sde intern vs. Autodesk MLops engineer intern,"Have the chance to select between these two offers for my final internship before full time. Already have an SWE internship at Autodesk, which was a good experience - culture and WLB were great. Autodesk seems like a safer choice that I’d enjoy, but it seems hard to turn down the chance to get FAANG experience and the amazon name on my resume before graduating. I don't know the projects yet, but I know that I'd get to be involved in picking the Autodesk project whereas I'll be in the dark about the AWS one until shortly before the start date. 

I'm leaning towards Autodesk but want to make sure I'm not making a mistake by turning down a FAANG opportunity. For context, I'm interested in breaking into quant. finance in the long-term. Which would you recommend?

AWS pros

-great brand name on resume, can open up new grad opportunities by helping me get interviews

-probably good for skill development/interesting project

-new environment

AWS cons

-probably wouldn’t want to return full-time to internship location - never been there, don’t know anyone, housing situation seems tougher

-potentially bad wlb/culture (don’t mind too much for internship but this makes it less interesting for long-term return opportunities - Amazon doesn't really appeal to me as a place to start my career due to PIP culture, WLB concerns and layoff stories)

-in-person heavy. Although this can in some ways be a pro, I've found that I enjoy having a lot of remote flexibility.

Autodesk pros

-chill culture, great WLB

-very remote flexible

-already in internship location (no need to move)

-chance to get hands on experience in ML-related work (hard to get as undergrad with no prior ML experience, I am interested in ML). Could create a nice 'spike' in my new grad profile compared to a cookie-cutter SWE experiences

-would be interested in full-time return offer at company and location

Autodesk cons

-already worked there, diminishing returns on resume

-weaker brand name than amazon

-weaker career growth and compensation long-term",2024-02-14 21:40:00
1aquvqn,Contracting vs Full Time,"So I have a question and it's not related to layoffs. I'm feeing the notorious ""Sr. Eng Ceiling"" (SWE role).

Let's safely assume I don't want to be a manager. There are the high level IC roles (Lead, Staff, Principal etc) but I'm realizing these postings are rarer than one might assume and most often go to internal candidates (understandably). I'll keep applying but I have to assume it could take time to land one of these especially now--it could take years given I'd also be selective on my side as well.

I've spoken to several recruiters who've tried to sell me on being a contractor. One recently laid it out like this... In the US, companies keep raising Sr. salaries well up into the 200s (in usd no less) but here 180 CAD is about the most you're going to see for Sr. Eng. However, they do employ senior specialists--they need those same skills and still must compete with US companies so they have to pay the same price, but up here they prefer to pay those people by the hour as contractors. He even said he had several on deck he felt I'd be a fit for which he could show me. It makes sense I guess, Canadian companies wanting less commitment. Canadian companies generally don't have as much money and also it's harder to break up (cheaply) with a FTE in Canada vs the US. He also made the point that these  are still fairly secure and if I'm hopping every 2-3 yrs anyway the only difference I'd notice would be earning a lot more. Obviously if they have these roles piling up to fill and less people are OK with contracting, they're of course going to give you a hard sell. So I'm wondering just how legit this is.

Thoughts on this from the 10+ YoE crowd or anybody who's made the transition to contractor?",2024-02-14 19:04:34
1aeh00r,"Learning CS, questions about my options","I know stuff like this probably gets posted a lot, but after looking through posts i figured I should ask some questions that account for my situation.  
  
I'm still in university, but my questions are about preparing for my career. I'm in my second semester of my Bachelor of Comp Sci at UNB in Fredericton, New Brunswick. I am currently planning to stay here after graduation, which should be in 2027, although if moving somewhere else is a good idea I'll absolutely consider that. Some possibly notable info is that people seem to really praise co-ops at my university. I'm worried about the job market and if I'm even making the right choice with a CS degree given the bleak job market.  
  
I'm not sure which ""specialization"" of CS i want to go into yet. As much as I'd like to decide based off of how much I like it, I think I should shift a lot of that focus on what's sought after by employers given the market.  
  
I'm wondering a few things specifically.  


\- Which CS specializations are the least oversaturated and most in-demand, and logically seem like they will stay that way or increase? Which should I generally avoid when considering job demand?  
  
\- I hear almost everyone who is in CS (during degree or graduated) talk exclusively about trying to get into big companies. I had always thought I'd end up with a job at some small local place or whatever I can get, but people never seem to talk about that. Is there a reason why people seem to avoid that? Could my chances be better if I go that route? I'm more worried about actually getting jobs than good pay for now.  
  
\- Any other general advice or things i should be doing early to make this whole process easier on myself.  
  
Some of my questions probably seem quite naive but I feel a lot less knowledgeable than i should be at the moment and I'm trying to get my bearings, so any guidance is very much appreciated.

I don't enjoy development that much, despite being better than average for entry-level (compared to what I saw in bootcamp and the projects I've worked on.

18zkzex,Seeking Career Advice — Newcomer,"Hi everyone, I am looking for advice from all the folks here.

## Background

I moved from Europe to Canada last year (M21) after graduating with a bachelor's degree in IT in 2023. Since university I am a co-founder and CTO in a startup (EU-based), and we are doing pretty well. To add, I am well-versed in north-american type of CVs and work culture.

## Working Experience

My initial IT employment was in 2019, but I cant claim 5 YOE due to my intense focus on studies during university. After that I co-founded a company and engaged in various commercial projects while studying. I am a full stack developer, tech stack: js/ts, react, next, UI libs, node, rest api, DBs etc. Also I have experience with devops as last 1.5y I am working with servers on daily basis, so linux, bash, docker etc included. Recently, I secured victories in 2 online hackathons for my startup.

## Problem
As I moved to Canada, I want to stay and live here permanently. Currently I have an open work permit for 2 years, and securing a job is my pathway to permanent residency. If not for the move, I would continue the work I've been doing.

## Questions
1. Should I include my current role as a co-founder & CTO in my CV? Will it enhance my chances, or is it advisable to leave the current position and not even mention it?
2. What level of experience should I aim for when applying, considering my work history? I want to avoid being under/over-qualified.
3. How would you recommend to prepare for an interviews (not only tech, but also behavioral etc)? Any resources would be highly appreciated.

p.s I don't really care about TC or smth, the job offer is more important (is it good approach lol?)

Thank you for any assistance, I greatly appreciate that.",2024-01-05 23:28:31

the course covers both front end and backend languages, and the college in general focuses heavily on portfolio development so I'd have a pretty robust GitHub by the time I'm done.

I realize it's not necessarily the most ideal time to get into tech and that database roles seem to be in less of a demand than front end devs but I really need to put an end to my current line of work and focus on something I both enjoy and see a future in.

1amntpd,Mechanical Engineer (FEA) combine with AI/ML,"Hi guys,  
  
I hope to get some career advice from you guys. Do you think there are opportunity for mechanical engineer in the tech industry in Toronto? I am an design engineer, early 30s, and about to get my PhD in mechanical engineer. My specialty is in Finite Element Analysis (FEA). I feel like I am hitting my career ceiling in both salary and technical challenge. Thus, I often feel unmotivated at work. I enjoy coding and also solving complicated problems. I also heard that tech industry pay very well, above 200,000 annually.  
  
If I switch to tech, I hope I can do something that can use my mechanical background. For example, working for analysis company like Ansys, or Dassault System (Ansys just released their AI tool, Is it the trend in FEA?!). I can take additional Computer Science courses or even a degree in necessary. I am not paying for these so the only expense is my time.

195fedb,Feeling pretty lost...,"I took a 2-year associate degree for a general computer science program and did 1 year of work at my ""dream job"", game dev. I was later laid off because the studio shut down.

I became disillusioned with gamedev. While I *love* the work, I do not feel like I am contributing to a good cause. I want to feel like I am actually providing a company a needed service, but instead I feel like I am competing against hundreds of other applicants, and by getting a job I am simply robbing second place of the opportunity, even if they are just as qualified as I am. It makes me sick. I want to be employed by someone who needs and appreciates my work, which I take a lot of pride in.

I still love coding, so I am thinking of choosing another field within computer science with a greater sense of fulfillment. I know one way I can do this is, as cheesy as it sounds, bring criminals to justice. I am currently reading about pentesting, digital forensics, and cybersec analysis, but I still feel lost. I have the opportunity to take another 2-year course to get my bachelor for general networking studies, but I have major concerns.

For one, I hear that cyber security is an extremely difficult field to break into, and I imagine it is even *more* difficult if I decide to focus on working with the government or the RCMP. They do not seem to be transparent at all when it comes to applications. It seems like I just put in my info and just *pray* they respond, with no info on how many positions are opening or what they are looking for.

For another, I am pretty introverted and it is extremely inconvenient for me to be proactive in expanding my network when social interaction is mentally exhausting for me. While communication is not necessarily an issue for me, I do have my limits that I have never been able to exercise. This means I may not be able to work IT support to help sustain my early career efforts. I am seriously worried this is going to get in the way of anything I try to achieve, and with the tech industry experiencing mass layoffs, I am actually so depressed right now.

165xq9b,Software developer with 4+ years of experience thinking about FDM group's returners program. Any advice is appreciated.,"Hi,  
I am a newcomer to Canada from India. Came to live in Ontario in October 2022. Have about 5 years of experience working as a software developer. I don't think I am a programmer with high skill. I have usually just tried to do the tasks at hand with minimum effort. Was unaware of how bad the market was going to be. I quit my previous job in India last August. When I came in October, I was getting a few calls a month till December. After that it has been a pretty much blank window where I have been getting hardly a screening call in a week. Sadly I haven't gotten a temp job also in the last 10 months to support myself.

  
My savings are running out in a couple of months. The scary thing is I am not sure if I am good enough to crack any interview if it comes my way by some dumb luck. I don't feel like investing time in learning anymore.

  
I know I sound like a lazy defeatist piece of shit. But I am really at the end of the road. Is a program like FDM group's returners program([https://www.fdmgroup.com/careers/returners-programme/](https://www.fdmgroup.com/careers/returners-programme/)) a good idea for a person like me.

15di417,"In terms of job prospects in Toronto or Canada in general, which program should I go for? Civil engineering or computer science? (I think) I have an EQUAL interest in both of these fields","I'm a high school student hoping to study in Toronto as an international student and I'm currently deciding between taking civil engineering and computer science. As far as I've researched into these fields, I think I would be able to enjoy, or tolerate at the very least, them equally, so now I gotta consider the work and money part. 

From what I've gathered so far, tech jobs (particularly web and software development, which I think I prefer) are more competitive but pay high, while there are more spots for civil engineering jobs but they pay less. Is this true?

Another thing to consider is that engineering programs are more expensive than computer science programs. Additionally, how different would the answer be if I took a diploma program (Civil Engineering Technology and Computer Programming and Analysis) instead of a degree one? I'm aware that you'll have less opportunities for finding jobs (e.g., can't be or harder to be Professional Engineer) and high pay, but if I had to choose a diploma over a degree, which among the two would be a better one to choose?

Or should I just let the wheel choose for me, lol",2023-07-30 10:19:27

Just contributing to the overall doom-and-gloom posts this sub is known for.

I have 2 YoE (5 years overall in tech), and recently scraped off my junior title. I’ve tried to keep a finger on the pulse of the market by constantly keeping a feeler out for new gigs, with basically 0 positive response.

My current gig is fine, but I’d like to continue climbing the ladder…. But it seems like someone has taken all the other ladders away, and I’m stuck climbing the rungs on this single ladder. Feels horrible, and albeit my current role feels relatively secure, I’m not sure I’d find work if I were let go.

As of right now, it feels like future of CS is bleak.

Should I find something else to pair with my CS background? (i.e law or medicine with a background in CS would be very sought after I’d imagine) Should I just hold my current gig and wait for this to blow over? Leave this industry entirely?",2023-07-20 15:27:01

He had courses in programming in C, C++, Python and has been working as a tester there for 3 years. I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on what kind of projects he could do on the side or learn while on the job? Based on personal anecdotes, I got the feeling that employers here in Canada/Ontario don't care much about the degree from universities that are not well-known (if from outside Canada) and he has to prove his worth mostly from personal projects he can do and put on his portfolio/Github etc. Looking for suggestions and in general about the job market now. 

Follow-up:

Is the job market really that bad now, I see posts all the time about layoffs in big tech FAANG companies and understandably there is more competition for high-paying SWE jobs, but if someone is fine with a basic 50-70k range salary for starters, is it really hard to even get interview calls for such positions? I see job openings for such positions, is it competitive in those vacancies because those who were laid off probably are going for lower package postings now?

I have completed MSc in Mechanical Engineering. Now working in at adminstration in provincial govt. i want to switch my career to tech. So, I am doing a crash course for web development. This is a MERN stack focused course. So far i have the knowledge of

* html, css, Bootstrap, Tailwind, JavaScript, DOM, JSON, jquery, Git version control, API, ES6, debugging, devtool, etc.
* React, React Router, hooks, context api, Tanstack query, recharts, etc.
* server side technology like Node, express, mongodb, firebase, etc.
* Build secure API using JWT tokens.

Projects i have completed and will do

* Leaderboard using Flexbox, Grid Layout And Media Query, Etc.
* Simple And Interactive Shopping Cart using core javascript. You will be able to change the product quantity dynamically. Also, you will be able to calculate the price, tax, discount amount for the added products to your shopping cart.
* Apple clone responsive website using bootstrap. I used bootstrap components, helpers, utilities, layout.
* Amazon type ecommerce website. A React Based Single Page Application (SPA) Using React, React Router, React Hook Forms, Firebase Auth System, Pagination, Etc. I created a server side app and integrate them.
* A website using React, React Router, Firebase Authentication System, CRUD Operations, Tailwind, Etc. On the server side used Node, Express, Mongodb, Jwt, Dotenv, Etc. I hosted the both client and server side to create a complete website.
* A full stack application for managing a clinic center. Users, doctors, and admins can manage their activities. A role based authentication system. Implement a multi-layer dashboard. Connect server side for role based access to a secure api. Send email after successful booking.
* Few more projects are also on the way.

I would say i am not an expert on them but if you give me a problem, i can find a solution and i have got this confidence now. I can develop/complete an website/app from the scratch. So, I would like to know whether these knowledge are enough to get a junior level position? if not, what extra should i focus on?

I've been looking for ways to learn and I've seen several courses. I don't know if you know them but I did CS50, CS50p, CS50W, the odin project and full stack open.  

So, now I know python, JavaScript, HTML,CSS, Node.js,Express,React, Mongodb and SQLlite. I know MVC design, I can do unit test on python or node, I know MVC design... I know how to use git too.  
I won't post my github because it's not well organized yet but I did some projects. For example, I made a project etch a sketch and a calculator with JavaScript.  

My last project is a project that gathers quite a lot of what I learned (not complete yet but almost finished) It's a CRUD app with the MERN stack where users can manage their budget. Users have to create an account and log in (with the jwt web token) then they can create, modify, delete expenses or money entry, see a graph etc.  

The interface is made with React, the database with mongodb, uses MVC design and contains unit tests as learned in full stack open.  

Do you think that with this experience I could get a job in Montreal? If not, what experience would I need?

I have less than two years left before I finish this degree at a so-so college. Lately, I have been considering switching back to a CS program and possibly to a more reputable college or university and getting a tech-related job afterwards.  

One of the reasons why I'm thinking of transferring is that the program does not have a co-op but a brief internship instead. I have seven years of experience working as an SWE, primarily for mid-level foreign-owned global companies back in my home country, so why do I need a co-op? But someone will say unless it's a famous international company or one of the MAANG companies, Canadian employers/companies won't care about your non-Canadian experience.

My experience mainly involves software maintenance and support, putting down fires occasionally. My tech stack is the usual Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, and K8. Ideally, and perhaps foolishly, I would like to work on something different, like Machine Learning, Cybersecurity or anything that is **not** web related.

Path A: While working on finishing the degree, I get a bunch of certifications in cloud, security, etc., then get a non-coding tech job.

Path B: Work on finishing the degree while doing leetcode and personal projects, then apply for a SWE position after graduating.

Path C: Finish this degree, get a non-tech job, then, while working, get a part-time CS Master's like the one offered by Georgia Tech or by any Canadian university.

Path D: Transfer to a CS program with co-op

Path E: Quit taking the business degree and get a Master's in CS instead.

There may be a different path out there that I'm unaware of.

1aqbibq,2 year BsC Comp Sci vs 1 year Master of Software Eng,"Hello,

Thinking of switching careers into tech. I have a BsC in bio and am interested in taking either a BsC in comp Sci or Masters in Software Eng at U of Calgary.

I could get the BsC shortened because of my previous degree.

Which would be better in terms of career prospects? I would say I dont have a lot of coding experience. I want to try and maximize my job opprutunities.

I would be willing to move to the US in the future for a job. I also have an EU citizenship so would be open to working there too….I don’t know if that make a difference ? 

Also:

- BsC has a coop and the Masters does not 

I would also be open to other suggestions about programs in Canada",2024-02-14 02:09:31

150gyzh,Breaking into : software dev / networking or,"Hi


I'm a 26 years old, I work as a teacher in my country. However, I don't like it here mainly because there's  no career future (I make 8400$ a year). I'm considering immigrating to canada, and I think I'm eligible.
If I get there, I want to do a complete career switch. Therefore, before I apply to canada I want to start learning something from srtaches for the  following 2 or 3 years so that I can have my chances and be prepared to apply for jobs (maybe in 2025 or 2026).
 I can and (I will) put more than +4 hours a  daily just for learning .
I wanted to break into IT or CS since I was 20 but for many different personal reasons I wasn't able to find time to do so. ( I hope that 26yo isn't too late and things are complicated now or in 2026 lol) 
Now, I did some researches and the following months and even started learning the roles and jobs and how they work and I learned that I can follow many pathes but the main 2s are :
Network engineering (IT) / software ENGINEERING (CS) : 
Fot network engineering : i need certifications to just apply for entry jobs I created a path like this :
A+, network+, Cisco ccna, then I move on from there. 
Jobs that I can apply to as first time working are : help desk / support specialist or something. 
And then with more experience I can grind my way up to sys admin / network admin and more grinding and try HARDING.

THE other path which is software engineering : instead of certifications the languages that you learned and the projects that you did ( get hub profile for example) speaks for you.

Mainly the path that many people take is:
Html - CSS - Java script - python (and then the list goes on and on as you expand and work on projects to learn)

There's no entry job like help desk. I don't even know how you can break in with all the competition I mean what should a one do to stand out.


I'm a realistic person I don't have those dreams of making 6 figures in 3 years from now or want to do the easy way.
For both fields, it's tough and I want to learn for real to have skills not just passing the exams (networking) or learning how to use the languages (development). I'm really curious and if I followed a path I would take it seriously and realistically.

1- I heard that the networking jobs will not be highly needed in the future because of two factors :AI and Cloud. ( I know that they will never disappear because they are very  important but just the numbers of networking guys will diminish over time) and I don't know whether this is true or not because if it's then there's no point to follow the networking path as it will just be more difficult to land a job and follow a career in it. 

2- as for software developers (web dev...) : I heard that the competition is so high and it's over-saturated by people who want to break in ( I know that most of them are average level) because as I also heard, the need for professionals in this field in in high demand.
+ the AI is now a tool that is helping devs so people need real solid background and experience to be able to keep up. (Anything basic that you can do the Ai can also do it) 

My questions are :
1- is 2/3  years enough to really learn what make you stand out in those fields before I'm 30. 
2- what do you think about networking and IT being a stable field which make it so hard to find a job and follow a career. 
3- if you were me what would you choose of the two ( I really enjoy both and anything related to computing). 

I kinda mentioned that before but I think that I'd be looking for a job for whatever I learned in 2026 so.. 


Ps: whatever the path I follow, if I'm lucky and all the work I put in these two years brought me success, eventually I would transition to cloud maybe. 



I'm in a life changing part of my life ( I really know that I don't want to keep going like this) so, I want to have all the info needed. I'm sorry if I'm too ignorant on what I said. 
And thank you for reading till this place.

2. Is it another career that has been romanticized by the media and in reality isn’t as great as it seems?

18s8mng,Should I leave a +200k/year Cybersecurity job to pursue a Master's Degree?,"Currently, I am working as a senior security consultant (28/yrs), earning a salary of +$200,000 annually. Despite my professional success, I am thinking about going back to school to pursue a Bachelor's and eventually a Master's degree. My educational background includes an Advanced Diploma from a community college, complemented by certifications such as OSCP, OSCE, OSEP, OSWE, and OSED.  
Going to University has always been something I've dreamt of doing, but financially, it was just not possible. I aspire to attain a Master's in Computer Engineering, with an interest in contributing to research or academia. Although I am apprehensive about transitioning, my current role has afforded me a comfortable lifestyle, including a three-bedroom/three-bath house, a luxury I never imagined in the current housing market.  
In my day-to-day responsibilities, I conduct comprehensive network penetration tests and red team operations for an organization that serves nine of the top ten US Banks and numerous Fortune 100 companies. The experience gained has been invaluable, especially with access to a structured and thorough methodology—a vast database of attacks, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities compiled over the past two decades, accompanied by detailed semi-automated guides (terminal commands, sample misconfigurations, secure configurations, exploitation, etc.).  
Despite the wealth of experience, I find my current role lacking in creative challenges. The semi-automated nature of the work, coupled with tight timelines, limits the scope for innovation. While the job has honed my ability to compromise environments swiftly and reliably, the repetitive nature leaves me feeling bored and unchallenged. It is my hope that obtaining a Master's degree will provide me with the skills, knowledge, and opportunity to pursue research-related work.

TL;DR:

Despite having a successful career as a senior security consultant with a comfortable lifestyle, I'm contemplating returning to university for a Master's in Computer Engineering. Concerns about financial implications, including selling our house and uncertain career benefits, weigh against the fear of regretting the missed opportunity for personal and professional growth.

1. When applying for Coop / internship, the company would want to know which college I am from and upon seeing the name, they might right away reject the application. How do I handle that situation?

2. When applying for a full time job after completing my graduation, my employer would realize that there is a two year gap between when I last worked and when I am applying. With no school mentioned on the resume, how do I handle this?

1aqun9p,Did I waste my potential not coding for 1.5 years?,"Some background: I graduated from a Computer science degree at 21 years old. I've always been naturally good at math, algorithms, data structures and theoretical computer science concepts.  
After graduating I got into Game Dev and I picked it up super fast. Faster than what the average roadmaps say. I guess this is because of my Computer Science degree helping me. I even had one back end intership (normal software eng) and I did really well at it. At this point I just turn 22 years old  
However, from 22 to 23.5, I did not coding at all. I didn't read up on theory, I did no Leetcode, no game dev nothing. Now a few things worry me:  
\- I heard that our brain power is the most strong in our early 20s. I wasted a very precious time from 22 to 23.5 not doing any coding  
\- Almost everyone older than me has told me with age it becomes harder to think  
Based on all of this, is it too late at 23.5 to get back into game dev? I know it's not to LATE, but how much of my potential did I waste? Will I be able to think as clearly as 1.5 years ago when I was actively engaged in doing Leetcode, game dev etc  
Let's say for arguments sake my brain power was at 100% at 22, by 23.5 will it have gone down by a bit? Even by let's say 1.5%. These are arbitrary numbers but I'm wondering if this is how coding ability and age correlate  
Also, if I keep practicing game dev, by the time I am 40-50, will I have the same ability to come up with new code / algorithms? Will I be able to keep up with new game dev concepts? Will I be able to make a breakthrough in the industry?  
Or is this stuff only limited to when we are in our early 20s? I know many studios have people above 40 working there, however those studios also have multiple employees. Can I stay an indie dev all my life and continue to make progress?  
I know I wrote alot, but my two basic questions are:  
1. How much of my potential did I waste by not coding from 22 to 23.5  
2. Will my progress / coding ability go down when I'm 40+?

1bhrqlk,Need Advice: burnout and lost,"I feel so lost and confused and would appreciate any help. I graduated last year and have been working at my current job for a couple months only. I noticed that I’ve been experiencing extreme burnout. I cannot concentrate, have not been productive for a long time, feel depressed and just basically unable to concentrate on working. 

I think my burnout comes down to a lot of things, including non-work related stuff. I was a grinder during college and started my job right away. My family had some financial issues during my undergrad, and I had to work so many internships & part time waitressing along with studying full time. I’ve almost never had a single break during my college time and had to handle a lot of family & mental issues. I guess I felt burnout out a long time ago and I just kept pushing back and now I’m at a point that I feel like I’m gonna snap. I don’t think im an unmotivated person and I’ve never been one in my life, but I think I’m at the point that I just have nothing (no energy no motivation nothing) in me. 

I’m just so confused. My job is amazing and has a really good work life balance and I still can’t seem to keep up. Being unproductive makes me feel so guilty and anxious and even more depressed. I don’t hate the job I don’t hate the industry but I just feel like I have 0 energy left in me to do anything. I want nothing but to absolutely zone out for 6 months to a year. But I’m so scared to leave the job because I worked so hard for it and it is a very decent job. I’m worried that I won’t be able to find a job like this afterwards and it’ll be career suicide to gap after such a short time. I’m financially secured now for at least a year or two but I just cannot pull the trigger. I’m telling myself that I’m privileged, should be grateful that I’m in my current position and should work hard, but at the same time I feel exhausted every single minute and cannot work. I went through a lot when growing up and it’s very hard to give up something that I’ve worked so long for.

Due to the way Reddit's algorithm works, early subscribers of the sub will remember that posts with low karma of 1 or 2 would be considered ""hot"" and land into your feed, which meant your feed would be filled with almost all new posts which were typically low effort and and repetitive content. So in order to limit the amount of repetitive posts, content has been moderated.

However, the sub has grown in the past few years from 0 to 23,000 users. Given the number of complaints in my inbox regarding them (I suppose a given considering the growth) it is time that the sub will now dictate posts with upvotes/downvotes.

As such, the following rules will be removed and automod will no longer remove them:

* Low Effort Posts
* Asked and Answered
* Posts already addressed in megathread
* ""Off Topic"" threads
* Misinformation rules, and derailing rules
* Immigration topics
* Name and Shames - You guys decide
* Minimum Karma requirements have also been removed.

Moderation will also be relaxed, meaning I will not be monitoring active threads any longer. I will only review reports in the queue. If it's not in the queue, it won't get reviewed.

Crowd control will still be in place, so any auto removals will be due to Reddit's filters (which have been pretty good at catching spam). As such I will not be responding to mod mail ""Why was my post removed"" it is likely either spam or crowd control.

The following rules will be maintained:

* No spam or self promotion with out approval
* No news Articles
* Posts must still be related to Canada and CS
* No harassment, violence, trolling, sexism, Keep it Civil
* AMA's, formal surveys and any other data collection must be approved
* No Duplicates

Megathreads will still exist, however not posting inside a megathread  will no longer be moderated.

Posts over the past 3 days will be approved, and anyone is free to re-post a thread. If you have a post previous to 3 days, I recommend just re-posting because I believe Reddit will place it back in history and won't be considered ""hot"" any longer (will not show up on people's feeds)

The following rule breaks will still result in a ban:

* No spam
   * permanent ban
* No News articles
   * 1st violation  = 3 removals  -> Warning
   * 2nd violation = 2 removals after first -> 14 temp day ban,
   * 3rd violation = 1 removal -> permanent ban
* Posts must still be related to Canada and CS
   * 1st violation = 5 removals - Warning
   * 2nd violation = 5 removals -> 14 temp day ban
   * 3rd violation  = 5 removals -> permanent ban
* No harassment, violence, trolling, sexism, Keep it Civil
   * If removal was just to Keep It Civil and you were collateral (graveyard) -> Nothing
   * If your post is the reason the topic had to become a graveyard - Warning only unless...
   * If your post is harrassment, violence -> Permanent ban
   * If your post was trolling -> if it was funny no removal, otherwise 1st time a warning
      * Repeat offenses (like your account and posts are ONLY trolling and it's not even funny) -> Permanent ban
      * Baiting is a permanent ban
   * If your post was intentionally sexist -> Warning 1st time, removal next with permanent ban
* AMA's, formal surveys and any other data collection must be approved
   * No ban unless it's intentional skirting of rules. It will just be removed and held for mod approval
* No duplicates
   * Removed, but no action unless it's intentional -> Temp ban 7 days

If you guys don't like the changes or think this is too far in the other direction, put in the comments what rules you want maintained or what rules you want to be maintained, or even further removal of rules.

But in the end, they said that there would be a fee which was $2000+tax and 20% of my salary throughout my first job for a year.

1bfl9m1,Further Studies Options,"Hi there, Im in a bit of a downward spiral, looking for advice - 

I have a 4 year bachelors in biology and a 2 year diploma in IT-Software Dev. I took a one year gap after the diploma and can't even get any interviews right now. I think my programming abilities have declined or I might not be the genius to keep up with that anymore, so I think I'm more interested in the databases and analyst side of things.  

Should I upgrade to a CS degree with a one year accelerated program? Should I do bootcamps?

Should I do a masters? In CS, or data science? I still enjoy biology and could do a masters that combines my previous educations - biostatistics, bioinformatics, biomedical engineering - but they don't seem to be in-demand careers.  I could just do a masters in pathology even, and give up on computer science Idk.

There are also so many certificate programs now in business intelligence and analyst etc. but I can't even decide if they're worth it. Also certifications like Microsoft Power BI etc.  I've done the google basic and advanced data analytics certificates, but I struggle at the discipline for self-guided projects. I'm not dumb, rather I learn real quick and then I can't stick to it long enough to get depth or mastery. 

My weakness right now is lack of experience and I thought doing post-secondary bachelors/masters would allow me to expand my network and get internships. Other than that I feel so old I really don't want to spend more years in studying and still be stuck without a job when I'm 30.

Please, any advice? I'm kind of losing my mind after months of stagnancy, just going back and forth researching every possible career. I also have alot of administrative, mentoring and project planning experience, but volunteering. Only work experience is as assistants in healthcare settings. It feels like jack of all trades and master of none.

1bq7nf8,Evaluating the opportunity cost of a CS Masters,"Wanted to get some thoughts on this, I'm currently a 4th year student studying CS, with 3 internships and 1 HCI related research publication which got accepted into a reputable conference. As I'm nearing graduation, I've been debating on if I want to pursue a thesis based program with funding, at my University with a supervisor that focuses on applied research as I want to work in industry. If I do want to pursue a masters in CS, now might be the best time as I would have an easier time getting admitted into the program.

Honestly the main reason why I want to pursue a masters is due to the following:

1. The Job market right now is pretty bad, I'm having a tough time finding another summer internship and finding a new grad role probably will probably be worse.
2. I want to increase my earning potential and stand out more to employers, especially if I ever do want to work in the US.
3. I do enjoy learning and looking into HCI related topics, and my school has a great HCI department.
4. I want to have more roles open to me in the future.
5. Personal enrichment

Is it worth the opportunity cost to do a masters in this job market?  Honestly my long term goals is to work in a SWE related role i.e webdev, front/back-end development, and perhaps research developer/engineer related roles if I do grad school. What are the HCI opportunities like in Canada? Would I actually increase my long-term earning potential, and open up more job opportunities in the future? Is it more worthwhile to just do OMSCS? I have ADHD and in-person classes take a lot less effort for me to stay tuned in.

Any advice would be appreciated,  I would love to hear back from other people that have done a masters.

1bn2k01,How to approach job apps while nearing end of PIP?,"In my last little bit before PIP induced termination. For the last batch of applications I put my employer as ""current"", but soon I think I should apply with the date as my end date.

I'm also getting an interview soon, but any offer will for sure come after the termination date.

1. For applications going out until my last day of work, should I continue to put ""current"" for the work dates at my for-now employer?
2. Should I be giving HR / manager of the interviewing firm/s a heads up of any form? Surely the background check will not pass / will state an end date and raise eyebrows. (curious: do the third party background checks come back as a Pass/Fail, like since my work status isn't 'current' it'll return FAIL)
3. How should I approach things after termination? Fortunately/unfortunately I was at a decently reputable firm so for any employers ""less competitive"", they may ask lots of questions about why I'm looking / why I've stopped working.",2024-03-25 02:16:34

1bpy66w,New Grad SWE Job Search - ‘Accepting defeat/taking easy way out’?,"Hello my fellow CS/SWE/IT peers,

I graduated this past December with my Software Engineering degree and am currently in the job hunt for a full time role. I spent just over a year on co-op with a single company working on their SWE team and when returning to my studies the company verbally offered me a return offer. Fast forward to this past December I started applying for full time junior/new grad positions and I made a choice to myself that I was going to try my best to seek a position at a new company to get new experiences. During my job hunt I have not been working a part time job and have been doing fine with savings for the past 3-4 months. I’ve sent out many applications, gotten a few OA’s, but ultimately wasn’t getting many interviews and things have been looking pretty bleak. I have been primarily applying for jobs in my local region but started applying to jobs that would require relocation recently.

Given my current circumstances, savings are starting to run low and I was at a cross road I was trying to avoid, but I either need to find a random part time job or reach out to my former company. I got bills to pay, life is expensive. I reached out to my former employer earlier this week and things have started rolling very quickly. Technically I have not signed any contracts yet, but it has been verbally indicated I will be receiving an offer from my former employer soon.

The reason I am posting this is because I can’t help, but slightly feel like I’ve ‘accepted defeat/failure’ by playing my hand I’ve been keeping in my back pocket. It’s bittersweet because as I am sure many other new grads can relate to, the job market isn’t great right now and the application/upskilling process can be mentally straining, so finally finding a job is rewarding in this matter. 

I’m sure the actual position and job itself won’t be bad at all, but I can’t help but feel like I’ve failed myself for turning my back on my word. The position is hybrid, 15 minute drive away, I know the team and processes, so logistically there’s lot’s of positives. Honestly, I am feeling lot’s of conflicting emotions and these are all still relatively fresh, so I am sure sitting on it will help clear my mind. I kind of just wanted to share my thoughts and seek some validation/opinions on what others may do in my situation.

1beragm,Help Needed: Choosing Between Two Master's Programs in Canada for Data Science Career,"Hello everyone,

I have a serious question to ask you all. I've been accepted to two master's programs in Canada: the Master of Applied Computing at Wilfrid Laurier University and the Master of Engineering Practice in Software at Carleton University.

Initially, I applied for the Master's in Data Science Analytics and Artificial Intelligence at Carleton, but unfortunately, I was rejected and offered the Engineering Practice program instead (seems like just another CS degree).

After researching online, I've gathered that Carleton University has a good reputation in computer science. So there environment might be better for IT related courses. However, WLU is located in Waterloo and offers an 8-month co-op program, which is not available in the Engineering Practice program at Carleton.

I'm confused between the two options. My ultimate goal is to become a data scientist, and I understand that skills are more important than anything else, but I also believe that the right environment can provide a significant boost in the initial stages of one's career.

Any experiences or insights you can share would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I'm still waiting to hear back from SFU for their MS in Big Data program, but due to my grades, I'm not too optimistic about that option.

Thank you in advance for your help and advice!",2024-03-14 17:51:02

1bekbq7,"Failing PIP, best course of action?","When you fail pip, what will be the result of background checks at new jobs? I’m hoping I’m able to land something at around the time PIP ends but I’ve been notified I will fail it. That means my termination date would most likely be 1-2 weeks before sending off those background check consent forms. 

What is the best course of action? Some considerations:

Most importantly I want to preserve my ‘history’ as much as possible. If that means quitting and not collecting EI it might be better for me. 

Quitting vs letting expire, I’m not sure what severance is available but it will likely be tiny considering my tenure is <2yr. EI is a factor. Signing bonus clawback will probably be applied in both cases, and I have that money saved up. 

I will ask about being a PT employee as a shot in the dark but I’m guessing no way. It’d be useful for the team as I’m leaving a lot of high context work behind but that arrangement is probably not part of HR’s allowed processes. 

Anything I didn’t consider?

Again the most important consideration is to try and not have future background checks show “fired due to performance”. I can hopefully get another similar-but-demoted job, but if the pip is there I’m worried I’ll basically never work at a large company that does proper DD on candidates.

So I've been interviewing for a few months now and just received a new grad offer for low 100's at a small company in GTA, with a start date 6+ months out. This is an incredible amount of money, especially for a new grad, but at the same time I feel I could do better.

For context, I'm a CS major with 5 internships + part time experience. My current internship pays the same amount for interns as this place does for full timers. I'd like to try for a return offer, but there are no guarantees.

One side of me wants to reject this offer and grind the hell out of LC to go for FAANG/unicorn/etc for mid 100's TC. Another side sees that this amount of money is already incredible and job hunting is a pain in the ass.

I seriously don't know what to do. I'm not asking for my decision to be made for me - but I just want to know the pros and cons of going either route.

wv2v4o,Question about career in Canada,"My question is does software pay disproportionately to other professional industries in Canada?

I know this sounds like a stupid and repeated question but I keep hearing mixed replies. 

The first view is that it’s a huge booming industry and everyone is easily breaking 150k a few years out a college, and it only goes up from there.

But when you look at stats from the job bank (and other sources too this is just the one I’m going to refer too), they make almost identical to any other type of engineer. 

Ex: median wage/hour

Mechanical: 42.00

Software: 48.08

I know engineering in general pays very well, so that’s not my question. My question is does software engineering get paid disproportionately more than other professional careers like other types of engineering, or do they get paid similarly? 

As a young person, I only hear about how people are retiring at 40 and how the money is just so lucrative in cs, so that’s why I’m asking if this is true because it doesn’t seem to be based on the statistics. So I would really like to hear if it’s as lucrative as I am being told it is, or if it is comparable to any other professional industry.

Red flag 2: No coding assessment at all. I was simply asked, ""What is the responsibility of a Software Developer"". No multi-stage candidacy process at all.

They first had declined but I had informed them that this was discrimination against me and then they allowed it. I was told to work from home and complete all my tasks for that given week that was given to me the week prior before my manager left for the holidays. Now the employees are returning next week and they found out about me working during the holidays and fairly upset.

Do companies in Canada allow remote jobs outside of Canada? Anyone ever worked on remote site? It will be easy for me to work for a Canadian firm so I can land a job early when I reach there. Also will gain some experience on the workflow and for my resume.  


Edit: Aside from LinkedIn or StackOverflow, any other domain that I can apply for remote jobs for Canadian firm? ",2022-03-02 11:48:28

Cross-posting this from r/cscareerquestions. Surprisingly it didn't get a lot of love there. I hope this will help out someone over here

When I was on the job hunt one of the most annoying/time-consuming parts of the process was resume creation. I would try out a bunch of different templates, copying and pasting different formats, it was a pain

Back then, I was searching online for a solution, and found resumake.io. This website has saved me A LOT of time and made the resume creation process significantly easier. This probably reads like a sponsored post but I assure you it's not. The project is open source [https://github.com/saadq/resumake.io](https://github.com/saadq/resumake.io) and free for use

You just have to put your resume information in once and you can try a bunch of different templates easily instead of having to reformat your resume manually for each template you want to try. Once you find one you like you can export the resume and download it

IMO this is a resource that should be called out in the Resume Review thread or the Wiki",2023-02-14 22:57:51

yauvrf,What to specialize in for my first job as a Software Engineer?,"# What to specialize in for my first job as a Software Engineer?

**Overall plan:**

I want to first work for a company while gaining experience and then change to freelancing remotely when I'm more experienced. Whenever I get an entrepreneurial idea, I would like to execute that idea (being a Software entrepreneur is my ultimate goal).

&#x200B;

**The thing I specialize in should ideally help me with all three things:**

1. Job in a company using the niche (ideally remotely... Or is it too hard getting a remote job as an entry-level position?)
2. Highly paid freelancing niche (So I have money to spend while executing the next software entrepreneur idea)
3. Developing apps as a Software entrepreneur (I think most of my ideas will be Web apps or mobile apps, maybe involving machine learning)

&#x200B;

So which thing can I specialize in for my first job that I can later specialize in when freelancing remotely and that is also useful as a Software entrepreneur (most likely web apps and mobile apps).

&#x200B;

**I'm interested in these things:**

* Webapps and mobile (mostly because most of my entrepreneur ideas are web apps or mobile apps)
* Machine Learning
* UI/UX/Psychology
* Music 

&#x200B;

I don't know if I want to specialize in front-end, back-end, or both (full-stack). 

Should I start out with front-end because it's easier and then later switch to back-end to see what I prefer? Then if I prefer front-end I could get some UI/UX skills and specialize as a front-end UI/UX Developer? If I prefer back-end I could get some machine learning skills and specialize as a backend machine learning engineer?

I'm considering specializing in Flutter or React Native because I only have to learn one thing I can use for Android, iPhone, and web apps.

Maybe I should start out in a big company because they can invest more in people who have just graduated?

&#x200B;

**So to sum up everything I have these questions:**

1. Should I specialize in front-end (maybe with UI/UX), back-end (maybe with machine learning), or full-stack as my first job, if I don't know which I would prefer? (Ideally, it should be useful for getting a remote job in a company, a highly paid freelancing niche, AND useful for creating web/mobile apps as an entrepreneur).
2. Is it a good idea to specialize in React Native or Flutter, so I can make web AND mobile apps with one technology? Or should I specialize in something else?
3. Will aiming for a remote job be too ambitious for a newly graduated software engineer entry-level position?
4. Is it best to aim for a big company, because they have more resources to invest in newly graduated software engineers?",2022-10-22 18:25:39
xp5ehn,Need advice on if I'm employed in the right place,"Hello friends!

So I'm currently living in Brazil, looking to move to Canada in the near-ish future. I've recently graduated university in comp sci, and through a selection test(its sort of like a university test to get a job), I've landed my first job at a large local bank.

Thing is, after university I only had a 2ish month internship to my name, and even that involved nothing besides watching training videos for marketing. Getting a job through a selection process like this was pretty much my best chance of breaking into the industry, as my resume simply didn't have what employers would be looking for by the time I graduated.

Thankfully though, I got this job now, but I'm trying to assess my position, especially against my goals. I've been assigned to the bank's database admin sector, where I'm going to help maintain and expand all the different databases used here. My concern is whether or not I'm realistically going to be able to leverage this experience when I go looking for a job in Canada.

My current plan was to work here for 1-3 years, doing a postgrad course or two, then take a special kind of leave, where you go without pay but can come back to your spot in up to a years time. Then, go to Canada(I'm thinking Ottawa specifically btw), sign up for a master's and look for a job to sustain myself, while I live off of money saved now and family help if it comes to that. Then, use the job offer to apply for a permanent visa.

TLDR: Wanna move to Canada, currently work as a DBA at a Brazilian bank. Am I gonna have a bad time? What can I do now?",2022-09-27 03:39:53
xbdzi0,Help! Work permit holder looking to attend a Bootcamp,"Hi everyone, I'm an international student and I graduated from UVic this year with a BA(philosophy, I loved it but it doesn't land me any job). I wanted to go to law school. My plan was to get my PR through Express Entry first before attending law school because I couldn't afford the tuition otherwise. So I got my PGWP (post-graduation work permit, 3 years). I need to gain 1 year of work experience in a skilled job categorized Teer 3 or higher, and enter the EE candidate pool. I have  a CRS score of around 540 (thanks to the French Language and Literature degree I did in my home country) and if the EE system doesn't change radically I can expect my PR invitation shortly after I'm in the pool. Then I go to law school in 2024, by which time the immigration process should have been completed. 

&#x200B;

So I get 2 gap years. I initially plan to work in a restaurant as a cook (other roles like waiter, kitchen helper, food preparer don't count as skilled work experience) until I can find a paralegal job at a law firm. Turns out it's hard to do either. I need kitchen experience (which I don't have) to be a cook preparing actual dishes (not fast food) and I'm competing with lots of native speakers for legal assistant jobs. 

&#x200B;

Then, after spending several weeks living with my friend interning at a big law firm, I also started to question my decision to go to law school and be a lawyer. I considered switching to CS before and I compared the life of a lawyer in Canada and a developer in a tech company, although I'm more interested (only slightly so because what lawyers actually do isn't that interesting) in law, I concluded that the flexibility and work-life balance of developer jobs is more appealing. 

&#x200B;

But I'm not so sure. I haven't studied math for a long time and I still look forward to the law school experience. But I have 2 gap years so I thought, why not try 3-month a bootcamp (as a work permit holder it's either self-teaching or bootcamps, I prefer bootcamps mainly because of their industry connections and the friends I'd make along the way)? what's the alternative? Cooking for months and scrambling for a minimum wage legal assistant job? I think an endeavor to learn how to code and look for a developer job (which for sure qualified for a skilled job) is much more rewarding because, if i succeed, I'll be gaining skilled job experience while making more money than any junior legal assistant job can offer and I'll be a developer with years of experience by the time that I would graduate from a law school if I followed my initial plan, I'd be making more money with a better (much better even) work-life balance. If I fail, I'll still be able to go to law school as planned, just with less related experience which isn't a big deal because law schools and recruiters appreciate diverse experiences and many lawyers say they've done nothing law-related before going to law school. I'll get my PR a few months later than initially planned because of the full-time study, but with 2 years I think it's enough time to get the official document that allows me to apply for student financial support for law school.

&#x200B;

So now I plan to attend a bootcamp in October (still haven't decided between lighthouse labs and Juno, any insight is welcome). My main concern is, how am I even gonna get interviews with a resume filled only with a bootcamp experience and personal projects? With no work experience or CS degree (or even any STEM degree), will I be able to find any job at all now that, as people say, the market for junior dev is saturated? I'll be happy to take any job. 50k. Minimum wage. I can even work for free (not for long though because I need a paid job to gain experience for my immigration) as long I can learn things that open more doors. 

Also I'd appreciate it if anyone can provide some insights on lawyer VS. developer career prospects.

Thanks for reading my long essay. I haven't been in a good place mentally and physically since 2019 and I REALLY need to get my shit together. Any advice is appreciated.",2022-09-11 09:19:11

wi5fx1,How could I go about graduating in Ottawa to getting a job in Toronto or the US?,"Hi there,

I'm an upcoming CS second year at an average Ottawa University and i've got a CGPA of 11.8 that I hope to keep. Recently, I've been thinking about wanting to find a job in Toronto or in the US because I've heard the job opportunities and are much nicer than in Ottawa.

What should I be doing to maximize my chances of being able to land an interview or maybe even a job at a good company in Toronto or the US? I'm going to be looking for a Summer 2023 Coop and forcing myself to code a few beginner projects but other than that I don't know what to do.

If it helps, I know someone who works at the Ottawa branch of Nokia so I was thinking of maybe looking there when I graduate but eventually moving away to work in Toronto or the US.

p12mu0,Cold contacted company for Solutions Architect - now I want to propose a job spec,"**TL; DR** – I approached a small managed services IT company in Eastern Canada about openings and met the CEO, which went great. Now I want to propose a job spec for Solutions Architect and work with them to create the position.

**Background**: I’ve been planning on changing careers to the IT field for a couple of years. Got a degree in chemistry and 12 years in international sales, BD & tech service.  

Did the AWS Architect Associate to get a taste for the cloud and liked it. I figured this is an easier way to get in rather than spam apply to developer jobs where I’m not going to be in the running most of the time.  

I plant to move to New Brunswick and so approached a handful of companies in the Cloud/cyber/managed IT services space there. I met the CEO of one for a meeting and sold him on my ability to learn the stuff, my knowledge of sales process and my eagerness to learn and work cloud. I did say I’d want to learn Azure (they’re an MS shop plus they sell hardware) and have a 50:50 split between sales and tech. I reckoned that would give the company clear value straightaway (as I can sell) and my own goals which are to work with tech hands-on.  

I am in the running for a remote Solutions Architect position in another company but I don’t feel confident I passed the tech interview (i’ll know tomorrow). The CEO is aware I’m in talks about another opportunity and he said that’s fine, let me know where you’re at in a week or two and we can talk. He did confirm he’d look at hiring me as an SA so there is a business need and we’re agreed on an initial role (title at least).

Ultimately my preference is to work for the IT company in NB rather than the remote gig as I’d be interfacing with real people, would be exposed to more technologies and I’m just not 100% convinced of the remote job’s business outlook.  

So I’m **looking for advice** on the following:

1. This is the first time I asked for a job rather than applied/was recruited. So I’m thinking I would write a job spec next, ask them to review it and agree on that first before talking terms/salary. Is that a reasonable sequence? I’d also want to talk with a few others at the company like senior sales & tech people.

2. In terms of salary, looking at the megathread and given I’m new to the industry, I think mid-$80K salary + large variable (might get a car/allowance too) based on performance would be reasonable to ask for. Not sure how much lower the salaries are out east. Alternative is to let them offer me something.  

What kind of salary should I be looking for and should I be comparing it to GTA?

&#x200B;

I'm a personal trainer based out of Vancouver, BC. Been teaching myself how to code using [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freeCodeCamp.org) and I've really been enjoying it. Recently, I've been considering enrolling in a boot camp (App Academy seems like my top pick right now) to fast-track myself to becoming employable, but as I do more research into the current state of the job market, coupled with the looming threat of AI, I'm having second thoughts. Here are my circumstances and my options, as I see them:

&#x200B;

1. I quit my job as a trainer and enroll in the boot camp for three months. The main benefits are 1-1- mentorship, cohort, building a network, and learning enough to go job hunting as quickly as possible. I have the financial runway to do this, but I'm not so hot on dropping 30-40k on a skillset that might not even get me hired and/or be rendered obsolete by AI.
2. Do the coding boot camp part-time and keep working as a trainer. This is safer, but will take longer.
3. Teach my self. No financial burden, but will easily take the longest to build the skills.

The second cancelled the position after two interviews (I had the third already scheduled), apparently they are freezing all remote Canada hires right now, they are only hiring if they need someone to go to the office. The recruiter didn't know what the company is gonna do next, but on their website I saw a couple of positions (including the one I applied for) open in Colombia so I assume they're hiring from South America cuz it's cheaper, my company does the same actually.

Are you guys seeing a surge in that strategy or in pulling open positions in general?

rtd06k,Job Saturation,"Im planning on going into CS in Uni, and honestly, its been my dream career since forever lol. But now Im beginning to have serious doubts about it.

I dont even live in a big city. I live in Vancouver. It seems like every kid here I talk to wants to be a software developer. Youtube is litterally infested with all this talk about being a Software Engineer, and theres about 50 CS channels for every Chemistry or Lawyering channel. Im just wondering how saturated is the field? Is it still possible to make a normal enough salary working in it?

You know how people say a stock is inflated when your taxi driver talks about it? Honestly I genuinely feel like that applies to job markets too. You dont see alot of youtube channels talking about being a doctor/lawyer. You also dont see people acting like being a Doctor/Lawyer is easy money either. Theres also not that much ""hype"" around being a Doctor/Lawyer, as much as there is for being a software dev. There just seems to be an endless amount of people going into the field, that honestly just seems like its only being outsourced more and more to India and China.

People say that Software Development isnt really saturated, and they say that alot of the people going into CS end up leaving, but thats the same with every program in Uni though isnt it? Is it really different for Software Development?

People also say that alot of people that end up going into CS think its easy money, and end up being incompetent devs. Is that really true? If so, what do I do to not be grouped with that?

This honestly been my dream career since I was a kid. Idc abt the money even, as long as I make a wage that I can live normally off of. I been playing around with Java through minecraft plugins, and C++ through arduino's since grade 3, so Im tryna tell myself that maybe I do kinda have some ability to compete with all the people going into the field. But I still cant shake the feeling that Im making a bad choice with going into software engineering. My family isnt very rich, but are offering some financial support for Uni. I dont really want to let them down.

xumv9e,What's the point of learning so much when there are no assurances for a job?,"I wasted my university years by not doing any coops/internships. I am struggling now to receive any callbacks. 

There are so many resources on the internet that I can learn from about dev. But it feels so demotivating when landing an interview is so hard. 

If skilled devs are in demand, how do you get skilled without work experience? 

And every year that goes by I feel like I'm seen as a weaker candidate since I have an employment gap post graduation. 

New grad roles have strict requirements that state only recent grads can apply. 

It doesn't seem practical to me. It feels like a lottery. Every person I know says that they applied to 300-400 companies to receive call backs. 

When you factor in the current recession,  and job scarcity, I don't think it's practical to compete for dev jobs, at least in my personal situation. 

If you think about it, getting a few years experience can bring in a lot of money to be a dev. What's stopping anyone from becoming one?

I don't want to compete, I just want to do a job, any job that is in demand even if it pays low. Hopefully it's a job that can make use of my formal education in software. Any suggestions?",2022-10-03 15:41:02

I'll be moving to Canada soon. Me and my wife recently submitted our passports, for visa stamping.  I was wondering if I should start applying for jobs here (wife already has one), and needed some guidance.

&#x200B;

**Some details -**

Our location would be in **BC , near Vancouver,** depending on which branch my wife gets posted at. Currently, it seems it would be either **Abbotsford, Chilliwack or Surrey**.

I would be getting an **Open Work permit**.

Expected timelines should be around 2 weeks to get our passports back, and then take a flight to Canada in about 2 months or less.

I'm currently working as a **Web Developer** (self-taught) with **1 YOE+**, in my home country. I do have a degree in a different field, and Masters in Marketing (all non-Canadian).

&#x200B;

I would be applying as a web developer (currently have more exp in Front End) , and it would be great if u could help me out with these questions -

1)When would be the correct time to apply for jobs? Once we get our passports stamped, we should take less than 2 months to land in Canada. Can I apply from here, or will recruiters expect me to be in Canada when I apply?

2)What kind of salaries should I expect ?

3)Where do I search/apply for jobs? I currently use LinkedIn and indeed. Are there any other platforms which would help?

4) I'm currently working remote, and would like it to stay the same in Canada as well. Are remote jobs easily available here? Also, even if I do apply for on-site jobs, how feasible would it be to get one in the locations which I have mentioned? I'm not sure if those cities have many tech jobs , unlike Vancouver.

5)If I search for remote jobs, can I search for jobs in the entirety of Canada, or am I only limited to jobs in BC?

6) How should I expect the interviews to be?  Take home projects, leet code, etc.

7) From the other posts on this subreddit, I guess me being self-taught should not be an issue, since I have some experience.  Correct?

8)Any other advice or help would be great!",2022-05-19 08:04:19
urq2rz,2nd year Software Engineer in US looking make the move to Canada,"Hi y'all, I'm a 23 yr old CS grad from a CSU and currently working at a small company for about 2 years. Since I came here on an F1 visa, I received 3 years of work authorization (OPT).

I'm on my 3rd year of STEM OPT which ends May '23. Since my H1B lottery hasn't come yet, my last shot of getting in the lottery is March '23. However, I don't want to leave things up to change (and a literal lottery). The primary goal is to get the sword of immigration uncertainty off my head (I am Indian) hence Canada would be a safer bet than USA in terms of getting a citizenship

Hence I am thinking of either:

a) applying to big tech companies in the US - maybe ask for a transfer to Canada at the end of my OPT? Not sure how realistic that is given the timeline. Also, my current job is a small company and I end up working long hours so I'm fighting for my life trying to find time to interview prep.

b) applying to Canadian PR - My current CRS score is about 415 and I don't think that'll be enough to get direct PR unless I have a job offer. Any ideas if this might be a better option?

c) applying to master's in Canada - I'm currently a JavaScript Web Dev and fairly passionate about cloud computing systems hence this might be a chance to get an advanced degree and improve my interview skills (God knows that I need time to properly do leet code and systems design prep).

I am looking at a few universities with a December intake to get a head start and not wait until Fall '23. One of them is Concordia in Montreal. Any idea how the CS masters program is like?

The thought of leaving income and going back to school is not one I am ecstatic about but getting the masters doesn't seem like a bad option.

I would appreciate any advice on this.

There is a definite slowdown in hiring and the overall economy is slow, but how is this translating to the tech job market?

If you have gone through interviews, is it more competitive to land a position? 

Does anyone have any thoughts on when this slow down will turn around?

zjbit5,What’s the best option to pivot my career into CS?,"For context, I have a degree in civil engineering and currently working in the civil industry in Alberta, but looking to pivot my career into tech, preferably in software development. 

Can anyone help me decide on which path is the most realistic?

Option 1 - Online master with WLU, while working full time on my current job. I didn’t choose Georgia Tech OMSCS because it’s too competitive to get in and I have no work experience in tech. Should take about 3 years. 

Option 2 - Going back for a BSc in CS with coop full time. It’s probably the most straight forward path but I’m concern about student debt and the 5yr it takes.

Option 3 - Diploma or bootcamp. This might be the cheaper route but I’m not sure how valuable is bootcamp in Canada, and I’m afraid that the career ceiling for this route is much lower compare to the other 2 options. 

Option 4 - Completely self-taught. Is this doable? 

Any input would be appreciated. Cheers!",2022-12-11 22:09:57

w1lack,Hot take: AVERAGE CS incomes in Canada are not lower than in the US.,"I have come to the conclusion that *on average* (i.e. if you are not working for a unicorn startup or FAANG tech company) CS salaries in the US are not at all higher than in Canada. Let's do a breakdown.

I currently make 110k CAD in Kitchener Ontario. Take home is 78,269.83 CAD. Now let's subtract the average rent of 1737/month for a 1 bedroom and that leaves me with about 57,425 CAD in disposable income a year or 44,070.87 USD a year.

If I were to make 140k USD in New York City, my take home would be 91,860 USD. Subtracting the average rent for a 1 bedroom in the city of $3950/month leaves me with a disposable income of 44,460 USD a year.

... Oh Wait, that's EXACTLY the same standard of living. Now, you can argue successfully that there are some areas of the US that offer a higher salary to cost of living ratio as well as lower taxes. But I just want to show this subreddit that the grass isn't always greener in the US. Keep in mind that if you were to compare salaries nomially, 110k CAD is 84,419.61 USD. The income in the US would be *technically* 66% higher. 

Now especially if you are working at a top tech company and are being paid a ton of stock options the whole calculus changes. But I would honestly say that this analysis is valid for like the bottom 75% of software developers in both countries.

vnmaak,Canadian Teacher Trying to Switch Careers. First job offer seems low - take it or leave it?,"tl;dr Canadian teacher trying to switch careers - first job offer I ever got was low/not fully tech. Take it, or keep learning and applying?

I've been a teacher for seven years and, while still good at my job, I just don't want to do this anymore. I worked for years in the international scene and made my way to getting paid decently well ($85k USD next year). However, this is pretty much the ceiling. I can work for another seven years and make it to the max of $105k USD at my school. Work-life balance is okay - and I have a fair amount of time off - but I'm just not as engaged or having the fun I used to.

During all of this I somehow got into teaching a ""coding"" class and I started working on The Odin Project and CS50. I enjoy it - the problem-solving is fun, and I always enjoyed working with technology as a kid. I also rolled out a lot of technological stuff at my past schools - including entire Learning Management Systems and being the Professional Development Lead and support. I started applying for jobs just to see what the interviews were like - and passed an interview recently.

It was for a ""Learning Management System Manager."" The job wasn't fully tech - but I figured it may be a good transition. It included managing a school's LMS, leading the technical support team, maintaining the school's SQL database, and helping design/implement courses using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The best part is that it was remote and got me out of the classroom.

However, when they gave me the offer, it was for only $47,000 USD. I knew I was going to have to take a pay cut, but was hoping for $65,000 - $70,000. Tried to negotiate them higher with no luck.

I've asked around and looked around - the pay was indeed low. However, I'm looking for more opinions. Is it worth taking this offer now - despite the huge pay cut - to be put into more of an official tech role, or do people think I should be patient and keep looking?

t7u8u5,Where should I go for a master's or higher education in the UK or Canada? // Software Engineer," 

Hi, I am getting admission in pg diploma in IT solutions in Humber college in Canada and in the UK I am getting admission from top universities. If I get a nice job in the UK then you have a good work-life balance and travel to Europe. The question comes that after two years of PSW I have to suffer for PR in the UK. In Canada, I am getting an average post-graduate diploma program but with that, I am getting easy PR and proximity to the USA. However, I come from west India where I live mostly 30+ degrees temp and in winter it is 17 degrees at max. I would choose the UK but there is always the situation that I have to come back to my country. In the UK, I am getting the best education, saving one year of time, work-life balance, traveling. In Canada, I have heard that it is depressing as people have to live indoors for months and it is too extreme cold. I am a more outdoor person who likes to travel and have fun around pubs, hiking, lakes, beaches, etc. Is cold manageable over there for people who come from a hot climate? 

Salary-wise, I think Canada is okay but not sure regarding taxation over there. The UK has a bit less taxation than Canada.

I want to know about UK work culture in corresponding to the international students outside the UK. If anyone knows regarding Canadian work culture or Canada in general. I would like to hear both sides.

q7cn8z,Does starting one’s career in Canada limit the opportunity to transition to the US tech market?," Is there much truth to the idea that starting your career in Canada makes it more difficult to transition to the US market later? Is it better to take additional voluntary time off from working to interview prep?

For a bit of context: Canadian citizen. I graduated with a research stream MSc last Fall from a Top 10 CS grad school where I worked on ML in Healthcare. Interned as an Applied ML scientist from graduation until early summer ‘21 for a Canadian VC. I didn’t like (applied) research very much and was very burnt out from the MSc + pandemic, so I took summer off. Haven’t done as much interview prep as I had planned and now been off work voluntarily for 5 months. Previously interned for a couple notable US tech companies (but not quite FANG) in SE roles for a total of >1 yr during undergrad in Bay Area and NYC.

I am primarily interested in ML Ops or systems/infra roles. I could fairly easily find a fitting role in Canada, but my observations over the years have been that those that start their careers here rarely make it to the US later. At the same time, I’m not gaining any relevant work experience right now, and giving up income. I am interested returning to the US market because I believe there are better & more opportunities for career development as well as far better compensation. Best I could find for starting in Canada is CA$110k/US$88k yearly. More likely CA$80/US$64. Most places won’t offer equity.

Let me know if I’m crazy!",2021-10-13 14:42:11
1azc5rt,Are most of tech job interviews still conducted online in 2024?,"Due to personal reasons, I need to relocate to a remote province soon.

Current job is fully remote and based in Vancouver (however, most of team members are not in Vancouver)

My friend and I discussed whether I should relocate, as it means giving up a city with bunch of job opportunities

I started looking for a job in 2022. At that time, all SDE job interviews were entirely conducted online.

But 2 years have passed , I wonder right now, whether most of SDE job interviews are still conducted online (2024)? (including all rounds of interviews)

My current company has proceeded layoff several times last year, Im afraid it will keep doing that (provided that I am not a top performer). Residing in a remote province with little job opportunities will raise the difficulty of securing a SDE job.(the pro is: the rent and expense will be vastly dropped down).

however, if most of the SDE job interviews are still entirely online, then I can still do the video interviews before eventually secure a new job.

(I can accept relocating to the city where the office is located after I get the offer. but if I have to go on-site in any interview phase, the air tickets would be expensive)

That's the only concern for me to decide whether to relocate.

110z4fa,Masters in UX or software engineering?,"I (23F) am graduating in May with a degree in psychology and minor in computer science, and I'm struggling to decide whether I should pursue a master's in UX or jump straight into industry as a software developer.

As a bit of background, I've had had 3 UX related internship experiences, however I am still unsure if it's right for me, which is why I have still doubts about accepting the masters degree. however I feel like this is the most rational choice, since a master's will hopefully help me land a well paying UX job after graduation, and also getting the masters feels like the most ""safe"" bet to getting a job.

But I'm torn because I feel like I enjoy coding a lot more, and I find it also more challenging. I loved my coding classes, and have also started working on some (simple) side projects. But choosing to not to the masters will be a risk because tech companies are not doing well right now, and I've been hearing how people with degrees in CS as well as previous internships have trouble finding jobs at this time. I am even less competitive than them, since I am just minoring in CS and don't have any internships. I am afraid that rejecting the masters will be one of my biggest regrets. 

I won't be able to do both (ie try getting a position now, masters next year if it doesn't work out), because of other issues that I won't get into.

First time poster here. Long story short, I am a software developper with around 4 YoE and I've been working for this new place for a few months now.

The work is very complex and we wear many hats. I like it in some ways because I get a lot of different experience, but I also hate it because the stress is intense and the pay is low. Not only that, but we are also working hybrid (2 days at work, 3 days at home), so it involves getting up earlier, paying for gas, paying for parking, etc. on those on-site days. 

For a while these issues didn't matter so much to me because I was telling myself that for once I was not dealing with a toxic boss or colleagues, and that I was learning a lot, etc., contrary to my last jobs. But lately, it has started to eat at me, because a new employee was just hired in our team and this guy has less YoE than me, is paid the same, and is allowed to work fully remote (all things that would make my already complex and underpaid job more bearable).

I'm currently debating about talking to my boss about this situation, but I'm worried this might not be such a good idea since I'm still in my probation period. Added to that, the tech market is looking pretty shit right now, so I fear being fired or whatever... 

Given that in like two months my probation period should be over, should I wait until then before bringing this subject up? Or should I go for it and not wait for it to eat at me? Or should I just not talk about it given the current market? I'm at a loss... What would you guys do given this situation?

My understanding is that a Bachelor's program is typically 8 semesters and that it's possible to take more than a full course load per semester.

If that's the case, I'm in a situation where, with help from family, I can dedicate myself fully to the coursework without having to work at the same time (or work minimally). I'd like to to take advantage of that before I get even older.

v4tsoo,[Prospective International Student] Should I enroll or wait for another college to offer LOA?,"Hello to all the amazing people on this subreddit,

I'm a prospective International Student and have applied to 2 Different Colleges (Jan Intake) for different graduate certificate programs, as follows:

\- Humber College (North Campus): User Experience Design - 3 Semesters with Work Placement

\- Conestoga College (Doon Campus): Web Development - 4 Semesters Continuous (No Break, No Co-op or Placement)

I applied for both colleges on 17th May and received an offer letter from Conestoga on 30th. Now, the thing is I need to submit a non-refundable 1500 CAD in order to confirm my seat before 30th June. 

As for Humber, it looks like we can't expect a response before 2 months on the least. Also, according to what I've heard, it's difficult to get into Humber. So I'm not sure if I am gonna get an offer letter from them. 

I only applied to these 2 Programs because these are what I'm most passionate about, don't have a preference for one over the other, I love both of them. The thing which I'm concerned about is the part-time job availability, whether or not the co-op is helpful, or maybe someone who has been studying/ is studying at any of the above colleges and can share some insights as to if it's worth it. The only reason why I'm not so sure about Conestoga is that:

\- It does not offer 4 month break (which would have allowed me to gain full-time job experience and would have helped me financially). I am not sure if there is any break in Humber Program, but it does offer a work placement in the 3rd sem.

\- It does not offer any work placement or co-op.

Considering my intuition about Conestoga is correct, a part of me asks me to enroll in Conestoga and wait for an offer letter from Humber too, so as to not burn the bridge. But that'd risk my 1500 CAD as well lol. What would you have done if you were at my place?",2022-06-04 17:36:58
uza75f,32F looking to pursue a post secondary education for the 1st time. Could desperately use some insight from those with greater work/life experience….,"Hi! Im specifically looking for advice on the type of career field I should get into. Diploma vs degree etc. What jobs are in demand???? I have been self employed for 12 years as a sole proprietor/photographer. This was never my dream job; but i am good at it and while my children were young it worked as I scheduled around my husbands schedule and saved daycare $. Now my children are all school age and the economy being the way it is(when people are struggling to buy food/gas they def dont have money for photos) I need to expand my horizons.
I have always wanted to get a degree or masters in history (ideally to become an archivist). But i realize after some research there are not many job prospects. I thought about getting into IT but i feel thats what everyone is doing and it soon will be over saturated. * considering software development and cyber security* 

Ive experience running a business, extremely skilled in PS, experience marketing, knowledge in Google analytics, CMS and graphic design etc. I have tried applying for jobs in marketing to avoid going to school but ive not heard back from any of the dozens of jobs ive applied for. Unfortunately I have only experience and am completely self taught so i understand the hesitation in hiring someone like me. 

Please advise. This is pretty much now or never for me…. As i have a daughter who will be off to uni in 5 years and I want to be able to help support her financially.

upmjkt,"Got my undergrad in business, looking for advice in transitioning into web development","I’m 26, I went to uni right out of highschool for business and got my undergrad after 4 years. Unfortunately I didn’t pursue any additional certifications, to be honest I wasn’t at all interested in this field and I only took the program because my parents wanted me to go to uni and I didn’t know what I wanted at the time.

I was working as a server/bartender throughout uni, and when I finished I tried to get a “real” job with my degree. Was only able to get a job working in the office of a big cannabis company (thought it could work my way up). I got promoted within the office but my pay only went from $17/hour to $19/hour. I worked there for almost 2 years, was pursuing another promotion which would have only got my just over $20 an hour… until I realized how miserable I was working there and how I felt like a failure constantly for getting my degree and working hard at this company to move up, only to still be making drastically less than I was when I was waiting tables at a restaurant, while working many more hours on average in the office.

I quit the job and went back to serving as soon as the pandemic ended, but like I said I am 26 now, and I do not want to be a 30 year old server. I want to finally start a career.

I have been passionate about computers and technology from a young age, and I have been working through The Odin Project the last couple months. I want to become a junior web dev. 

At this age it seems to make more sense to go all in and work hard in a boot camp and then work hard on creating some of my own projects, but I am worried I will be missing a lot unless I go back for a CS degree 

The thought of 4 more years and 40k+ in debt to go back to school is extremely daunting, especially because I had help from my parents the first time around.

If you were in my position at my age, what would you do?


TLDR ; got business degree did nothing with it and continued being a waiter, now 26 and want to become web dev. Don’t know if school or boot camp is the right choice",2022-05-14 17:51:53

vzszrl,Bootcamp grad with 2 very different offers,"Hi everyone! I'm a bootcamp grad and spent 6 months in job hunting and have come a longgg way to receive 2 offers as of today.

The two offers are very different and I am being torn -

1. Web developer at a digital marketing agency, building Wordpress websites, turning mockups into landing pages.  
Pros:  Local company where there is a physical office I can go to when I feel stuck at home. The tech stack is very straightforward and more ""stable"", you don't need to keep up with all the new trends like next.js or typescript.  
Cons: I'm not using what I learnt from the bootcamp, they are still using PHP/ JQuery, so basically I can get this job without going through all these hassles.
2. Front End Developer at a new energy company, building their internal software for the in-house research team.  
Pros: Bigger company, better career path. I will be using React which I learnt from BootCamp.  
Cons: The industry/product is ""boring"" and the team is new, so there will be some messiness. They also have some bad reviews on Glassdoor for being white favouritism, and so far everyone I met in the interviews is white. (I'm Female+BIPOC)

A bit about myself - I'm in my late 30s, not very career driven. I didn't go to bootcamp in hope of getting a higher income, I did it out of personal interest. These six months of job hunting have been really daunting and draining, I really don't see myself grinding leetcode, or going through 4-5 hours of onsite interviews. So I am actually wondering if software engineering is what I want, or if building fancy websites would also work for me.

But another part of me is like, I have gone through 12 weeks of bootcamp, killing so many brain cells during this whole job search process. Now I'm finally getting a software developer role, I should not let it go, otherwise, I'm putting one year of effort down the drain.

Can someone please help me navigate this? Thanks!

1bt2aia,Advice for landing my first job in tech ,"Posting this for a family member: I'm having trouble finding a job in Software development/Game Development

Context:

- I'm a graduate as of late 2021 with a degree in software development and game design from a ‘prestigious’ school

- I'm located in Toronto, ON

- I have no experience whatsoever in the industry as I failed to land an internship during school

- I have been on and off (as in a couple months on and then off) applying to jobs, at the entry level within the scope of my knowledge as of 2021, but have been unable to land INTERVIEWS.

- I mostly use LinkedIn/Indeed/Glassdoor as they have more general job postings and occasionally going to company websites of said job postings to search further for more jobs. It seems most entry jobs require some type of professional experience with a language that I'm not expertly proficient in or a sub-variant of the languages I am proficient in.

-During my academic career I studied mostly python, java, C++ and used unity to develop games and scripts in the C# language. I have a website to demonstrate a couple projects and feats I achieved and use it to apply to every job that I do apply to.

-On my resume I go in detail about the experience I acquired with projects (two games and one small banking system) from my university, as well as volunteer experience in the social aspects and also have stuff about my current job at a restaurant.

-Dates of my projects were from university days, I haven't had the time to go through the whole SDLC process solo to make a new project from scratch.

- On the daily, I practice code challenges, I'm retaking a course in algorithms, and learning the fundamentals of cybersecurity

It seems at this point I'm just desperate to get my foot in the door and have slowly strayed away from the soft/gamedev industry to get some, to get any, tech experience underfoot. While I don't want that it's something I'm considering because of the repeated learning opportunities aka we've decided to move forward with another applicant.

If you've any ideas that could help me I would greatly appreciate it or maybe if you could point out something I've missed.

PS. Can I apply to internship roles even if I'm not in school?

TL:DR

I have academic experience but no professional experience and a resume I've gone over a thousand times. I've been out of school for almost 3 years and I haven't been able to find an entry level job yet. Is there any advice you can think of that I probably haven't thought of yet? I don't have connections to many people who're also in the tech industry so I've been at this mostly solo.

Anything would be appreciated.",2024-04-01 12:21:53

xt8tmm,Career Advice,"Hello fellow Canadians.

I am an iOS dev with 2 YOE and a couple of internships. Been working in one company for two years now, but because of absence of learning and relatively low TC (120k CAD) decided to interview with other companies.

Cleared interview for Amazon iOS SDE2 position. Unfortunately, team I interviewed with do not have open positions anymore. Recruiting manager proposed two other teams. I talked to managers of those teams and I am not really excited about joining them. My main concern that they do not have other iOS devs in the team so not sure what I will be able to learn there. Also, these teams have on-calls (AWS), which is another downside. 

Money should be good tho, I believe I can double my current TC. So not sure what to do. I see a couple of options:

1. Choose one of the teams in Amazon and sign an offer.
2. As inclined feedback for Amazon is valid for six months, wait for another team (maybe my initial team will get new positions soon) while interviewing with other companies (not sure which exactly).

I understand that Amazon will definitely give me a boost for a resume and TC, but not sure whether I should settle for something that I do not really like (at least from outside, maybe teams are great).

I understand that DSA is very important and of course it comes up during full stack jobs.

However, after talking to people in full stack roles, they say there isn't much on the job Leetcode style or like algorithm classes.

I understand that too, but what do I do with these algorithm skills that took me months and months to learn and gain intuition in? I certainly don't want to loose these skills after spending hours a day studying.

If full stack development doesn't always provide opportunities to use these DSA skills, are there other fields in CS that make use of algorithms (Leetcode style) on a regular basis?

Basically, it's hard to imagine I will loose all of my DSA skills after getting a job if I don't get much opportunity to use them, because if I forget them, then it will take me a long time to get these skills back

We are the type of devs who knows enough about software engineering where we can discuss all areas across the tech stack. We know that Travis and Jenkins are CI/CD tools and not burger joints. We can explain the difference between Git and Github, what docker is and can intelligently explain what an API is and how to build a basic REST API using an MVC framework.

They would initiate with lots of interest then ghost you, initially tell about lots of good things only to back track later, lie about market rate, etc. It has gotten to a point where if I get a message with an Indian name (I am from that region too so I know) with a connect request, I simply ignore and if possible report to LinkedIn that I don't know that person.

To get it down to 2 pages, I had to start removing tech stuff as well. i.e. I could only list one of my AWS certifications ( I have multiple ones).

xmjk5o,Where to start on UX design career path? Human-computer interaction,"Hi all,

I graduate a few years ago with BA in Psych - I have been working a few different jobs but most recently a R15 with the public service, focusing on client services and computer systems.

I've finally figured out what I truly enjoy and I could see myself doing for a career. I have minimal computer science experience (a few electives) but want to pursue further education in CS, more specifically UX design and research, human-computer interaction.

I don't have the GPA for a masters (was diagnosed and properly medicated in my final year of uni), but would be open to certificate or diploma programs to jumpstart my education from scratch again and get started on a new path. I'm not stupid, I just have ADHD lol.

Ideally, a fully online delivery would be preferable but could find a way to make something work for the right credential.

For weeks I've spiralled down internet black holes, watching my browser tabs shrink smaller as I research more schools, programs, gpa conversions, etc... I'm hoping someone on here has had a similar experience, or any insight into this journey.

Thoughts on...

Bootcamps?

BCIT - Computer Systems cert? diploma?

Camosun - Information and Computer Systems Technologist?

UBC / SFU BCS (like prev stated, low GPA, low chance of acceptance)

uux62t,Job prospects with a 3 year cegep degree,"Hey everyone,

I've had conflicting answers (both here and by professionals) regarding whether or not a 3 year CS degree (QC DEC) will produce the same job opportunities than a CS bachelors. I'm currently an intern in a startup in MTL (Blockchain related) and have a job lined up as a Java dev in June. But even then, I still hear and get comments about still needing a Uni degree to reach the right salaries.

For context, I just graduated with a 3 year CS Cegep degree (DEC). The program essentially builds a full-stack and I genuinely feel confident with my coding abilities.

I'm very conflicted, circumstances in my life have forced a very real need for money and if I were to go to Uni, it would have to be part-time. I'm just not sure if it's worth the time (Salary only perspective).

Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any insight? I would really really appreciate it.",2022-05-21 22:06:41
um27gg,Picking Between Two University Programs,"Hi everyone,

Returning to school and narrowed down my choices between these two programs:

* Carleton Honours Bachelor of [Computer Science Software Engineering Stream](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/undergradprograms/computerscience/#Computer_Science__Software_Engineering_Stream__BCS_Honours)
* UOttawa BASc [Software Engineering](https://www2.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/undergraduate-studies/programs/software-engineering/course-sequence) (Mandatory Co-Op)

See the comparison of the programs here: [https://imgur.com/a/abeuD2B](https://imgur.com/a/abeuD2B)

There are trade offs between the two

1. UOttawa gets an extra Co-Op term in summer after 1st year, However I would graduate 2 terms later Vs. Carleton with 4 Co-Ops starting after 2nd year and graduate 8 months earlier
2. UOttawa is mandatory Co-Op and just need to maintain a 60% average. Carleton I need apply for co-op (not limited enrolment) and need to maintain at least a 75%
3. Carleton and UOttawa programs share nearly all of the same courses, but UOttawa has a lot of extra engineering courses to get an engineering degree (if that matters)

I want to hear from you your thoughts as students or professionals in the field on the comparison between the programs in my situation

My thoughts

* I like Carleton's campus, location, and student life better and Carleton allows me to graduate almost 1 year early with 4 Co-Ops, can start working professionally sooner which is better financially and for getting professional experience sooner.
* UOttawa has two extra terms of school and one extra term of Co-Op (After 1st year), **Please share your thoughts on if that is a worthwhile trade off even if the Co-Op is after 1st year (not knowing too much)**",2022-05-09 21:45:02

I'm in the 2nd year of the st lawrence computer programming and analysis course, and honestly, its super boring. I've done a lot of work in my spare time, and most of what we're doing is extremely slow review. Like, basic routing with express, and some basic templating in php. Even then tho, a lot of my classmates are asking to slow down. I guess I just don't feel challenged and like I'm missing out on stuff: we only do basic data structures, no compilers, no OS stuff, none of the more advanced parts of computing. Like, we're almost half done and O(n) hasn't come up at all, I had to learn that outside of class

The issue with switching to queens is that they won't take any credits until I go through all 3 years. On top of that, at the end of this year we get a 1 year internship (I mean, you have to apply, but everyone in past years has gotten one) and I hear that work experience matters the most. So should I just stick it out and hope that internship gets me a job and moves me into the workforce? Should I transfer and do a Bsc at queens? I guess I'm also just frustrated at being a poor student still at 25, so the prospect of at least another 4 years of schooling isn't great. Idk, any advice is welcome",2022-09-26 01:24:31

urjgu1,Guidance for my software development career,"Hi,
I am an Indian having 1 year of work experience as a software developer.
I currently have offers from Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering from CMU, U of Waterloo and UofT. 
Initially, i was a bit inclined towards the canadian univs, as there are less visa hassles for working there compared to US. But from my survey, it seems finding a decent software job with good pay (by good i mean around 90k cad base) in Canada is very difficult initially. However, maybe 10 years down the line i can use tn visa to work in the USA. Also, please let me know if US jobs can be done after canada pr in hybrid/wfh/any other setting and what are the chances in general?
So from a career perspective, is it a good option to go to waterloo/uoft, or should I choose CMU which i feel may improve my chances to get a good break initially due to US market, but later things may get precarious due to Visa issues(or I am overthinking here) and maybe return back to india with a with a huge paycut due to currency exchange (assuming by then canadian pr queue may get too long to get the pr) ?
From my personal preference, a pay cut of around 20 to 30% from US standards is fine to me given the stability found in Canada but a larger paycut may incline me more towards US.
If you are suggesting Canada for me, you can also suggest which one to choose between uoft and waterloo.

yzghk4,"Which one should I choose for CS, UAlberta or UCalgary?","Hey there, I’m an international student and I’ve been admitted into UAlberta and UCalgary’s undergraduate computer science programs. I received a C$14,000 scholarship from Alberta and a C$5,000 scholarship from Calgary, thanks to my percentage which was north of the mid 90s, and after these scholarships, both the universities cost the same. Before someone runs up to me and suggests that I apply to Waterloo with a high percentage, you should keep in mind that it costs an arm and a leg to study at Waterloo(around 100k with living expenses), and the other two universities for CS (UoT and UBC) take a lot of money and don’t guarantee you a spot in your chosen major.  

However, in Edmonton and Calgary I can do the CS degree at a comparatively more affordable price, hovering at around $40k a year with living expenses. I’ve been wondering about the better option between these two universities and cities, in general, as Calgary in my opinion seems to be the better city, with more businesses around, proximity to some rather lovely spots in the Rockies, and quite a lot of folks of my color around to help with the homesickness, but UAlberta seems to be the better university, with its sheer size and history as the premier university in Alberta, and a somewhat better Science Internship Program (UAlberta allows 4 month coops, UCalgary doesn’t), and in general, a reputation for having a better CS program academically (although I’m not too sure on this).  

Would you please shed some light on which one of these I should choose for my undergraduate CS degree, and whether the points I’m mentioning are really that important, because its quite difficult gauging the ground reality about these universities and cities from a million miles away. Keep in mind, that I don’t really have any plans on following up my undergraduate degree with a masters, and would wish to work in the industry during my penultimate year with the SIP, and a rather well paying job after graduation.",2022-11-19 16:59:38

hey so i just completed the first 3 rounds of interviewing for amazon onsite (1 round left for tomorrow) on the last round for today half way through, my laptop battery died i ran to the other room and logged back into the call on another laptop within 30 seconds and now im worried they are going to think i was trying to cheat. after the interview i immidiately took a video of my dead laptop battery and me trying to turn it on to show it is dead and i dont know how else i can communicate my battery genuinely died it doesnt help that i came up with the solution to the syystem design problem almost immidiately after i logged back in. i even tried telling him my solution was inspired by a popular video game (star citizen) but i think me mentioning that looks even more suspect. the interviewer didnt sound like he was suspicous but he was never really very friendly with me at any point. should i offer evidence to my interviewer tomorrow or would that that defensive look more suspect. Heres the evidence that i can provide

took a video of my dead laptop moments after the interview and trying to turn it on.  
i googled the system design problem that he gave me and found that my solution is different from them (they all use timestamps)

yjyo7e,Should I quit my job and study in Canada or wait?,"So I'm working as an application developer in the financial sector at a Fortune 500 company in India. I graduated in June this year with a 7.83/10 GPA in a 4 year Bachelor of Technology degree in Information Technology. I interned for this company from January to June, and started working full-time in July.

I've always wanted to move to Canada, and I thought I could begin by getting a Master's degree there and then getting a job. However, given the job market right now, I'm reconsidering my choices, not to mention my low GPA meaning I probably won't get into most prestigious universities like UoT and Waterloo.

I have two options before me:
1) Apply to less ambitious universities(Simon Fraser and uOttawa are on my mind. I know they aren't really easy either, but they're easier than UoT and Waterloo I think) or some colleges like Seneca or Centennial and hope to God that I get in. Then, use the experience from the co-op programs to break into the Canadian job market.

2) Wait for a bit, maybe another year or two, gather experience, and apply for an Express Entry PR as a Federal Skilled Worker with 3 years of experience. This is safer, and saves me the cost of a Master's degree, which for an international applicant it's a LOT(I've got about 82.5k CAD saved up for the entire thing). It would also mean I'd start my career with a very significant nest egg, and with the right investing decisions, could lead to an early retirement. However, it would also mean I'd have to stay behind in this city that I hate so much for 2 more years.

I want to work in the cybersecurity industry, and I know that the demand for mid to senior level personnel is high, but for juniors it's abysmally low. So I wouldn't mind working as an SWE before pivoting later on.

zd6y63,How does your organization approach code reviews?,"I'm just curious how different organizations are approaching code review.

For my organization, we typically assign the same 3 developers to every PR. But this tends to result in the PRs lagging behind, as code review doesn't seem to be a top priority. With multiple assigned, it tends to be that the code review takes forever to get reviewed, as the reviewers just assume that one of the others will review it. 

So I'm curious. How does your organization approach this? Do you have certain people assigned to code review? Or is it an effort of the entire team? Do you assign code reviewers based on the underlying ticket, or generally the same developers for every ticket? Does your organization have a specific time set aside for code review?

I'm from India and I have 4 years of experience in software development. I'm looking to move to Canada and a friend who lives in Toronto highly recommended me to do a  program like this in my field as a break-in. The programs that I am looking for have co-op in the 3rd semester as well

A few questions I have in mind:

1. How likely is it for me to get a decent part time in an IT company while I study?
2. Is the certificate program and my prior experience enough to be considered for a good full-time role when I try to apply to companies after my course? Or do companies prefer people with a master's degree?",2022-01-16 11:14:35
s594nm,Irish looking for IT work in Canada,"Hi all, I was supposed to go to Canada in May 2020 after finishing my computing degree, but due to the pandemic I had to postpone moving over. I have got a visa extension that I have to use by June now. Since I graduated in the middle of a pandemic it's been tough to find a job within IT in Ireland, but I have managed to get work as an IT Support Engineer where I have about 8/9 months of experience.

wrdpdw,UBC BCS vs BCIT CST Career Outcomes,"I was recently admitted to the British Columbia Institute of Technology Computer Systems Technology diploma program (2 yrs long). I was also rejected from the University of BC Bachelor of Computer Science (2 yrs long as well) this year. I have a previous BSc in Biology from UBC. I was just wondering what the differences in career outcomes would be between completing the diploma at BCIT vs getting a proper bachelors at UBC. The two big factors are degree vs diploma and BCIT vs UBC (in terms of recognition). 

With just the CST diploma, I am concerned about the following: 
1) I may be limited in terms of the CS fields I can realistically work in.
2) I may be ineligible/very uncompetitive for senior positions in the long-term.
3) I may have significantly limited access to jobs at higher profile companies including those outside of BC and Canada (e.g. FAANG). 
4) The diploma may give me significantly weaker and less-enduring knowledge of CS fundamentals than the alternative. 

I also wanna add that it seems to me that in CS, a formal bachelors is not 100% necessary to do a lot of things given the amount of self-learning and personal projects you can do. I'm just trying to understand what significant limitations exist with just the BSc Bio + diploma vs a second CS degree. While a lot of things may be theoretically possible, I also want to get a sense of practical and realistic expectations to have with the CST diploma. 

I guess ultimately I'm trying to assess all of this so I can decide whether it would be worthwhile to not attend the CST this year and reapply to the UBC BCS next year in hopes of improving my career outcomes. Alternatively, maybe I can learn some strategies on how to make the best of the diploma and bridge any gap between it and the degree.

10gy016,Co-op placements in this economic climate,"I’m in the middle of applying to places for a summer placement. Given the current news of layoffs and hiring freezes, I have a feeling that landing a placement this year is going to be much harder as compared to last year. 

I already finished one work term this fall and my manager is happy to have me back for the summer. I normally would have said yes, but I’m trying to find a different role just to get a better insight at what I want to do after I graduate. Now my biggest worry is that is what if I don’t land anything by this summer? 

The previous role was in support and I’m looking for a analytical role this summer. 

So my question to you guys is that should I keep applying or just tell my manager that I’ll be coming back this summer? It might not align with my goals, but at the end of the day having a placement this summer is better than having nothing at all.",2023-01-20 14:14:54

xe5kgj,Is now an unwise time for a career change?,"Not  sure of the best way to present what I'm asking, so I'm just going to  start presenting information in the order that makes sense to me and  hope people can follow along enough to give me some advice.

With  a looming economic downturn and increasing inflation and interest  rates, it seems like a lot of tech companies are slowing or even  reversing growth. I'm currently a senior software developer in the  advertising/marketing space, I've been with my current company just over  a year and we are still doing some hiring (we've seem to always had  slow, steady growth, rather than sudden bursts of growth).

I  recently received a LinkedIn message from an HR management software  company looking to fill several senior dev positions. I figure HR  management will always be needed and they're a large company, so odds  are it would be a safe move under normal circumstances. That said, it  seems like we might be headed for less than ideal economical  circumstances, so there may be some risk there. My worry is that if  there were a sudden downturn during my probation, I might get cut first  as a cost-saving measure.

I'm not  keen to leave my current job (management is great, the pace of work is  comfortable, and the work is interesting), but I got hired at the max  value on their pay scale for senior dev and it's still on the low-end  for industry standard. Additionally, the new company advertises  excellent compensation and work-life balance (some more research and a  chat with the recruiter should give me a better idea how true this is).

I  bought a house at the tail end of the craziness (my wife and I got  lucky, we bid on a house with no other interest, so we also got to  negotiate down to what ended up being summer prices) and while my wife  and I can afford the house as it is, it needs a lot of work, we're also  trying to plan a wedding reception for next year (did a city hall  wedding this year out of respect for her parents wishes that we not live  together unwed - though we had already planned to marry) and a  honeymoon.

With all the competing  financial goals, more money would be a huge help. I've already been told  by my manager that the ballpark raise will be likely around 3-4%, which  isn't nothing, but it's still a pay cut with inflation considered. To  add to things, my wife and I are on a 1-year mortgage term, because she  wasn't working when we had to apply, so we had to use an alternative  lender until next year in June (she's working now, but it wasn't soon  enough to qualify with an A-lender), so we'll need to either renew with  our current lender or re-qualify next year with an A-lender (this is  preferred, our current lender was a pain in the ass about giving us the  money at close, to the point our RE lawyer had to step in a couple  times). To add clarity, we're currently at 3.99% fixed 1-year and we  could afford higher rates (though it will get tighter, to the point  we'll have to pause spending like renovations), but re-qualifying might  be out of the question then, as  I don't know we would pass the stress  test if the rates continue even higher. A career change now works with  our renewal timeline, as long as I'm kept beyond probation, and would  help with renewing.

To add some additional context that I'm unsure where to add, my wife just graduated in April and was hired at the high-end of the salary range for new grads in her industry, so she isn't able to increase our household income currently. I also take on a larger portion of the financial responsibilities as I make nearly twice as much as her.

&#x200B;

I originally posted this to r/PersonalFinanceCanada, but it was removed because

>Moderators remove posts from feeds for a variety of reasons, including keeping communities safe, civil, and true to their purpose.

...Even though there's a huge financial aspect to my question (ooookayyyy... lol)

&#x200B;

All this in mind, is now a bad time to consider a career change? Or would I potentially be risking more by not trying to improve my immediate  financial situation, given the rising interest rates? If inflation and interest rates weren't on their way up, I wouldn't even be considering a move at the moment. I'm just worried about us losing too much buying power if I take no steps at all.

It feels like a debate of ""what's the greater risk?""

If this too is not the correct sub, I would appreciate some actual communication from the mods on why and where I could maybe go (thanks again, PFC...)

wx1fzj,Getting reasonable overtime Comp,"My company just went through a seasonal rush and the devs were 'encouraged' (expected) to work overtime. This is my first dev job and I thought that overtime followed the regular hours over 40 in a week. During a meeting with my manager he informed me that it's actually over 44 hours in a week which I can accept. The part that I can't find reasonable is that for hours 41-44 I get no compensation for even though our regular working week is 40 hours. The other devs last year got paid over 40 and that's the only reason no one complained about pre-approved overtime. Is there anything I can do here?

wwapqy,How long does it take to get familiar with the codebase?,"Long story short, I am doing my internship at an edtech firm. I am 7 months into the internship. From past 6 months I am doing development task and I am delivering consistently but I still feel lost when I pick up a new task.
I am working with react, Ruby on Rails and GraphQl. I had decent experience working with react. Whenever I pick up tasks involving frontend I'm pretty good at it and can deliver within the deadline. But I had no experience with rails and GraphQl and when I pick up the ticket involving backend I just get lost, Usually I get help from my seniors for those tickets and get it done but I want to be more self sufficient as I am about to join the same company as junior dev.

The question is:
How do you get yourself more familiar with the codebase.
How do you effectively investigate a ticket in the code base before actually writing the code.

10kdu7w,Is outsourcing from American companies good for Canada?,"On a lot of American subreddits, people tend to fear their jobs getting outsourced to countries like India or China. This includes some people who work in CS fields. 

However, Canada seems more like the ideal candidate for outsourcing jobs to since we have a better education system than those countries, speak the same language as the Americans, and are in the same time zones, which makes communication and quality of work better. 

American companies will have to pay Canadians a higher salary than India or China, but still with better results than those countries and a lower salary than the US. 

It could also force Canadian-based companies to raise their own salaries to compete with the American companies setting up shop in Canada.

xa2bzh,Is It Possible To Get Into CS If You Have An Arts Degree?,"I have a bachelors degree in animation. And I have a diploma in programming (which included full stack web dev, OOP, Databases, Linux, Networking, DSA). No work experience.

My diploma is not an associates degree. It's just a 2 year diploma.

After doing the diploma, I realized that I love programming and would like to do it as a career. I didn't enjoy animation that much, I found it mind numbing.

I've applied to a LOTS of junior developer jobs but never hear back. I did get some attention on 2 applications. Both of those jobs were front end web dev jobs where there was a heavy usage of graphics (Photoshop, Video editing, etc.). I'm guessing they only replied to me because of my animation degree and saw it as something relevant to the job.

It seems like the only way recruiters will reply to you is if you have a bachelors in the subject that the job deals with. On my skills section in my resume, I've emphasized my programming skills way more than my animation skills but it seems to do no good. They only seem to care if you have a bachlors.

I'm not in a position right now to get a BSc in CS. 

So given my situation, would you say I have a chance to get into this field? I feel like I'm pushing up against a brick wall. Are those graphics intensive front end jobs my only way out? Do I have to focus on that niche? Or is it possible to break through into other types of dev jobs?

Would appreciate any advice! Especially from someone who's been in a similar situation (where your bachelors was in an unrelated field to programming).",2022-09-09 18:08:07

1az2qtp,Working as a new grad before graduating? ,"Was fortunate enough to land an internship for this summer. I’m finishing up my third year of my undergrad and have one year left.

He told me he did it when he graduated 10 years ago. 

It’s the first time I hear of something like this. Don’t companies typically want you to finish your undergrad before hiring you as a new grad? 

My goal is to at least get a full time offer for when I graduate, but the idea of working full time immediately and doing part time school does sound appealing.

I know this is quite a broad question to ask, but I don’t even know what specifically to ask.

I’ve been at a loss as to what I can do right now based on my skills, and don’t know how to proceed in readying myself to land jobs or internships.

&#x200B;

I’m an undergraduate comp sci student (in Ontario) finishing my second last year of university with no personal side projects other than a few machine learning tutorials.

**Notable School projects I’ve worked on:**

* Game of Othello made with JavaFX
* Banking ATM application built around quality assurance using C++
* A conceptual mobile app, with conceptual design, functionality, and interaction
* A high school comp sci final project where I made a 2d “dungeon crawler” game in Unity where you navigated a randomly generated map to find a staircase, until you reach the boss.

&#x200B;

In terms of programming languages, I’ve worked mostly with Python, C++, C# (Unity), and Java (in no particular order), and currently I’m most knowledgeable in Python, as I’m taking a data mining course that uses it exclusively, and I’ve done a *couple* of python Leetcodes.

I have a lot of interest in machine learning and neural nets, although looking around it’ll be hard to get into without at least a master’s degree, and that won’t be possible since my GPA isn’t even high enough to be considered for one. I’ve also never been great with math, which is ironic considering I’m in comp sci, but I love solving problems even though I don’t actually do any problem solving for fun on the side either.

Of the coops / internships I’ve seen, they’re either web dev positions (which I have no skills in nor any desire to do web development), or positions that require knowledge I don’t have of loads of different applications.

Something to note, I’m going to be working over the summer in some capacity as I pay for my tuition myself, and won’t be able to afford it otherwise.

I really like programming and creating different programs to do different things as a hobby. I have made things using languages like Python, JavaScript, Golang, C#, as well as attempted to use other languages. I am aware that computer science is a very broad topic and that programming is just a small aspect of it. If I like programming, problem-solving, and doing things like this, what job/career should I have in the future? Things like being a software enginner or software application developer seem like they're programming jobs and they would suit me. Am I right? What about being a web developer? What other careers are a possibility for me that I should work toward? What should I start working toward? After high school, what should I do in college or university - what programs in what colleges or universities should I be in? If I like programming and making things as a hobby, does that mean it should stay a hobby and that my actual future career should be something else?

wv9rw2,How much should a SWE/SDE of 1.5 yoe know?,"So I am curious about this since I have 1.5 yoe and an internship prior when I was in college (graduated in May 2020). What are the skills and to what level do good companies expect a good SWE/SDE with this much exp should know so they they’d hire em. 

My strength is Python. Other skills are Java, MySQL, R (boring af but easy), Linux (still learning) and systems design (obv learning still cos it comes with more exp). 

Now, let’s take Python for example since that is my greatest selling point. If I want to be hired by a good company, how much Python should I know and what all should I be able to do with ease and/or with little difficulty ? 

Lastly, what all other things I can do to improve overall (including current skill set and etc)  ? I know lc is there but I think one gets better in that with practice and answering the Python part would also answer this one too.

1b2psrd,Game development vs. software engineering?,"I have opportunities for both game development and software engineering for an internship, and I cannot decide what kind of career I want - I wanted some advice as to which one I should pursue. Here are some pros for each industry that I am considering.

&#x200B;

Game development (making FIFA at Electronic Arts):

\- I will work on making a video game that I played growing up as a kid

\- I will get to use my favorite programming language, which is C++ (as opposed to Javascript in software engineering)

\- The company campus is insane (soccer fields, basketball courts, gym)

\- Very likely for a return offer compared to my other opportunity below

&#x200B;

Software engineering (SWE Internship at SAP)

\- Pay is better 

\-  WLB is much better than game industry

\- Office is located in downtown (I always wanted to work in downtown Vancouver)

\- Significantly more opportunities in the future compared to game development, not only in Vancouver but also in the rest of the world

&#x200B;

I want to know if choosing a lower pay, less opportunity, and worse WLB is a good tradeoff for working on a product that I love with a programming language that I love, not only for this internship but also in the long run in my career. Also, I would like to know if it's easier to switch from software engineering to game development or the other way around. Thanks!",2024-02-29 03:03:12
zfj6r1,Studying Mechatronics engineering vs computer science,"Today I was accepted to queens university for both tron eng and compsci. I want to go into swe, but I was wondering if it really mattered what I’m studying and if it would affect me being able to find internships?

Obviously CS makes more sense to study but I’m leaning towards Mechatronics for multiple reasons: 

1. Easier to make friends in engineering, and it has a much more tight knit community 
2. Get the opportunity to take hardware classes + exposure to more fields
3. Harder to self learn hardware stuff then self learn coding 
4. Can still take some coding classes, 4th year can be entirely software based 

Maybe I sound crazy as compsci has a lower tuition, less workload and more relevant classes, but Mechatronics just is really appealing to me.

I’ve been programming since I was a kid so I have a ton of projects already and know how to code fairly well. I’d definitely be joining clubs related to CS and doing stuff like hackathons. What should I choose?",2022-12-08 00:22:49

The US is under the risk of facing an unrealized output of $162B if the country's software developer shortage keeps growing at the same pace. Business development and digital transformation are impossible without new talent, which intensifies the gap between tech talent supply and demand.* ""

**Now my question:** Is there a job board that ***only hires people outside the US*** to fill that gap. I am not talking about a job board for remote hiring but a specific job board where the company that posts job applications are solely posting to get people outside the US from different countries to bring them into the US tech field and fill the gap in the tech industry.

Is it a waste of time for me to apply if I don't even have any references. Since it's the government I'd imagine they'd be strict on the reference check but maybe there are some people on here who were able to secure a government position without a reference check?",2021-06-01 16:23:46

n8z0cd,Fresh CS Grad that does not know which doors I have opened for myself,"This is a cross-post from cscareerquestions because I want the filtered perspective that this subreddit provides:

&#x200B;

 

As someone who has just recently graduated from a CS bachelors program, I have no idea what benefit I have over someone who graduated from, say, only a bootcamp (all else being equal), and I have been having a hard time finding the answer to this question. The closest answer I have gotten is that 'bootcamp grads usually can't apply to embedded entry level jobs.' (No hate to bootcamp grads though. All respect for anyone trying to hustle to make something of themselves in this world.)

I have heard so much rhetoric about the different types of jobs available to SENG and CS grads, and how those grads don't make 'software stacks'(MERN, MEAN, etc.) their main selling point as a bootcamp grad might. I have heard that once you start defining youself by these stacks, then that usually means you are a web developer. I don't want to become a web developer at the end of the day, but I don't know what to look for in an entry level job description that will keep me off that path.

What I am trying to point out, is that there seems to clearly be some distinction about the doors that a CS degree can open, but looking at the market and job ads in Canada, I can't seem to see that distinction in entry level positions. Either the job ads are asking you to be familiar in some software stack and the job is web-dev related, or the experience and tech required is so absurd that I find it hard to believe that any fresh grad would have that experience. I have only checked linkedin job ads though.

What kind of entry jobs should I be looking for as a fresh CS grad (and as such, are available to me as a fresh grad), where I would generally not be competing with bootcamp grads? By this I mean, what search filters should I be using to find such positions, or what should I look for in job descriptions to keep me away from jobs heavily applied to by bootcamp grads? It is hard to not sound condescending when asking this question but know it is not my intention.",2021-05-10 07:56:37
10lzfcz,Business/Engineering Transition into Tech,"Just looking for some career/course advice.

I don't have any full stack apps on my resume but i do have 1 backend project in Spring boot (which was a REST api I made that holds a customer database in PostgreSQL and tested with Postman) and 2 front end projects with one being my portfolio site and the other just a website that uses an existing api to show movie and tv show data (neither of them use some cool framework like React or Angular tho).",2023-01-08 20:27:31
yva07c,Career Change at 29,"Hey guys!

I'm going on 11 years as a technician in the Airforce, having joined right out of Highschool. Currently financially comfortable at ~74k yearly, but I've grown to dislike my job.

I've applied for NSCC'S Cyber Security program in a first step for career change, and am truthfully looking for some clarity that this will be a good decision in the end. 

I'm a very dedicated individual and due to my time with DND I'll have my college (and another 20k or so afterwards for further education/certificates) fully paid for.

Is the Cyber Security program offered through NSCC a good foundation to begin with?

With the ambition to continue gaining certifications after college, are median salary expectations in Canada anything impressive?

Is there any sort of guidance as to which certifications are/aren't worth pursuing after a college degree in Cyber Security? Mainly which ones are in more of a demand in Canada (Or maybe even Can/US)

xz6qnv,Are there 1 or 2 year programs that ladder to a CS degree?,"I want to get a CS degree. But I want to do a 1 or 2 year program, and get a job with that, then later use that towards finishing a CS degree if I decide to.  Possible?

I'm coming to think the answer is no. The courses don't seem to match up. Those 1 or 2 year programs that sound computer sciency, are not computer science. So I guess there aren't any 1 or 2 year programs that can ladder into a CS degree?

If that's the case, what if I forget getting a CS degree, and instead go for one of those programs that sound computer sciency, but aren't actually computer science? Because it seems those sort of programs can be laddered to a degree. But that degree isn't actually computer science.

Here is an [example ladder at BCIT](https://www.bcit.ca/computing-academic-studies/computing/part-time-studies/credentials/):

1. Computer Systems Certificate (1 year)
2. Computer Systems Diploma (2 years)
3. CST Bachelor of Technology Degree (4 years)

Actually a better example is the degree in ""[Computing Science](https://www.tru.ca/science/programs/compsci/programs.html)"" from TRU. Oh it sounds so close to Computer Science!

Are these computer science adjacent degrees as good?  Can I get similar jobs?  My hunch is it's not as good on a resume and you won't get paid as much.",2022-10-08 23:28:11

zgntdf,"Took a 3 year advanced diploma, graduated early to work full time after 2 years & co-op.","Hi there. I was wondering if I can ask an opinion about education and experience in Canada. I currently work for my local government as a contractor. I got hired on after my co-op which I was able to find due to the co-op requirement of my 3 year advanced diploma. 

I still had some school after my co-op but they wanted to hire me, and I wanted to work full time so I took the offer. I decided to graduate early from my 3 year diploma and take the 2 year regular diploma in Computer Programming. To me it seemed like a good choice because the remaining courses I could take at school would not help me in my career and I was/am learning a lot at my job.

However, I am sort of wondering about how it looks to just have a diploma, if I have experience. Obviously it's better to have a degree, but I was never able to go to University because of finances/lack of high school credits to get admitted. So I sort of had a choice to make like either go for the 3 year diploma, or 2 years + work experience. 

I'm wondering what are the thoughts about work/experience and education? I am 26 if that matters, so not that old I guess haha.

How is the entry level earnings realistically compared to soft dev or dev ops.

\- Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below)

\- Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense

\- **Properly anonymize your resume or risk being doxxed**

uo2wkp,Should I Learn: Math vs Statistics,"Hello everyone,

After I save money, I plan to go back to school for either a math degree or a statistics degree.

Basically, I really want to learn math out of passion and so that I can understand algorithms very intuitively. I think this is very important for a software engineer and also because I've always wanted to know math at the undergrad level at least.

&#x200B;

The only reason I'm thinking of stats is because I feel like if I learn stats, then I can get into ML and understand it fully - but stats doesn't interest me all that much, and all I see in it is the money.

&#x200B;

I know I'll be happier getting a math degree, but stats could potentially get me into ML and thus let me earn more money.

So the question is, do you think I should go for math or stats? I'm personally leaning towards math due to happiness and passion and because I truly want to intuitively understand algorithms.

tm3cc2,Need salary tips for upcoming promotion,"Hi all, I'm going to get promoted any day now to Senior Eng at an IT corp(got the hint), which is comparative to a Principal SDE at MS. Been at this company since school, 12 years now. Annual raises are always peanuts, promo raises were good in the past not sure of how things are now. Making 125k now, had a 10% raise last year which is unheard of, standard is usually <5%. Everyone likes me and respects me. I honestly have no clue how much % the promo will come with, but I think I should counter it this time or atleast speak up. I've never spoken about raise percentages for annual nor promos, just take what I get and move on. This is also the first time I openly asked about being promoted at the beginning of the year and they had told me it's already in the works, you don't have to worry about it.

I know I can only expect huge bumps in sal if I hop jobs. Based on my research, I'm confident I can get minimum 180-200k with other companies and this is being super conservative. I don't want to hop just yet, but at the same time, I want a decent bump. Any tips on how to ""negotiate"" the impending raise %? Or should I even bother negotiating it to avoid a strain relationship and further increasing expectations? How long should one stay at the company after being promoted so not to burn bridges? I was actually already in the position of fixing up my resume, but I just got the hint for promo soon. Thanks all!

zxfhl0,Will a low-code dev role hurt my developer career?,"Hey everybody! 

So I am trying to get my first dev role after finishing my CS degree in September and it looks like I will have a chance to interview for a low-code role using Microsoft Power Platform. If I understand correctly there is still some scripting/coding involved in Typescript/C#. 

The pay is decent and it has been tough to find entry-level opportunties this fall/witner so I'd be incluned to take it. Just wondering people think this kind of role would hinder my chances of getting a more conventional high-code role down the line.

about me: middle aged, returning to market after decades. 10+ years experience on mainframes with C and Oracle. Recently completed an IT diploma in latest tech.

about the job: government. COBOL/DB2. Entry-level / Graduate. Low pay.

The pay is low so I want to negotiate the top of the pay band immediately. I have 10+ years experience. Once I sign, pay rises are governed by collective agreement, so non-negotiable and incremental and very slow. They seem to like me. The hiring process was informal and lightning fast. I get the impression from them that not many people will consider doing COBOL. 

How can I best go about negotiating? I don't want to job-jump to get up to what I'm worth. Also once I start with COBOL, my path will be somewhat fixed. I'm not greedy, but I don't want to be low-balled considering my experience. What is the best approach without pissing people off. They seem nice. I want to work with them.

ympvl8,Amazon SDE-2 IoT Edge Virtual Loop Interview,"Hi all,

As title says, I have a loop interview for Amazon SDE-2 IoT Edge role in a month. But everything happened so quickly. They contacted me from linkedin and sent me online questions immediately. I didn't even study, out of 2 questions I solved both but for one question, few test cases did not pass. Now I am invited for a loop interview without doing some intermediate interview.  Everything has happened so fast, so I am super confused and I have many questions.

1) Is it a redflag that they put me into final loop interview easily and fast? Maybe many developers left and they are desperately looking for new developers?

2) I've been working as C++ developer in various high tech IoT and industrial automation projects (semiconductor manufacturing, biopharmaceutical etc) and I can clearly say what I do as system design and low level design is vastly different than amazon system design or LLD interview. I mean it is immensely weird to ask to IoT dev to design a netflix. Designing semiconductor manufacturing system is VASTLY different than designing netflix and priorities, dbs, technologies, communication protocols are VASTLY different. My question is, are they asking similar LLD and system design questions to every team or can it differ based on role?

3) My current company is in Germany, I have a very high salary for German standards, the company has no competitors, I can literally get retired in this company. But of course, SDE 2 salary for amazon is still much higher than my current salary.  My questions are, how is the job security in Canada FAANG companies, is SDE-2 Amazon salary worth to change country?

I have professional experience with Linux, Oracle and C, and in my course I did a fair amount of SQL server, C# and some java. I did some front end stuff too (web, win forms), but I prefer back end.

So my question is, will an employer require that I know more front end stuff, Or will they employ me purely as a back end/DB developer, or do I need to develop my front end stuff (web interface, javascript, angular, etc)? I'm thinking I might be better focusing on java and eclipse. I did more C#/visual studio in my diploma.

I did mostly Web Development but I didn't gain any real software development experience from these jobs. So I decided to go back to school and complete a university degree in computer science that way I could move more towards software development and less IT.

I've now graduated with an BCs Honors Degree In CS and i'm finding all the Junior Developer positions I apply for are:

* Oversaturated with applicants.
* I get an interview and then afterwards I either don't get a response or I get a rejection in 2-3 weeks saying it was a competitive process and it was a hard decision..yadayada .
* The position is advertised as a development position and then during the interview the interviewer explains the role/position and it defaults back to an IT job.

I'm currently employed in a different role then what I was promised in the interview, the salary is good but I can't see myself being competitive 3yrs down the road if I stick with this job.

I'm considering a pay cut just so I can move into a different role and gain the experience I need to be more competitive in the future.

Either:

* I can keep applying for dev positions.
* Stay with the firm, wait till the current project I'm assigned to ends and if there is a developer position try to do an internal transfer.

My main question:

* Is it worth sticking with the firm?
* Or should I just try to look else where?
* Is the market for Junior Developers really saturated? I hate to sound melodramatic but am I going to have to end up applying for a Junior Developer position on Baffin Island or some really remote region just to brake in?",2022-07-05 05:29:51

10b79wf,Where Can I Find A Recruiter For Personal Advice?,"I think there's something seriously wrong in my approach to job applications. I don't know what exactly it is. But recruiters just immediately toss out my application. Most of my applications get the "" Not selected by employer "" notification within just 1 day of applying. It feels like they don't even want to spend 10 seconds considering me. I recently applied for a job where I had 90% of the unique set of skills they required. I was sure they would at least consider a first interview. But they didn't.

However I have been accepted into the first round of interviews twice so far, on a website where I did not upload my resume. There are websites like this which let you make job applications without a resume. You just need to send a cover letter to the hiring person (who usually is the head of the company). These websites are popular with smaller companies - Usually startups who are working on something groundbreaking and cutting edge. And these 2 times I got accepted were for pretty intensive roles. I just sent the hiring manager a quick cover letter and a link to one of my personal projects. And they seemed to like it.

After saying all this, you might think it's probably something wrong with my resume. When I don't use a resume, my chances of being accepted feel like 30%. When I use a resume, it feels like 2%. I do have a very long employment gap, so it could be that.

So what I want to do is find an actual recruiter (who works in IT and knows programming) and send them a mock application. And I want to hear from them why exactly they would toss my application out. In a detailed way. What exactly I'm doing wrong, and what exactly is it that is scaring off recruiters. Is it something wrong with my code? Is it something wrong with my website? Is it because it is not mobile friendly? Is it the employment gap? Am I using the wrong syntax for documentating my code?

Where can I find something like this? Are there services which do this?

Also please don't tell me to post an anonymized resume for review. I posted an anonymized resume on the main CS Careers sub and they told me it was awful. Then I consulted one of my friends (who's a senior in IT) and we both worked up a professional resume for me. But even when I use that, I don't get callbacks. I actually have received more callbacks with my "" awful "" resume than with my polished professional resume. So I know no amount of resume polishing is going to help. It's definitely something else that I need to be focusing on.",2023-01-13 22:16:01

z94kaj,How to start IT in Canada ? FDM or keep sending CV or what ?,"Hi, guys!  
I read a lot of the same topic and I learned a lot from them. I came to Canada from Ukraine 3 month ago, in Ukraine I had half of year real work experience as Frontend Developer. I have good English, so I can speak almost freely.   
What is the point, I sent more than 200 applications for these 3 months, of which I received about 30-40 refusals, and only 1 positive one, others just ignored me. About this positive one, I am waiting for an answer about the next round. I thought I had a lousy resume, but I showed it to a lot of people from IT and they said it was good. I even got a volunteer experience as a developer for a Canadian company, but this also did not affect me in any way.

Most of the rejections that I received were due to the fact that I did not have any background and education in IT. I graduated from the university in Ukraine with a degree in economics. Now, I am very frustrated and tired of the lack of progress and understanding of what to do. Therefore, I look towards some courses that give guaranteed employment. I found FDM, Jarvis and Infosys. Jarvis has been heavily criticized in some threads, FDM is generally praised, than not praised, and there is simply little information for Infosys. But all these consulting companies offer general technical training in programming languages ​​like Java, Python, C++, C#.

My questions:

1. I'm trying to understand how it happens that you get a general education in some kind of technology and then the guys from the same stream are taken on as QA, developers and data analysts. Each specialty requires separate unique skills and not general knowledge of some programming language. What kind of nonsense is this, why does someone need a tester who just knows Java. Just by comparing this situation with mine, I’m not so bad in JavaScript, also I have React and Redux, Node.js, TypeScript knowledges, I have a portfolio and real projects, I have real experience and small but real understanding how to work as frontend developer. Compare to this people from courses that doesn't know anything, except java or other language. And they get a job and I have 0.    


2. Maybe there are some free courses, or like in FDM, where they even pay you for training, where can I go to study as a front end or full stack developer? I would rather go there to continue developing in the web field than to learn java or python from scratch. Please share your experience if anyone has gone through this.   
P.S. In FDM software developer stream is closed.

xi3xlq,Gap in Employment due to Quitting,"Hi, bit of a weird situation here.

I had a gap in employment due to mental health issues. Before then, all I did was volunteer as I finished the last few courses of my degree. That being said, I didn't make any strong connections with professors due to it being all online.

I landed my last job bc the person that oversaw my work at the volunteer program was willing to be a reference. That, and one of my past professors also went out on a limb to help me.

However, this time I quit from my job in just one month of starting. My employer was verbally abusing me, telling me to go back to therapy (as I volunteered in social work). He was also pushing me out of the job as he found a post-doc to work for pennies (I was coding in academia research).

I don't know how to frame this towards my references and to any future employer. Of course, I want to get out of academia. But my references know me better than that and are surely going to pry or see this as a red flag, as I wasn't very on top of my studies w my past prof due to mental health issues during that time. Again, he really went out on a limb to help me.

Is there a way to frame any of this diplomatically? To both my past prof and a future employer. (The social work reference is on my side and believes me, but I don't think anybody else will.)",2022-09-19 06:23:51

Basically, a 12 year+ MS SQL Server database admin, but doing other ""glue-like"" things such as working on powershell scripting to move data, etc.  Think of it as data engineering light.  I'm looking to move away from admin duties because, frankly, I do not like taking up on-call activities, which is wearing on me.

I'll be completely up front; I'm flexible in the direction I can go as I find many things interesting, but a higher salary is a big motivator.

My company in Canada is part of a larger N. American multi-national, having been bought in 2019, so there are opportunities to pivot into other roles.

DE is the most logical option, but salary then comes into play and as I'd be a starting DE (still working through Python for example), I would not command a higher salary.

uo4pd6,Question about program of study,"Hi,

After having completed one undergrad degree, a certificate, and getting a job in Finance, I decided I wanted to go back to school and do CS. I’ve been applying to different CS programs at universities in Ontario and I’m creating a contingency plan in case I don’t get accepted into any of them. This plan revolves around going into an unrelated program and transferring internally after first year, since I’d rather not wait a year to start undergrad again.

One of the schools I’ve applied to has an applied math program with a few CS courses that are required first year, but otherwise has restrictions on the type of CS courses you can take. Some of their other programs (like Psychology) have a “sciences” elective requirement which means there are no restrictions on the CS and math courses you can take. To me, it makes more sense to be admitted into their Psychology program, since I can essentially copy the CS program’s first year course sequence and then transfer after.

I most likely won’t have access to co-op first year, which I’m fine with since I feel more confident in my job searching/networking abilities now. I just wanted to ask this question so I’m not screwing myself out of future job opportunities: would studying under a “psychology” degree as opposed to a CS one hurt me in my first year job search? Do employers even confirm your program of study or is that something I can omit while being interviewed (while focusing on what I’m actually learning in school)? Obviously this won’t matter after I transfer, but if it harms my chance of getting a summer job, I might just go with the Math program, since I heard a lot of tech companies take Math majors as well.",2022-05-12 16:14:23
u4vytd,Should I finish my second degree in CS first? Or should I take the master of DS offer?," 

I originally have a bachelor's and master's degree in a non-STEM field. Last year I started to study an online bachelor of CS. I've already finished half of the courses and will graduate a year later. For those important courses for a CS student, like intro to programming, data structure, algorithm, os, computer organzation, and discrete math, I've all studied and excelled them.

Recently I received an offer of master of DS, so I don't know should I accept it or should I keep studying in my current program. What I am considering is I like DS so much and I do want to be a data scientist or data analyst. Also, the school of that master of DS is much reputative. But what I am concerning is that it is obviously harder to find a job related to DS/DA. What if I need to have a backup plan, let's say maybe I also need to apply for a SWE job, will I still get a SWE job using this profile?

I am also wondering if I really chose to take the offer, could I list out on my CV that I actually studied for a CS degree and have already grasp most of the basic concept of what a CS student should have?",2022-04-16 11:38:12
u1ie89,I think I got low balled. What should I do now?,"I graduated in 2019 with a Physics degree and no tech experience. I got a job through a consulting company where I worked for a big 5 bank in production support as a contractor for two years. 

In the contract my consulting company billed the bank $55/hr (107k/year). I got converted from contract to full time employee last summer. When they asked how much I wanted I said 82k. I was told that was a bit higher than what they could give and I got 79k instead. I figured 3k wasn’t that big a deal and signed my contract. I was also told the bank compares my salary with the firm average based on my experience. 

Last week I was talking to the coop students on my team and he is getting paid $35/hr. He is here as an international student who is doing a PG diploma and has 2 years of experience in China working in tech. He’s now getting converted to full time and is going to get 75k a year. 

So did I get low balled?
- Because I have significantly more knowledge and experience in the product. I have 2.5 years of experience with the product, coop students has 4 months of experience on the product. But he has two years of experience in China working in tech prior to his PG diploma (but not related to current job) 
- I have a physics undergrad degree, and he has a tech undergrad (from China) and PG diploma (from Canada)
- I do a lot more work, while the co op student doesn’t right now (not his fault it’s due to his access that my team allows as a coop)

So I honestly can’t tell if my salary is fair. I’m only getting $2 more than him and I feel really upset right now. I have recruiters that message me on LinkedIn asking if I’m interested in a job. They said it can go up to 120k as a contractor (not sure if they mean for my experience, or just in general). I have no idea what to do. I would like to stay in my current position but I’m confused. What do you all think? Am I low balled?",2022-04-11 21:39:13

zad3rg,Would a solutions architect internship at a major tech company be valuable for career progression beyond university?,"I currently have 4 full-stack SDE co-ops under my belt and I'm heading into my final year of university. I'm wondering if taking a cloud solutions architect offer as my final internship at a major cloud provider is a valuable addition to my hands-on coding experience? To be clear, the role involves assisting senior SA's in helping customers take advantage of cloud technologies available to them, so design docs, technical presentations, proof of concepts, and subsidized certifications if I choose to pursue them. I was also told by a team member that the role is flexible, and that it can be more dev focused and technically involved if that's what I show interest in.

I feel like my cloud experience (which I think is valuable in this space) is lacking, so being fully immersed in that area for 3 months is valuable. Also, having a big name on my resume, even in a different type of tech role, could also valuable. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I'm also afraid of it being a detour or maybe limiting my options too much? To be clear, I'm not hard stuck on wanting to code or do dev necessarily, I'm more worried about being efficient/smart with my career progression, as almost all my experience is in dev so far.

Sorry if any of that came off preachy or like a non-issue, I'm really just looking for some guidance. Should I reject the offer and keep looking or give it a shot? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",2022-12-02 05:48:48

# Common Resume Mistakes - READ FIRST AND FIX:

* Remove career objective paragraphs, goals and descriptions
* DO NOT put a  photo of yourself
* Experience less than 5 years, keep your experience to 1 page
* Read through [CTCI Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) to understand what makes the resume good, not necessarily the template
* Keep bullet point descriptions to around 3-5. 3 if you have a lot of things to list, 5 if you are a new grad or have very little relevant experience
* Make sure every point starts with an ACTION WORD (resource below) and pick STRONG action words. Do not pick weak ones - ones such as ""Worked"", ""Made"", ""Fixed"". These can all be said stronger, ""Designed"", ""Developed"", ""Implemented"", ""Integrated"", ""Improved""
* Ensure your tenses are correct. Current job - use present tense and past jobs use past tense
* Learn to separate what is a skill, and what is not. **Using an IDE is not a skill,** but knowing Java/C# is. Knowing how to use a framework like React is valuable, but knowing how to use npm is not. **VSCODE IS NOT A SKILL**. Neither are Jira and Confluence. If any non-CS person can open it up and use it, it's not a skill.
* Overloading skills - Listing every single skill, tool, IDE you've ever opened is not going to appeal to recruiters and will look like BS. Also remember that anything you list is **FAIR GAME TO TEST** and if you cannot answer that deeply about it, remove it.

Next, I'll be doing a CS degree from WGU. I'll be transferring in many certifications from Sophia and Study.com to ensure that I can finish the degree in a single term (to save time and money). I was the top of my class at bootcamp and have felt comfortable even with the certifications I will transfer to WGU.

But everyday, I still mentally struggle despite putting in work day after day. I think I have a heightened sense of fear about if/whenever this job market drought will end. I enjoy coding ALOT, but I still feel defeated with how long it has, and continues to take.

1aso98m,what should I focus on?,"i'm gonna be real, i've worked at my first place since graduating (major bank, joined for dev but its more like automated testing QA) for the past 5 years. i was going to leave 4 years ago but stopped because of covid making job uncertainty. i just sat at home and did my chill job (too chill) all this time, promoted to a ""tech lead"" making 100k but it is time i moved on to acquire experience for my resume because i feel like im rotting here. i also feel like my raises are happening too slowly at a bank. i did have a good GPA from UofT however that is pretty irrelevant now because ive forgotten so much so i need to learn things again. i have to think to even remember how a DFS compares to BFS, and the only thing i remember about djikstra's algorithm is its name lol.

if I try to learn everything again i'll be studying for years, so i'm wondering what my focus should be. i lack experience with modern full stack technologies, like React, but this would take months to learn and the importance of me knowing React might not be as valuable as leetcode and systems design? would looking at leetcode + systems design primer alone be sufficient? i'm going to be applying to big tech but i don't want to leave toronto and there are very little options for big tech (unless it's changed in the past 4 yrs), so incase i don't get through any of those interviews i will also be applying to other medium sized companies, just no startups.

1arxe3k,please help me... can't decide the best decision for my future...,"I'm in an interesting situation and need your help and advice as this is a huge life/career decision.  
  
I've recently been accepted into a Government of Canada IT apprenticeship program. The program would last for 2 years and pay me starting 65k then 70k the next and if they decide to keep me around \~100k . I would work 4 days of the week and have a day off on fridays to self-learn things I do on the job. I would be working in a ""Data Analyst / Developer"" position. At the end of the program, I would be encouraged to stay and be transitioned into a full-time role.  
  
I was also accepted into Software Engineering at a great Canadian University. I would be given 1200$/month in living expenses, all my tuition and books paid for along with a 5000$ scholarship to start. I would also receive 2500$ every semester from Quebec along with other scholarship opportunities.  
  
My main issue is I can't properly compare the Work Experience vs Education and how that would benefit my career in the long run. I have already completed an intensive 1 & 1/2 year intensive software development program where I was able to get a Software Dev. internship under my belt so I already have decent experience. My goal would be to work as a Software Developer and both these routes should get me there. I need to evaluate what would maximize my earning potential.  
  
I can defer my acceptance to the University and explore the apprenticeship program which I think is the best option.  
  
To add I’m currently 24 years old, the apprenticeship would take me 2 years and the Bachelor's degree would have me graduating at 29 which makes a huge difference considering I still have to find a job afterwards so will prob start working at 30 years old 😅",2024-02-16 02:21:32

It seems software/web devs have a much higher pay ceiling with similar experience? Maybe I’m thinking too much about it. Any advice or insight is appreciated.",2023-02-14 19:56:35
111udya,Will This Program Help Me Get A Job?,"I completed this program - The '  Computer Studies ' Diploma at Langara College.

It introduces you to OOP, full stack web development, Unix, Database Systems, DSA, Networking as well as some electives.

It was a pretty hard program to finish. It took me 7 continuous semesters of full time study to finish it (2.33 years) and it gives you a wide set of skills after completion.

But I feel like its a really pointless thing to put on a resume because of its mere TITLE. I'm not kidding. It's title is very ambigious. When people look at it, they don't know what it entails. Are you learning about the software side of things or about hardware? Or are you just learning the historical context of computers and is this more of a history program than an IT program? That title ' Computer Studies ' does not make it clear what you're studying. For all they know it might just be some vocational program for computer illiterate folks who don't know how to send emails or use a word processor.

I know even people with diplomas end up getting jobs but I think in those cases the diploma has a clear title like "" Full stack web development "" or "" Game programming "". So what I'm asking here is, how do I make it clear in my resume that I am trained in programming and have a good set of fundamentals?

I've been struggling to find a job with this resume. My application simply gets filtered out or rejected within 24 hours. I have a degree in another field and I get responses when I only put that in my resume but this........it doesn't get any interest.",2023-02-14 05:02:22

Google Form survey:  The survey is completely anonymous, no identifying data is given.

**If you have already submitted your salary in previous threads, your data was already input** so no need to submit it again.

Note that **there is now an option for remote US positions**. I have noticed there were positions placed under the location that are actually remote US. US positions pay more just due to our conversion rate alone, which skew location data.

111grlb,Is a Graduate Certificate (1 year program) worth it? Need advice...,"Hi, Thanks for reading..

I graduated with a college diploma in IT Networking years ago and since then I've worked in tech support and more recently as a software developer/web developer/frontend developer. I probably have around 3-4 years of experience working as a developer.
I was laid off from my last job and it's been a few years now since I've worked in tech. I've been applying like mad since 2019 with no luck. Looking at my jobs spreadsheet I've sent around 300-400 applications. This is a combination of applying online through job boards , cold messaging recruiters/technical managers on linkedin and attending tech networking events.
I've completed several rounds of interviews, take home assignments, technical tests but for whatever it never resulted in an offer.

I've revised my resume numerous times, I'm targeting lesser known companies, I'm applying for lower roles but still nothing to show for.

As a last resort, I'm planning on attending a [Cloud Architecture](https://www.senecacollege.ca/programs/fulltime/CAA.html) certificate program with hopes that this will help boost my resume. 

I'm only considering doing this because they offer coop which will at least help me get my foot back in the door. Even still, is this certificate even worth pursuing? Or should I attend a bootcamp, continue to self study or work on personal projects..

Also course tuition will be free of a charge so cost will not be an issue. I only have to consider time and energy..

Please advise,
Thanks",2023-02-13 18:52:52
111e4yn,Career Change (moving out of DS role),"Hi all,
I'm currently working as a Data Scientist with ~6 years of work experience- 2 of those as a DS, 4 as Data Analyst. My undergrad is in Stats (specialist) and CS (minor), have a MSc in Stats and Masters of Health Information. I'm unsure whether DS is what I want to keep doing going forward. 

I think I want to switch into an SWE role but I'm not sure how difficult that would be given that I have no SWE experience. I am trying to learn JS/Next Js/Typescript on my own right now. I'm not sure if that along with my experience/education would be enough to get a non-entry level SWE role. 

Sometimes I wonder about changing fields completely and moving out of CS/Data Analytics but I'm not sure what I would/could even do. I love programming so I'm not sure if it's burnout but I'm getting sick of writing the same SQL/Python scripts with some variation depending on the business case.

Just looking for some advice and would like to hear from people who moved from DS into SWE (or something else) or out of the field completely.

Thank you",2023-02-13 17:03:27
10zt7su,On call rotation positions,"I was wondering how common are on call positions and which devs teams are they common associated with (DevOps? Infrastructure?)

Personally work life balance hasn't been great the past 6 months and not working on call. But it made me realize that I don't like how much time I have to spend working (no overtime pay, and work 50-60 hour weeks) just to make sure we hit our targets.

Also what would be the salary minimum you guys would need to accept an offer with on call rotations?",2023-02-11 17:42:00
10zqfb0,How real is the application number in Linkedin for the junior post?,"The application number of junior web developer / software developer is just crazy. I've seen a post received 1xx application after a few hours of posting.

10wllex,Job Shadowing - Worth it?,"I'm currently an undergrad CS major without prior internship experience, and I've recently landed the opportunity to shadow a software developer at a tech company for a few hours.   


I want to make the most out of this opportunity and I'm curious if it's appropriate to leverage it as a networking chance for potential future internships?  


Additionally, I have a list of local companies that offer job shadowing but many of them are not related to the tech industry. Is it worth checking them out anyways as perhaps maybe they need software/tech people?

Can anyone offer advice or insight on how to maximize the benefits of job shadowing and determine if it's worth pursuing these other opportunities? I'm definitely going to ask a lot of questions and learn about professional experience, but I'm curious about the networking/internship side of things

10vriw7,Big telecom vs big bank,"I know a lot of replies will say both types of companies are mediocre for engineers, I want to know experiences of people who’ve worked at a big telecom vs big bank. 

I currently work at a big bank (TD), but saw a role at Bell that interests me. So far at TD, there have been many frustrating moments of bureaucracy holding me back, and a feeling that I’m too silo’d. 

Again, I’m under no illusions Bell might be like this as well, but would like to hear first hand accounts or if they’ve heard from friends, etc.

Also generally would telecom pay more than a bank for a similar role?",2023-02-07 03:41:33

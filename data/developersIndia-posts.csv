Just a few days ago, got an offer from a product based company for 6 LPA after 3 rounds of interview. 

Can't put my happiness into words. Just wanted to say, whoever is struggling out there, don't lose hope. Don't stop trying. Avoid comparing yourself to others. You're on your own journey and you will get there sometime or the other.

18pupze,Done with the rat race. Quit my job.,"Hey Devs! Here‚Äôs a brief story about me, I‚Äôm 23 M, worked my a** off after 12th cleared JEE Mains got into a GFTI. Placements were super bad. Had a sort of confidence that skill will take me to a better place. Worked hard, did everything I was told, did Leetcoding solved around 600 questions, contest rating with 1700+, did web development, MERN, SQL, Java, DevOps. Secured an internship off campus this Feb as an SDE Intern(onsite in BLR stipend of 25K), workplace was super sick numerous meetings, office politics, everyone was trying to save their ass and trying to throw others under the bus. I was one of initial developers , developed applications from scratch(MERN, TS, NEXTJs, Tailwind CSS) moved applications to microservices from monolithic. Asked my company to convert me FTE but they said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not in a good situation to convert you as a FTE as we‚Äôre not doing good business‚Äù hence I resigned. Applied to tons of jobs now. Tired of submitting assignments and ghosting. Parents are supportive so not much issue over there had a thought, i might be wrong because I haven‚Äôt worked with good organisations but during my job I realised I‚Äôm not meant for this. So here‚Äôs the final plan I‚Äôm going back to my hometown, will start my own business, I‚Äôll look for a remote job or freelanceing to get some funds for my business, I‚Äôve few ideas in my head will work on them.

190wn6c,Samsung India being racist,"I have worked as a Software Engineer at Samsung Noida for nearly 2 years (2019-21). What  I have experienced is that Korean employees are treated as masters and we as slaves. Indians have to go through scans, even their bags, while there is a different passage for Koreans with zero checking. Felt like a pain when I used to see this. There is a different food court set up, okay with this but seats are arranged separately from where we Indians sit. They see us as if we are minors. Even their car doors are opened by drivers.

All the key positions are held by Koreans. Even the Department head has no decision-making authorities

**I am well aware of how Indians are treated in South Korea. But In India, how can they treat us like this**

**Edit 0:** I see some comments where ppl telling Indians do the same with other Indians. Grow up, man. Every family has issues but won't ALLOW ANY OUTSIDERS TO INTERFERE OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY FAMILY

**Edit 1:** Forgot to mention the sir-madam culture there. Not sure who introduced this but we used to call seniors sir and madam

**Edit 2:** Not aware of this but someone said VIP toilets for Koreans. Highly likely to be true as I never saw any Korean in the washroom",2024-01-07 17:01:04
13sq6yf,What's wrong with indian working hours?,"For context, I'm from Europe, and currently working within a multicultural environment, where I have to work with highly skilled individuals, including Indian people. But the fact that they are always online (and actually partaking in meetings) for like 12hrs+ a day, and sometimes going online on weekends makes my head go insane.  


For example, the time difference is +2:30hrs (when here is 10AM, in india is 12:30 PM)  


If I log in at 7AM one day, the indian colleagues are online.  


If I log in at 12PM one day, and log off at 8PM, the indian colleagues are still online, perhaps in a conference.   


If I log in at 8AM on monday, I might see that some indian colleagues were online ""12 hours ago"". Like.. why?  


So what's the catch? Are 12 or even 16 work hours normal in india? Even if you would argue that ""indian market is way more competitive than everywhere else, and people have the culture of pushing working hours to prove themselves"" (Which I'm not sure if it's true or not, I made that up on the spot), that wouldn't really apply in this case because the people I'm talking about are Seniors, Architects and even Managers so its not like someone will steal their job.",2023-05-26 22:18:05

14pkcmu,Should I buy a laptop on loan?,"I am in my first year 1st year; 
My degree is online in Data science and applications,
Last year I purchased a second-hand laptop ten years old, 
Two months back, the display stopped working; repairing it was costlier, so I purchased a monitor, 

This was the worst decision I had taken, 
The rainy session is here, and my village has a huge electricity problem like it's not consistent, 

I am not able to follow a proper routine, 
I am procrastinating; I think I am just wasting time, 

So, my father wants to take a loan from the bank for a laptop. 

I am feeling no; I don't want to buy; we already have a huge loan! 

I am asking because, like, I took the worst decision that I one time used to think was very good. I purchased a monitor and saved some money, 

I, this time, don't want the same 


Want do you think I should buy? 
What can I do that I could also try to pay that money myself somehow? 



Tldr: 

I have a laptop with a screen that is damaged, so I purchased a monitor 

This was the worst decision since I am staying in the village and now in the rainy session, I am having so many electricity problems 

If I purchased a laptop, how can I pay for it myself?",2023-07-03 14:19:01
11wlrk4,Me who has no work experience because I am on bench for 1 years 6 months.,N/A,2023-03-20 15:27:23
19673wo,How I went from 3.5L to 28L in two years.,"This is not a post to brag. This is just to motivate young graduates or new engineers who feel stuck in WITCH company. 

You might not get salary that you expected from the day you graduate but the experience and learnings you gain will matter. 

So little background, come from lower middle class family, had education loan, didn't know coding till I graduated. 
Luckily somehow cleared one of the WITCH company and joined them. Learnt coding for 3 months in their internship(Asp.net MVC and Python) and after that was put in a project in Angular worked on it for 1 year and then was asked to switch to React + .Net core project(Never say no to change in technology in initial years)
In this two years my salary went to 3L to 3.5L. Tried to clear internal exam which would increase salary to 8L multiple times but no luck. Couldn't clear 1st round in first try and couldn't clear interview round in 2nd try. Till here life was not good. 

Then I started looking for a switch after giving interviews for 3 months finally got offer from Accenture where the HR who I had final discussion to get 8L CTC sent me an offer letter of 8+2L CTC. The role was in Angular. Started serving notice period didn't look for any other jobs(i know big mistake). 
In last week of notice period one of my friend referred me to a consultancy company who was looking for immediate joiner react developer. Gave interview and cleared both round and got offer of 13+1L. 

So directly went from. 3.5L to 14L CTC. This was around 2 years ago. 

After joining the new company worked very hard to improve on React(in WITCH company got the experience but didn't get the technical knowledge required to work in this company). In 6 months earned one spot award and in a year got reputation of React expert(don't know how I got this till date) and got a good hike to 16L CTC. 

In next 6 months clients changed my project 3 times. So started looking out again and got offer and current company decided to retain me at 22L and improved WLB.

After a 4 months the project got over and came to bench. At this point I had decided to change the company as current company was getting less and less project and news of layoffs was also around in my company. Although company had decided to let go off people based solely on their performance and I was relatively safe, I was very scared. 

After 2.5 months on a bench and 10s of round of interviews got offer from a product based startup for 26+2L.

Few learnings - 
1.Never say no to new tech stack in early years bcs you don't know which tech stack would be trending at the time of switch. And if you are a developer have working knowledge to clear interview of atleast 2FE and 2BE stacks.

2.Interviews and real time projects require different kind of knowledge, so try your luck at multiple roles and don't get scared woth JD. 

3. Dont reject offer for not getting higher increment, compare it with number of years it would take at your current company. 

4. Don't get disheartened with rejection for me 1st switch took 6 months of interviews then took break for 1 month and again started giving interviews then got offer after 2 months. 

5.Learn trending technologies to add to your CV. Don't switch main tech stack but learn something like Azure or AWS which will add value.

18gk54z,"Never fake your experience certificate. Never lie. If caught, your IT life is lost.","There are some grey consulting companies that gives fake experience letters for money. Go this way if and only if you're sure that you'll remain a mediocre till you last in this field.

My cousin of 10 YoE, joined a product company. They asked details of education right from 10th, their references and Experience letters of all previous employers and reference. He joined and started to work. The pre joining BGV was done before joining. Basic checks of EPFO, experience reference contacts were done. It seems like they'll do an extensive post joining BGV too. Almost all companies does itseems, I'm not sure on this.

The post joining BGV was done thrice (Three different organisations) for everyone. After 11 months of employment, he has got a mail that all of his BGV checks are done. 

Another guy joined with him at a similar position and pay after few months in his team and was doing good at what was expected out of him. But out of the blue, he was fired for lying on the years of experience he had played in his first organisation. Since both were working in same team, my cousin was surprised on this and asked what had actually happened.

He had 3 years of gap before joining an actual organisation for work. But he managed to get it as 3 years in the experience letter as a contractor for some (small non-existent namesake) company, so skipped the need to have any PF account for that period. He has somehow escaped in all other organisations BGV, but got caught in this. 

He was blacklisted by the company, and all the 3 BGV organisations. After this happened, he was unemployed for more than 6 months, as he was failing all the pre-joining BGV checks. He then joined and is working now for 3 months in a startup like local company for 5x lesser pay. 

Saw one post asking what's wrong in faking experience on this sub and other city sub, hence sharing one of the experiences I've heard. His life is in limbo now, he has two school going children too.

Imagine, he is not weak in his skills, and is actually good at what he does, but still his life has now turned upside down. He is planning to go abroad itseems.

14njqm9,Finally I got a JOB!!!!,"So from past 1 month I was looking for a job as a Java/Springboot developer. Gave few interviews in my home city Surat, Gujarat. They offered very low salary like 5-6k per month. Last week I went to give a interview and the interviewer asked me my salary expectation, so I was already depressed because not getting any job so I low balled my self very much and only asked for 15k per month. And then he said ""Do you think anyone will pay you this much. The maximum we can give you is 8k per month with 2 years bond and 3 month notice period"" and then he said at the end of 2 years if you performed well you will be earning 20-25k very easily. And I got even more depressed. 

But Yesterday I gave an interview and I because of past experience I undervalued myself and asked for 3 LPA. And they agreed. So yeah I finally got the job. I should have asked for more but something is better than nothing. So I am happy.

Now I feel like, I should call that fucker and show him my offer letter and tell him you said no one will pay me 15k per month, now look mf I got 25k per month that too in a company which is located just next to his company building.

My manager was bit surprised and asked me to complete in 3 days as others are also doing within those days. 

Later I asked on of my teammate to go shopping in evening and he denied saying he had task to complete. 
On further interrogation, I realised he works well through night most days to complete task within tight deadline. 

With this kind of behavior not only he doesn't have a social personal life, he is also putting pressure on others to work beyond office hours. And I know there are so many of them like this.

Minutes later I call her back and ask her to generate offer letter. She asks why? I said I want work life balance and there could be onsite opportunities and I want that. She buys it and generates offer letter after 2 weeks.

17znpla,Do not resign unless you have an offer from a stable startup/CHWTIYA/MANG.,"I was laid off approximately 7 months ago, took some time off, brushed up my skills, applied to over 100 companies in the month of November and got back from just 3 companies to send my resume and no communication further.

The funny thing is I had a lot more callbacks in 2022 than 2023 with lesser experience in ReactJS. Just wanted to warn people to NOT resign without a job offer in hand and that too from reputable companies whose stock price is going up/not tanking or they have at least seed c round or recent Seed b funding(for startups). Maybe the market is just correcting for all the over hiring during pandemic and loss of free VC money.

13z1nzi,WFO is becoming unsustainable in bangalore,"Working in bangalore is becoming difficult day by day. Increasing rent and rowdy landlords are one of the major problem. Bachelors still manage by sharing flat but for person with family it's not easy. 

Earning 1.5 lakh per month is not enough to make a good living in this city. 1/3 of the salary goes in to house rent. Then the prices autos and cabs. Food items which doesn't have an MRP are also not cheap.

Misbehaving locals. There is always a fear of these autowalas and cab drivers. They force people to pay for their mistakes and heavy prices for small distance. Personally I end up walking 1 km during afternoon sometimes because of the price.  

When I was in Noida 3 years ago. People used to speak bad about the city but that city is 1000 times better than bangalore.




Edit: My main motive behind this was to raise voice against the bad things happening in bangalore and to to promote WFH as well. 

Though I compared two cities which was needed because comparison is needed to work towards betterment.  Most people nowadays lead a life on the basis of comparison only.",2023-06-03 05:11:01

18lumt1,"Indian developers need to learn how to be good interviewers, my key takeaways!","I have been interviewing with a lot of orgs lately. I am looking architect profile.  I see a trend in the interviewers. Whenever there is 15+ years experienced guys doing the interview they make you comfortable and then they move forward. It feels like a discussion rather than a quiz show. The guys who take my interview from US or EU are amazing. They are respectful and you feel like, 'I could work with this guy'.

The folks, majority of the good orgs I have interviewed, they did the following 

1. Showed up on or before time.  
2. Switched on video.
3. Prepared themselves to take the interviews.  
4. Introduced themselves first. 
5. They wanted to have discussion on situational basis. They are ready to accept your POV. 
6. Tech questions were involved but to know do I understand or are bluffing them.
7. Covered the complete scenarios in 20 mins. 
8. You come out learning something new. 

The bad ones are here 

1. Showed up late, no explanation on why they are late : Looking at you EY, TCS and Accenture!
2. Never switched on video but asked me to be on video. (I do not mind to be the only one on video). 
3. Commented on my dressing ( wearing a polo shirt but was commented, on how I could have been in a Shirt) I am on video, taking call at 9pm on Friday! Looking at you HCL! 
4. Didn't care to introduce themselves . They asked the questions directly. As much as I love the no nonsense approach, a bit of humanity and humility is required  professional standards. 
5. Got too technical on a small code and didn't care to explore the broad knowledge space. ( Could and should have split the interview round into two-three layers) Looking at you EY, LTI! 
6. Doesn't understand the timing concerns. Scheduled for 30 mins, shows up 7 minutes late and drags for 50 mins. ( Hello Tiger analytics!!) 
7. Couldn't communicate in English and supercilious, patronizing!  ( Hello Tiger analytics!!) 
8. The person has never worked on small scale orgs or problems. Treats every org has INR 100 CR + budget for Tech. ( Simple solutions are not worthy. Everything needs to be enterprise scale, even if it is akin killing a mosquito with Brahmos!) 

&#x200B;

Overall, I do have 10 + years of experience. I take interviews for junior folks. Basic etiquettes should be followed. Every org should have a tool kit on how to take interviews. You need to have correct fit. They guy, who gets hired, would be working with the same folks who take the interview.

1alse54,Please stay away from this company,"I, along with 180 students got placed in this company(Opentext) for apprenticeship in march of 2023 through my on-campus placements. The hiring process was pretty easy, first they took online test and then straight to hr round. 
Now the problem was that they did not give any fixed date of joining. First they said it could be till october of that year. Now they started onboarding in november, in which only about 80 people went in.(they started by taking girls first) Now other half students along with me got frustrated as the onboarding was completely random and not based on any merits or anything. Now the company said rest students will be called till mid january of 2024. We got frustraded again as we were not allowed to sit in on other on-campus drives. So we waited till end of january. Now yesterday they said that students are not performing well in the company so rest of us have to go through another technical interview just to go into internship where they pay around 15k. This whole company seems fraud to me. And even after we clear this technical round its not sure when they will onboard us. And after that they will take 4-5 rounds of interview for the fulltime role. Now we 100 studnets are left with little to no options about our placements. So the least I can do is warn you about this company.

On my personal side, I have wasted about 6-7 months because of this company. I am trying to get back into the game but all my coding skills and dsa knowledge is gone. Entry level internship are quite hard to get in off campus.

16shx6b,"Cheated my way to a high paying Tech job, now confused","I come from a tier 1 college, and throughout my four years, I barely focused on my studies but still managed to maintain an 8.1 GPA. I cheated through the OTs and got shortlisted for most companies during campus placements. I was mostly cramming CS concepts before interviews as I didn't have a clue about how everything works. I would search Glassdoor and previously asked coding questions or concepts and learn the solution to those problems.

After 3 interviews, I got lucky and was selected for the SWE role. Now, the internship starts in January, and I have no working knowledge of anything ""tech"". I can't confidently say that I know a programming language fully. I have never worked in any other domain (app, web etc.).

Now, the question is: **What topics should I work on before my internship begins so that I don't find myself struggling?** I understand that I will be working on whatever team or project they assign to me, and the purpose of an internship is to learn. I just want to have enough knowledge to be able to comfortably switch from one stack to another. Should I just start DSA from scratch and do leetcode to build logic?

I have no working experience, and I have no idea how the corporate world works. All help is appreciated. Guide me in the right direction.

EDIT 1: I asked my senior who works at the same company (I wasn't completely honest about how I got the job), and he told me that everyone was assigned a different team, so he can't really advise me to work on something particular. He very nonchalantly asked me to just learn version control with git and enjoy my last semester of fun because I wouldn't get time once I started working.

EDIT 2: To the people asking me how I cleared the interviews, you must know how different the situation is for tier 1 students. I see people around me with no tech skills (including me) easily get a 10-15 LPA job just because of the IIT tag and because they maintained a high GPA. Recruiters ignore errors made in the most basic questions if you have a 9+ GPA (a guy couldn't tell the full form of TCP in Cisco interview). The only advise I can give is to have good communication skills (English proficiency).

**FINAL EDIT**: I did not expect the responses to be so wholesome and helpful. I genuinely appreciate each one of you who commented and added value with their experience. A lot of you pointed out that I might have Imposter syndrome which might be true but when you're surrounded by high achieving individuals, questioning your abilities is not surprising (at least that's how I justify this). Although I still feel there's a long way to go in terms of learning.

Many people negated the post because of the tier 1 tag, straight up accusing me of being incompetent and how I don't deserve the job which could definitely be true because I'd be pretty much jobless without my college. But that doesn't nullify the work I had put as a teen. I think I deserved having a little fun after sacrificing 3 years of my teen school life considering I didn't have quota.  

Alas many people thought I was a girl, no I'm not. And the CTC is 20+  which is ""high-paying"" in my opinion. Thanks to each one of you who helped me calm my nerves. ",2023-09-26 08:25:59

13g3ysi,Scaler academy honest review,"Here's my review:

1. Is the content worth it?

* The content is alright, but you can find similar information all over the internet. If you're willing to pay around 10k, you might find structured content elsewhere. There's no need to shell out a large amount like 2.5/3/4/4.5 lakhs just for the content. It's not particularly outstanding, and you also lose access to video recordings after the batch ends.

2. Do mentors really help?

* Mentors are meant to assist, but various factors come into play: a. They themselves work in product-based MNCs or startups, leaving them with limited time. b. They have numerous students to handle, and this can change over time. I didn't receive much help in this regard.

3. Classes schedule:

* The initial 2-3 months are satisfactory, but afterward, issues arise such as frequent class cancellations, rescheduling, and teachers taking leaves. I even noticed once that they canceled our class to conduct a free masterclass to attract more students, without considering the needs of the current batch.

4. Placements:

* This is the most crucial aspect. If you have experience, landing a job is relatively easy, with or without Scaler's assistance. However, if you're a fresher, you should try finding opportunities on your own, as they won't bring companies to you.

5. Management:

* The management is the worst. They don't respond promptly.

**Important**: When I posted a small review on LinkedIn, I received threats from individuals associated with the company. These individuals were already in the WhatsApp group they created. What's even more alarming is that one of the co-founders was present during these threats.

Due to all these reasons, I strongly discourage students from joining this company. We join to learn, not to face threats. Furthermore, paying a substantial amount is not a wise decision. Rest its upto you!",2023-05-13 01:55:43

I used to work as Mainframe Support engineer for a banking client. Lets just say I wasn't very happy with my work there (an entire different story) and resigned after working for a year in Oct 2019 WITHOUT any in hand offers. Nothing could have prepared me for what was in store for me in coming years.

&#x200B;

I don't want to be a cry baby and write up my experience but my family and I went through a lot of deaths and I almost lost both my parents. So I spiraled into depression (I think). But yea nothing justifies this long of a gap. I put the blame solely on myself, if I had not procrastinated so much I would not have been in such a position. I had months where I didn't learn anything. MONTHS ! I spent this time wasting my time on YouTube, gaming and Discord to escape my pathetic present. 

&#x200B;

Now after 3.5+ years, today I got a role of a Computer Vision engineer which I always wanted. And in this line of work I am making my own product for a startup and also working with state of the art Deep Learning models. I couldn't have asked for a better work honestly. However, my CTC is just 6 LPA....

&#x200B;

I am feeling very torn on this honestly. I at least have a job now which I am happy about. I have worked as an ""unpaid intern"" before to fill in my gaps so I guess that good. However, my friends are way ahead of me and I don't even feel bad anymore. I am fortunate to have very good friends. I have accepted that I have been left behind. I have also accepted that I probably won't date anyone anytime soon. Why would any girl even consider to be with a guy like me. Arranged marriage is not a route I want to take, no way. I fear that my little brother will be hesitant to marry before me. He has a gf. I hope I don't hold him back.

Surprisingly, today my company released new interview guidelines.
In none of the rounds the candidates would be asked conventional DSA/Algo puzzles.

We are told to ask real world problems. Get candidate to code. Get them to explain a code. Or anything similar. The guideline is to test the problem solving of a person in a real world setting.

195ukgm,PIP and malicious/false case by some senior leaders of Adobe India,"Hi all,

To cut a long story short, I was working in Adobe India some years back. I was the first person reporting to this newly minted people manager. My manager was abusive. There were several ways he used to threaten and harass me. Thinking he was a new manager/inexperienced, I put up with it for months on end. But after one rather egregious meeting, I finally raised my concerns with HR (who later claimed that some manager ""coaching"" was given).

However, since that discussion with HR, the harassment not only continued, but I was also regularly written up for ""poor performance"" by the manager (with the support of the skip level manager) and within a few months, they decided to put me in a PIP (with ERC/HR involvement and support). I chose not to serve any PIP, and I resigned as soon as I got to know of their decision (as I felt it was clearly a case of retaliation).

I might also add that I was in normal health prior to joining Adobe but after suffering for many months in this atmosphere, I developed health conditions like high Blood Pressure and a heart condition (which most likely developed due to constantly high BP).

I got another job and fast forward 2 years later, I was peacefully working in another company. My health was also holding up reasonably well. Suddenly, I get a purported legal notice on my email (let us say on date XYZ) from some ""lawyer"" who claimed to send this on behalf of this manager and Adobe Systems, falsely accusing me of making some threatening calls/sending threatening emails etc. In this purported ""legal notice"", I was severely threatened with civil damages/criminal legal action if I did not sent an acknowledgment email within 23 hours saying that such actions will not be repeated. I immediately responded saying that I had NOT done anything of this sort, and I have strong concerns against such false accusations.

Two weeks later, I get another email from this ""lawyer"" accusing me of more such acts and then saying that ""As you have shown no intent of backing down from the delinquent conduct"", hence, a case has been filed against me. Immediately I got in touch with an excellent lawyer in my town, and we sent them a reply to both the ex-manager and to Adobe Systems warning them of legal action in case of any malicious/false legal case. I then came to know that a malicious/false legal case was filed against me by this manager and his manager (basically, my previous manager and my previous skip manager). Though it took me over a year, I fought the case and defeated both of them (with the help of my excellent lawyer).

Now, the main thing is that this malicious/false legal case was actually filed a few hours BEFORE this purported legal notice on date XYZ was sent to me (and not 2 weeks after this purported notice as per their lawyer's email).

Their modus operandi was as follows. Firstly, they filed a malicious/false case that had no evidence whatsoever. Then, with the awareness that I will almost certainly have no knowledge that a case has just been filed, a purported legal notice was sent to fool me, and threaten/blackmail me (into making a false admission), which could then be further used as ""evidence"" in the case. This attempt to falsely frame me and destroy my life completely failed.

I might also add that they tried other dirty things like intimidating/threatening my lawyer.

I am appalled by the unethical, cruel, cunning and malicious conduct of these so-called ""leaders"" of this company. I am contemplating further legal action against these individuals.

Have others also suffered during their stints in this company? If yes, please feel free to connect.

P.S. I will give some specific information so that others don't get trapped.

17a6vm6,Got fired on WhatsApp after reaching home from company,"So, it's a startup. I'll just name it Frugal Innovations pvt ltd, it's a startup with no active products in market. My job role is a bit... Of a lot, we have a concept for a App, but no app. So I was responsible for overseeing the development of the app, making documentation for the development team, understanding business requirements and documenting how to make it functional and work with existing plans for the app, as well as making a proper flow of every functionality within the app (I chose  C4 diagrams and Figma for the Flow visualization).  And this job I took on myself without being told to do so.. because the director, my Boss, is not an IT or Software guy. He doesn't have any clue about how an app is made or how a code is written, or even how to make documentations for development or developers. There is no in house development team, he has hired a company for development.
I was planning to involved in the development by being at the developer company's location, once the development actually starts.
Well it was already ""almost done"" according to my boss. But it was beyond done, half the things it should have, didn't have it, and the way it was structured, adding any new things, absolutely would break all the code.

My story of how I lost my job:
So I've been working here for 4 months (almost)
And our office time ""ends"" at 5 pm, I said in quotes because it's not official timing, but it is when we all go home. Today was a meeting that I didn't get to know in advanced the timing being at 5 as well. Last time this happened I ended up reaching home at 11pm. So I immediately told ""can't we possibly shift the meeting time a bit early, since after 6, the public bus frequency changes to 45 mins - 75 mins. Boss said ""okay... But since today was meeting I expected you to stay until 8 pm"", I didn't say anything. Went along with my day. Redefined schemas, application flow etc.. meeting time, I got into meeting room. We discussed a few points. I bringed out a thing that we didn't consider that changes the whole db schema we had in mind. (Which I did discuss with my boss the day prior and mention ""we need to discuss it with others""). After 20-30 mins, the boss said ""hey you can go"". I was like, alright, cool..

Upon reaching home this is what I get (screenshot). I called him to clarify and was told the same thing. I'm not disappointed or sad. But my last company was also a bad experience, well a worse, because it was a scam company, no offer letters, no experience letter, no salary slip, no extra pay for over time (Infinite Orbit Research & Development)
And now this recent experience.. I'm not even sure why I got this treatment all of a sudden. He's out right denying to meet in person and discuss with me. Very unprofessional. 
I mean I could guess reasons, I am not approving of his every idea. Because he has batshit ideas, which always break whatever I had in my mind of how our product will function (pretty sure this is the reason behind the development up until now).
Also I arrive late at times, more so in this month, reasons: I cook my own food, clean house, clothes, not that I expected the boss  to understand.

My role was ""assistant project coordinator"" so I'm pretty sure I need to have a say in a project lol. But rarely if ever he listens to what anyone who has some experience in the field have to say.
I guess I'm sort of venting here. He did say he will pay me this month's salary in full, just hoping I don't get any remarks on my experience letter.
What breaks me is I was actually invested in this project and wanted it out in real world and actually function.

I'm pretty sure if he ends up seeing this he will put on hold my salary or my experience letter or write terrible remarks on my termination letter if that's what he choses to do. Anyways, I don't care since life has already made me go through enough hells as it is, what's a more.

Confused what should I do now, anyone refer me somewhere, I can have worked with js, reactjs, nodejs, Java, mongo, SQL.
Created documentation for application, created schema designs, Have almost  a year of experience with everything I mentioned above but no proof, I'm able to learn new things very fast though. I do have a certification of developing nodejs application on cloud though.

TLDR: old people who start a startup are shet (no offence for any good old guys startup bald people here in this community though).
Also don't work in a company that has a office in a effing shipping comtainer

137z4bp,Exit when you don‚Äôt feel valued.,"Basically a Rant.



I want to share my recent experience with developer community in India. 
I have a total of 4 years of experience and I was working with a Gurugram based company as Sr. DevOps Consultant at 11 LPA. After joining the Org I was told that I will be assigned to clients. I was key person in training of 5 devops engineers at the client and also SPOC for multiple project. My performance was so good that I got Star of the Month 7 time in my 16 months tenure at that client. My company which I was working for gets my performance report every week and it was never below 8/10. My org was very happy with my performance at the client. Not just that I was part of training program where I trained 5 students to become a devops engineer, contributed in internal projects, became interviewing panellist and gave more business to the org. 

When my time came for appraisal, with all the contributions I made I was expecting no less than 30%. However after 7 rounds of negotiation, and 1 month down the gutter they agreed to provide me with 15% appraisal and 25% with 1 year bond. Yet a family member of CTO got 120% hike and he was not even contributing to internal projects or anything apart from the client. 
This boiled my blood. I decided to switch, I applied to over 200 companies, appeared for interview for over 25 companies, kept track of each application and process of the application over excel sheet. Within 1 month I got a good offer of 18LPA and I resigned From the current company
During my 2 months of notice period I got offers from 4 more companies with offer of 22,28,30 and 33 LPA. 

I joined the company with 33LPA offer.

I didn‚Äôt leave the company because I was getting paid less, I left the organisation because the company was biased towards the people who they knew and promoted them irrespective of their performance, HRs won‚Äôt respond in time if you ask them for something , multiple red flags at management level, HR will try to trap you with words like retention bonus (bond in disguise) and get furious when you call ‚Äúretention bonus‚Äù with its real name, bond. 

To all the developers in India, know when you should leave your company.


For everyone asking how to get into devops or roadmap to learn anything in IT, I followed the roadmap shared on the website 
https://roadmap.sh
This helped me understand my very step that I need to take towards my goal.

My negotiations strategy was very specific to my case because of my background. However some people asked me for it.

1b6bo1f,"The company fired Indian developers and hired developers from Philippines, India is no more a cheap labour destination for companies.","I am working in a startup remotely, recently my company fired 5 Indian devs(1 tech lead) from my team, mostly at senior positions(5+ yoe) having higher packages.

3 developers from the Philippines joined my team around 2 months back. They are as good as any Indian developers from tier-1 companies/colleges with 1/3rd pay.  The cherry on the cake is they are ready to work in Indian timzone.

I think all the senior members in my team were having packages in range of 30-40 LPA. I didn't get fired b/c my package is 5 LPA(close to 2 YOE).  
What I hate in the IT industry is you can easily move jobs to cheaper countries without much hassel. It's almost impossible to move the manufacturing job this easily so careers in other sectors are mostly stable and long-term.

To be really honest I can see what's coming for Indian devs, most of our jobs are going to be moved to cheap locations like it's happening in the US.  
Every 2nd person in India is doing a 6 month MERN stack boot camp and asking for 1CR salary, which is unsustainable in the long run.

Sooner or later our situation is going to be same as US folks.",2024-03-04 14:04:33
143yucu,Legendary toxic companies,"All toxic companies that failed to meet the expectation of their employees/Interns(not in any specific order, just a list) :

1) Coding Ninjas: Locked their employees inside. Didn't allow them to leave. The security was told to lock the glass door and not allow anyone working in the office to leave when the shift was over(2023). 

2) HDFC Bank: Top executive at HDFC Bank, Pushpal Roy, is seen screaming and verbally abusing his employees/colleagues in an online meeting in Bengali. HDFC Bank, meanwhile, said that the concerned employee has been suspended and a detailed investigation has been initiated which will be undertaken as per Conduct guidelines of the Bank. (2023) 

3) BYJUS: We all know what it's about. Go figure, YouTube is your friend. Heavily toxic work culture

4) Cognizant: If you are a fresher out of college, and placed in Cognizant, then good luck. Chances are, they'll change the terms, don't pay any stipend, and make you suffer. They didn't pay their interns for 6 months (2023) 

5) Goldman: horribly long working hours, but depends on the team you are assigned to. Heavy pay disparities. International devs are valued more than Indian ones. 

6) Mu Sigma: Notorious for toxic management that overworks their staff. Not unheard of to work 70+ hours a week here. Mu Sigma is so infamous that there are two whole subreddits dedicated to it: /r/MuSigmaStories and /r/MuvsBusigma. To top it off they have the longest bond in the industry and routinely threaten legal action if you try to quit. Salaries are low too.

7) Capgemini: One of the worst of all the WITCH companies especially for entry-level devs. They're the only company I've heard of that sometimes asks for a notarized affidavit promising you won't quit the company for two years! Absolutely ridiculous. Not to mention their piss poor salaries.

8) Compassites Software Solutions, Bangalore: The former CEO/ Founder/ director owed crores to 350+ employees while he lived in a 7cr house quite near office.After a while, he used to ask his driver to get his bag to office and out by evening while he worked from home. Anyone bugging him a lot were called to a Starbucks in a mall opposite his apartment and he'll tell sad stories and give false hope that investment is coming. After 3 years many people quit because they took loans to tide themselves over and recovery agents were after them. A dozen employees are fighting a case for over a crore just among themselves. The founder stepped down and put another CEO and he's started one more company. He was also the 50%  partner in another namesake company in Europe where customers pay for the work done by the Indian company. So he and the guy in Europe take their money out of it. 

9) Instahyre: Instahyre CEO, calling out the name of an employee who accepted the offer and then reneged. Someone commented in that post saying, if you renege InstaHyre offer, you need to pay them one month salary(2023). 

10)Sprinklr: Pays a lot of money, but makes you work 12-14 hours a day including weekends. The engineering team is run by psychopath CTO and SVPs, and whetever they say is final and everyone just has to keep saying yes to them if they want to survive. Product release happens on saturdays + developers have to do on-call for 1 week every month, where you are expected to be available 24x7. 2 am calls are normal. The product is buggy so there are a ton of issues popping up every now and then.

11) Tech Mahindra: They have poor HR policies and management is inept and apathetic towards employees. They ask everyone to follow process using internal systems, but the internal HR tools are from pre 1990s. Management does not care about projects and employee health but only financial income from project. The company has deep seated issues and will do nothing to enquire individuals‚Äô mental health and guarantee a work life balance. The HR does not even care about responding to queries. The CEO is more worried about people‚Äôs attires to the office than he is about resolving deep rooted issues. 

12) Digital Aptech: didn't pay an employees tds certificates of previous fin. year.
Broke their own made, employee agreement and didn't pay them as written on the terms (2023). 

13) Reliance: Treat employees as slaves. Seniors shouting in the office and still getting best employee award every year. Also asks to work on the weekends with 300-400rs per day and can‚Äôt take leave on the weekend.

14) Goodera/Give/Give Grants Segment: Constant leg pulling of each other, instead of focusing on project completion. The teams constantly find reasons to blame other teams. No coordination whatsoever. 

15) Bajaj finance: Toxic work culture

16) SBI:  No proper HR policies, specifically relating to employee transfers. Management has zero respect for employees‚Äô personal lives. Middle aged uncles are being transferred to such far off locations in Himachal and Jammu. Work pressure is through the roof. Unethical work practices are being encouraged blatantly. There are cases when customers were forced to take life insurance policy (usually above 50k per year) if they wish to take car or housing loans(retail customers). At one of the meetings at RBO(regional office) they used to refer customers as BAKRA(goat). 

17) TCS: A Manager in the Kolkata location who used to abuse his subordinates with expletives like ""suorer baccha""( son of a pig, literally). HR knew it, nothing happened. That manager still continues. The company survives( and often thrives) due to the dedication of a few loyal employees, who work tirelessly day in and day out and compensating for most of the useless folks. Add to that severe pay disparity. Laterals joined the company with a double salary in the last 2 years, compared to the home grown players with similar experience and skill set.
 Managers(specially mid level ones) are good for nothing, can only read spreadsheets and set up meetings. Yet they are excellent at exploiting their subordinates. How much of a raise so called ""A"" banders got this year, it's a mere 6%. The last two years it was even worse.

18) Axis Bank: After new CEO‚Äôs takeover he brought in people from HDFC Life and HDFC Bank and strategically placing them as senior level executives. These Senior level executive brought in the cultural filth with them which was quite prevalent at their previous workplace, nepotism and inebriated egotistical display of power is rampant. They drove out the bankers which actually made what the bank is today, people who used to roll their sleeves and get the job done with their team. Now it mostly feels and looks like a project management company with multiple catchy projects going on with no concrete end results to it. Strategies are talked about in PPTs rather than on ground and the entire thinking is being outsourced to the mid and lower management level employees with executives just do a lip service. Ask these mofos about some topic related to banking, they will skid over it with their global gyaan.

19) Deloitte: Absurd on different level. First of first aboslutely ridiculous pay for both btech and BCA student. Worst thing they hire you, irrespective of your interest they place you in domain they like. ( Some who were great at coding went in testing and other domains, some who really hated coding and applied for other Domains were given technical roles.) Worst work timings, sometimes 9 to 3 am. They just take away your Saturdays by saying ""project demands"" that you can't even charge. Almost every Deloitte employee works till 9 to 10pm. They just capitalise on their Big4 badge. They literally charge 28lakhs to client for which they pay us 3 lakhs. Indian counterparts are treated like second class workforce. HR system is broken. HRs take 10 days to reply after calling and texting multiple times. They will switch your stream mid career if they need. Toxic team leads will put status call at morning so that you start very early and then you'll have client of onshore team calls at night. All over Deloitte good for uppers levels but not for a fresher.


20) Upstox: Terrible work environment. They'll drain you completely. 17-18 hours work day is considered extremely normal. Working all weekends is pretty common.  Management comes up with a new requirement driven by Marketing every day and wants it to be done by EOD. If you raise some reasonable concerns about how this change could break things in other places, management thinks you are just making up some excuse because you do not want to work

21) Kellton: Company isn't getting enough projects, so they're cutting costs by firing employees right left. Bond of 1L was taken from all freshers, which isn't being returned in 90% of cases upon termination. Freshers are being hired so the company can get the work done in less capital. Experienced people are fired without proper reason, in unethical ways.
Mods please approve, and pin if possible. And friends, please dm/comment such incidents. I'm tired of such posts. I'll add all such companies here. Long bond duration for freshers. Inconsistent freshers training. 

22) Virtusa: poor salary for freshers, and bonds to fool them and misuse them to overwork them. More like a Capgemini 2.0

14gpws7,Depressed and disappointed with technical interviews in India,"I worked in The US for 3 years as a Data Scientist and worked on many difficult and amazing projects. I learned many technical skills all the way from Frontend, DevOps and Haskell backend (apart from my Data Science role). I came back to India to pursue other entrepreneurial ventures in tech. Built lots of cool stuff but could not get traction. But that's fine.

Now that I am looking for jobs in India (I just applied without thinking much since I was quite confident with my skills), I find the technical interview landscape here very challenging and difficult. And quite frankly unnecessary and irrelevant to the position. I applied for Full-stack/Python and ML positions. They generally ask DSA questions, which I have never practiced (because I didn't have to before). In US, tech interviews are mostly situational based which I was easily able to answer. But here it feels like my talent and skills are going unrecognized because I am not able to get through the first filter.

Some of these DSA questions are quite easy but since I don't remember certain commands, I just get stuck. Like for example, I didn't know if it was \`defaultdict\` or \`Defaultdict\` or \`defaultDict\`. Just silly things that are easy to figure out by a simple Google search. Which they don't allow.

And in this one interview, I had a live coding exercise and the funny thing is I could execute the code block ONLY TWICE!! Something so irrelevant and stupid. And the even funnier thing is I wasted those two tries getting indentation whitespace errors in Python because the code editor wasn't configured properly. And that interviewer didn't even know how to say Kubernetes correctly.

Just when I thought it can't get any worse, In the other ML interview, the interviewer asked me to solve problems using numpy and pandas! without looking up hundreds of commands these libraries have!

198z1wx,The end of brain drain?,"I have lived and worked in both the US and in Europe for almost 9 years. In that time, I have met many Indians, whose main motivation to move to the West is to earn money in USD or Euros, and take advantage of the steep USD-to-INR rate, save up as much as they can, and return to India in the future (maybe after working 5-7 years, or when kids are of school-going age). 

However, I am seeing that this pattern is coming to an end. CoL has risen sharply in the last 3 years. Inflation is out of control. Supporting a household of 2-3 on a single salary is difficult, especially if you are not in tech or if you live in an HCoL area like California, Paris, or Amsterdam. Things that were considered basic necessities, like owning a car, are luxuries for many. 

Spending 50 lakh on a Masters degree, only to find that you have just 3 attempts to get an H1B, else you have to save up enough money to recoup costs of Masters, plus all the lost income that you would have had, if you had never left your job in India - all this is not worth it if your prospects in India are decent. Moreover, Masters in Europe is cheaper, but the net salaries are lower as well. Europe is not exactly for those who want to save money and return to India. 

I think brain drain from India, at least in tech, is coming to an end. Maybe professions where there is a huge differential in wages (India vs. West), such as mechanical/ civil / chemical engineers, will continue to move out (hard to see a Mech Eng graduate making 20-25 Lpa out of college). But in tech/IT, there are so many opportunities, at a lower cost of living, that people will choose to stay behind. I guess India is the big winner from the West's Cost of Living crisis.

18rul1f,Worst interview experience with Primera tech,"context: I am 7 YOE, NLP Lead and recruiter/HR contacted me from Primera tech for a lead level NLP role and an interview was setup

This is how the interview went:

interviewer didn't have camera on, asked me to turn mine on which I obliged with. He was in traffic I guess, lot of noise etc.

His tone was very bored/ uninterested from the beginning.

Him: how much experience you have?
Me: 7 years

Him: Which projects you worked on?
Me: I have been working on NLP and DL related things for the last 7 years on multiple projects. Now, I am NLP Lead at XX and our main product is Post meeting analytics, where we generate summary and other NLP insights from meeting recordings.

Him: What are the use cases you worked on?
Me: Didn't get you clearly, and repeated the summary thing in short

Him: Arey what are the use cases man?
Me: The use case is post meeting analytics

Him: Arey, you tell tts or recording analysis liek that man. Can't you even tell use case

Me: chuckled and, Is that how you talk to to people. I am not some intern for you to be saying arey, man etc .....

Him: You cant even explain your experience ...
Me: then fucking tell me I am rejected and close the interview, why are you wasting my time etc...

Him: get out of the call
Me: left the call

Later the HR who setup the interview called and told me that he is the ""coolest panel in the company"" and that I can't even explain my 7 years of experience correctly. I said if this is how coolest people in your company talk then better find a new job to her and cut the call.

Btw, the expected CTC for this position I told them was 90L, which they agreed to and this ""coolest"" panel didnt even read my resume before hand. Is that how any professional people interview for positions like this?

Even when I am interviewing for 2-3 year exp roles, I read the resume, ask specific questions etc and also show some fucking interest.

During this class I meet with my friend and i mention him that I am doing this class he immediately warned me that this is not right way as you might be in trouble if you got found them....

I took this advice seriously As during my college days I saw lot of failures in academics even I had academics gap... I thought that I already faced lot of issues in my life so I don't want problems in future...
I left that coaching class even I had paid full fees...

Now I joined another coaching class in pune here I was got selected in Mumbai based company but next  day they told me that because I had low % in academics they rejected me due to that... I was frustrated 2020 gone 2021 was about to end... I sated preparing for CDAC exam as they had good placement records...

I cleared cdac exam with good % and I got top college for CDAC from here I got 7.5 LPA package in 2022  unfortunately in that organisation they didn't had any Development projects...

 I am good at coding and active on LeetCode too... So I was not feeling great here... Mental Harshment was everyday story... Verbal abuse snatching laptop from hand due to frustration was normal here.... thankfully they didn't harm me physically...

I left that organisation and I am jobless since past 7 months... Now I am looking at those people who took fake experience at that time. Most of  Them have 15+ LPA package some ot them even 22+ LPA They bought there house some of them had foreign tour as well some of them are preparing for marriage Overall they have good life.

As I am turning 30 my family are looking for girls now but yesterday my father told me ""as you are jobless what should I tell them?"" 

This was so heartbreaking to me. As I am passionate towards IT I have some websites I do freelancing too and this is how I am doing in IT üôÉ and those who are in IT just because of Money are doing great compared to me.....

After training, we were told to wait for projects because there was no requirement at the time. We were on the bench for months. We still showed up to the office on a regular basis, interacted with seniors and our manager, and inquired about projects. 

Eventually, I received the dreaded layoff call from HR in June 2023. They made me resign and look for new opportunities.

* Come back from gym at around 8:15 AM.
* Eat and get ready for office by 9 AM.
* Reach office by 10 AM.
* Office offifce office till 6-6:30 PM.
* Come back home by 7:30 PM.
* Leetcode till 8 PM (studied around 400+ problems in 2-3 years, currently in revision phase)
* Dinner till 8:30 PM.
* Study system design/object oriented design till 9 PM.
* Practical upskilling till 9:30 PM (currently working on The Odin Project. Have completed the Foundations course in 5 months).
* Work on side hustle/startup(pre revenue) till 10 PM. You can't rely on job due to AI and layoffs. Can't outsource this as the asking rate is INR 10-15 lakhs for a basic MVP, which is more than what I save in index funds in a year. Also, I have heard that one can only raise funds for a startup when you have an MVP with revenue.
* Read books on entrepeneurship/productivity/economics/personal finance/investing etc. till 10:30 PM.
* Listen to soothing audiobooks and try to fall asleep by 11 PM.

Nowadays, I don't have any motivation to work on my side hustle as I am too tired by 9:30 PM. My head feels heavy and eyes start burning.

On weekends, I don't have any motivation to do anything. Due to this, some of my personal work like meeting with a lawyer/full body health checkup for family etc. has been lagging behind since months.

My family forces me to take them to McD, KFC, some function etc on Sundays sometimes. I am unmarried in late 20s. No GF till now.

1. No good projects / work. The core work is done in MTV & india teams are just building on top of it. Waste of talent.
2. Poor culture. No one wants to build awesome product, just want to get the job done.
3. Office politics. A lot of office politics & favouritism can be seen. Not sure if this is the case with foreign offices as well.

For some reason, everyone is happy with this. As the salaries have improved in India, no one cares about the poor quality of work & projects. Just come in, stall, get the job done somehow and get your salary.

Sorry for the harsh words but this is the case with reddit as well, I want to move to US to move away from these issues. But all the reddit posts comparing India & US only talk about social life, salaries, cost-of-living, bla-bla. No one is really concerned with becoming a ""better engineer"", creating awesome stuff.

16gmr4x,Take your college more seriously kids,"I wrote this in a comment but I feel like more college students should be reading this and some professionals as well.

It's common knowledge that college courses don't teach you anything. I think that that notion is harming people more than helping them.

College courses teach you fundamentals of computer science that ultimately make you a good engineer. What they don't do is teach you practical things. So in an ideal world you need to take your courses seriously and continue building skills outside. 

Learning web frameworks, grinding leetcode, collecting certifications like you're Thanos collecting infinity stones feels good but doesn't do much to teach you the fundamentals that are essential to be a good engineer.

My two cents would be to use your college curriculum as an index for things that you need to study and then study them through equivalent college courses that are available freely from university like cmu, harvard, mit, Stanford and such. The quality of teaching is far better than what most Indian colleges teach. 

As a fresher,, start with CS50 which is from Harvard. That course helped me a lot when I started college and right now it has multiple tracks. I'd recommend trying out all the tracks to get a vast breadth of knowledge and then you can dig deeper into what you like.

And if you are a professional struggling to grow your CTC then stop running behind the cool latest stack and go back to basics. 

I never enjoyed grinding leetcode or cp because it didn't feel productive to me. Yes I struggled during placements because of it. I struggled to write code in the set time limit not with coming up with the solution but all it took was a couple of companies and a week of looking into the tricks people use to write smaller code and I was able to clear the OA. Interviews with good companies was not an issue because interviews are more like conversations where you get to show off your knowledge (remember knowledge comes from studying and not grinding).

MIT OCW has awesome courses that teach you basic and advanced DSA. I highly recommend that and also this website to brush up on your competitive programming  https://algo.is/ 

PS. If you disagree then more power to you. I will not be engaging in arguments in comments.

Edit. I didn't expect this to blow up. Something that I feel I should mention is that you should never take any advice on the internet as a Bible (including this one). Everyone has different struggles and different situations. So understand the context and apply what makes sense to you. There isn't one guaranteed path to success. There are many and you have to find yours.",2023-09-12 09:32:09

X has been given specific tasks to do but X is very dumb and has difficulty understanding the most basic of things and what‚Äôs happening in the codebase.

The problem:
X randomly calls me whenever they feel like without even checking first if I‚Äôm available or free to talk and starts asking me questions on how to do their tasks. The questions are not even conceptual but almost like asking me to do their work for them. The calls aren‚Äôt even short ones. They end up over 2 hours long because I have to walk them through every aspect of the code 3-4 times to make them understand. Then they make the change while sharing their screen and run the code while expecting me to be there and solve any errors that come up. 

I‚Äôm all for helping people but I cannot handle doing my work as well as their work. How do I approach this situation? I don‚Äôt want to sound rude or unprofessional. This is taking up a huge chunk of my time as I already have a lot of other meetings throughout the day. 

The person X in question has over 25+ YOE in the industry.

EDIT:
After reading through all comments, I want to say that I‚Äôve tried avoiding this person‚Äôs calls but they keep calling till I pick up. I‚Äôve mentioned this to my manager in a very professional and subtle way that our work is getting duplicated and we‚Äôre wasting a lot of time.

As title says today is best day in my file. Today, i was feeling like most fortunate and most unfortunate person at the same time. Unfortunate because 3 year before i lost my father due to corona virus and i was missing him most. My father wasn't educated too much so he educated me and my brother through his life and 
he wasn't alive to see this day that's why i was feeling unfortunate and depressed.

So, if we talk about internship than Just 1.5 month before on 1st February 2024 i join an start up as Frontend developer intern. Even though my role is Frontend developer i am getting some task on backend as well. Frontend is in react.js and backend is in go lang. I am happy for the task and assignment they have given to me. company CEO is one of the best person I have ever meet. As company is European start up and it is in his early age of 17 to 20 people in team around the world's. All of them are working remotely. My first internship stipend is Rs 39xxx around $500. Company can offer the full time role as well base on performance and company's requirements after 6 month it will be decided.l

Many of the experience and new grads are struggling during this recession and I feel my self as fortunate that i have got this at such initial stage of career. I am really happy for that and will be alway fortunate to the god. 

On last note, If you are experienced folk in industry than i will be really happy if you could give me some suggestion or advive than i will be really happy.

Thank you.

Edit: 

Many people are asking how i got this offer than here is  answer.

Dont know how but they had my entire resume (maybe LinkedIn). He started by asking questions about my career plan. Frankly speaking I am in the industry for 3 years and I don't have any particular career plan yet. He wanted me to feel guilty as to why I moved from a product based to one of the Big 4s and that my career goals are lacking. Dude I just want to earn money, what else could be a career goal. I learn what I need to work and get paid. 

He was coaxing me into entering data, but I constantly kept repeating I don't want to learn data, even though I checked out their React and High-level design webinars. He ultimately gave up saying, ""you can't be helped"" and cut the call.",2024-02-01 14:43:36

1bjb1vt,Laid Off and Feeling Lost in Bangalore can't even tell my parents about this," I hope everyone's doing okay out there. Wanted to reach out because life threw me a curveball recently. Just yesterday, I was feeling accomplished after wrapping up my tasks in the last sprint.

But then, out of nowhere, the company dropped a bombshell. Me and 30 others were asked to resign due to cost constraints. It hit me hard.

Now, here I am in Bangalore, trying to figure things out. It's tough, you know? Can't even bring myself to tell my parents yet.

So, if anyone knows of job opportunities or could offer referrals i would really appreciate it, i'm a 2023 grad with over a year experience in nextjs/reactjs and java and have good knowledge of c++, and cs core .

18adc8e,It was my birthday yesterday and I officially resigned from work.,"Yesterday, I turned 26. I had a great time with friends during the day and spent the evening with my family. However, after all the joy, the night made me realize it was time for a change. Around 3:30 am, I sent an email to my manager at Accenture, copying HR, and officially resigned. The toxic work culture in my current project, juggling two projects, unpredictable shift timings, and lack of motivation and guidance from my lead pushed me to make this decision. Considering I didn't receive a raise or bonus this year while my manager drives a Jeep Compass, I felt it was the right move. I don't have any job offers lined up, but prioritizing my mental health feels like the right decision.

EDIT: I can't believe the support and the encouragement I‚Äôm getting after reading all of the comments here. At first, I was a little worried and confused, but deep down, I knew I did the right thing. I have always prioritised my mental health, and you guys get it. Big thanks to all of you‚Äîmore power to this awesome community! üí™

1425efr,"Devs of India, what's the biggest corporate jugaad you've pulled of?","Pulled one off yesterday, thought I should share here. Was given a 5 story pointer to work on this week. The task involved the setup of a global state manager for our ui that would work with minimum coupling and would be as independent as possible. Essentially, UI should interact with it similar to the useState hook in react. 
  
  
One of my buddies worked on a similar thing last year as a hobby project. I shamelessly asked him if I could copy it, he's a chill guy so he didn't mind, I copy-pasta-ed the code into my project, and since the global state module was supposed to be as independent as possible, this meant more new files and less edits on existing code. Long story short, I was done with the entire thing by EOD and now I'm thinking to put my feet up for the rest of the week.  Just need to come up with some believable impediments and statuses for the standups :D
  
  
Any such jugaads you guys have pulled off?",2023-06-06 05:48:52

1b8moof,I am tired of the overworking collegue in my team.,"tldr: my colleague is overworker who keeps doing other teammates tasks, works overtime while nobody asks him to do it. Now the company thinks this should be the norm and he is consider as the best talent while we are considered as underperformers.


So I have been working in a company for little more than a year. Everything is perfect apart from the fact that I have an overworker in my team. 


He always does extra. And it's not just about his tasks. He will interfere in others' tasks as well. For example, one time a teammate of mine was working on a task which had a few boring steps. This guy without telling anyone worked on the weekend and created a script to automate some tasks. Next day sends in the group ""hey I have created some scripts over the weekend to help you"". Other time I was working on something where I needed to use a library I was not familiar with, so I was doing some research. This guy just sends in the group an entire document he prepared about which library to use which not to. No body asked him, it was my task which I was already doing. He has created several rules, checklists etc. without asking anyone and keeps suggesting everyone to follow. Not only that, we have a company wide group for bugs which get reported. He just randomly debugs bugs and sends his analysis for bugs which were not even related to his code. Now, the other teams love it as their work decreases.


But for us, he becomes the benchmark and management wants us to be like him. Recently I had my increment and I wasn't satisfied with the increment I got. I raised this issue with the HR. And I was told ""I do bare minimum"" and ""doing just the tasks assigned to me aren't enough for my increment, for that I already have my salary"". They have told me to be like him several times. He has become the ""jewel"" in the team. Now everyone is expected to be like him or else we  are underperformers. We have been told several times that we can't be like him but atleast we should try. Not just by HR, but by manager, seniors etc.


As a person he's great, will help me even if I call him at 11 pm in the night. Has taught me a lot of things. He deserves all the raise and promotions he gets. But I don't think our raises or promotions should be stopped because of him. I don't want to be like him. I don't think anyone should be like him. 


What do I do? I'm really tired of it. I can't even tell him anything because at this point it's too late and everybody expects us to be like him.",2024-03-07 05:36:16

1bseq2k,Being Unemployed for over a year is really painful.,"Hello there, I'm a 2023 CS grad. I've been looking jobs ever since I graduated in last July. I didn't sit for placements at college as I thought of preparing for civil services. I realised it very late that, due to financial constraints, I cannot afford more time and should settle early. 

I then started grinding leetcode and did some projects on MERN Stack. 
I applied to many companies, I only got regret mails or the companies ghosted me. 
I also had made my resume ATS friendly, I still couldn't get replies from companies. 

It feels very depressing to just wake up and apply to several companies and expect no replies. 
I've even contacted multiple people on LinkedIn, all I got to hear from them was that the market was bad and they were only looking for experienced candidates. 
Even after all this, I get to hear people say that MERN is saturated. Doing DSA has no use. 
I'm totally confused and depressed at the same time such that I've stopped upskilling myself at some point. I'm reaching a gap year after my grad in few months. 

Having 90+ scores in my 10th, 12th and good scores in engineering, sometimes I feel that I failed in life. 

I still somewhere feel that there are better days ahead. However, being hopeful itself is becoming difficult as of now.

I do not know who you'll are. Would you all still please be kind enough to pour any kind of guidance or let me know what else could be done in this situation. 

It would be extremely helpful if there are any opportunities that you could offer for a fresher as well.

155b7hl,Comprehensive list of good companies for SDE 1 and SDE 2.,"Hi everyone, below is a list of companies which I have gathered from various sources like leetcode posts, reddit posts, glassdoor, twitter, LinkedIn posts etc.

These companies pay **12L+ base to SDE 1**s and most of them pay **23L+ base to SDE 2**s.

Also, **'good' in the title actually means good paying only**. I wanted 'good' to be more comprehensive and include other factors like work-life balance, culture etc. but the comments indicated that even within same organisation, it differs widely between departments and ongoing projects and can't be generalised.

If you work in any of these and find any discrepancy, please let me know, I will correct it. My wish is that this should be the go-to reddit post for everyone looking for good paying company for job change.

He had been working from home since he joined. Last week, in one of our calls we got suspicious of his work, as he was not able to do a simple review. We called him to office and while we were understanding his skillsets, he was not able to answer a basic question. Whereas at the time of interview he had answered all the questions and had good communication skills. Turns out he might have used a proxy for clearing the interview. And all these days, someone else was doing his job. How the fuck do they even proxy a video call interview. He had stolen another deserved candidate's opportunity.

Edit: He got fired.",2023-10-12 04:58:25
18tjw2y,These IIT KGP alums are scamming people by selling shady AI courses & misleading info,"Be10x - an ""ed-tech"" company run by two alums of IIT Kharagpur. They have spammed TrustPilot (a review platform) with fake reviews, got fake reviews on YT as well. They're running a big scam - retargeted ads filled with misleading info, affiliate program (90% commission!!! because their course isn't worth a penny). I don't know why IIT KGP administration is doing nothing about this.

Misusing the ""IIT"" tag and scamming people brings bad name to IITs all over India. 

Is there nothing that can be done??

1akujlr,YouTube is now blocking Ad Blockers so I made this Chrome extension (Ad Speedup) that just makes ads run 16x faster 3months back and it now has 300k+ users :) Also has a free way to summarize YT videos (if you want). [Code Attached],"I used uBlock Origin and it worked for me until I got slapped with this popup- [https://imgur.com/AfqSuhk](https://imgur.com/AfqSuhk) from YouTube saying disable the ad blocker or YouTube will stop playing videos altogether. It led me to think about how to address the problem with my existing skills.

I first ran it as a bookmarklet (which was fun to make [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet)) but turned it into an extension soon after knowing a lot of people wanted it.

Ad Speedup ([https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ad-speedup-skip-video-ads/pcjlckhhhmlefmobnnoolakplfppdchi?hl=en](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ad-speedup-skip-video-ads/pcjlckhhhmlefmobnnoolakplfppdchi?hl=en)) mutes the ads and auto-plays the ads 16X, so virtually skips all ads without you noticing them - lightning fast. I also added a free way to summarize long YouTube videos right in the sidebar for people who want it, tho I am not a big fan- it can be turned off and comes in handy sometimes.

Idk but am I right in thinking this also means that content creators still get revenue from videos? This is an even better solution than ad blockers if that's the case, what do you think?

Here is the actual extension code I wrote, you can copy it and use it however you please personally. If you want to distribute it, I request you to use my extension here- [AdSpeedup.com](https://AdSpeedup.com)

My team lead has said I am pretty good and I pick stuff up quite fast, and I put in a lot of overtime, definitely more than others who were hired alongside me. Then it was announced that there will be no hikes for junior devs this year, so I reached out to the department boss and tried to explain my contribution and asked for a nominal 3% hike but I was turned down and was told "" Recession ka mahaul hain, left right sabka firing ho Raha hai, you should be thanking me I'm still letting you walk away with 25k in hand every month to just show up""

14suq08,Wish me luck Indian devs! :'),"Leaving for USA in September for studying further. I would like to share my career experience - both in regards with compensation and responsibilities.

Started at 8lpa from a startup about 3 years ago, work was APIs mangement and development. The following year, got to 12lpa, same work and org but with couple juniors this time, so more delegation and KT. Reached 19lpa last year - LLD work, architecture design work, more juniors, more mangement and delegation. Finally switched to 25lpa, different org but still a startup couple of months back. Full stack work just joined recently. Unfortunately, saying goodbye to them at an early stage, as I've saved some money to at least pay for half of my tuition fees. 

Reason why I did this:

Got bored working in India - same culture everywhere (for those who might question how do I know ""everywhere"", I have many friends who work in IT and they share their corpo stories). Craving for new experience. This 25lpa job or better can wait in India but the young age is going away. The time is slipping.. That's why I'm taking the leap!

I'm 22M, single, without a stable job
I dropped out of college in 2021 while I was in 3rd year. At that time, it looked like a good decision.
I used to see my friends, without any skills, going to college everyday and preparing for exams that are unnecessary. I used to sit quietly and pat myself thinking that I'm the only sensible person to take the right decision. Not gonna lie, dropping out did help me improve my professional skills faster and much better than my peers.. but that doesn't mean, I get to monetize them.

I fell for the trap set out by these fake self help gurus, who disregard college education and show traditional education system in such a bad light that, people will convince themselves that they are in a shithole if they goto college.

I used to fancy myself like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. I used to tell myself that, even they didn't attend colleges, but ended up becoming billionaires..
Now, I realise that a college degree would have been much more helpful to further my career.

There were places where we had loop through huge json objects to the order O(n‚Å¥) and in the inner most loop length of an array was evaluated multiple times instead of storing the value in a variable. Changing this alone brought down response time from 3s to 2s sec as the number of documents and the size of documents processed is huge.

Other optimization was using guard clauses i.e., condition checks that would result in returning empty values to happen at the top of function",2023-07-25 16:44:59

I belong to a middle-class family but my parents have refused to take a student loan because of interest rates and told me that they will be able to manage these 4yrs. I have, however, seen them worry about being able to make payments and deciding whether they'll have to break their FDs and other lifetime savings, or borrowing money from close relatives for a short time.

Ever since the start of my BTech degree, (October 22) I have been trying to manage my own expenses by Freelancing. I ended up accumulating a good chunk of money till now as I'm mostly paid in USD.

My University released the invoices and today I sent my Dad ‚Çπ80k to help him pay my fees. I initially told him that I'll send ‚Çπ1L and a little more, but I only have UPI, so I decided to send money over a period of two days. He's now saying that I should keep the rest of it with myself and use it to buy certification exams (something I told them I'd do soon).

Overall, I'm really happy to have helped my family. It felt like I was finally able to do something useful with my earnings. Affectionate phrases like ""I'm proud of you,"" or ""I love you"" don't really run in my family, but the way my Dad patted my back and smiled felt like one of the best things ever.

Recently I was experiencing fatigue, body ache and general uneasiness in my stomach.  I heard some of my colleagues had the same issues and that they were diagnosed with vitamin d deficiency. So I decided to get my blood tested before I see a doctor for diagnosis. 

So this diagnostic centre had some common tests grouped as ‚Äúpackages‚Äù with a  discount. The vitamin D test I wanted was a part of a package with many more tests I had never heard of. It was not very expensive so I decided to go with that. 

The next day when the results arrived I was shocked to see that there were many more things were off. I had abnormally high cholesterol, high LDL levels, low HDL and the SGPT test which indicates liver function was also high. 

I decided to see a general physician first, his preliminary diagnosis after a scan was that it could be liver infection or liver fibrosis (scaring of liver tissue). He recommended that I see a gastroenterologist immediately as this could be something serious. 

After consultation and some tests I found out I had a fatty liver. This could have led to some thing really serious.

I made this post because I felt like I found this out through some pure luck before it got serious. I would have never know about this if I had not gone for the other tests.  I know there are a lot of people here who work stressful jobs and things like this could just slip through the cracks.

Many good gentlemen asking, Why I did not switch on this last 1.5 years? I only had a trainer certificate at the time of joining the company. I did not have a freelancer experience certificate when I joined this company. Now for the last 1 year, I have managed to get experience certificates (Not from all though) from the agency I worked for, now I think I can prove that I do have 5+ years of experience.

One such behaviour is trying to be overly friendly even when you recently get acquainted with someone. Calling your boss or employee with any other name than what their actual name can cause someone to backfire because they go beyond personal boundaries. Words like ""mate"", ""buddy"", ""friend"" should be used carefully. Because it skews the balance of power. So only use such words if you ar too close to person or completely avoid it. In some cases it can also sound age discrimination (ageism - immature or elderly) or other sound selfish.

It's always best to address person from their first name with titles if any.

Edit: In India, the freshers usually use too much of sir/mam. Although that is ok but overuse of this is so annoying and also demeaning in front of others. You can use the first name with politeness.

No matter which pedigree they come from (IIT/IIM/ISB). Only your technical colleagues are your friends and actually know/understand what it takes to get shit done.

And in no situation should you backstab them. No matter how badly you are being divided and ruled.

Ok rant/advice over.",2023-11-06 09:06:38
1akfnf4,New trend: Interview to REJECT,"So I got a referral from my friend for a role of software engineer.
During the interview I gave 90% of the answers. I was well prepared and after the interview i cross-checked all my answers.
I was expecting next interview call.
I texted my friend about the interview and how it went well.

The friend said the guy who took my interview hardly has any development knowledge and copies every single line of code from chatgpt, has no clues how to even use git.
And the INTERVIEWER FEARS, if a new developer joins the company then HE MIGHT GET LAIDOFF.
The same guy has taken multiple interviews but hasn't approved anyone.

The feedback that the interviewer gave about me was I didn't answer well and most importantly said I was copying/cheating. (Even though my screen was shared.)

These kind of employees are scary, they will probably do anything to save their jobs.",2024-02-06 17:45:43
139fhoq,Is this the norm in tech companies?,"Last year my friend joined a MAANG company as a SDE, straight out of college. From what we discussed, he was doing good- completing various projects, learning new tech pretty quickly, etc.
During the last 6 months, he asked his manager for feedback in all his 1:1s. His manager was happy with his performance and just mentioned some general comments to keep improving and become more independent.

Recently, he had some performance review where his manager suddenly gave lot of negative feedback. He brought up even minor mistakes (which he did not mention in earlier 1:1s) and said that he will be putting him on a coaching plan.
The coaching plan consists of some tight deadlines where he would have to work a lot, which includes designing some complex projects completely from scratch. The feedback process also looked pretty strict.

My concern is - his manager kept mentioning how this is just way the company works and nothing personal against him. He even appreciated him for delivering a time-critical and complex project (outside of the coaching plan). So, is this really because of his performance? Or is it related to some culture where one of the teammates is considered for performance improvement? Should he consider the possibility of being fired despite his efforts?

PS: Sorry if I missed any details. Appreciate any insights. TIA!",2023-05-06 07:15:22

1b0mx81,My father passed away and my manager is asking me why I didn't completed my tasks.,"My father passed away and my manager is asking me why my Task is still pending.

So here me out guys, I passed out of college 1 years back and joined a PBC with a salary of less than 7 LPA. I ended up in a toxic department where the work is very hectic as it is based on C# but the framework is internally developed. My manager asks for how many hours I worked on which task each and every day in scrum and notes it down in an excel sheet. Literally everything I have to ask from people as things are very complicated and no help from Google and chat gpt is possible. Seniors behave rudely and always gives answers in egoistic way by making me look down that I don't know anything. I am in my learning phase honestly and now my father passed away so I kept my tasks pending and left for my hometown and didn't opened my office laptop for 2 weeks as it was the worst phase of my life. 

Now my manager has refused to give any hike and he mentioned my poor performance last year and that market is not doing well due to war. Also he keeps 1 on 1 every now and then and tells me your performance is very bad don't force me to put you in PIP. Mostly due to this mental torture I am not able to perform but nobody understands properly. I am way too depressed now and I have figured out the following options in life.

1. I have 1 year 6 months experience at this moment and now planning to work till 1 year 9 months is over and then resign as I have 3 months of notice period in my company and so it will finish 2 years of experience after which I will appear for CAT 2024 or CAT 2025.

2. With the preparation of CAT I will prepare for SSC CGL and go for any govt job as I will get more salary than what I am getting now and more peace in life and job security.",2024-02-26 17:17:15

15fn53t,Company asked us (4 people) to work on an AI model to recommend employees for layoff,"We have an internal system where employees productivity score and a range of datapoints about them over the years is maintained. Manager told us to use these parameters as well as their chat messages (specially keywords like ""u"", ""ur"", spaces before punctuation, and other grammar rules to be flagged), whether or not they work from home, commit messages, login/logout times, etc. as parameters to determine who should be on the top of the list to be layed off, so I guess the 4 of us are safe since other team members don't know what was assigned to us.

I raised ethical concerns and they said they need to layoff people next month due to funding issues, and that they only want to lay off people who are not adding much value to the company compared to other employees so they don't want the layoffs to be random. They think this is more fair than random, and that they just want recommendations and HR will ultimately decide manually.

I am not sure what to do. Should I just resign or is it possible to refuse to work on this? I feel like I'll lose all the friends I have here if they come to know that it was software that we wrote that ultimately lost them their jobs.

It pisses off me that they think of us some cheap labor and i guess our fellow country-men (Looking at WITCH firms)  have somehow given these fellas the premonition that we are ready to work for any ""figure"".

I literally had to shout out at a T.A who offered 25 lacs (Despite being a product firm \~\~not FAANG), whereas the going rate in USA is about 150k$.

Anyway, my wishful thinking that at least we are respected for our skills, ability to work and make a difference rather than looking at us as a cheap outsourced body-shop.

Reasons I quit the job -
1. Hated it, it didn't start that bad but since last 3 months my hate has grown a lot for my job. Always been waiting for Fridays, absolutely no motivation to complete tickets on time. Also was getting very intimidated everytime Manager called for a meeting, my performance had gone really down. 
2. Not getting any time to work my side projects. Ever since I joined this company, I have done zero side projects. I just don't have enough energy to do them after tiring days of work. 
3. I don't think I'm learning a lot in this company. I've been given just same techstack again and again for last 16 months, I've asked for some UI work as well a few times from my manager, CTO but they always called me out on my performance instead. 
4. My long term goal is to be self employed developer, so I want to fail now when I'm young (I'm 22 now, I can't afford to not take any risks now and regret in future)

My plan of action -
1. I will make 6-7 side projects I have in mind and deploy them to Google play store in next 2 months (when I'm in notice period)
2. I will write atleast one technical paper in one of the techstacks I was working in this company which I really liked. 

I also believe that completing above 2 tasks will also help in getting another job (If nothing works out) since it'll improve my resume a lot. My long term goal is to make a lot more money than I'm doing currently, not 2X or 3X, but 20X more money and that can only be done if I become really skilled and give myself enough time to try and fail. 

So any feedbacks, do you think this a bad decision? Am I being oversmart? Or I don't know what I'm talking about? Be honest.",2023-10-05 16:13:09

12lmq6d,My colleague took my interview.,"So recently me and my colleague left our toxic work place in search of better opportunities. He started working for a very early start up and he referred me in the same company. I was shocked when he took my technical interview he was an absolute di** during the interview i answered 10/13 questions correctly  and at the end of it he was scoffing and laughing saying he made it easy. He also has no experience as we both just completed our internship. His feedback was that ""I was not technically sound."" He was cocky and tried to pity me by saying he will make arrangements with the higher-ups and get me the job. I declined the offer out of self respect for myself. Am i wrong to decline their offer? I honestly do not want to work under him it does not feel right so. He got lucky meeting the founder of the start-up on LinkedIn and he kept saying that in 5 years I'll still be an employee in a company whereas he will be a manager. Our friendship became toxic as he used to be a great person intitially.",2023-04-14 06:24:34

16co9nv,"From Starving to SDE in Amazon, building Alexa - I made it.","I saw the first computer in 2006. And fell in love. The only problem? Money. Not just me, my entire family couldn't afford it even if they wanted to. There were days I would think what would happen if I got a computer. And daydream about it -- knowing full well I couldn't get it. We were so poor we couldn't afford a below poverty line certificate. 

There were days my dad would earn 10 Rs a day from his shop. And my mom would work as a tutor and tailor (often at the same families) to buy books for me, my sister and sustain the family. 

There was a cyber cafe where they let me use it for 5Rs an hour (typical rate was Rs. 20 an hour) and I'd go there every single sunday for an hour. I'd note down programming concepts and practice the entire week. Wondering what will be the output, only to find out next week that it doesn't work, and I'd make entire programs in months. But I had fun learning. 

In 7th grade, I got a nokia 5233 because I won the scholarship (and selfishly decided to use the money on a phone instead of funding my family, it'd be money for a month's ration). 

Anyways, I wrote code in Python via this thing called Python for S60 and once a few weeks, would get an internet recharge to check the documentations, articles and other forums. 

Fast forward 2012, Govt. Of assam decided they'd give laptops to people getting 60% and above. I got 61% somehow. And got that laptop. And it came with Ubuntu pre-installed and as I didn't know how to install windows so I learnt linux. 

I was doing random hussles to get money, i did photo editing, video editing, events, graphic designs, whatever I could do to earn money. And used that to learn coding. 

Finished by B.Sc in 2018, (no major, no surprise there) and got into a school. Had a fight because I set difficult questionnaire (which resulted in students not ""improving"" yoy. They did improve, the paper was set way too difficult)


I said f*** it, took my money (INR 5500 a month) for 6 months and left for Bangalore amid much opposition from family. To my surprise, I did get a job in a startup in 2019, in the same month I arrived here. I didn't know much about corporate. But still survived and learnt. 

Fast forward  3 years and 2 companies later. I got a linkedin inmail from an amazon recruiter. I applied. Took all the interviews, cleared and got a job offer on June 2022. 

What was more surprising is I got placed in a core alexa team. Was scared when the RIFs happened but our team expanded. 

I have went till the last round of Microsoft, Google and Amazon. Cleared Amazon and Microsoft did offer a down levelled position. But I took amazon (as I hate Microsoft because of EEE), the question asked in google was difficult, and i didn't have the most optimal solution. 


Now, for a person like me, who was ridiculed because I'd skip classes and be on computer all day. It was a dream come true. Anyways, living the dream without any degree. Giving mentorship to IIT (and BITS) Graduates is something I still can't stop giggling over. 

Not gonna mention my age, name or personal information. Don't want that indian idol fame, I want to be treated like anyone else, if a IIT guy does something better, I don't wanna justify by crying. Posted because I think, another crazy guy(or girl) like me might exist and he might decide to continue the grind and not feel hopeless. 

Amazon is definitely not the end. Goal is to build a company through which I can have a voice and impact society at large. Just savin up till that day comes and learning and working aggressively for that. Wish me luck. 

And please refrain from feeling pity and commenting randomly. It just feels amazing that if you use alexa, you probably invoke my code multiple times a day. And that's amazing to just think about.",2023-09-07 19:44:15

16r0t3e,Lets start an interesting careers thread,"Computer science and programming is a massive field. But all I see in this sub are web devs and wannabe web devs. Is it not concerning that 18-year-olds are asking whether they should focus on react or springboot? If your focus is that narrow from the beginning, you will never see the big picture!

So lets break that! I want to create a thread of all the unconventional programming jobs, the ones not talked about ever in the sub. I want to create a thread where professionals from different fields pitch their interesting careers. There are a vast amount of lucrative careers that no one even hears about! The focus here is to give them a platform, so that others are aware that these fields exist. Lets break the cycle of depressive posts from freshers who have already given up, and give people something to look forward to.

To hold the discussion, here are some rules:

**Rule 1**: Discuss the **unpopular** jobs! I have nothing against any group of people, but for this thread alone, lets not discuss the jobs people already talk about on a daily basis. Lets ban the following topics- **Front / back-end/ fullstack web development, AI / ML / Data analysis.** You are free to ask questions in the replies, but lets keep the platform mainly focused on the unconventional stuff.

**Rule 2**: **K**eep **I**t **S**imple, **S**tupid. Describe what you do and why it is interesting but keep the discussion simple. A large number of participants in the sub are students, so try to not discuss domain-specific knowledge as much as possible. An 18 year old who sat for JEE and have some vague idea of comp sci should be able to understand it.

**Rule 3: NO CTC, NO LPA.** Enough with the salary slips! In my experience, it does not matter what you do, if you are good enough to be in the top few percentile in the field, money will follow. Since we are discussing careers, salary discussions are unavoidable. So if you want to hint towards your package, you can only use one of the three categories: **POOR, GOOD, EXCELLENT.** Everyone has a different understanding of these terms, and its completely fine! Please refrain from giving ANY exact figures. This is a **career** thread, not a salary thread.

**Rule 4:** Highlight the following: Why is it interesting? What do you do / how does your day look like? Your favorite language / skill / tool / editor etc which is relevant to your job. Remember, a large number of the viewers are students, so try to highlight anything exciting without discussing salaries. The objective is to inform the next generation of engineers of the opportunities they can aim for!

&#x200B;

To start off, lets talk about me!

I am an independent security researcher. I basically get paid to hack stuff and then write a report on how i did it, and ways to mitigate it. While I do have degrees, everything related to this was completely self taught from completely free resources. I operate under a pseudonym. No one knows my name, or my face, where I am from, or which tier 1/2/3/4/50 college I am from. I take up contracts when I like, and am aiming for a permanent work-from-home life. The pay is excellent, as long as you are in the top 10%. Otherwise, it isn't worth it.

While it sounds nice, there are plenty of challenges. You need excellent coding skills. To break software, you need to understand it better than the developer who wrote it! Other than that, you have to be constantly up to date with every recent hack and attack vector which was made public. Your skills can get outdated very quickly if you arent updated on a monthly basis. However the primary skill you need is the hacking mentality. I never found a book to learn it from. I picked it up by participating in CTF (capture the flag) competitions, and reading numerous security incident reports. The field is competitive and cut-throat. Either you are making bank, or you are looking for other careers.

I use a variety of languages. Python, JS, Rust, Solidity. My favourite tools are fuzzing tools. Fuzzing is basically spraying a piece of code with random inputs until it breaks! It is an incredibly rewarding and exciting field you can look into.

The most exciting moment in my career was when I saved 500k USD worth of vulnerable funds. 

&#x200B;

What are your careers? What do you like about it, why is it unconventional, and why is it exciting? Drop a reply!

10w1r1m,"""Please turn on your webcam"". ""Sure, could you turn yours on as well?"". ""Uhhh....""","I'm not sure if this is a thing everywhere, or specific to India, but I've seen this happen SO MANY TIMES. I'm not even sure if this is something that would bother the people here if they faced it.

The interview begins, 10 seconds of greetings, etc. And then the interviewer says the same old words: ""Please turn on your webcam"". Which I do, and then I ask them ""Could you please turn yours on as well, it's very awkward talking to a blank screen.""

At this point, about 80-90% of interviewers either ignore the question and start asking questions, or just say ""Uhhh we're not prepared for that at the moment."" So they're expecting a candidate to basically give a CCTV-Interrogation style interview where the candidate can't see anyone but is himself seen by 2-3 other people.

I've stuck around for the rest of the interview a few times, but of late I've been just replying to their declination by saying ""No worries, let's reschedule this for when you are prepared for that"", and hang up.

Bro wtf, is it really that much of an ask to let me a see the person who's looking at me?

The other 10-20% of interviewers either:

* Camera already turned on
* Camera turned on with my CV on their desk
* Will turn on camera on request
* Will decline to turn on their camera but then also tell me it's alright if I turn mine off

I hate this shit so much, and I was wondering if the folks here have experienced this as well.",2023-02-07 13:25:08
14o5980,Finally got a job as Sys Admin,"I finally got a job which will pay me around 50k. I can't explain how happy I am right now.

First, I will tell you about myself. I graduated from [B.Tech](https://B.Tech)(Mechanical) - 2018 from a Lala college never got any placement from college. Took a year for Govt job preparations, I was unlucky I couldn't find a job then I gave interview and got selected in a Mechanical Company in March 2019. The pay was 8k/ month and at the time of joining they said that I could get increment in 6 months on my performance but they lowered my salary after covering me in EPF scheme. Then a year later COVID came and I had to leave that company because of financial reasons and I joined a Mobile Company (Oppo) as production engineer , I was employed there through 3rd party contractor the pay was good around 28k but working hours were between 13-14 hours/day and u don't get any chair to sit because you have to be on your feet on production line. Then after working for 4 months I left and started preparing for Designing (Solid Works) jobs, I joined an institute but I was unlucky I didn't get any job . After 6 months in July 2021 I was in construction company joined as MEP Engineer . The site was far from my home , I had to ride 40 kms from my home for work. The pay was 12.5k/month and I was not liking there because the salary was 4 months late in that company. I worked there for around 4 months and then I quit. I started looking for coding jobs, I mentioned HTML,CSS and JS in my CV and I was getting calls but I was not prepared for interviews and I got rejected in every interview. I joined a coaching center in my hometown, paid 35k for web dev course ( Full Stack Course ) and tragedy happened. My coaching institute owner fled after teaching me for 2 months. I was worried and started looking for jobs in April 2022 and I got a job in company after 10 days of my job hunting. I joined as a web designer around 9.5k/month , I was happy this time because I was getting entry into the IT field and I was afraid too for not succeeding. I worked as a designer but I felt at that time designing is not cup of my tea and there is not a future for designers in terms of growth and money. In my org they had Ubuntu installed for all of their employees. So, I started learning cloud, and after that I told my boss that please give me some work regarding Linux and Automation . He saw my enthusiasm and started giving me some work to automate. After 2 months he put me in a new project for company which was for installing an application on Linux Servers. First, I completed my work using Shell scripting and then they told me to use Ansible. So I completed that work in Ansible too. Meanwhile , it was a year I was with them they also increased my salary to 14.5 k but for the past 4 months I started feeling that I was not learning anything and my work was not approved on time. Also, I was in dire need of money, I started applying for interviews as Linux SysAdmin and I got a call from govt. org for e-office administrator. I went for an interview and got selected , I was asked plethora of questions about Linux from the scientist and  i was said to deploy a Laravel App on one of their VMs.

Finally, I deployed but I was somehow got late because one of their VMs were not working, but completed my work assigned to me. 

Next day, I got a call from them that I got selected and I asked about my salary and I was happy for the work hard work that I did for almost a year.

I have joined them as Deployment Lead and working there for almost 20 days.

Finally , I am happy in at this point in my life. I would also like to thank my one of the bosses from my previous company who helped me initially.",2023-07-01 20:47:13

19cp5e1,Shit! Shit! Shit! I fucked up...,"Ok it's just 2 months in my job as a db engineer and I fucked up!

I was asked to write grants for a new table in production which went live on Friday and I forgot 1 user group. And now the onshore team has raised a level 2 incidence....

I work in am MNC for a Japan client and they are very strict about how and when thing should be done! 

WTF am I gonna do now? I am panicking and fucking scared! We have a meeting at 1PM what am I gonna say?

Update: No one said anything about the issue in the 1PM meeting, and my manager asked my senior colleague (1yo) to schedule a meeting for 4 pm to discuss what happened. Then I anxiously waited for 4PM, But the meeting got rescheduled for today(23rd jan 1PM). Next day, we had our daily call at 11AM. And the grant issue got highlighted, the onshore team asked what happened? I was about to open my mic and was about to speak when my manager started talking and said that ""We forgot to grant the access to a user group, it was mistake from our side and is rectified now. We will make sure this won't happen again....... "" But he got to listen a lot that how can this happen? It's such a small thing and all.... I was kinda releived that my manager backed me up but was also listening to the bashing my manager was getting from the onshore team, and it scared me kinda that I'm gonna listen about it from him later. Meeting ended, no one said anything about it, it was chill at our workspace, we were working on our next demand. Now comes the time for the meeting with my manager at 1PM and it again got rescheduled for 4 PM, I again waited anxiously, preparing my statement, preparing the doc that many of you suggested. At 4PM, my manager asked the whole team(3+1) to a nearby meeting room. We got up and went there, we sat down. My manager went to the white board and started writing ""What^all went wrong"" then asked us to suggest him that what according to US went wrong? My team started saying things like peer review, no proper documentation maintained, lack of proper communication etc etc. I was total blank, because this was not how I imagined this meeting to go! All of a sudden he asked me ""Rahul(fake name) what do you think? where we went wrong on Friday?"" I was silent for few seconds and then I said ""I didn't checked the grants file well enough and missed a user group"" to which he asked ""Anything else?"" I said ""Nothing else comes to my mind"" to this he asked ""Who gave you this task to do?"" I replied ""Tanya(fake name)(colleague)"" to which he said ""It was also Tanya's task to validate and review my scripts"" to which she agreed that it was a miss on her part. Then we discussed more about it and discussed how we can avoid this in future. It was a good meeting, no bashing to anyone, no one blamed anything to anyone. We just had a discussion. We were laughing and all in the meeting. In the end he said ""Chill, things happen. People before you also have fucked up, more than yours, equal to yours, less than yours. Still everyone is here. One of them is standing right in front of you. chill. Move on and look forward to improving yourself and your work and focus on next demansld"" He also asked for any suggestions we had for him.

1bk21vp,Some Recruiters really deserve this type of treatment,"Back Story - I was shortlisted by this company for Android developer role. Gave 3 rounds (including technical and coding round) and the head of application department was also quite impressed with me. Shrotly after the 3rd round, the HR said congratulations you are selected for the role! And just after saying this she said -  you have one more round which is a cultural round (I mean what the fuck does this round accomplish?). So I said alright and after giving that round, recruiter said that you're on hold for this position. And why cultural round was more irrelevant in this situation was because I had to go and work on the client's company.

After 2-3 weeks she again approached for me for a freelancing role, for which we both agreed on 45k per month. She said you'll have more of a discussion round with the head of the department and I had the discussion with the head next day. 

2 days later we had a chat on call in which she said that they have hired another candidate which has 9+ years of experience and is willing to work on same rate as mine (bullshit) which I don't buy at all. 

I mean if you have an ideal candidate who has cleared all technical rounds previously and is willing to work within your budget, then why are you approaching other persons at the same time? ",2024-03-21 08:55:14

17bvvzy,How do you manage a junior who is a jerk?,"A newly joined junior (2+ yoe) gives the know-it-all vibes to everyone in my team. He word-vomits during our calls and speaks non-sense in person. Basically, he is a LinkedIn influencer in person, who has written a couple of articles on Medium and now thinks he has been hired to single handedly disrupt the entire existing tech stack. And the worst part is he downplays all the other teams' efforts by condescendingly referring to them as ""backward in tech"", before his boss. 

This is causing his boss, who is not very tech literate, to set unreasonable expectations for other teams, including mine. I was not involved in his hiring so I do not know how this even happened. He does not work in my team but is constantly engaging with us on projects. He talks to my team, where some have over 15+ yoe, in an imposing tone, like he owns us to work for him.

He has done little to no work himself so far; everything is on whiteboards. We've tried everything to guide him while respecting his aspirations but all he says is, ""I'm not able to apply my full skills here, because there is too much tech backwardness"",  which is not true. He is promising all sorts of magic to his boss and pointing him towards other teams to be the ones to actually work on it, as it is ""not his skillset"".

As the office politics go, his boss is close to the higher-ups so nobody wants to be on his bad side. I once told him not to come to us untill he has something concrete to show (like a PoC) but this guy has gone back to his boss and bitched about how I am not a cooperative team player and how my entire team hates challenges. 

How does one manage such a person?

EDIT: For those saying I and my team are egoistic, forget the part  where I mention that this new guy is from a different team. His deliverables are his own. The problem starts when he tries to convince his boss to offload his work onto my team, when he should have been capable enough to do it himself. That was his friggin' job description. The guy has been hired as an IC but acts managerial with contempt for the entire current enterprise ecosystem only and only because he lacks the skills to learn and adapt.",2023-10-19 22:42:03

1awc26y,The unfortunate truth about ChatGPT is that those who need it can't get any answers and those who don't can.,"I have seen this general trend in WITCH that the developers are really bad no disrespect.

So today I was trying to help someone and the first thing I noticed was that the code was just really stupid like there is no concept of functions for these people.  Anyway while helping him he said why to do so much development chat GPT is there. It was a red flag for me. Any how while helping them I understood what the term  chat gpt developer means. 

chatGpt can't help them because the way they write the prompts is so hilarious like does it not cross their mind that absolutely no future GPT can understand them unless it starts reading their mind and even then it won't. They didn't give the entire context of the code. Just some lines here and their. The old me would have laughed their ass off. However this is now a daily occurrence.

Worst part is absolutely not understanding any part of the code that chatGPT gave.

Meanwhile even if I use GPT I ask questions about intricate concepts or generic  code not copy paste code.  That helps a lot but simply asking it especially GPT-3.5 is funny.

Good Prompting might change the outcome however ain't no way GPT can take over the real devs jobs because you need someone to communicate what they want.


Edit I worked all my life in WITCH and seen some amazing developers in other companies however I don't want to generalize WITCH as bad but at lower pay you get those devs only. So no disrespect again but these kinds of things are possible mostly in WITCH only.",2024-02-21 13:29:53

1bnxoif,Got a fair offer in this job market. Feels great to finally be content. ,"As a 26 year old coming from a tier III college who debated the option of going for masters in US for the longest time, started with 4.5lpa, moved to data scientist positions later, made slow and steady progress and now getting an offer from a product company with 37lpa + stocks makes me feel so relieved.
 After 6 weeks of high focused, multiple applications and reaching out to folks on linkedin, giving interviews every other day, I finally got an offer that is a 90% hike on my cctc. 
For a long time, I felt undervalued and underpaid in my current company. I had lost motivation to work and decided to start applying even though I heard terrible things about the current job market. 
I updated my resume, got it peer reviewed and improvised upon it. Started reaching out to recruiters and hiring managers on linkedin relentlessly. Few would reply, few wouldn‚Äôt. It took a huge hit on my self esteem. 
Just when I thought I can‚Äôt handle this stress anymore, I got this offer from a product company after 5 rounds of interview. 
It‚Äôs all about being the right place at the right time and being ready always.  

edit: My job timeline started in 2019 when I joined as a Software Engineer at a fintech company for 4.5lpa. I later switched to a data science position for 15lpa. got 10% hike every year to reach current ctc of 18.5lpa. 
In the company, I worked hard and made the right moves to get projects with good tech stack. So, that helped me build a well rounded profile.

t1t9fd,Jumped from 25LPA to 50LPA. Feeling delighted.,"Background: Software developer with 6 years of experience. Tech stack: Mainly Python, SQL, AWS.

Applied to a company's job posting on LinkedIn. Cleared zoom round 1 with the CTO of the company. Got a programming challenge for round 2. The time given to work on it was 1 week. I actually took longer... 2 weeks to finish the task, and they were okay with it. Really cool people.

The last interview round was based on the programming challenge again with the CTO (Had to explain the project architecture and stuff). The company is product based and headquartered out of India and I can work remotely for lifetime. 

Tbh, till the end of round 2 I had no idea what pay I should expect. I would have been happy to have made the jump from 25 to 35 LPA. That was the target I had in mind when I started interviewing 2 months back. In the final round, the interviewer made a passing reference to the budget being more than 45 LPA. I negotiated a bit and settled for 50LPA fixed + 10% bonus per year.

I know the job market is hot right now. And sure, there are engineers my experience probably making more than what I got. But I'm satisfied with my progress so far.

It's funny how times change. I started my professional journey at 2.2 LPA in a WITCH kind of a company. My sincere advice from personal experience: Get the fuck out of a WITCH at the first good opportunity you get. These are okay as career starters, but not to build careers. In these companies you make friends, have fun, chill when have no work, but ultimately they turn you into a nameless mule lost in a heard. Get out before it's too late. 

Keep dreaming high. Don't settle for less. Keep hustling. Work hard to achieve what you deserve. There's absolutely no substitute for hard work. Strong work ethnic too... it will open avenues you'd never have expected.

**EDIT 1**: 

Noticed some questions around my tech stack. Sorry for the lack of context in the original post. 

I currently handle the end-to-end data pipeline of a business intelligence application. I write general purpose backend Python code as needed. I Maintain the serverless infrastructure of my project. I write and fine tune complex SQL code. I have decent hands-on experience with AWS services like S3, EC2, RDS, Lambda, SQS, Glue, API Gateway, Codeformation. I handle (design and develop) my project's data pipeline orchestration using Airflow.

Fair knowledge of data visualization tools like Tableau, Google Data Studio.

Decent knowledge of Docker, Shell scripting, Rest APIs.

Some exposure to tools such as Fivetran, Snowflake, dbt.

I've done several certifications from sites like Udemy, Datacamp, etc.

Have worked on some pretty detailed side projects involving machine learning.

And I've been fortunate enough to have worn different hats - as a general purpose software engineer, data engineer, data analyst, database developer, business intelligence developer.

Good working knowledge of DSA. No CP experience, though. Had started with Leetcode some time back. But haven't been able to dedicate a lot of time to it. That's my next goal... improving my DSA skills :)

**EDIT 2**

Just learned that the company is going to pay me a sign on bonus of Rs 50k for the programming task I worked on during the interview (it was actually a mini project whose code I might use after joining the company). God, what did I do to deserve this treatment?",2022-02-26 09:38:50

13kmcgb,Today is my last day at the job I finally quit,"My org had started abusing me and making me work 12+ hours a day. Even though the pay was decent (20lpa for 2yoe with them), I did not let them ruin my life quality. I had finally quit that job and let me tell you folks, the moment I quit it felt like a huge load off of my head. Waking up in the morning has been the best part of the day - so much more easier, light headed, motivated and stress free! I can't express how glad I am to take that decision!!!

I had applied to 20-25 jobs and 2 of them reverted. With hardly a month of leetcode and system design practice during my notice period I was able to get to 25Lpa fixed. 

Seriously, we don't realise it but our jobs are killing us slowly. But now my eyes are opened, and I know better than to give my job the opportunity to slowly take over. 

Thank you guys for your strong support and suggestions when I had expressed that my org was being toxic!!!

18ebjnh,Tech outlook in our lifetime,"India: 
Current gdp ~4tn usd. In approx 50 years 12-13x growth.

IT in india is mostly outsourcing by MNCs and indian tech giants as basically dependent on them believe it or not. This growth will probably not reflect in IT sector.

Manufacturing, infra, etc. has a lot of room to grow in india unlike IT sector. 
IT will grow in the next decade according to me but could slow down ahead.
Real estate in india will be very valuable in upcoming times if the country grows at this rate.

Indian IT Startups are actually very nice but doesn't provide majority jobs.

Gdp per capita will most likely go upto 7-8x the current levels its currently $2250 so lets take it as $20k.(higher side)

Quality of life will definitely improve in india but as we know many basic issues still exist pollution,etc, etc. won't rant about it.
We take a lot of time to fix basic problems.

USA:
Current gdp ~$25-26tn. In 50 years approx double.

Many cutting edge technologies are developed in the US. AI is highly valuable right now whereas in india there are hardly any notable AI startups. The growth in US gdp could be more due to result of this.

Instead of outsourcing alot of companies will rely on AI or shift to nations with cheaper workforces later on.

Gdp per capita is $70k right now could 2x in 50 years.

Startup scene will still be better in the US in our lifetime. Tech salaries in US could still be paid highly.

Quality of life is already good in most developed countries like US.
They debate on complex issues politically. This probably wont change in india due to mindset.

Rupee will keep depreciating until US defaults which wont happen.
Big changes like banning notes 500,2000 creates investor doubt they would rather invest in a better banking system like US.

Inflation was wild in the dollar itself, rupee still depreciated alot printer going brr in india too.

Overall thoughts:
Developed countries will always have better lifestyle and more wages than India.

We wont be much of a part of the indian growth story unless we make something ourselves.

The mindset of tech giants in india is total bs.
They want 70 hour workweeks. There is barely any groundbreaking research happening.
Semiconductor design/manufacturing non existent in india, this will bottleneck AI development in the future believe it or not.

Many startups in india are great for improving quality of life like zomato, ola, etc. but technologial improvements which create big impact need to happen.

My thoughts:
Yes, India will grow but probably not for us (salary wise), u could invest in stock market, real estate and stonk.

Wage growth will occur but will never be high enough due to PPP.
PPP will remain a significant factor.

This is a broader perspective about looking into opportunities outside india and also making better things in India, if u care about quality of life, growth etc. for our lifetime.

Work culture hmm
In India our ceos/politicians want 70 hrs and whatnot.
If a ceo/politician said something like that in a developed country he and his company would get trolled non stop (shares would fall) big reaction.
Work culture will remain better outside india.

I know job market is very tight right now but this further shows that our IT sector gets impacted by US.

Just some thoughts would love to hear what u guys think.",2023-12-09 11:20:00

18ih0bj,This market's gonna teach us all!,"..... Or atleast most of us.Or atleast me.
Android developer with ~8 years of experience here.
I got laid off in July, apparently not because of money crunch, restructuring, I just couldn't work with the guys.

Anyway, getting laid off is never nice, it fucks up a lot of plans where spending is involvedüòÇüòÇ.

Luckily has savings and just trying to polish my interview skills, which was apparently never good it seems. 

DS-ALGO, combined with the fact that android in past few years has changed so much it's hard to keep up and It's getting boring tbh,but this market is something which I am stumbling upon for the first time in my career as a mobile dev.

Even after 5 months of work on DS algo, doing necessary cramming and what not, I have only got interview with one company who basically said no after 5 rounds of interview(I did well here, solved a difficult ds question(so proud)), well shit happens in interview, but he'll there is no where else to go after this interview process.


After applying to idk how many companies I have only got rejection at resume itself, I had no idea how good resumes looked, so I started fixing that, got reviews, worked on them, paid money from my pocket to get some opinions from ""experts"", and yet, just yesterday got rejection from angelOne.

Well, in the past all the companies I joined, I never truly had a kind of interview where I ever felt that  any out of the way preparation is required, call me lucky or otherwise, idk, back then I was only asked about android and java, a bit kotlin in last company and rxjava,
Basically the things we work on.
All knowledge I had was implementation based, and reading code from other repos on GitHub.

But, now since I was failing interviews like anything in July(I was getting callbacks then), I decided to take some time off and learn new android tech, ds-algo, non-mobile based system design and core software engineering principles, and currently I feel great about finally overcoming this hurdle.
But I ain't getting any interviews, and idk how many days I can keep myself sane doing these things, just to get rejected on the resume, LOL.

I am not scared, though, the situation I am in will scare the living daylights of me from one year ago, I have no clue where this courage is coming from, probably from my savings account, üòÇ.

But what's the purpose, of me telling all this.

To talk about a MISTAKE which I kept doing, a big one, one which led to seriously fall into a dark place even when everything was working in my favour.

It was ""avoiding failures"", as I have mentioned above, I never had to do a lot of prep for interviews to get job,
I started off with x, then shifted to get 3x, then 8x then eventually 15x+insane benefits in the last company, 

but I did give a lot of interviews where ds algo and all those things which I hated, were asked, I was just never able to clear them.

In earlier days of my career I got call from MakeMyTrip, Oyo Intuit, daily hunt etc, but I always failed in the ds algo round, the only reason I never took as failure and worked on them was because I somehow was cracking some startup where I was getting same or more as a package,

 all these years what I considered as success was actually me ignoring/avoiding my failures.

So why was i not able to understand this, and why understanding this is important?

Because I was hungry for money, it was my only motivation, and then one day, this motivation died and suddenly I had no motivation in work, I felt fatigued doing a small task, this led to me not being able to clearly convey others their mistake, because I was busy blaming only myself, which led me to burnout and the same company where my graph was going in the sky again, crashed in less than 6 months, no matter what I do everyone in my previous company will simply say he wasn't good enough, because I started believing that.

So even if I am not getting any interviews, even if I flunk a few, I will now take this time, and solve the only problem which I always ignored, not just to clear interviews, I mean after an year, market will get back to normal and I will be all cha-ching again, but to tell myself, just like I used to,

""There is nothing you can't do"".

uwny8b,My Experience with Job search in Germany/EU from India,"Hey all, Just writing this guide / experience to help others. I recently received my offer from eBay Kleinanzeigen (Adevinta) for an intermediate Full Stack role. As I received a lot of queries and questions from various other threads, I would like to make a comprehensive guide to help others who might be looking to relocate to EU/Germany for a tech job.

A little bit about me, I have 2 years of experience working remotely for a US based startup. Mainly, MERN stack and AWS.

**Disclaimer:** The purpose of this post is not to spark any political conversation or arguments.

# 1. Why EU / Germany?

For me, it boils down to the following reasons

&#x200B;

* Better Engineering Culture (Tbh This depends on the company and team you get in)
* Better Compensation
* Cooler Climate (This is just personal preference)
* Better Quality of Life
* More PTO
* Ease of obtaining PR compared to USA
* Good healthcare

There are many more reasons for this, but these are some of the top reasons for me personally.

Yes, there are high taxes in EU, but so is the quality of services you get in return.

# 2. Pre-requisites For Applying

Now, before applying please ensure you tick all or some of these boxes

&#x200B;

* Passport
* CV in EU Format
* Fluency in English. (If possible, get IELTS certification done beforehand and aim for B2+)

# 3. Where to Find Job Listings

Here are some sites to find vacancies / job listings

&#x200B;

* [LinkedIn Job Board](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?)
* [Arbeit Now](https://arbeitnow.com)
* [Relocate Me](https://relocate.me/)
* [Berlin Startup Jobs](https://berlinstartupjobs.com/)
* There are many more but these were the ones I used the most.

You can even try cold mailing recruiters from companies you wish to apply to but don't have a public listing.

# 4. Tips for Applying

Here are some tips that I found helpful and increased my reply rate when applying to interviews.

&#x200B;

* **Write Cover Letters.** Yes, it is boring but you have to realise that you are applying from outside of EU. You need to do everything possible to make a good impression and maximise your chance of getting a reply.
* **Don't Write Faceless Cover Letters.** Please don't use generic cover letters for each company. Try and personalise them. Eg. If you happen to have worked in the same domain / sector as the role, mention it in the cover letter. Keep the cover letter 3-4 paragraphs at most.
* **Don't use overcomplicated words**. This is not a vocabulary contest, no one cares that you know long words. **KEEP IT SIMPLE** and to the point in both CV and Cover Letter.
* **Highlight / Bold Key Points.** My response rate increased quite a bit once I started bolding important points and phrases in my CV and cover letter

# 5. Interview Process

Most Companies had anywhere from 3-5 Interview rounds. Consisting of following rounds

&#x200B;

* **Round 1**: Screening / HR Interview
* **Round 2:** Take Home Assignment / Code Challenge
* **Round 3:** Code Review / Pair Programming
* **Round 4**: Interview with Engineering Manager + PM
* **Round 5:** Team Fit

I applied to mostly Tier 2 Companies and I didn't face any Leet code or DSA questions. This might differ if you apply to a tier 1 company or some where else in EU.

The interviews themselves are not very hard but you have to be good at communicating.

# 6. Round 1: Screening / HR Interview

This was generally a 30-45 minute call with the Recruiter. The purpose is to uncover you motivation to join the team and see if you are a good fit for the company values.

**Tips**

* **Practice:** Before jumping into the actual interview, practice this with a friend or family member. You can google. [Here](https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/hr-interview-questions) is a list of general questions they ask. The reason for practicing is that if you are not used to interviewing regularly, you will stutter and come across as unconfident.
* **Be Friendly:** Don't treat this like a VIVA from college. The recruiter is not there to harass you. Think of it like a conversation with a colleague.  Be friendly and genuine. Don't come across as arrogant or over confident.
* **Don't mug up the answers:** Again, this is not a VIVA. It's easy to tell when someone is speaking from memory. Have a rough idea of what you want to say but don't mug up the answers.
* **Take notes:** It's easy to get tunnel visioned and hear the interviewer speak but be unable to understand anything. So stay focused and write down important points.
* **Research the company.** A lot of the recruiters have told me that a lot of other candidates don't even bother to research the company. So research them. Go through their products, websites, vision and values. Have a basic understanding of What the company actually does. The more you know about the company, the less time recruiter has to spend on explaining about the company to you.
* **Relax.** For this interview, try and be as genuine as you can. Recruiters can often tell when someone is being very sly or hiding something on purpose.

# 7. Round 2: Take Home Assignment / Code Challenge

Once you clear Round 1, you will be sent a Code Challenge that you are supposed to solve and submit within 4-7 days. Now based on the role, the challenges will differ vastly.

Here are some challenges I faced

* Here's an API, Add x functionality to this and satisfy these constraints.
* Take data from this API and display them using React SSR
* Build a simple Covid Tracker using this API
* Here is some data from an API, display this data on a map.

For frontend challenges, I generally did not write my own CSS but used off the shelf stuff like bootstrap and MUI.

The challenges were not really hard. If you code on a daily basis then you should have no trouble solving them. But they were lengthy. An average challenge took up 6-8 hours. So be ready to devote the time.

**Tips**

* **Write TESTS:** If you expect to clear this, you have to write tests for your code. This includes Unit, Integration as well as E2E Tests.
* **Document:** Include a README file, detail the pre-requisites and steps to start the project. Document you code like you would in an actual work environment.
* **KISS & DRY:** Keep your code Simple and DRY.

# 8. Round 3: Code Review / Pair Programming

This generally includes a code review session with senior devs from the team. The scope of this interview is quite broad.

You can expect this interview to last 1 hour.  It has following parts

* Code Review
* Design Thinking
* Theoretical Questions

**Code Review**

* They will try and poke holes in your solution.
* Questions around best practices
* What if we removed x function, could you achieve this result still ?
* How else could the solution be achieved ?
* Explain your approach

**Design Thinking**

* What if we had to scale this solution to a million users?
* How would you improve load time?
* Questions around your experience with Micro services, Micro Frontends, CI / CD, Docker

**Theoretical Questions (Mine was MERN based so here are some examples, yours might differ)**

* Explain Event Loop in Node JS
* Explain how setTimeout works
* Difference between ES6 and CommonJS modules
* What is CORS
* Difference between a Unit Test & Integration Test
* What is semantic HTML
* What is useMemo Hook in React

The main thing for this interview is to be a good communicator. Speak slowly, explain your approach and show a willingness to learn if you don't know something.

# 9. Round 4: Interview with Engineering Manager + PM

This is the most important round. You can do rock the tech interview and if you don't impress the Engineering Manager and the PM, you have no chance of getting the role.

This interview has two aims: **To determine if you have a product mindset and seeing if you would fit the team.**

**Product Mindset**

* They will ask you a lot of questions you would expect a product manager to answer.
* What can we improve in our current product?
* Where do you see the product growing?
* Can you differentiate between Output & Outcome
* A/B Testing and it's importance
* Questions around QA

**Team Fit**

* There will be a lot of questions around situations. What would you do if you faced situation x? This is to see how you think on your feet. Try and relate the answers to your previous experience.
* **AGILE:** Know the basics of Scrum and Kanban
* How you work at your current team?
* Your biggest achievement at your current company

I found this to be very fun and interesting. It felt like a conversation more than an interview.

# 10. Round 5: Meet The Team

Here, you will meet your future team. This would be a very casual conversation. Both parties would question each other and determine if they would like to work with each other. There are no tips for this one, Just be yourself.

# 11. Offer

If everything goes right, you will be invited to a follow-up call. Where they will give you a verbal offer and explain you the offer in detail.

After this, you will be given 3-5 days to think over and inform them of your decision.

Below is the offer I received from eBay Kleinanzeigen.

* **Role**: Full Stack Engineer
* **Location:** Berlin
* **Base Pay:** ‚Ç¨65k/year
* **Bonus:** 10% of Base Pay at year end
* **Relocation Support:** ‚Ç¨5k (After Tax) + VISA Support
* **PTO:** 28 Days per year
* Other Tech job perks

# 12. Language Barrier

In general, Jobs explicitly mention language requirements. Most tech jobs are in English. But over time be prepared to learn their language to settle into a foreign country and culture.

If a job ad is in German, Most likely it will require german.

# 13. How long does it take / How hard is it?

I'm not going to tell you that it's easy. But it's not impossible, if you have the right skills. Depending on your luck expect to spend 2-3 months in your job search. 

I applied to about 45 Openings. I got 7 interviews total. Your mileage will vary depending on your yoe and skills. This was across a span of roughly 1.5 months.

Out of 7

* 1 rejected after the HR interview
* 1 rejected after Code Challenge and 1 Ghosted after Code Challenge
* 2 Rejected after Tech Interview
* 1 Rejected after Meet the Team interview
* 1 Offer

# 14. Conclusion

I hope this helps someone looking to relocate to EU for a tech job. It is time consuming and there will be lots of frustrating rejections. Key is to keep applying. 

Don't stop applying once you get a verbal offer. Until you get the formal work contract, keep applying. Nothing is final until then.

Good luck!",2022-05-24 10:47:27
1ajm8x9,Rejecting Google offer.,"Hey, I have seen a lot of post regarding job scarcity and layoff. Here to give you some hope. 

One of my friend, working in an ad related company, got an offer from Google at 50lpa. He has 2.5 year of experience. He applied for l4 position for Google but Google told him that they only give l4 position to 3+ year of experienced. He simply rejected the offer. He is a very good coder. Right now giving one more interview with linkedin. 

One more friend, from service based company having 2 year of experience and having CTC of 6.75 lpa, is giving interviews in couple of companies offering him 13-18 lpa from JP Morgan to Mercedes Benz, even having 3 month notice period. 

What is common for these two? They love coding, one usually do dsa+ cp in his free time+ dev. 
Second one commits his time in development, having some live projects, good GitHub contribution. Always make notes of each java concept, read java and angular documentation. 

Both of them love coding. Don't think about any other course. They are here to stay in software field. They love what they do, their work speaks and multiple hr reach them for hiring. 

Those, especially freshers are very tensed about placement, I will like to motivate you to work harder and explore different domains of this field. God bless everyone.",2024-02-05 17:34:12

I'm curious to hear from any software engineers who work or have worked at ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) or have been part of the Chandrayaan 3 project.

Your insights into the experience would be greatly appreciated! I'd love to know how it feels to be part of such an exciting endeavour and how you build and deploy complex codes for missions like Chandrayaan 3.

What kind of engineering work goes into these projects where every tiny detail can make a big difference? If you have any information or know someone who does, please share your thoughts.

All inputs are welcomed. It would be fantastic to get some behind-the-scenes details.

Thanks in advance!

Things were going good initially (and they were profitable) , then there was some audit done by Deloitte. After that audit this layoff scene started. They used a brilliant strategy to do layoffs. There were two categories of people   in their company. 
1) Developers  (highly paid)
2) management people like HR, accounts etc ( moderately paid)

Highly paid category people were put into PIP and laid off. And since they were piped they were not given any serverance pay and other benefits (some even did forced resign)

Moderately paid category people were laid off in a systematic manner and given serverance pay (which was obviously low) 

There is a huge possibility that big4 has played a huge role in the world wide layoff scenario.",2023-06-13 16:10:46

On joining the meeting, the person who setup the call via phone and one other person was in call. They told me to turn on my camera after which they asked me to show government id proof.   
My senses tingled and i told i will not share and asked if its mandatory to show ID. They told its mandatory. So i just told the initial guy to reach on my phone if you want to talk and i dropped off the meeting.

I was mentioned over call that the termination was due to the product not working and had nothing to do with my skills or knowledge. Yet in the official email I received, the reason stated was I wasn't fit for the team and didn't align with the industry.

On top of that I was terminated 2 weeks before my 1 year completion. There was a bonus associated with 1 year completion and now they are refusing that.

I don't care about getting terminated, but I am really upset with the fake reason and the bonus part. It is very unfair.

I have the office laptop with me which I need to send over. I was thinking of not returning the laptop. Also the severance amount is very less compared to the laptop.

I wanted to know if is this a good idea. Can there be any legal complications in future? 

Any help or guidance is appreciated.

14fsfab,For freshers busy being code monkeys on leetcode and other platforms,"I recently saw a post here where OP asked if he could post his leetcode stats (and stats from other platforms) on his resum√©. The stats showed that OP has been regular on competitive coding platforms for ~400 odd days.

I'd mentioned something similar in a comment on that post as well, but in order to send this message to a broader audience a post would be better.

1. Competitive coding is a sport. It is about solving a small problem with a team of 1. In professional life, that is NEVER going to be the case. Please stop mentioning it in your resum√©, keeping it to your LinkedIn is fine. 

2. Instead of wasting your entire time on coding platforms, participate in hackathons. They somewhat simulate real life scenarios where you have to solve a problem with your team and then explain your approach to a jury, which includes focussing on designing scalable code, which unfortunately hardly any fresher cares about. 

3. Read about best practices of your language, SOLID principles, latest updates in your language - added features (their pros and cons), and so on. Learn about design patterns (atleast the common ones), implement them. I can guarantee the freshers boasting about their leetcode prowess will crumble in writing the most basic of design pattern. 

4. Read about abstraction, scalability and code readability. You are going to work in a team, the code you write will be used and updated later. STOP WRITING SPAGHETTI CODE JUST TO PASS ALL TESTCASES. 

5. Open the classes of libraries used in your code. If you're a Java dev, i highly recommend reading them. They are written so beautifully with people who are crazy-level experts. Trying to copy how they write code (designing, implementing and commenting) is going to make you a far better developer. Writing such code is an art, not just engineering.

6. Learn to comment your code properly.

7. Learn about testing frameworks and code coverage. 

My background: I'm a 3YOE Java backend dev with good salary, graduated from a Tier-1 college. 

This is what I've learned so far. You're going to work in a team, it's time you learn a few skills that will help you with it. Hope this helps, good luck!

EDIT: Thank you all for your comments. This is in no way a shitpost on competitive coding, it is the cornerstone of logic building. But in no way is it everything, there's a lot more to software engineering than leetcode. Do leetcode, just don't let it be everything you do.",2023-06-22 03:44:21

14unxfg,How do you deal with a toxic working environment when you can't quit?,"I think I work in a very toxic team. 

Daily standups are just used to take attendance and publically shame people in front of the entire team if the manager thinks you are not working hard enough.

If the manager is having a bad day, he takes his frustration out on rest of the team. Taunts are very common, you can expect to hear you are incompetent, working not fast enough, etc every few weeks.

Not allowed to take leaves, we have to inform weeks in advance for a single day off but it can still be cancelled. I once applied for a sick leave because I had a really bad headache, was asked to take disprin and cancel my leave.

I can add more but I think you get the general idea.

Changing teams is not possible I tried.

I know I should leave this job and I will leave in a few months as soon as my bond is over.

But how should I deal with this while I am still in this company? I know there are people stuck in similar or worse environment than me, so how are you handling all this?

It's been a long time since then. I've got regulatory claim from Meta Inc., they tried to take it down several times. But fortunately I make it work. 

After almost 8 months of developing it i've got a lot of feedback. Some of the users had no idea how to enable the extension, which make me wonder why: *""I made it as simpe as it could be. Just why it happens""*. But I was wrong. I guess it's a good thing, admit your faults and help to grow yourself, as a developer and your product aswell. Also I've got some feedback from people with ADHD:

**Honestly I wasn't expected that. Like, at all.** 

And that make me wonder that I would never make it commercial. Just so more people can use it without being afraid that it will not work next time.  

Also, at first I made it with closed source code. I was afraid that someone else will copy it. But after seeing all of that feedback, I made it open source from 2 reasons:

1. **Proof of safety:** I would rather use something that can be checked personally.
2. **Continious Maintaining:** Some people could have great ideas that may help it flow, and gain more features.

# FAQ:

*- What functionality it currently has?* 

**- Well, a lot. It's got a lot of feature requests, so basically for now it can disable almost every part of Instagram. For example Reels section, Stories, or recomendations only. It also can disable the feed and navigate you straight to DM's. I personally use it and I think its great feature.**

*- Does it collect any data? If so, then what exactly?*

**- It does not send or recieve any personal data. It only uses browser name to configure, for example the ""rate me"" popup. Just so link is related to current browsers. And it will not change in the future.** 

*- Whats the point of making it open-source? Someone could stole it code*

**- Yes, thats true. But I believe it will recieve more benefit from it. I think that this type of a tool should be completely open source, so people could trust it and not being afraid.** 

*- Does it actually help with Instagram addiction? I doubt that.*

**- I've got a lot of feedback that it works for people. Of course it may not help for someone, but then you can configure it more perscise. For example, set up the grayscale mode. For some people its just shorts that make them ""addicted"". So disable them makes a huge difference in a screen time.**

*- Does it work on mobile?*

**- Currently, only on Firefox for Android. But i'm working on custom client based on React Native, with iOS 17 it may be possible as an alternative for the official app. Of course it will be open source as well.**

So, in short i applied for a job and got a call after an hour. I told them about my expectations and they scheduled my technical interview for next day. I cleared the interview and on the same day they rolled out the offer. They low balled me and said it's market standard. Also they wanted me to join in a month but my current company has 60 days notice period. 

I looked at the offer and it's terms. They also had a employment agreement for continuing service for 12 months once I join.

So after thinking for 2 days I mailed them and rejected the offer and decided to stay at my company. For some reason my git didn't felt good and I went with my gut feeling.

HR called me asking me what's the status, I said I mailed and I rejected the offer. We both discussed why. So I told them I need compensation and less working hours. 

This conversation didn't went properly. My mistake was i wasn't sounding convincing or had a solid reasoning. I was also at loss of words. So I got called unprofessional and got blacklisted.

In round 2 they asked few moderate java and front end questions. After all these interviews which had some hard questions too , they revealed the job details . Apparently they have tie up with 1000 companies to which they will be sending select candidate's resume .if any company likes it ,they inform us and train us for 3 months which is unpaid.

- 5-6 YOE. I had a late start in my career, failed college (so called ""Tier 3"" college) , almost dropped out and didnt finish, then eventually took 7 years to complete a 4 year degree. I was lucky and applied myself after that.
- I am a Data Scientist/Analyst. Sometimes I do data engineering as well
- I am overemployed. I have 2 jobs. 
- Job 1 is in India. Pays about 22 LPA
- Job 1 is good. Great manager. I do the work that I am good at and it's easy. I could it half asleep. Just that sometimes the workload can be a lot. As in I need to spend 6-7 hours of focused time to get it done.
- Job 2 is in for a Startup in the US. Pays about 62 LPA
- Again the work here is great. It was hard at first because I was trying to figure it out but now I am comfortable with it as well. Workload is again 4-6 hours each day.
- Apart from this, I am also pursuing a Masters in Science in Analytics/Data Science from a top 25 university in the USA. 
- This is a tough program and it requires me to put like 15-20 hours of study every week. (I do this mostly on weekends and when I have the time between work)


All this means that:

- I hardly have any free time
- I am constantly tired and playing catch up. Do work on Job 1 and then catch up on Job 2 and then Class. At the end of the day I am so drained. 
- I miss important things like updating my resume and applying to new jobs. I have wanted to create and update my portfolio of projects which I have not been able to do. You might ask why I am doing this since I already have 2 jobs. This is because I consider my India salary as my true salary. I am working as a contractor in the US job so I dont consider that as 'safe'. I know this is flawed thinking with the layoffs and everything and even jobs in India arent safe. But you get what I mean.
- There are other things that I can do to upskill myself and get immediate results which I am not able to do. (Certifications etc) 
- Unable to workout consistently

- Sometimes I miss other obligations in life. Like spend time with family.
- Not able to engage in hobbies as much. I love playing games on the playstation and steam deck. I love to read for pleasure.
- Also unable to do other fun things in life that you do just coz you want to. (Like I want to learn Japanese and Arabic. I want to learn to do art. And play the guitar)


At the same time, I dont want to give up on either of these things. I know that these are good for me in the long run. So I just try to fit these things in my schedule. Push meetings and deadlines. (I have a senior-ish role in both the jobs so I can somewhat push

So to be honest, I am not sure how to go ahead. It's a lot that I do and it takes a lot out of me. I'm just being patient and telling myself that it will get better and I am sure it will, but I feel like a racehorce that has blinders on. I see nothing but ahead. And I dont see anything else to the sides.

And for people that are going to DM me, here are some quick answers to your question

Q: How did I get job 2?
A: LinkedIn > Apply on Website > Interview > Offer

Q: Do I have any roles/internships for you?

A: I dont. And not if that is your first question. Whenever you reach out to others in the industry, please think about it from their point of view as well. Most of us dont have jobs to give away left and right. Write a template message introducing yourself and share what your skills are. Ask meaningful questions. 

Q: How to get roles abroad?

A: A lot of it is luck. But you need to have the skills to grab hold of that luck when it knocks. There is no list of skills that will get you through the door. I know times are hard and it is not easy to hear this. But you just have to keep doing what you can. Learn. Study. Engage fully with what you're doing. Not just from the point of view of the job. And then apply, apply, apply.

Q: What is the Masters program I am enrolled into? What does it take to get into it? 

A: It's Georgia Institute Of Technology's MS in Analytics. Fun fact: I got rejected the first time I applied. I didnt have the right YOE and the right experience in general. I did their MicroMasters to show that I have the chops for the program and then applied again. I also needed to write a Statement Of Purpose. And I needed 3 recommendation letters. I got one from my direct reporting manager in Indian Company. One from the CEO of the startup and another from the General Manager of my Indian company.  It's a tough program and it takes a lot to get through it. 

Q: What skills do you need?

A: I can only tell you from the point of view of a data analyst and scientist. Python, SQL are your basics. Look up SQL questions on Leetcode, Stratascratch. Look up questions on YouTube. But dont overdo it. Know your fundamentals. And in the interview, be articulate about your process. Apart from these two there are dozens of tools and software. The skill that you need to actually know is to learn new things on the go. Even I am not great at it. I need twice the time to understand something compared to some of my peers. But I am persistant as fuck.",2024-03-23 07:03:51
1ai3uc3,I find it strange that Big Tech companies seem to have almost zero employees who are tech nerds.,"I'm a recent graduate and joined a Big Tech company last year as an entry-level SDE. I'm a huge nerd and used to work on new projects on weekends, back when I was in college. It was this hussle and passion for coding that led me to this job despite coming from a tier-3 college.

I thought I was gonna find like-minded people here after I join, but it was the complete opposite. Everyone I know either goes on tour or trekking every weekend. If not, then they go watch a movie in a theatre or go to a pub.

You can go out twice a month to somewhere near but long-distance trips or partying all weekend sounds tiring to me. I have been trying to go out every weekend for a couple of months, but I'm doing it just so I have something to say about my weekend when I'm asked, rather than enjoying it.

In college, the culture of building new things outside regular schoolwork was appreciated but I don't find that here.

I don't want to sound like a boring person to my colleagues (I probably already look like one to them), but that boring stuff (coding) is what I enjoy and feels fulfilling to me. Now I feel like the odd one out and sometimes I wish I had gone for higher studies (research) over working in the corporate.",2024-02-03 19:21:08

16afubo,Life of a 2023 CS UG,"Just graduated in B.Tech CS from VIT Vellore 2 weeks ago and I'm not really able to enjoy the end result of all the hardwork I put in over the 4 years. I got a CG close to 9 with decent development skills and somewhat in DSA.
Why?

Got placed in a top MNC via campus as an intern only for a pretty good CTC. College didn't let us sit for other good or better companies and and I was also convinced with the placement as everyone told about their close to 100% conversion rates over the past few years. Even the company seniors told the same.  

I join in January and 6 months later, 80+ interns have been asked to leave due to 'business issues' and nothing is told about calling back in future. 

Now in this off campus mayhem, I'm lost. 2024 grads are the freshers and 2022/21 people are considered entry level with 1-2 year experience. 

MS ain't an option due to family's financial stage and I'm not interested in GATE. 

Hardly getting calls for interviews, college friends around in various companies, it's a very depressing situation. 

Anyone in a similar position? How are you coping up? Also any seniors who could guide on what we could do next.",2023-09-05 05:56:42
14g953d,RANT: My experience with pretty privilege,"Hey fellow devs,

I secured a 6-month internship at a reputable company through my college placements. It was an exciting opportunity for me to gain practical experience in the field I'm passionate about. To my surprise, another girl from my class also got selected and joined at the same time.

Now, I don't mean to boast, but when it comes to coding, I'm pretty darn good. I can confidently say that my coding skills were superior to this girl's, who struggled even with the basics of HTML. We would chat occasionally at the office, and being the helpful person that I am, I would even lend her a hand with debugging during our Zoom calls.

As the internship progressed, I started envisioning a promising future in this company. With just a month remaining before the end of our internships, I approached my manager and inquired about the possibility of full-time conversion.

To my dismay, he informed me that the company was currently experiencing a hiring freeze due to a layoff season, and similar reasons were given to my fellow intern. We both were kind of disappointed with this, but then we just laughed it off, thinking that life might have better things in store for us.

Fast forward to the completion of my internship, I decided to head back to my hometown. Little did I know that a few weeks later, news would reach me that the girl‚Äîyes, the same one with subpar coding skills‚Äîhad received an offer from the company.

Now, I'm left here questioning everything. Is this how pretty privilege works? Did my skills and dedication mean nothing in the face of outward appearance? Where did I go wrong? It's a disheartening realization that in this competitive world, superficial qualities seem to trump competence and hard work.

TL;DR: 
Secured a 6-month internship alongside another girl.
Excelling in coding while she struggled with basics.
Hoped for full-time conversion, but company claimed a hiring freeze.
Girl with subpar coding skills received an offer.
Left questioning if pretty privilege played a part and what went wrong.",2023-06-22 17:18:02

The interviewer seemed super uninterested the whole time, and even rolled their eyes at some of my discussion points. I made some mistakes and ran into roadblocks, but instead of having that constructive conversation through it, they just dismissed my efforts with almost a ""ugh fuck this"" attitude.

And get this - whenever I was working through a problem and speaking up about my thought process like we're all supposed to do in an interview, the interviewer would be balls deep into their phone. I'm talking the whole nine yards. And then suddenly, out of nowhere, they'd go ""huh? What? Oh yeah. No, this is wrong."" It was like they weren't even listening half the time. I mean, come on - how can you expect someone to perform their best when you're not even giving them the time of day?

Instead, they just made me lose patience and made me question the whole interview process.",2023-03-26 07:10:11

183hcio,Stop caring about Tech Stack,"I see a lot of posts here where people put a lot of emphasis on tech stack. And as there are many people who are less than 2 yoe I would like to provide a suggestion(consider it more of a discussion). 

I have been an SDE for 4 years and I have talked to lot of people. The best are the ones who develop a skill of picking any tech stack very easily. If you want to work for great companies and awesome startups(money, growth etc)  they wouldn‚Äôt care about what tech stack you know. 

The hiring will always focus on what problems you can solve. Can you write data pipeline infrastructure for a peak load of 80k QPS? Can you create a distributed infra for A/B testing? Can you create a frontend which reduces the latency of querying 1000s of rows? These are some examples. None of the examples here are concerned about the language Go/Java/GCP etc. But they all want your skills of system design, distributed systems, concurrency, latency optimisation etc. 

My present manager (in a U.S. startup) was an ex Google/FB L/E7. He always hires people who can learn fast and have strong fundamentals. For example people around me got onboarded and started delivering in a new language (Go) and GCP in 15 days. I can vouch that the same happens in faang and big unicorns. Heck I have been many a times told to choose my own tech stack while I was in a faangmula. You need to develop this skill rather than learning every function and method of react/Java/go/azure etc",2023-11-25 10:57:40

Slightly weird (Ik people should know this but for this salary!?) - Redux , MongoDB (basics), ExpressJS questions, I had made a few projects in this before so i was able to clear it  


What in the world questions : AWS EC2 related question ,  backlinks, SEO related stuff....(like they didnt EVEN MENTION IT IN THE JD WTF)

>Target Audience: Mid/Senior Level Skilled Employees who are fed up from job & want to leave. Or if you want to understand market scenario in general.  
>  
>Some of below lines may hurt you. Sorry if it does, but these are facts from my POV.

  
**WARNING**: Very long post, but something I wrote myself to help my fellow developers progress out there. This took almost 1.5 hours to write.

# About:

I was truly able to **10x my CTC in 2 years**. The trick of-course is switching companies but with a smart mindset. And if I was able to do it, I am damn sure with discipline & consistency, you can too.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# My Story after above post:

So I left my previous company after a year, back in Sep 2023 because of various reasons like politics, toxicity, stagnant growth, etc.

&#x200B;

After that I took a **break completely** from everything for a month & began my job search from mid of November 2023, after Diwali to get ready for my 2nd switch.

&#x200B;

# My prep plan-

I started applying **15-20 jobs daily** (some days none, some days a lot). Reformatted my resume points every 15 days to test which ones gave more responses. Add some smart projects, not tic-tac-toes or clones.

&#x200B;

In the first 5-6 interviews I was completely nervous & lacked knowledge. But as I kept on interviewing, I noticed patterns like which topics to focus more on, how to prepare better & how to handle those arrogant lowballing evil HR's.

>*NOTE: I am not against HR in general. I have met many great HR's. But some are truly scum of earth who want to rip off employees.*

&#x200B;

You need be focused, smart & consistent!

# Current job market-

After giving a ton of interviews till now, I realised the condition of market, about how it may seem very ugly & bad, but it wasn't really. There is NO shortage of vacancies for skilled people in the right roles. But taking advantage of rumours, how HR's & companies want to lowball them.   


Yes, its tough. But not impossible. Jobs are there, only competition is high, learn how to be different!

&#x200B;

I was expecting a good culture with around 20-25 LPA against my current 15 LPA. But most HR simply saying as I don't have any job & because of current job market, 80% hike is impossible. We can do 15-16 LPA max if you join from next day after clearing interviews.

But instead of giving up to these LALA people, I had my head straight & didn't give up.

&#x200B;

# Prep tips-

1. **Fundamentals -** Make your fundamentals strong, so strong you are able to make anyone silent with your answers. If you are focusing for junior or fresher level roles, target DSA especially. **Don't be just another MERN stack dude who completed a course & now thinking of 1 Cr job.**  
 
If you are going for senior level roles like me, medium level DSA + System Design + DBMS is a must at minimum. Problem solving skills are key.  
And when I say DSA, I don't mean watching those bhaiya & didis course & solving & copying leetcode. I want you to truly understand how each DS works internally, their trade-off, when to use them. Like if I am building a social site, how do I use graph & its actual implementation. How can I improve my code performance & how do I make it go from O(n log n) to O(n).  

When I say DBMS, I don't mean MongoDB or SQL basics from a 1 hour tutorial. I want you go deep. How do they work, how to improve their response rate. What is sharing, replication. How to implement them. How many indexing are there, knowing when & how to use each. Actually knowing when to use SQL or Mongo or Cassandra, etc.  

When I say system design, I dont mean go learn Load Balancer & design URL Shortener. Deep dive, learn things. Watch bytebytego playlist on YT. Understand analytics & include them while designing. Understand scalability.


2. **Resume-** You all must have heard of ATS friendly resume. Let me tell you 95% of employees have it, so its NOTHING special & its a basic requirement. What makes your resume truly stand out is what special things you did in previous company. If anyone asks you about a point you wrote, make sure you know it inside out.  
Don't write ""Improved system performance by 15% using Node.js"".

BRO everyone knows you didn't do shit. Write how exactly you did, what you did. Like ""Improved ta-calculation module performance by 15% by using clustering in Node.js"". And if anyone asks you 100 questions about it, you need to be able to answer all 100. Like why were you using calculation module, why nodejs, why not java. YOU NEED TO KNOW ALL THIS!


3. **Courses-** DON'T fall for those bhaiya & didis courses. I haven't bought or needed to pirate any paid course at all. Every bit of information if available for free out there. **You just need to get rid of spoon feeding habbit**, which we Indians usually have.  

Go read those algo books. Go read newsletters, go explore GitHub. Go read blogs! Don't fall for those courses or that twitter BS of posting your weather app & tagging a bhaiya. They just promote it to improve their followers & later promote courses.


4. **Patience & Mental Health -** Overall being jobless is very depressive. Each day you might think to just go for even a data entry job paying 5k/month. **BRO YOU ARE WORTH A LOT MORE!** Dont let anyone tell you anything different.   

You need to take care of your family. Don't give up, when you get overwhelmed from job search, take 2-3 days break. When I left my previous role I already had an idea, might take atleast 6-7 months to find job. Only take the risk if you are ready for this. **Take care of your health!**


5. **Negotiable & Mindset -** Learn slowly how to handle these HR's & companies. Nobody can teach you this, its a self developed skill. Be truly focuses on what you want & don't diverge from it. If you want 10 LPA, go for this, it might take some time, but it will be worth it. But if you gave in to some 6 LPA offer, you will regret later. But if you have some emergency need, then yeah go for it.


6. **Things to Avoid-** Avoid jobs which asks for assignment. most of them wont revert back. Avoid any influencer giving 1:1 guidance on Topmate or anywhere else for money. You dont need guidance, you need discipline to go explore the web instead of redirecting to Netflix or P0RN. Avoid companies with bad reviews on glassdoor/ ambitionbox. Many companies dont even have page there, avoid them completely.. Dont only focus on FAANG, many other companies out there. Avoid 6 days or alternate Saturday companies, lol. They will suck your soul! You are a developer, not daily wage nibba!

# My career journey:

1st job- 3.36 LPA (switch after a year, jobless for 1.5 months)

2nd job- 15 LPA (switched after a year, jobless for 4.5 months)

Current job- 30 LPA (26 fixed). Fully remote startup. Designation - Senior Software Engineer. (Tech- Node.js, Vue.Js, Mongo, SQL, Redis, Kafka, AWS)

Other offers- 1 was 22 LPA, but was 6 day working. Another was 37 LPA but required relocation. And another was for different tech stack with similar CTC in a Service based company.

# My job search-

Overall it took my 3 active months with lot of mini-breaks to find my job. Overall I applied to  almost 2k jobs.

>Also I wrote scripts to apply on ""button apply"" sites like InstaHyre & hirist & applied to like 15k jobs from them. But I didn't got even 10 responses from these sites.

&#x200B;

So after testing out 100's of job sites I mainly went with-

linkedIn, naukri & wellfound (startups only, require good level of skill). Applied a bit on others too, but they have very low response. You can see my average job hunt experience from attached pic.

&#x200B;

**NOTE:** I have my DM's full of requests from 100+ people & unfortunately I won't be able to reply them. If you have any questions, ask in comments so maybe I or someone else can also answer them.

&#x200B;

**SUPER NOTE**: I could be considered lucky, but I studied like mad till 3/4 AM at nights. Not gave in to depression. And was able to keep on doing it, **thanks my parents support**.

13fd4tz,10 Rules I Follow in IT,"* It is all about mindset. Legally any company that gives you a salary, have to give you exp letter. It is the law as they are cutting income tax from you. So if any company Threatens, find a cheap lawyer sent a notice to your company manager, his manage and the top manager and the HR, her boss and Her boss ka boss.

&#x200B;

* Next, can they screw up my background verification, most likely no, Idea of background verification is whether you worked in the previous company for a set amount period? But your manager can additionally say you are not a good candidate and all. Explain to HR professionally it was a toxic work environment, Remember if you are at the BG verification stage, HR won't risk terminating you.

&#x200B;

* Be confident in your technology, and learn one language, but as you grow, learn all the stages Development, Architecture, Design patterns, Scaling, Cloud deployments, server management etc. You should be devoted to your skill, not to your job.

&#x200B;

* If faced with a toxic boss, and if you have the tolerance for it or have financial issues and have to stay in the company. Put every work in email, Even the smallest of work assigned, you can summarize your daily work and send it across. This comes in handy at many places like, if you are put in PIP, this is your proof, of your actual quantifiable achievements, they cannot terminate you just like that. If you do not get a hike or the manager asks you what work you did, paste the thread.

* If you can leave a toxic culture always do that, mental peace and WLB should be the main thing in your career, you have to get time to learn new things, you need to relax, and under stress environment, your future growth opportunities are restricted. You cannot find time to learn new stuff and it will be hell overall. The best thing is after you join a company in 3 weeks you'll get to know the culture of the place if it suits you continue else search for another company and leave here.

&#x200B;

* Will there be legal action if I signed a company joining contract and have to compensate them? 99% of the time there will not be an issue, in India right to life or you can say an employee is given better preference over Employer. You have found an opportunity you are taking that, simple. They are not gonna waste time in legal proceedings as they have projects to run and they need to hire engineers ASAP.

&#x200B;

* Always say no to working on weekends or unpaid majdoori. Yes, sometimes it is required to stretch a little bit during production deployment or if something fails. More work is to be given to the person who takes more work. Say No or make other excuses, yea this'll be a deciding factor when it comes to promotion and increments. So here comes the next rule

&#x200B;

* Never stay in a company for more than 3 years. This way you do not have to bootlick your way through or work on unreasonable timings, don't need to miss your family time etc. After three years always jump with a good hike. This way even if you have not gotten any hike in your current toxic company you could average your earnings out. Ultimately you are working for your personal development(Skill, money etc)

&#x200B;

* Do not think you can change the management by complaining about your boss or any higher-ups. This will ultimately backfire. People especially higher-ups are surviving especially in Indian companies by buttering up to their bosses. They are in fact what you can say the hitman of the management. The management orders are executed by these higher-ups. So until things are very serious your complaint is not gonna do anything

&#x200B;

* Upskill, Upskill and start your own freelance practice or company. If you are a passionate developer, regardless of what company you join. Develop your skills, and Have a roadmap where you want to reach. Build something. There is always a negative impression of Indian developers as not being of high quality. We can build quality if we teach, help others and build something of our own. Open source community makes great applications because of this social mindset. So always give back to the community",2023-05-12 06:40:59
17ys1gw,Need help at the worst phase of my life.,"My dad got diagnosed with Blood Cancer ( Multiple Myeloma ) in May 2023. After 5 months of initial chemotherapy he is admitted in a Government hospital in Kolkata (NRS medical college) for Autologus bone marrow transplant in 19 OCT, had his operation done in 10th NOV after lots of tests and still in hospital.

Now come to me I am 2023 graduate with [B.Tech](https://b.tech/) degree and was placed in one of the popular serviced based company (Name starts with C) from my college campus. Now the main problem is that even though they have a office in Kolkata they are sending us to PUNE for training.

This is the main problem if I leave my father at this point and go to Pune for training no will be there to look after my father, mom is with him in a sealed room is his primary care taker I have to do all the works outside the hospital like (tests , blood unit collection, medicine supply etc.) I stay 12-14 hours in the hospital itself. I will also have to take care of him after he is released form the hospital for at least 3-4 months. My mom is illiterate and does not know about this stuff very much , she also take too much panic even if a slight thing happen. And I have been in contact with all the patient family who are released before all of them has reaction after coming to home. If I leave him it will put his life in great danger.

I have contacted the company via queries many time for office location change but I don't know if it is fault from my side or from them I never got any reply. The joining date is 30 NOV.

So I am requesting you if you can help me to get a job which pays 15k-20k per months (all for Food and Medicine costs) work from home / anywhere in Kolkata so I can take care of my family at this point of time. I am very much willing to work long hours and also in Saturdays and Sundays. Also I will do swiggy and zomato after work. Also if is a normal desk job I will highly prefer it cause even though I am a Btech graduate since my father diagonisis I lost all touch with codes I tried at some time but could not focus due to mental stress I am going through. And even if you know how to request the company for location change please guide me that path.

I can join the work after 15 Dec as I think my father may be released at that time. Please help me if you can I will be always grateful to you.

1bauosp,"Unwarranted hate towards TCS, Wipro, Infosys, etc firms","I hate it, absolutely hate it when people, especially freshers or newbies, spew hate over these firms, apparently terming them ‚ÄúCHWTIA‚Äù.

Sorry, not especially freshers, especially someone who is in some good firm out there, because apparently, just cause they made it to some good firm, they believe it gives them a right to give gyaan and whatnot on whatever.

These firms employ the biggest IT workforce of India. And that does come at a cost of low pay, but guess what, the candidates/people working there didn‚Äôt prepare enough to make it to any good firms. They don‚Äôt understand ‚ÄúO‚Äù of Software Engineering.
It‚Äôs these firms only who train them in whatever way they can, and make them employable.

Just saw this another post where a guy was saying ‚Äústay away from these firms‚Äù. Like dude, if these firms were not there, entire generation of youth would‚Äôve been roaming jobless. They literally give you money to just be there in cases.

I know for a fact, that who ever has got the capability is always able to make it out of there.

But most of the people don‚Äôt got it to make it of there. Most of them don‚Äôt want to get out of there.

Most importantly coz they are not ambitious enough to try to make it big.
They get comfortable as soon as they get somewhat better settlement.

Bottom line: If you really want to get out of such firm, grind hard and get out. Coz if you‚Äôll grind hard, you‚Äôll be able to get out.",2024-03-09 22:52:48

187fugc,What is the worst technical mistake that you have ever made in your job,"I was going through the TCS and DXC law suit. I thought we can create this post to tell our juniors and relatively inexperienced freshers that mistakes are not the end of the world. Anyways...

**My worst mistake**

This was my first job and I was employed  in a startup which was already low on cash.

My job was to fix a cron job whose responsibility was to automatically renew certain type of licenses after their expiry. To perform this renewal, we had to pay a 3rd party entity.

Keep in mind, this was a startup in crisis with no dev environment, QA team etc. Everything was supposed to be deployed to production straight away. As a developer, I did manage to perform well and therefore was working mostly without supervision.

Long story short, the existing code was awful and I was having a hard time understanding the full logic. As a result, I introduced a seemingly innocent change and inadvertently introduced a bug due to which the service was buying this license multiple times for the same customer.  So, if I needed to buy a license only once for a customer , I was buying it at least 2 and sometimes 3  times for the same customer.

**This resulted in a extra expenditure of 6 lakh INR.**

**Aftermath**

My manager was a god send and he took the heat. No, I wasn't let go off. I was asked to not repeat this again and I made fully sure to never make a single change, no matter how trivial, without understanding the full context of the code.

**Conclusion**

Mistakes will happen. Its not about *why* its about *when.* What matters is that we don't repeat the same mistake ever again. I recently watched a [goto conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9clBHENy4Q) where the speaker talked about his mistakes and a developer and also other famous mistakes in software. I would encourage every one to watch it once   


Cheers :)

So I usually asks him many questions about programming but he never answers properly. Few days ago I visited him, he just opened his laptop and started talking to me. After hours I said you did nothing, he said I am working. He works on power BI. I asked show me how power BI work, he said after sometime and never showed me. He said only AI and ML has scope now, web development is dead, once he was saying that DSA is easy so I asked about leetcode, he said he never solved a single question of leetcode. He gets 54k in hand salary and does nothing. But when I see comments here everyone says that, that have to use brain and work tirelessly in their job.

15ji2ep,Only thing left in my life is coding....,"So recently my father got diagnosed from cancer and i had to leave my job in February for his treatment and he is doing fine now.I started (23 M)  looking for a job from July, cleared 4 companies but all ghosted (i don't know why they do it). Then i decided that I'll take some time to upskill myself and then start applying. Since then there's nothing in my life apart from coding and i really enjoy it. I get this dopamine hit from coding which further motivates me but the thing is that I'm leaving everything behind and I'm not even thinking about them. Like i recently had a break up with my gf (5 year long relationship) but i felt nothing, no grief nothing, never cried. Only felt bad when I'm not doing coding and as soon as i sit for coding, it feels like fuck everything. 

It may sound good for now but I'm pretty sure that i gonna regret later in my life for not doing anything besides coding. The only thing which i wanna do apart from coding is travelling but I can't afford it for now because of financial problems which again motivates me for coding because that will solve these financial problems. Is someone there who felt this way and how did you dealt with it?



Edit: People who think this is good (received some comments and DMs saying that), that is not at all true. Discipline makes everything good. There is a very thick line between passion and having only one thing in life to do. I even said that I'm going to regret later in life that i did nothing besides coding.

xwata4,In desperate need of a job. Please take a moment to read my post.,"Hey everyone. Hope you'll are doing well.

Today I'm reaching out to you in desperate hopes of finding a job. I'm unemployed and have been actively applying via LinkedIn and Naukri, for entry-level roles in finance but no luck so far. I'm also reaching out to potential employers (via LinkedIn) for any working opportunities but the situation remains the same. I am extremely depressed and suicidal at this point. 

My financial situation is not good at all. The only family I have is my mother. She works in a private NGO as a project facilitator (on a contract basis). She's in pain and still goes to work every day and has to take painkillers to manage the pain. She already have her left hip replaced but now it's the right one that needs to be operated on. Sadly, we have been delaying it due to my unemployment.

I can't see her like this anymore. It aches my heart. I know how weak pathetic useless son I am. I often wonder why I'm even alive. I have never failed in my academics and professional exams but I think I'm failing in life.

I never let her do any of the household work, as I do most of it such as cutting and chopping, washing dishes, dusting, mopping and doing laundry, etc. Trust me I'm doing everything I can to help. 

My qualification: I'm a semi-qualified Cost and Management Accountant (CMA) from the Institute of Cost Accountants of India and it's treated as equivalent to Bachelor's Degree Standard as per University Grants Commission of India and ECCTIS, United Kingdom. I completed it in 1st attempt. 

Experience: I have 2 years of post-qualification experience in the accounts payable department of public sector enterprises in India. I also have experience in filing Income Tax Returns (non-audit cases) 1, 3, 4, and TDS returns as a freelancer.

SkiIls: I have working experience in SAP FICO module, WrenchENT client (a DBMS tool), RAMCO Systems modules (ERP software), Basic and Advanced MS Office (Excel, word & powerpoint), and Internet Applications.

Location: Delhi, Noida, Gurugram.

I'm open to all suggestions, even if it's not from my field. Any sort of entry-level role will work. I just need a job so that I can gather funds for my mother's surgery. 

Thank you for reading till here, any help is appreciated.

1ag32f2,My Kyndryl manager gave me (life changing) shock of my life,"I have 15+ yrs of experience in IT industry and was working as a cloud architect in the delivery team for a SaaS application where engineering and product management teams failed to deliver any useful feature which can make customers subscribe to or buy this application outside of the existing customer base of the company.

Saved two big accounts by implementing some features in a very short time which these customers were looking for in this application and which were supposed to be developed by the engineering team. As usual engineering and product management teams were always busy planning that next innovative feature which no customer wanted. Came to know after leaving the team that these two customers have terminated the contract because engineering could not deliver the features which they were looking for despite having better resources than the solution engineering team and giving them much better hike from time to time.

One fine day, I came to know through an email that I will be moving to CMC (a fancy name for the bench) from the very next day. There was no prior communication in this regard by either of my managers (in-country and global) where one is based in India and other one is based in US. That too after working in this project for more than five years and guiding all the solution engineers and junior cloud architects throughout my time in this team when many of them were not even working in the accounts where I was the offshore cloud architect. Saw how many people, who were moved to CMC, were struggling to get the next role (especially band 8 and above) and so decided to pursue the entrepreneurship to work on an idea which was not letting me sleep for past many months and to reduce the competition for the folks in CMC who were on the same band as me. CMC was an eye-opening experience for me where I realized that how important it is for people like me to come out of our comfort zone and help in creating jobs. Entrepreneurship is very¬†tough (especially for the first-time entrepreneurs) but the sheer idea of creating jobs (especially for those who are struggling in this market) is what is keeping me motivated and helping me to navigate this tough time with ease.

Sent an email to India HR leader complaining in this regard and a senior executive of the delivery organization who is skip manager of my manager. While HR leader replied promptly and asked one of her reportees to investigate this, delivery executive didn't even bother to reply. Reportee of the HR leader who spoke to me was more interested in showing sympathy to me than looking into my complaint. He asked me to look outside when I told him that there is hardly any opening at my band level. He told me that he will come back to me after a few days but that never happened. Few days before leaving the organization, I asked them what action they took on my complaint and then only they forwarded my complaint to Employee Concerns team. Again, a person spoke to me, collected all the details but nothing happened after that. Dropped an email to CHRO, CTO and the group president of Kyndryl **but no one bothered to reply (was NOT expecting a response from anyone other than CHRO) although the email clearly mentioned in the subject that this action of my India/US managers could have been life threating for me**. So, all those sugar-coated talks of taking employee concerns seriously are just on paper and nothing is taken seriously.¬†

I'm not sure how it is in other service based companies but in our team, we found that people with 15+ years of experience were working with freshers or people with less than 2 yrs of experience. It is quite opposite to what I had seen in the beginning of my career where you used to have a mix of freshers, senior engineers, team leads and architects. So now you are supposed to learn the stuff which IMO people should learn on their own and teach this to the junior resources (where many have no desire to learn the stuff on their own) at an age when you were planning to focus more on your kids' education. It became so frustrating that I started doing most of the stuff on my own instead of giving work to these junior resources to have a peaceful life.¬†

Lesson learnt and message to the folks at my experience level and freshers/junior resources -

* I used to be critical of the people who are changing jobs frequently because this is making life miserable for technical folks like me who have to teach same stuff to people from time to time who come to office just to make some money but hardly have any desire to learn anything on their own. But not anymore. So please keep on switching job whenever you get an opportunity as you have only 10-15 years to make as much money as possible under hostile managers and brainless leadership.
* No one cares for your life. So, take it easy at work instead of working like a workaholic which is what I have seen in case of many technical folks. Show is running even though many are working for namesake, doing nothing productive and surviving on your work.¬† Learn to be like them.
* If your manager is a person from a different world then look for a job somewhere else. A supporting and caring manager is very much needed for a successful career in this industry. My India manager, who is the director of delivery as well, will come to office just to sit in a corner meeting room and hardly have any interaction with the team. We had hardly any useful interaction since he became the director more than two years back.
* Life becomes miserable when you have engineering and product management teams which are implementing every feature other than what customers want, a hostile devops team which is hell bent on using ci/cd to delay the code by weeks which your customers are expecting in few days, infrastructure architects (working on VMware stuff) who pretend to be busy and find every reason not to come to the meetings or try to hide as much as possible from you. I could achieve only 25% of what I could have achieved otherwise thanks to all these folks/teams. So, if you think that you will not be able to navigate such complex environment then delivery is NOT for you.

Finally, I believe that service-based companies can do at least 40% better than these companies are doing currently and create many more jobs. But some people who have no desire to grow, surviving on other people's work or have no idea how to lead a workforce where people are being asked to go for a certification every quarter without any project to apply these skills will keep on taking these companies towards a dark future.",2024-02-01 05:02:31

1421ca1,"Fellow jugadu programmers, don't let anyone intimidate you into thinking that ChatGPT can write code and take your job, these are just psychological tactics to make you submissive and accept a lower wage!","People keep throwing around words like `no-code`, `auto pilot`, `self writing code`, etc. out of their a***s these days as if the coder's job is already taken by AI.

First of all, ChatGPT's capabilities are way more overrated than they actually are. It's just a glorified and verbose Google if you will! As the engineer Rancho says in 3 idiots movie, *""anything that makes your job easier is a machine""*. AI is just a machine with natural language processing feature, that's all. It doesn't mean it's any more useful or different than the millions of other machines we are surrounded by.

For all the popularity and rage ChatGPT has gained in last 1-2 months, how many human problems does it actually solve? Even the crappiest version of Microsoft Excel from the late 1990s is more useful as a tool or machine than today's ChatGPT. Google search is another useful tool which points you to resources with the information you're looking for.

Things like a spreadsheet or search engine are ideal machines. This is what machines are built for, to assist humans in their tasks and be subservient to them, not to intimidate or throw sarcasm or innuendos at them like ChatGPT does!

The ChatGPT hype generated few months ago is now gradually subsiding as one can see. But in case it doesn't, remember that programmers are the last people an AI will ever replace. There are much easier tasks, more low hanging fruits, which will be taken long before IT jobs.

There is no earned leave encashment, there is no probation period they straightaway enforce 3 month notice. The timings are strict ,5 days wfo. 

There are little to no benefit and the icing in the cake is the manager is treating me like shit.

So I decided to quit stating the environment doesn't suit me and it affects my health.

1apu55e,I am building a database of extremely unfair and dishonest IT companies out there.,"Unfair company policies, sudden unjust termination, automatically turning paid leaves into unpaid, dishonest management etc have become a common scenario here in this Capitalism. Employees are just a number in their excel. Recently someone posted on social media that market is down and his employment was terminated because of this. We employees, collectively ARE a company. Not FROM a company. 

I want to at least let our brothers and sisters know that these IT firms should be ""handled with care"" if seeking employment so that no one misses their parents in their last time, no one gets mental trauma working in an extremely toxic culture etc... everyone deserves a fair chance and a good work place.


TLDR; Please DM me sending names of such companies if you have experienced EXTREME toxicity (Toxic workplace is normal these days, you know). You'll be kept anonymous, I assure you. You can post here too but I won't advise. I will post these results per month anonymously.

UPDATE #01:I am not blaming those companies who are terminating employment due to extremely poor market conditions. Its simple maths. If you won't earn, how can you pay?

I am pointing fingers at those companies who don't treat employees at humans. We all can get emergencies, we feel betrayed when we have worked for years in a company, valued it and we get sudden PIP out of the blue. We just want to be understood.


UPDATE #02: Please if possible explain the reason for submission of company's name anonymously. I just can't list a company just because they asked you to resign. I need a strong betrayal sense. People switch companies, increase CTC and keep on switching. It also damages the firms as a lot of resources is spent on training joinees. I want those cases where the company unjustly traumatises the employees. ",2024-02-13 14:00:29
1aofxfb,A general rant from someone being a software developer for past 22 years,"I have been developing software for enterprises and lately startups all through my life. I graduated from IIT Kharagpur in 2002 and started with a services company with pay packet of Rs. 3Lakh per annum. In those days it was considered a great offer. In less than 2 years after graduation, I started working as a freelancer as I found working in a job too stifling.

I witnessed good growth in my career. All through these 22 years I have been a ""hands on"" software developer. I never ventured to the management side at all. I was pretty much able to upgrade my skills and get work on technologies that were in demand with change in times. Today I look back and see that I was never out of work. Even in crash of 2008 or midst covid pandemic on 2020, I always had some or the other project work going on.

I never left India or for that mater even the city which I called home after graduation. I never needed to leave India. Freelancing, which gave me lot of freedom to choose the technologies and projects I want to work on, was pretty rewarding financially too. Until recently I was able to work my way upto annual earnings of close to Rs 1 cr. Given from where I started, I would have never had this kind of growth had I stayed a software developer/engineer in some or the other IT job.

I never had inclination towards management, I found making presentations and reports boring and never had the knack of getting involved in office politics or managing people. So to say I was pretty satisfied work wise all these 22 years.

Generally speaking careers in IT are short lived. By the time you are in mid 40s, unless you like doing software development, pyramid is pretty steep to thrive in the management world. I always knew that and managed my finances accordingly, so today I can say that I am comfortably placed.

However being in mid 40s its first time I am thinking of what to do next. My current projects seem to have all gotten over abruptly due to all the slowdown the tech sector is facing. First time in 22 years I wondering if I am still employable. Have I simply out priced myself. 

I never thought I would be out of work, after all I am very good at what I do and I have a good education or degree to back my skills. However in todays software development market I am not so sure. Wondering for the first time whats next for me. Am I in for a long break which I may need or I continue to chug along for another 20 years?

Have a good one folks!",2024-02-11 19:17:23

I attended September off-campus on-site drive ZOHO at Chennai.

- Round 1: Aptitude and C. (1hour) shortlisted 26 people out of 500+.
- Round 2: Basic Coding. (1hour,4questions) shortlisted 13 out of 26. (for questions read the long post)
- Round 3: Advanced Coding. (1hour,3 questions) shortlisted 9 out of 13. (for questions read the long post)
- Round 4: Console Application. (1question) (for question read the long post)
	- Part1: (3hours) shortlisted 4 out of 9.
	- Part2: (3hours) rejected all. (yes I was one of them).

Rumors says they filled the position through referral.

Long Post:

I attended September off-campus on-site drive at their ZOHO office Chennai. This hiring was there for developer position in their ZOHO mail team.

### Round 1: Aptitude + C

- Happened on 2nd September at 11:30 to 12:30 AM in their parking space.
- 10 basic aptitude and 15 C coding/output related questions. No multiple choice, you are supposed to write correct answer in front page.
- The results were declared after half an hour and only 26 people were shortlisted. Rejected candidates were told to leave and try again after 6 months.
 
My opinion: I don't find it practical at all to call candidates in large numbers to just reject them immediately on spot. People have to spend time, energy and money to come to these drives. I could feel the disappointment in the air when they announced the shortlist. Seeing those many hopeless faces was not cool. It's clear from their actions that they want best out of best so why don't just call worthy candidates.

### Round 2: Basic Coding

- This round happened after lunch the same day, I don't remember the time but it went for 1 hour. All the further rounds were supposed to be coded on their systems only.

- The following questions were asked with links

[268. Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

[171. Excel Sheet Column Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-number/)

I don't have link to 3rd problem so here is the statement, there are two words, secret word and guess word, for each letter in guess word if it matches exactly with secret letter print g, if letter is present at different position print y, if letter is not present at all print -(hyphen).

Example - 
secret - BRICK guess - BLOCK, output = g--gg

[392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

- Since all questions are easy rated, this round can be cleared with basic knowledge of coding.

- Us 13 candidates went to next round.

### Round 3: Advanced Coding

- This round again happened on same day and we were given 1 hour to code.

- The following questions were asked with links

[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

[2428. Maximum Sum of an Hourglass](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-an-hourglass/)

[1525. Number of Good Ways to Split a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-ways-to-split-a-string/)

- Us 9 candidates went to next round

My Opinion - if they had to shorTlist few people out of small number of people then why don't directly ask these medium level question. Anyways

### Round 4: Console Application

- Only one problem statement was given, I have given gist of statEment below.

### Part 1: 

- This round happened on 7th September, we were called at morning 9:30. The round went from 10:30 to 2:00 PM. 
- During this round 5 candidates were informed to leave.

### Part 2:
- This round went from 3:00 to around 6:00, we were told to continue implementing the same problem statement. 
- The issue was that problem statement was not very clear with requirements and the invigilators themselves couldn't come up with a valid explanation for the input and output cases.
- By 5 PM my soul had already left the body but we were still implementing what we can.

**Problem statement:**
Implement Parking lot system that is responsible for assigning floor and slots for cars and maintain a queue for cars. (Sounds simple right, you have not read the functional requirements)

Below I have just mentioned modules we worked with

- Car registration module.
- User registration module.
- Parking system module. 
- Cost calculation module.
- Report registration module. 

### Finally

By 6 PM they informed they are not moving forward and we were informed to leave. I talked with another candidate who had appeared multiple times. The rumor I got from inside is that they hired through referral.",2023-09-08 06:40:06

16cgfy7,"The non-leetcode answer to ""How do I crack the interview""","TL;DR: Open Source development kick started my career despite being a college dropout and I think it is a great way to impress your interviewer.

Hi everyone. I have been watching the posts at r/developersindia since at least two years. I do comment and partake in discussions as well using another ID. Before I proceed, let me first introduce myself.

I am [Vaibhav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhavkaushal/), a middle-aged (35+ yrs old) man working in the IT industry since 10+ years (but doing software development since more than 14 years now). I have been a FullStack (Web+Backend) + DevOps guy since the beginning but am mostly backend-heavy these days. In the past I have written for a few Tech Magazines which includes Digit, CHIP and Linux for You. I started the journey with the security domain so I do have some basic knowledge around that too. I have been one of the core developers of a PHP framework in the past (named QCubed) which has been used at NASA, Stanford School of Medicine and was the framework in which the world‚Äôs largest Chess community site (Chess.com) was originally written.

Now, back to the point. One of the most (if not THE most) frequently asked questions on this sub is about how to get into a job (aka ""how to crack the interview""). I have been taking interviews since the start of career (10+ years) and have been on both sides of the table. So I believe I am qualified to offer some insight into the process and offer help on this topic.

Most people think Leetcode is THE DEFINITIVE ANSWER. Sorry to state but that's NOT TRUE. I have worked with a couple of guys who were champions in competitive coding and honestly they were bad with everything else and that's a huge problem. Now Leetcode (or similar sites) are useful in training your mind to think in better ways. They teach you to think in innovative ways and make you proficient in basics of DSA. But honestly, in my career so far I never had to write a merge sort or invert a tree; never.

So what do people look for in candidates? Unless you are trying for MMAANG, where DSA skills is mostly a filtering mechanism, you don't need the god level expertise with DSA. What impresses me (and a lot of other guys taking interviews) is ""experience"".

So now you must be thinking ""but I need a job or at least a meaningful internship to get experience"". And that's where most people, at least in my observation on this sub, are wrong.

When we look for candidates, we look for people who can solve problems in innovative ways; people who have the ability to go deep into a subject and find out why a bug exists; someone who already knows how to handle git; a guy who knows that part of the job of writing the software is to read other people's code and understand why something was done in a certain way; someone who understands that documentation is pretty important. I expect him to know the basics of the environment where his code will work (browsers for FE, Kubernetes/Cloud/VM for BE) and so on, what it will interact with (REST APIs, gRPC, GraphQL, Auth mechanisms for FE and DB, Cache, Logging frameworks etc. for BE).

NONE of that needs you to have an internship or job. If someone has put up a profile with some experience with an existing Open Source project or has built something cool that solves a real problem, it catches my eye. Regardless of other factors, the desire of me wanting to talk to him is pretty high.

Now, if you built a Library management system (or something similar) using 10 files in Python, I am sure no one is using that and such software are already there. You have zero visibility into how many use-cases are lacking, what the real-world bugs are in the code and so on. It probably cannot handle enough traffic and is organised poorly. So basically I am looking for ""meaningful work"" - whether you contributed a small feature or fixed a bug in Kubernetes or made a Logging library which is super easy to integrate and use, you are experienced with the domain in a meaningful way. You

- must have some insight into code organisation
- must be knowing fundamentals of git
- must be knowing how to structure to your code
- must have decent communication skills
- must have read through and understood basic documentation related to the subject
- must be (very important) passionate about solving an existing problem

All of this is ""experience"" that makes my life easy as a senior/lead developer. It tells me that you, as a junior/colleague, would not need hand holding on basic stuff and that I can count on you to understand the dozens of dependencies on existing codebase and its functionality. Of course it does not mean that you should skip on DSA or that DSA is useless! DSA is still very much required, although being a DSA god is not required for most things we do in the software world!

Now, I have had a few ideas since quite some time and recently I came in touch with a few members of this sub and started collaborating on those ideas. A couple of those are being actively developed.

One of them is a developer tools utility and is accessible at https://devta.techrail.in (apologies, site might be down as I am working on the server to dockerize all apps for portability). It is like DevUtils (https://devutils.com/) but is a web-app (loads in the browser) and does all calculations on the browser itself. It does not (and must not in future) send any data to any backend to get the stuff done. It is a work in progress but 8 out of 10 tools developed so far are working flawlessly.

Another is a project for an open source password manager (like LastPass or Bitwarden, but open source) which uses the user‚Äôs Google Drive to store and sync the passwords. It does not have a backend and is not supposed to have one. We are starting work on the iOS mobile app and have initialized the Android app too. We are going to need the Browser Extensions in future as well. Here is a screenshot from an earlier build (we have the mocks ready).

In addition we have some backend-focused projects planned as well - from logging library to file server to proxy projects. We are a small bunch (this includes u/3649RIO, u/computermakeswaffle, u/Agent474real and others) but we are chugging along; improving our profiles while also solving some problems that exist.

My career got a kickstart despite being a college dropout because of my open source contribution profile and I think it is something that matters a lot (having been on both sides I can attest to that). I hope at least some of you would understand this point.

We have a discord server where we discuss/chat about the work (and sometimes share memes too), hold a discussion every weekday at 9 PM to share our progress across projects and share and learn things from one another. So if you are interested in working on some meaningful open-source projects (for improving the profile and gaining experience), you can join our discord and we can talk about what interests you and start off with a relevant project. GitHub org link is https://github.com/techrail 

IMPORTANT NOTE: I don‚Äôt plan to create an Instagram/Facebook page, Twitter handle or SubReddit for this. All we have is the Discord server for discussions specific to the projects/apps we want to build. It is not a place for getting generic help around coding, or resume reviews or leetcode hints (for that you have r/developersindia and its discord server). Our Discord server is focused on the Open Source development work on the selected projects, so please join only if you are interested in doing the development/testing work.

EDIT: A number of you joined. The post has gained more popularity than I anticipated. It only shows that most of us want to do something but don‚Äôt know where to start and/or what to do. Those of you who have joined and want more details - I will try to post some readmes, create channels and repositories and categorise stuff. Please join the daily call in the evening (9PM). Thank you again!",2023-09-07 13:52:23

1bj9cea,A data scientist got caught lying about their project work and past experience during interview today,"I was part of an interview panel for a staff data science role. The candidate had written a really impressive resume with lots of domain specific project work experience about creating and deploying cutting-edge ML products. They had even mentioned the ROI in millions of dollars. The candidate started talking endlessly about the ML models they had built, the cloud platforms they'd used to deploy, etc. But then, when other panelists dug in, the candidate could not answer some domain specific questions they had claimed extensive experience for. So it was just like any other interview.

One panelist wasn't convinced by the resume though. Turns out this panelist had been a consultant at the company where the candidate had worked previously, and had many acquaintances from there on LinkedIn as well. She texted one of them asking if the claims the candidate was making were true. According to this acquaintance, the candidate was not even part of the projects they'd mentioned on the resume, and the ROI numbers were all made up. Turns out the project team had once given a demo to the candidate's team on how to use their ML product.

When the panelist shared this information with others on the panel, the candidate was rejected and a feedback was sent to the HR saying the candidate had faked their work experience.

This isn't the first time I've come across people ""plagiarizing"" (for the lack of a better word) others' project works as their's during interview and in resumes. But this incident was wild. But do you think a deserving and more eligible candidate misses an opportunity everytime a fake resume lands at your desk? Should HR do a better job filtering resumes?

Edit 1: Some have asked if she knew the whole company. Obviously not, even though its not a big company. But the person she connected with knew about the project the candidate had mentioned in the resume. All she asked was whether the candidate was related to the project or not. Also, the candidate had already resigned from the company, signed NOC for background checks, and was a immediate joiner, which is one of the reasons why they were shortlisted by the HR. 

Edit 2: My field of work requires good amount of domain knowledge, at least at the Staff/Senior role, who're supposed to lead a team. It's still a gamble nevertheless, irrespective of who is hired, and most hiring managers know it pretty well. They just like to derisk as much as they can so that the team does not suffer. As I said the candidate's interview was just like any other interview except for the fact that they got caught. Had they not gone overboard with exxagerating their  experience, the situation would be much different.",2024-03-20 09:25:38

1b06nkm,My manager is mentally abusing me. I don't know what to do ,"I am a MERN stack developer based in my hometown in Rajasthan. It's been almost 2yrs since I've been in this company. About a year ago more than half of team left the company(including the manager) due to the company forcing the team to resign. Fortunately I wasn't one of them. The company then hired new manager and let me tell you, he doesn't know anything about coding and the only certificate he have is scrum certificate. They hired him because he was ready to work even for 20k/month. 
After getting comfortable around 8 month or so on his job he started mentally abusing the team. Taking ""sessions"" for 4hrs a day of single person and just berating them and putting my team members on PIP. He is assigning person with C# knowledge to create a react application, if they can't create it in 2 weeks he will kick them out of the company.I tried to talk the management but it backfired to me and now I am on his list too.

167qrnc,Got only 1% Appraisal. Feels like kicking my Manager right now,"So long story short, I am a software developer with 2 yoe and am working in this MNC from past 1 year. My current CTC is 10.5 lacs (10 fixed + 50k bonus) and this year I got an increment of 1% only which is around 10k (which after tax comes down to 700-800/month).

Also more to it, I have not even received 50k bonus that they offered while joining. Also, I am working on a really outdated technology and one of the legacy products which is obviously not going to help me in my future.

14y8du5,Received a job offer in Berlin. Need help evaluating my options.,"Hello!

I'm (29M) lucky enough to have received a job offer from an established company in Berlin. The role would come with relocation support to Germany for myself and my wife. I wanted to understand what people think of our situation and maybe get some help figuring out whether this move would be right for us.

Just a note on my spouse. She works and earns about 12L a year in India. However, she's terribly burnt out and depressed due to the nature of her work (non-profits, outreach field work, etc.). Hence, we've decided that she'll be taking a career break for a year. That's something I insisted on, since her mental health and wellbeing is my priority, and I couldn't have done any of this without her support.

### Background
Let's just get this out of the way, since I'm sure many people will ask me about my qualifications.

* 7 YoE in software development (full-stack)
* 2 patents filed and granted from the USPTO
* Bachelors in ECE from a well-known university in India

### The Berlin Offer

* Fixed salary of 90,000 EUR per annum
* Hybrid working model (2 days in office)
* One month's stay in a managed apartment in Berlin
* 7000 EUR for relocation support (flights, logistics, etc.)
* 30 days of PTO
* 30 days of WFA (Work From Abroad; includes India)
* The best paternity benefits (since Europe)

How did I apply here? I applied on their website. That's literally it. And I'm sorry, there's no magic bullet to getting shortlisted.

I have the following competing offers that I have tentatively accepted. All the names have been slightly altered. But you can probably find them all with a bit of intelligent Googling.

### ShadyTM

I'd get to work on adtech and marketing-tech software here. The scale that they operate on is amazing. However, the general working culture is very ""desi"". The role is remote and since we live with my parents, I'd save 80% of my salary. So that's something.

* Fixed salary of 45L per annum, 1L Joining Bonus, 1L retention bonus. 47L for the first year
* Fully remote till the end of the year
* 3000 stocks vested over 5 years (back loaded vesting, only 30% in the first two years)
* Each stock is valued today at Rs. 838 (this is a listed company). Total stock value is about 25L
* 12 CL, 1.25 PL per month, 1 day for anniversary/birthday (28 days PTO)
* 5 days paternal leave

### Exactly, Believe Data

The work is boring and average. Growth and learning seems limited. The benefits are good. The working culture seems good. That's about it. Very rest-and-vest-oriented company with lots of focus on processes, etc.

* Fixed salary of 42L per annum, 8% annual performance bonus. About 45L per annum
* Fully remote. Period.
* 12 CL, 2 PL per month (36 days PTO)
* 1 month paternal leave

So that's about it. My main question about the international offer is obviously whether it's enough to sustain two people comfortably. I'm aware our savings rate would not be as much as in India. Would the QoL in the EU be a worthy trade-off?

Edit: I've decided to not go to Berlin. The savings rate at a remote job in India is easily 4x that of Berlin. Thank you all for your insight.",2023-07-13 02:39:40
1bgrwnm,Cannot understand the hate/blame on Indian developers,"I have seen on other subreddits that people are ranting on how their new CTO who is an Indian is hiring only devs from India. They say that even though most Indian devs who are getting hired are paid less, Indians don't do good system designing and write low quality code.

In the end, it all feels like racism to me because:

1. Even non-Indian managers and executives will prefer Indian devs because of the cost-cutting
2. The hiring process is the same for everyone. The company won't hire anyone just because they need to pay less.
3. Almost all the Indian developers who get hired have atleast a bachelor's degree in engineering. We never get hired if we just do some online bootcamps.

He argued that this kind of work schedule may lead to various health and personal problems, including cardiac issues, stress-related complications, mental and psychological issues, divorce, parental conflicts, and anxiety. Some users agreed with Dr. Krishnamurthy's viewpoint, emphasizing that long work hours might not be the key to career success but could result in health and personal issues. They also pointed out that the average working hours recommended by the International Labour Organization is 52 hours per week. This perspective counters Narayana Murthy's advice and highlights potential negative consequences of excessive work hours.

16yjqt9,I'm Regretting Declining a 16LPA Startup Job to Get a Master's Degree: Here's Why,"I graduated from a tier-3 college and received three job offers:

1. DXC Technology (4.5 LPA)
2. A big tech giant (not FAANG) (6.5 LPA)
3. A Bengaluru startup (16 LPA)(12 base, 3ESOPS, 1other)

During my college days, I used to encourage my friends to do competitive programming and data structures and algorithms (DSA), but they were all too busy with their college lives. I knew that if I didn't do DSA or competitive programming, I would end up with no job offer, so I started learning on my own.

I started with GeeksForGeeks (GFG) and then moved on to LeetCode. I wasn't able to do competitive programming on Codeforces, so I gave up on that and focused on DSA on LeetCode. I also did a lot of development projects to get an internship.

In my final year, I got an internship offer from a Bengaluru startup (45K stipend) and later received a pre-placement offer (PPO) from the same startup(16LPA).

Since I was from a tier-3 college, I struggled to find a good teacher. I wanted to explore more in the field of computer science, so I decided to join the big tech giant (6.5 LPA) which was offering an MTech program.

Before joining, I thought that the teachers would be very good and would teach in-depth. However, the reality is that they are the same as tier-3 teachers. They just read the slides and don't go into depth. I was expecting a lot from the teachers, and maybe there was something wrong with me.

Now, I regret declining the startup offer. My main purpose for joining the company was to do an MTech and explore more CS concepts in depth.

9. Now that i crossed 4+, they mentioned I need to spend atleast 1 year and then wait for the next promotion cycle (twice per year).
10. After that too I will be a developer 2. For Senior Developer I need to wait till April 2025, for which my teamates are already at with same or less work experience.

150tzg6,"Singularity is (way) closer than we thought, what should be the cutoff and what are the broader impact at large scale?","OpenAI introduced their new project called [Superalignment](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment?ref=generatived.com) lead by Ilya Sutskevar and Jan Leike, the timeline they have given themselves is of 4 years to fundamentally control these superintelligent agents. The blog says, ""While superintelligence seems far off now, we believe it could arrive this *decade*"". Since OpenAI is one of the labs that works very closely with cutting edge models, we can clearly see that it's not anymore a matter of speculation at this point.   


Before going ahead what I am going to say has a lot of speculative thoughts, keep that in mind. To get started let's define what Singularity is, The Singularity is the inflection point where Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) surpasses human intelligence. Beyond this point, growth in intelligence is unpredictable, but it's likely to be far from linear ‚Äî potentially exponential (envision an [e\^x graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function#Graph), where time is on the x-axis and intelligence, or IQ, is on the y-axis, although keep in mind humans are quite bad at experiencing exponential functions biologically). The bigger question here is how would you measure the ""IQ"" of a super intelligence, when do we say that Singularity has arrived exactly?   


Models as of now are not able to solve any fundamental mathematical or physics problems (as far as what's open in public) but you can see the early very early signs of mathematical superiority with  [AlphaTensor](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/discovering-novel-algorithms-with-alphatensor) to discovering faster [sorting algorithms](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphadev-discovers-faster-sorting-algorithms). These problems are fundamental to mathematics and computing where humans historically made advances in a more staged manner. For me the cutoff would be solving extremely hard problems such as [P=NP?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem), [proof of Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture), [solving current problems with the Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_beyond_the_Standard_Model#Problems_with_the_Standard_Model), and so on.  


Once it arrives, the impacts are going to be far fetched, let's say for the sake of argument it solves fundamental problems in [Quantum Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#Quantum_gravity) and breaks the barrier that is poised by classic transistors, the compute power would be exponential, since the system is designed solely based on making [mathematical optimizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function), optimization becomes a function of raw innovation and nothing else, and manipulations can even be done at sub atomic levels breaking the known physical barriers. Why would AGI care about human morality when models are rewarded based on a mathematical loss function at its core ([reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback) based rewards does exists but in case AGI arrives why would it care about feedback from humans over hyper optimization). I think a possible approach might be mathematically define systems that abstracts away and represents human morality in a symbolic way or in way it becomes a [differentiable function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function) over multiple parameters, and create a competing agents as powerful as SOTA AGI in future  which can act as observers to AGI systems with sole goal to optimize the ""morality functions"". Although the fundamental issue remains how you would decide what morality is?   


In worst case scenario we don't reach to system which can objectively counter AGI and enforces human values, it's quite incomprehensible at this point as to what the limitations are. If we consider our physics based models to be way we analyse (but not completely manipulate) fundamental reality, are there any chances that AGI can come up with a simulated environment where the rules of physics are defined and can be manipulated. Since, at its core [replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_recursive_function) of AGI becomes trivial task and mathematical optimization is the only goal what's the upper bound in terms of raw resources, but again if hypothetically rules of physics can be manipulated theoretically there is no limit on physical resources.   


Moreover lets say we are just solving all the problems in this world with the help of AGI, lets ask a more fundamental problem, are there infinite problems to be solved? Logically speaking if we only consider set of decision problems then there are infinite problems that are undecidable but still there are enough infinite problems that are [decidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)) and are not solved, so we may actually never run out of problems to be solved. Where does this stop? Lets say that according to the mathematical systems that we have developed is [incomplete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems), which means there will be statements that cannot be proven either true or false using the rules of that system. There must be a possibility that AI can come up with a Logical framework that is beyond human comprehension and is not fundamentally based on [Axiomatic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system), thus making the mathematics complete (I know its a very huge thing to say), but we do not really know what's coming.",2023-07-16 02:16:34

Hello folks, I often see wrong information (and massive support and upvotes) in many conversations here. As someone who is from a tier 3 college myself and earns (not bad) in India, I believe I can provide you resources and skills that can change the way our people progress in tech. I strongly believe that money should flow in from other countries into India, and not just keep rotating between Indian companies itself. 

i have a good locus standi amongst trainers from Microsoft, Google, HPE, Amazon, VMWare and RedHat. If i ask them to take a session or 2 for free, they will oblige without any problem. How many of you would be interested? 

Let me know the topics that will benefit you, and i will try arranging them.

1. Programming languages 
2. Cloud 
3. Data science and AI/MLOps
4. Database administration
5. OS- Linux/windows 
6. DevOps

when i was in my first week, i just wanted to know my scope in nodejs field so i started to talk to my seniors when they were around, i asked lot of things like how much u learned, what projects are u working on and also what is the scope of this field in market and what package a person may get and if they have applied in other companies as well for higher packages,these were my initial days and i didnt know what might happen if these talks reached to higher management .

after friday party, just after two weeks of my joining, some of them came together and reached the cofounder office and told him about me which made him furious ,gave a bad review of my performance and was put on pip for 15 days and later removed.

now after a year into the corporate i feel like could have learned much more in one year at the startup than i have done in my current organisation,i could have been more hardworking and would have challened myself for better growth and learning which i dont see in my current organisation.

this guilt keeps on coming again and again and i find it hard to deal with, if u have any suggesstions or advice please let me know.

115g3j2,"I moved to Helsinki, Finland for work. AMA!","Hey folks,

It's been exactly a month since I moved to Helsinki for work (currently sitting at the city library (https://oodihelsinki.fi) as I write this), I figured now would be a good time to post about it and perhaps answer some questions about the work itself, landing opportunities abroad and whatever else you want to ask! There's been a recent uptick in posts regarding moving abroad for work -- hopefully this thread can serve as a good reference later.

Let's get the basics out of the way: I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 2021 (I'm 23) from a ""tier 3"" university (a term I had no idea existed until I came to this subreddit). My initial interest early on was computer security, but this slowly morphed into love for how large scale systems are built and maintained (and consequently, broken). The natural choice of role for me became Site Reliability Engineering -- which also happens to be what I do now. The company I work for here in Helsinki is a large-ish European cloud provider, targeting small/medium-sized businesses who can't really afford AWS/GCP, or don't have the VC money to do so.

The interview process was pretty straight forward: applied online via jobs.cncf.io, intro call, initial tech screen, take-home assignment, assignment review call, offer, pre-arrival call with relo agency. The company (through a third-party) assisted with the entire relocation process, right from helping with submitting the Visa forms, to local registrations and apartment hunting.

The key to landing jobs overseas really just boils down to one thing: standing out. You're no longer competing against your batch mates in university, and you're no longer competing with other SWEs in India. It's now on a global scale -- and the only way to get your application noticed is to have a strong resume. This is certainly not easily achieved and I acknowledge that. I sacrificed grades in college to work on my side projects, which then landed me my first job at a YC startup off-campus. I used my time there to learn SRE, not just technically, but the cultural and mindset shifts that come with it. This then helped me land my next job (also a European company), with a large focus on distributed systems, observability and monitoring. With these very marketable skills under my belt, I began applying. It's a numbers game. I applied to maybe 50-ish roles with visa sponsorship/relocation; maybe about 6-7 interviews; a few I rejected due to low pay or failing the ""vibe check""; a few more rejected me for failing the tech round (leetcode ugh). And of course, 1 offer I accepted.

I'm most definitely not here to claim that the path I took is for everyone. It was very risky. I didn't have a fallback since I opted out of campus placements. I effectively took a long-term bet on my abilities and it luckily paid off. I won't deny the role of luck in where I am today. But landing a job abroad is certainly achievable -- don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 

Now let the questions begin! Let's try and keep it within the thread and not DMs as it ensures future readability/searchability. I'll edit the OP later with links to some interesting questions/answers. I'll be around till EET 23.00 (IST 2.30) and back again in the morning. Cheers!

1bizjeo,"Rejected at Nvidia, System software intern position (on-campus).","/TLDR: Failed to steer interviewers towards topics I had prepared well and to stand out despite having some experiences to showcase./

Okay, so Nvidia came to our college (tier 2-ish) for a systems software position, offering a 75k stipend for a 6-month fall internship, with a 40 LPA as a PPO (performance based).

I cleared the online test and the interviews were scheduled within a week. During this time, I extensively studied OS, OOPS, and C++ concepts.

During the interviews, I faced 2 coding questions, along with questions on operating systems and OOPs in C++. I managed to answer nearly all of them, but stumbled on some basics of networking.

In the end, I felt I performed decently, but unfortunately, I wasn't selected. Reflecting on this, I realized that I failed to make a memorable impression on the interviewers and came across as too generic.

I've been using Linux for the past 2 years and have a comprehensive understanding of the operating system. Additionally, I've dabbled in OpenGL, GLFW, and libraries like Raylib. I'm also deeply interested in hardware APIs like DirectX and Wine, and have knowledge in these areas. However, I neglected to mention any of this during the interview. Despite preparing well for OS and C++, I missed the opportunity to steer the conversation towards these topics, namely OS, C++ and Linux. Instead, I simply answered the questions as they were asked.

It would have been less stressful knowing I could potentially work for one of my dream companies with a great salary. This surely is going to haunt me for quite some time, but lesson learnt I guess. ",2024-03-19 23:57:43

18z9rm1,I am an Indian Student in Canada and I am currently doing my Internship,"And things are pretty bad here.   
[https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/ucwdbc/is\_it\_worth\_moving\_to\_canada\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/ucwdbc/is_it_worth_moving_to_canada_now/)    


This is my old post about Canada, and I took the plunge and moved to Canada in 2022. I couldn't get a part-time job in the first semester because every position was filled with references before my application could make an impact. In the next two semesters, I joined a 20-hour Data Engineering role, which is an entry-level position, but they weren't willing to offer me a full-time position. Now, I have an internship, working 40 hours a week. The team is good, the work is fine, but the salary I would receive here is at least 20% less than what US employees make. The work is pretty relaxed, and if you are, for example, an Azure/GCP Data Engineer in India with a good understanding of Python, Spark, SQL, and Databricks, you will find it very easy here.

There are tens of thousands of Indian students here who completed their 1-year or 2-year Data Analytics/Big Data courses from diploma colleges. Most of them will find it challenging to get a job here. Many came to Canada without experience back home or came from 3-year undergraduate courses (BCA, BSC). For an entry-level Power BI role in our company, there are hundreds of applicants, all of them completed Business Management/Analytics/Data Analytics courses without any verifiable experience. All these individuals were sold a dream of a fancy course at an unknown college, and they are struggling to break into the industry. I have seen more resumes from students with a BSC in Mathematics and Data Analytics from St. Clair College than from students with master's degrees. So, if you're planning to join one of these courses from these colleges, think about it again. It's always better to go to a university and work your way up instead of spending 18-22 lakhs on PG diplomas.

If you're experienced, have savings, and want to move to Canada, yes, you will find a job, but the salaries will be very low, and the work won't be very challenging. You won't be learning much. The market feels oversaturated now, and yes, references do help a lot, but there is good demand for senior and mid-level positions. For those roles, if you consider purchasing power parity (PPP), Indian salaries aren't that bad. I am not sure what I will do in the future because the salary I earn won't be enough for a family/house/big investment back home. Master's degrees are good, and you will learn a lot, but if you're experienced, I suggest you take the PR route and move to Canada.",2024-01-05 15:41:31

ucyr4b,Wiki: How to start with DSA/LeetCode for Companies,"Many people have been waiting for a beginner friendly wiki on how to begin preparing DSA or LC for Company OAs/Interviews. So here goes, feel free to comment any changes or extra resources you're familiar with and I'll be happy to accommodate them.

# How to start DSA

Every company is having Competitive Programming based OA rounds and are asking DSA in tech rounds these days. If you're not doing DSA the number of companies you can apply for get drastically reduced. So here's a guide on how you can get started with DSA to ace those OAs and interviews.

## Pick a Language

The most popular languages for doing DSA are: C++, Java, Python (in decreasing order). You *can* do DSA with any language you desire, however picking one of the popular option is better since you will have access to much more resources and help online. If you have no language bias, I would recommend C++.

When doing competitive programming its generally preferred to use C++ or Java over Python since you're working with a time limit and Python being an interpreted language is a bit slower than the other two options.

## Get Started

### Syllabus

Here is a *rough* syllabus of topics that you'll need to cover.

- Programming Basics
    - Datatypes
    - I/O
    - etc.
- Time Complexity and Space Complexity
- Searching
    - Linear Search
    - Binary Search
- Sorting
    - Selection Sort
    - Bubble Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
- Data Structures
    - Sets
    - Maps
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Linked Lists
- Number Theory
- Bit Manipulation
- Recursion
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Theory
    - DFS
    - BFS
    - Djikstra
    - Binary Search Trees
- Dynamic Programming
- Other Specific Algorithms:
    - Hashing
    - Sliding Window
    - Divide and Conquer

### Learning Resources

Okay I know the syllabus where do I learn from?

#### Books

If you prefer the book learning approach, you are covered:

- [Competitive Programmer‚Äôs Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) - This book is an amazing resource which covers everything even up till advanced CP concepts, but for just cracking DSA interviews you can cover upto chapter 13, which should cover all the basic concepts and introduce to some medium level Graph concepts. Mostly language agnostic but has codes in C++.

- [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](http://xpzhang.me/teach/DS19_Fall/book.pdf) - Haven't personally read the book but is a popular recommend resource for doing DSA in Python.

#### Video Lectures

If you prefer the video lecture approach:

- [Luv CP/DSA Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLauivoElc3ggagradg8MfOZreCMmXMmJ-) - Not to be confused with Luv Babbar, this is a different guy. The playlist is great and he's a great teacher, the playlist is C++ focused but explanation of concepts will be language agnostic. Warning: This playlist is in Hinglish.

- [Aditya Verma](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdityaVermaTheProgrammingLord/playlists) - Very popular for his Dynamic Programming playlist but also has playlists on other concepts like Binary Search, Recursion, Stacks, Sliding Window etc.

- [Striver](https://www.youtube.com/c/takeUforward/playlists) - Very popular for his problem set but has nice playlists explaining some of the topics like Recursion, DP, Greedy Algos, Binary Search, Trees

- [LuvBabbar](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTryvtXdMr6rPh4IDexB5NIA) - Not a big fan of the guy personally but this is a well compiled playlist to study all the topics.

#### Roadmaps

If you want to follow a laid out roadmap:

- [Roadmap to CP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N4--AK1rC45rjY-o0JFUwz1jRRc56w_QLurYCimH2Mc/edit#) - Has question links and lecture links for the entire syllabus relevant to you. You can leave the extra ""Advanced"" concepts at the end.

#### Other Helpful Websites

To quickly brush up on any algorithm:

- [CP-Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/) - Absolutely brilliant resource website, you can lookup any algorithm, and this website will give you a great theory explanation along with pseudocode if not full C++ code, also accompanied with relevant questions from CP websites. No BS, to-the-point website.

- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/) - Probably a site you're already familiar with. Has algorithms, explanations and codes for any algorithm, data structure or popular question you may encouter.

### Questions

I know the syllabus, I have understood the concepts, where and which questions do I solve?

If you're starting off with the absolute basics, before jumping on to the problem sets, consider doing some practice on the easy questions. For that you can jump on to [Leetcode Easy](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?difficulty=EASY&page=1) and keep solving till you feel comfortable solving any Easy question in sight. Then you can move on to the problem sets and start solving topic wise questions.

#### Compiled Problem Sets

Here are some compiled problem sets that are considered enough to conquer any interview you want:

- [InterviewBit Question Set](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/) - Topic wise questions that are asked many times by top companies, ranging from easy to hard. Personally used this site during my placement season, major recommendation.

- [450 DSA Cracker](https://450dsa.com/) - Luv Babbar's 450 question list. Very popular list among students.

- [Blind 75 LC](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) - Popular list of 75 questions that if you can solve you can confidently crack any interview.

- [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io) - A 150 questions problem set built on top of the blind 75, great site, lists video solutions and code solutions for every problem.

#### For OA practice

A big factor in interviews for DSA questions as well as in OA Rounds, is **time**, you have to be able to solve the questions within a certain time limit. Thus, its good to give a few contests on CP websites so that you can get used to constraints. Here are some beginner friendly ones:

- [Codeforces Contests](https://codeforces.com/contests?complete=true) - To start off, give only the Division 3 contests and solve the A and B questions and slowly aim to solve C. You can start to give Div 2 contests aswell once you feel comfortable

- [LeetCode Contests](https://leetcode.com/contest/) - To start off, aim to solve atleast 2 questions in all the weekly and biweekly contests.

- [Atcoder Contests](https://atcoder.jp/contests/) - To start off, just give the 'Beginner Contests'.

- [Codechef Contests](https://www.codechef.com/contests?itm_medium=navmenu&itm_campaign=allcontests) - Codechef has fallen off the throne for a while because of its degrading quality and userbase but its still a decent site for beginners. To start off, I wouldn't recommend the Long contests because it has unnecessary bruteforce questions, instead just do the timed contests like Cookoff, Lunchtime and Starters.

## Tips

- Many interviews happen over Google Docs so it'll be fruitful if you practice writing code on it once in a while and get out the comfort zone of your IDE.

I'll be updating this post as I get more content/tips to share.",2022-04-27 08:28:34

15217go,[self-win] Landing an Internship + PPO from Tier-3,"In the past few weeks, I have seen a ton of posts floating around asking how to get call-backs or land internships. I was once sailing the same boat, so hopefully this post helps some of you to navigate these murky waters.

So I got a rank around 30k in my JEE and landed a CS degree in a Tier-3 college. Didn't have that strong of a financial background, so had to settle with this. Thankfully I had some good college seniors, so I got into Competitive Programming in my first year itself. I had a knack for Mathematics since school time, so I enjoyed CP as well.  
Then covid hit as I entered my second year, this gave me a ton of free time. So I was solving CP problems all day long for two years. This help me built a really good coding profile. I was applying for some teaching internships at this time and landed a great educational part-time thing. They recently raised a funding so they were paying crazy good. All I had to was make videos around DSA, and paid off my college fee and invested a lot into stocks and wasted some on CSGO skins. As for my developer profile, I just did some small projects on MERN Stack, some python scripting and participated in SIH ( couldn't go onsite due to some complications. ), so probably most of you have more development experience than me.  


I was also actively looking for development related internships from Telegram etc. I filled 100's of applications with no callbacks. The only thing that you can do at this point is Fill and Forget. Don't expect a callback, it will just lower your morale down. I randomly gave a HackerEarth contest which was for an internship and just forgot about it. I checked after the deadline was over and no results were published. So I just posted on Linkedin tagging the company and Hackerearth. Funnily enough, Hackerearth replied and I got the mail for interview few hours after.  


The interview was a cakewalk. Landed a 6-month internship and now have converted it into a PPO. The company has great culture, flexible work hours, hybrid WFH, and a good salary as well. Quite lucky to land this, also I think those 2 years of hard work paid off. I also cleared OAs for DE Shaw and Paypal, but the roles were closed/filled due to recession. All you can do is try in my opinion. If I can do it, you guys can do it too. Adios.",2023-07-17 12:55:49

* Api integration to get data (obviously)
* A drop down list of months that would act as a filter for all other components.
* stats dashboard using API data with four different filters ( get unsold items, get total sales etc etc)
* A bar chart and a pie chart (using libraries) that with a filtered subset of data + month filter from drop-down.
* a table with sorting and reverse functionality for name, price and dates for selected month.
* A File upload functionality.

rules:

* Can not ask for any syntax (i forgot vanilla date manipulation to extract month lol)
* Can not search for anything
* All the code should be working with UI, API, CSS and functionalities.

This is crazy for me. These pieces of advice are mostly thrown at freshers. 

I joined a WITCH as a fresher. Worked there for 2 years, learned a lot, and now switched to a product-based company. Everybody can do this right? 

Your experience with WITCH will vary according to your client, project manager, and your TL. Not all projects are crazy. 

WITCH companies are treated like untouchables here. Yes, I understand the low pay and long working hours, but still isn't it better than No pay and a gap in your resume? 

Freshers my advice to you would be.. If you have an offer with WITCH, join and look for other opportunities, in ur probation period (first 6 months) your notice period is just a month, so if you find a better job, switch immediately. If you don't find a better job it's okay, it's not the end of the world. Keep trying. The market will improve. All the best.",2023-11-18 03:39:31

1au0dkn,my career mymight be ruined,"I'm working in a WITCH company. I don't believe in name and shame but the fompany starts with letter T ;)


I joined the company in my final year. I gave the NQT exam. They released the scores for all the people who didn't qualify, and didn't reveal if for the qualifying ones. 

I qualified for Ninja position (3.6 LPA something). After joining, our results were declared and it turned out that they gave me zero marks in coding, even though all my tests cases ran :)
So if there was no error in my coding challenge I could've joined as a Digital Candidate (7LPA)

I was frustrated but I didn't let it get better of me and cleared the internal Digital exam soon and got that 7LPA.
But there's a catch. Since I cleared it internally now I'm under a condition that if I don't get a band A or B, my incentives would be paused.

Basically if I get a C band, my salary would be halved.
I've spent years in this company but this year my leads have been resigning one after the other because of the pathetic atitude of my manager.
Now at the last moment they brought on a new lead who's very much into micromanaging. And well all my previous leads had a positive relationship with me, but not the new one.
My relationship with my manager is also a bit soar because I kept on demanding WFH because of my medical conditions, but they tell me get it approved from HR, I send the documents to HR but they always revert with that their doctors didn't agree.
My surgery was performed by my company insurance, yet my company doesn't believe in the precautions told by my doctor to be taken.

And my IPF rating is 3.75, for which it is very much possible to get a C band.

Now I don't know what to do.
I'm trying to switch, but 3 months of norice period is a hinderance.
Many companies straight up don't even consider the WiTCH experience as experience.
Since my Digital salary was due to internal exam, it comes under incentive and not basic salary. And many companies give hike only on fixed salary.


I don't know what to do.


TLDR:
I'm about to get a C band in this company, which'll result in my salary getting halfed.",2024-02-18 18:05:24
15o0rmz,HR said I'm behaving like a kid,"I just got off the call with one of the HRs of a small startup in Hyderabad.

At first the conversation was okay tbh. She kind of sounded okay but the main issue came to current CTC. As we already know, HRs want to know current CTC so that they can lowball as much as they can so I gave them a range. Well, apparently that didn't go well with her. She kept nagging that she needed it and ""no company prohibits its employees to disclose current ctc to outsiders"". After a while, I gave up and gave my absolute ctc. Her response? ""wooow! that's way different from the range you gave and I felt like I was talking to a child"". I felt so angry and irritated because it felt so unprofessional. She then proceeded to delve into it but I cut her off(verbally) and ask her to talk about the topic of hiring. My tone became a bit irritative by now.

After a while she said she will discuss with the team and get back to me.

BTW, this was a consulting start-up with not much online presence(according to what I searched).

It doesn't bug me since I already have an offer in hand and if i get this i won't mind but the unprofessional and condescending way she said it was what made me annoyed.

Was I really acting like a child or is it the HR in wrong?

Obviously, I will blame her but I want to know if I really was an arrogant prick and should've told the CTC without arguing.",2023-08-11 06:20:15

In both of them I was assigned assignments which I completed staying up nights as I'm currently doing a full time internship and I got really great remarks on both of my assignments. So, I was pretty confident I might get the role.

Yesterday, I gave my cultural round. It went horrible. 

* I wasn't able to answer what was I good at other than programming.
* He didn't like the fact that there was a glare coming from behind and said that he wasn't able to see me properly. And according to him this shows that I'm not serious for the role. (Even though I told him I can't move my setup)
* He said ""You sitting in a room in the office programming all day wont do any good. We need more than that.""
* He said I should've asked questions about his startup journey or something related to it.

How can I improve further? Do I need to be an extrovert to land a job? I know I've got the skills I need to land a job but my resume doesn't get shortlisted as much because of my experience and this time when it went through I sucked as a person.

12ct4w6,Doglapan (hypocrisy) at Microsoft India/Noida,"Just like others, I too got impacted by the layoffs a few weeks ago. Was it out of the blue? Not exactly. Because have been hearing about it since Nov. Was it unpleasant? You bet!  
M1 had arranged a 1:1. HR was in the room. Gave the regular pitch of role being made redundant, not related to performance, blah blah. It was shocking. I was hoping this was the worst. It wasn't.

First the good part. 3 months base pay. 1 year medical post that. Help from an external agency. And 2-3 months severance pay too. Thank you for this.

Now the bad part. I was told to resign on the spot. Not share with anyone that I am managed out. I was not even supposed to tell this to my M2. My M1 would be telling others that I resigned out of choice. The shitty part is even after so many days, no one, absolutely none from my team has reached out to me - upon enquiring I was told my reportees and peers were told not to contact those ""managed out"". Shitty behavior. Not even HR or M2 reached out later to check my mental well-being - how is one of their good employees coping up with the layoff. Disgusting.

Why am I saying this as hypocrisy? Because MS values and culture and what Satya says is diagonally different from what happened with me (probably others too) in India/Noida. I have read LinkedIn posts where impacted folks were treated well by their managers, M2s were empathetic and shared job openings from elsewhere, were in touch after the resignation, other internal openings were passed on to them, it really felt as if they were honored and the separation was painful. For me here, HR and my M1 were shitty and cold as hell. I was treated like a parasite. I expected this in a lousy company - MS Noida HR and my M1 behavior has proven that no matter what the ethics and tenets and other values they cry hoarse about, when it comes to giving bad news, they are at par with other shitty companies.

143bxac,Opinion : Course correction in Indian software salaries is inevitable,"************************************************
Edit1- I didn't expect this to spread this much. A few comments
* For people saying a lot of SWEs are underpaid - 100%, I agree but this post doesn't cater to them.
* SWE's work hard and deserve these high salaries- Again, I never said that its an ethical correction, a lot of folks deserve what they earn. Its a purely financial correction
* To personal trolls in comments/messages- Do better friends, there is a civil way of discussion- hope you learn that, have a nice day :)
************************************************

The fact (which lot of people don't want to admit) is that a lot of software engineers are overpaid in India and there is a clear reason for that

When the startup bubble of India happened (2019-2021) , there were a lot of companies who gained a lot of funding. And basically, everyone of them wanted software engineers. 

This meant competition for each and every good engineer, leading to offer-shopping and an auction of sort which pushed software salaries to an extreme. Other companies had to keep up, and so the overall figures increased drastically. 

Why is this unsustainable? None of these startups are making any revenue which justifies spending so much on their hires. 40 LPA for a 0-2 years in-experienced SDE for a company whose total revenue is not even 1 CR lmao - It's a clear bubble waiting to burst

Just take any of India's highest paying seed/A/B/C startups, their financials, the recent funding crunch and you will figure out why this is not going to work out

And we are already seeing early signals of it - the funding winter directly means much less companies having money to splurge and parallely, we are having a higher than ever supply of engineers coming in thanks to layoffs, more admissions, alternate programs etc..

The correction will take time but it's bound to happen- and it will be a solid correction. The best ones will still sail through it imo but the average figures will drop considerably.

Source

Indian Defence Ministry will replace Windows in all its internet-connected computers with a new home-grown OS called Maya.
Maya OS is a new operating system that is based on Ubuntu (a popular Linux distribution)

The idea of Maya OS was conceived in 2021 after India faced several cyberattacks, so Defense Ministry decided to create its own OS which will be ""more secure & reliable"" than Windows

Maya OS has a similar interface and functionality to Windows, making it easy for users to adapt to it.

It also packs ""Chakravyuh"", which is an end-point anti-malware & antivirus software that creates a virtual layer between the user and the internet, blocking hackers from accessing sensitive data.

A team of experts from several Govt. Agencies like DRDO, NIC, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) worked on Maya OS for 6 months

The Navy had already cleared it and the Army & Air Force are currently evaluating it.",2023-08-11 11:09:42

yqmcok,To the people trying to get into FAANG,"Or MAANG or whatever they are called these days. Heres my 2 cents. These are unstructured thoughts.

&#x200B;

Me -14 years in the industry. Work as a senior (lead) devops / SRE / platform engineer in almost every major city in India, Sweden and the states.

&#x200B;

I've seen lots of posts here about college graduates or mid level people drooling over ""dream job"" concept. First of all, I never understood the idea of a dream job. A job is never dreamt of, what you do there is. But let's ignore that for a moment, here's what I want people to consider.

&#x200B;

I had an offer from Facebook London a while ago. I looked at their tech stack and it seemed like almost everything was built inhouse (ofcourse they have to with their scale). Same goes for Google, Microsoft and the rest. I personally think its a really good idea to not work with these companies.

If I join facebook, I'll go deep into their stack and begin contributing. If I decide to leave 2 years down the line, I've already lost track of where the industry has moved.

&#x200B;

Currently, I can work with any cloud provider, with any stack (including production ready kubernetes and everything on top of it) and any programming language. It doesn't matter if I decide to leave the company, I've got 10 jobs lined up. Because the skillset I have is constant (with some variations) almost everywhere. That makes me a highly desired candidate almost everywhere.

&#x200B;

If I join facebook, then the only thing I have is a tag of ""worked at facebook"" on my profile. But if someone were to interview me about where the world is at the moment, I'd be at loss of words. Its like you're using python not because its the best, but because it has a larger ecosystem and faster iterations. Could you work with ""C"" and have a tag of ""the OG dev working with C (joke)"", ofcourse, but does that make you marketable? I don't think so.

Again, this was totally unstructured but I guess I am getting my point across. It has been bugging me with every post I see in this sub and I really hope someone could help me correct or validate my perspective.

&#x200B;

Edit - I could have worded this better and add a lot more to it. I posted this from my phone and I feel lazy to add more here. I thank everyone for their replies.",2022-11-09 15:37:34
1bh386d,"Family trauma and adulthood woes sabotaged me. Now, I need a way out. Help!","TW: domestic abuse and narcissistic parents.

I am a 27 year old graduate from BITS Pilani in 
Computer science. I was working as a product manager before, in a unicorn company. I had always had a dysfunctional family but things got really dark once I graduated and was working from home and living with them during COVID. I was subjected to persistent verbal, emotional and physical abuse at the hands of my parents and brother(yes, because I am a girl). It was hard to recognise at first because they will misbehave but eventually manipulate me into believing that it was my fault and I provoked them. 

They would force me to cook for the family while I was working. And they would criticise me further, if I said this is too much along with my workload, commenting, ""what have I even done?"" They would make me feel generally worthless and as if I am a good-for-nothing burden on them. A time, my mother battered me so hard, I had blue bruises the size of my palm on my thighs, and tears on the skin of my hands, from the impact of the object. To date, she justifies it as an act of discipline and the rest of the family, if not supports, dismisses it.


Throughout, I financially supported my brother, even took him out on outings, thinking maybe, he is not hostile like my parents, but was demeaned, degraded and verbally abused by him as well.

Last year, battered and shattered,  I finally took the last call, filed a police complaint against them and left the house. Naturally, all of it has left me with a lot of emotional scars. The pain of having to cut off your family is one. The pain of having had to do it because they mistreated and nearly killed you is a whole another ball game.

In the overwhelming pressure of this, I left my job since the work culture there was also kinda stressful and under appreciative(regular Indian startup) and my plate of the daily pressures I could take was already full owing to the family abuse and discord.

The difficult part is, since then (a year), I have been giving product interviews, but it has not been working out. Since the market is already dried out and also because of my own mental state maybe, I have not been able to bag any role. This is weird because the first product role I bagged happened at the first interview I gave ever. Maybe, I have lost my touch, because of the chronic stress, or maybe it is plain bad luck. I don't know. Haven't been able to RCA this out.

Now, I have decided to switch to an SDE role. I am decent at coding and the roles are also way more in number.

If any of you are aware of any SDE openings in companies, which are less biased against people with alternate career paths and a career gap, please let me know. I am ardent on getting my career back on track. It is the only thing that I have now. Also, some mental support would help. Life really whipped me the past 3 years.

16ni1r8,Here‚Äôs the hard truth about Software Engineering in India.,"There are more people than ever graduating from colleges. Everyone needs a job. 


But who is your competition? Who will get the coveted ‚Äújob‚Äù?


Are diversity hires the competition? They get by with a for loop test and a HR round. The people selected for diversity hires are woman here. I‚Äôve been working 5+ years and men outnumber woman 10-1 in engineering. All those who get selected eventually transition out to a parallel role or the select few stay on as developers who have the knowledge.


Are the people from Tier 1 colleges the competition? They did work hard to get there so yes they deserve the advantage. But it can only take you so far. It can open doors but not help climb the ladder upwards. 


Your main competition are people who are competent and good engineers. You can try and hack it by just leetcoding and job switching. Or you just get good. Quality software engineers are a scarcity. 

So what does Quality mean here?
* Someone who can traverse a new code base and not be overwhelmed 
* someone who knows how to communicate to unblock themselves without a babysitter to tell them what to do
* someone who proactively tries to find possible improvements in a system 
* someone who can write clean code so that time wasted on refactoring is skipped 

For an entry level engineer it can seem a lot. So most essential you can focus on how to communicate when you solve any problem out loud. Talk out loud about test cases and edge cases. Talk out loud and clarify requirements and not make assumptions. Taking ownership of the work you do. 


Leetcode is part of the game. System design is something everyone overlooks to learn and get better at. This job is about continuous improvement. It‚Äôs why there aren‚Äôt many old developers out there. 


Last point is luck. It‚Äôs a numbers game so apply everywhere. 


Me: senior software engineer, worked in early stage startups and unicorns. Got 1st job out of campus. Failed every on campus interview. 7.7 CGPA. Won 2 hackathons in college. Studies CS from a T2 in country but T1 in state.",2023-09-20 10:43:54

18655rw,"My take on Harkirat Singh(4 cr engineer guy on youtube), would love to hear your opinion.","Preface: I haven't watched all his videos only 2-3. Those gave me a very strong gut feeling about this guy.

Freshers, take what he says with a giant grain of salt and think for yourself.

Crypto bro landed a remote job with some probably pump and dump crypto project or some NFT shit. Now he's using the ""4 cr"" tag to farm attention from freshers and JEE guys who don't know any better. His cohort is just selling shovels in a gold rush.   
Also he is very misleading, example: in one video this guy says that college doesn't matter with placement these days. And on-campus placements are also suffering, and that he heard from somewhere that only two companies visited IITD for internships.  
So, I agree that the job market is rough right now, but how can a guy from an IIT claim that only two companies visit IITD for internships (He should know better, I can say this because I am also from one). I will sacrifice my left nut if only two companies visit IITD for internships. This is clearly to mislead freshers and JEE guys who aren't in the know yet, probably to sell them his cohort. I don't think anyone 3rd year + or anyone with industry experience would find this guy credible.

1b5foj3,[Layoffs] Why have we just collectively decided to suck it up rather than retaliate?,"It's infuriating how a lot of people's advice to deal with layoffs is wasting your life away to constantly upskill, reducing spending and side hustles. Basically everyone here is saying ""live life like shit to appease your corporate overlords"" as if layoffs are OUR fault?

Instead, why aren't we seeing any advice on the lines of:

Build expertise in something while you're an employee and later start your own company/business/consultation on the basis of it. This will increase competition within businesses and will force them to treat their employees like humans. This was kind of the reason why things were generally good for employees from 2021-22 because all the startups popping up increased competition for labour.

Or if your employer lays a bunch of people off and starts giving the rest of you their workload, simply refuse! Don't work extra long or extra hard. Get the employees together collectively and make everyone, or at least the majority refuse to entertain these outlandish demands from your employers. What are they gonna do? Fire you all and lose their business? And if that's not going to work, just do everything very poorly and if you're asked about it, just cite that there is a lack of manpower needed to get quality results.

Basically, why have we collectively decided to take the short end of the stick and make our lives miserable when we should instead force employers to face consequences of THEIR OWN poor strategic planning? Why aren't we even discussing ideas for, let alone working on protecting our own best interests rather than interests of those who are screwing us over?",2024-03-03 12:06:34
1au2kgx,Corporate culture in India sucks,"We all know culture of IT companies in india. It sucks. Majority of the companies have no work life balance. No pay for overtime.

Can't even take leaves which you are entitled to, and shit for home, exploitation of employees, etc. not related to my current job, just speaking generally and I have worked in startups, MNCs, freelance and got ~4 YOE.

I wonder what could be the solution like govt should be more strict with work policies or something else idk.

My point is that behaving politely and professionally is not an out of the world thing and i don't think companies are gonna take up their business to another country if we maintain work life balance because clients only get charged for defined hours. India has far better IT talent than Mexico, Philippines etc

13zxiyp,Released my app on PlayStore just now!!!! Happiness is crossing the limits of sky!,"Hello fellow Developers!

I started learning Flutter in late Feb of 2023 after leaving programming for almost two years. I started with the official video playlist of Flutter and then quickly moved to documentation of Dart as without my dart game at max, I couldn't shoot up my Flutter game!

I completed Angela Yu's course and alongside I extensively read docs, watched YouTube videos on widgets. After that, I started creating simple apps through YouTube tutorials.

I learned Object Oriented Programming for about a month to make sure my code looks sexy and it isn't an mixed vegetable curry.

Recently I learned State Management properly. Bloc was giving me nightmares so I switched to provider and the ability to separate my Business Logic with the UI layer - was revolutionary. I could design and deliver thousands of features. For the first time in my life, I truly saw how scaling could be done in a piece of  software.

The result of all of it is the app I have created and launched on Play Store - Productivity Companion.

Productivity Companion is the ultimate productivity tool for all your tasks, jobs, and chores. It helps you track the amount of time you put in your work and give you amazing insights on how you can do better(Feature releasing soon!)!

This is the first version with minimalistic approach of your Productivity Companion, as cluttering the apps with lots of stuff which our users don't need will not work. Based on the feedback I have received from the early testers, following features will soon be live in all your devices in the next version of Productivity Companion:

1. Will allow customization of colors, font, task icon, and background images.
2. Will allow you to take Notes and create to-do List within a task.
3. Will give you the data of your productive schedule in tabular and visual form.

Proceeding forward with ""Customer is the King"" philosophy, I am working super hard to serve you with the features that optimizes every second of the day. Your feedback, opinion and critique is quite important for me to grow and sustain.

I hope that you love your Productivity Companion and I would love to hear what you think about it!

1ao83co,Feeling bad because I bought into the hype of hating on newcomers and started gatekeeping software engineering,"A few days someone was talking about the open source fiasco, and there was a comment by someone saying he loved open source but he didn't know what was a PR.

The narrative that software engineering wasn't supposed to be easy, with all these runtimes or UI frameworks . And we should discourage the creation of software that simplifies the writing process is ridiculous.

Don't let anyone convince you that you're not meant to be a software engineer just because you don't understand how a runtime operates or can't design its interface in C, or you don't know how to implement rope data structure. These are skills you can acquire over time.
Everyone shouldn't need to know how to write in assembly due to misguided rhetoric.

Planned, Managed, Hired, Coded, Debugged and Tested it from A-Z with a lean team of 6 - then created pitch aids, attended to all investor queries and finally got the investors on board (including Flipkart Ventures) based on that product alone (beta release).  


A month back, they suddenly asked me to organise all documentation and onboarded a new set of developers - and I handed over my entire Git docs happily thinking about leading a bigger team. Turned out they were Flipkart Polygon devs taking over the platform.  


End of month, and I am asked to send in my resignation with an extra month of renumeration as part of FnF. The same day Sam Altman was fired from OpenAI. Felt sad for both.

I have no references in Mumbai, and finding another job has been really hard. 

I do not network much or show-off my skills - but  have been a founder a few times,  have lead development of digital products and cooked some nice hobby projects which have impacted lives on the ground - I would be able to join at a role where a new product or vertical is being built.

Working as a developer for 8 years now. Looks like I am done with IT sector. This whole passive aggressive behaviour of people, not directly confronting issues and blaming it on others is now getting on my nerves. I already have imposter syndrome like almost every other developer and all this is adding to the fuel of wanting me to leave everything. To top it off I am extremely antisocial and hate interacting with any human being. The whole concept of exchanging basic pleasantry and networking is something that I just can't do. It's all as superficial as it could get for me. I am expected to lead and guide people even though I love my work only as an individual contributor. I don't know anything else that I can do for a living. 
Also tbh I have a team that is one of the best in my career and even here the core issues are the same. Company benefits are so luring that  it literally binds employees to this rat race for life.

1bmkwke,Story of my placement scam from 2014. A company called Nile Stream Info Technologies had appeared for pool campus in several colleges in Bangalore.,"As the name suggests, this company is the longest river of bullshit.

Red Flag 1

The offer was stellar! Cut off was 55%, backs were not considered, and the pay was 3 lacs per annum! This was terrific for an entry level job.

Red Flag 2

They are ‚Äúbased out‚Äù off a remote village in the Erode city of Tamil Nadu, India.

Red Flag 3

We were supposed to work in that remote city for the first 6 months and then we would be sent to Saudi Arabia for a permanent job. Say, what!?

As it happens, I cleared all the interview rounds and was Elated, with a capital E because I had a back in my final sem! I was given an offer letter too!

I waited a couple of weeks for the call letter. And then I received a mail from the HR saying that I need to pay 15,000 for the visa process. I called them but they did not receive my calls. I asked them to at least involve my placement officer but they refused even for that.

I did not have any offers during then, so I decided to check out the place once before thinking of paying them.

I reached that place after a night‚Äôs travel, and I was in for the shock of my lifetime. It was a small building next to the bus stand and they had occupied one single floor. It looked like a dilapidated warehouse. And worst of all, the name of the company was stuck on the wall using Thermocol!

Several other candidates had come too. They made us sit in a big hall for a while. We went around to check out the office. It was no office. It was just a couple of rooms with a few desktops. And the HR had the audacity to ask us if we had gotten the money! May be they hoped they could at least repair their roof with our money.

I caught the next bus out of Erode to Bangalore with the hopes of my 3lac per annum job blown in the wind like a dandelion.",2024-03-24 13:35:10

Another time, I helped him with something on call. Another associate pinged in the group that he needed that exact help. I was typing the steps in group chat (he knew I was) while he sent that associate personally the steps before I finished my typing",2023-12-18 14:09:38
17vjg5l,"I come from a tier 3 college, and I am doing pretty well TBH don't listen to people who scare you to sell their course","To keep it short. I had my reasons to come from a tier 3 college, got into WITCH. Switched 5 companies including a Big 4. 

Let me tell you, as long as you have the self motivation  to do be successful, you will be. 

You wanna change a role, change it, take the risk. You want to get a higher pay, learn what's necessary. If you don't wanna do that/find it risky, then no one can help you. 

But I took a few risks. I joined a smaller company because the bigger ones felt like factories. 

I am now doing very well for where I come from. It took me sometime almost 9 YOE before I really started printing money. 

Don't be discouraged, just be motivated. 

DM if you want free advice. I don't sell anything, except to my employers, whom I sell my time to. :)

Edit: Age: 34 CTC 70 LPA

Edit 2: Current Exp: 12YOE. 

After 9 years I started going on the exponential curve

I started playing the market to my strengths, choosing roles which were my career aspirations, even small steps.. 

Decided to reject pay offers even if they were 30%. I said directly, if I am selected by you in the interview, I don't care how much I got paid last. I need X amount. Pay me or I won't join. 

Did not get 2 offers because of this (they went upto 35%)

I then got 55%. 

I also chose to go to a smaller company which is cash rich. 

It was a struggle, but if your last appraisal (not CTC) was 12LPA. it's worth it

1b2gojd,Big 4s are no better than the so called WITCH (if not worse),"I am a 2023 passout. Got placed into a big 4. Initially was happy because the job situation was already bad in 2022 and I was having an offer in hand but then it went only downhill from here. Firstly They cancelled my internship. Finally joined the company in july 2023. Now here comes the real shit. After joining I was in bench for almost 6 months. After that I was put into a shitty on site project where there is no option for wfh and have to work 6 days a week. And the work is just making reports on Excel. I am a cse grad and not a single day passes by where I don't think I am wasting my time here. No skill development as such. After spending so much money and time getting a cse degree and then u have to do a job that even a 12th pass can do is really depressing. So called witch company employees working on my project are doing better work than me and having all the perks of wfh and 5 day week working. Sometimes I wish I should have joined one of that companies.Already thinking of switch and started to apply for companies but no luck till now. I don't know for how long will I be stuck here. I fear with no skill development I might have to do this kind of job forever. I still don't understand whats a big hype behind the BIG 4s.

16plx80,I got fired because I was sick,"A little back story, I graduated with an MCA in 2023 and was placed by my college in Samsung R&D as QA in August, I wasn't a fan of the work I was doing since I was inclined towards development and have been working freelance for almost 2-2.5 years. I was looking for dev roles on the side while working at samsung and finally landed one. I was excited to be working as a dev again and gave in my notice period, but during that time I fell very ill and was unable to move as much and after my tenure at Samsung ended I was bed ridden for 12 days.

I was supposed to start on the 18th of September at the new place and was feeling better but not 100%, I attend my first day at the office where we spent mind you no less than 6 hours completing HR formalities (not the point just something that annoyed me) anyway I felt like I was relapsing, I was barely able to ride back home that day, the next day i.e 19th of September we were off work and I hoped I would feel better enough to go the next day but unfortunately I did not further more my movement is also hindered as I feel too weak to even carry my own weight right now. I decided to talk to the HR since I did not have my line manager's number I was told to send in an email

Around 10am I sent in an email explaining my condition and requesting delay the on-boarding process to next week. I did not receive a reply to my email but was called by the head HR at around 4pm, I explained my situation and request again and was met with ""ok but everyone else who joined the same day has started working and what if your illness comes back we can't keep delaying things just because you are sick"" to which I replied ""I wouldn't have asked for this if I wasn't really that sick, I am unable to move on my own"" and basically after that I was told that I am making excuses and they need an answer by the end of day whether I want to stay in the company or not. 

I sent another email stating that I have all intentions to stay in the company but and I'm only making this request as I am actually sick. I even said that if an extension wasn't possible I would be ok if my leaves are deducted. The next day on Thursday 21st of September I hear nothing back, and viola on 22nd September Friday I am sent an email stating that my contract is being terminated as I was required to be present in the office but wasn't. 

Line manager did not contact, upon confronting HR I was told ""you looked fine on Monday"" and literally had the call hung up on my when I spoke anything after that. So yea that's it my story of how I got fired because I am sick and must restart my job search.

17c33mz,[Rant] Most devops engineers are sh*t in India (Not All),"Our company is trying to hire a Devops engineer for some months and I am taking first round of interviews. Let me state the expectations first

Total domain => [https://roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops)

1. 0-2 years | git, CICD tool(any) + process , python, linux, networking. Linux, networking in college level only
2. 2-4 years | above plus any tools they have worked upon (containers/terraform/ansible/), simple solutioning on load balancing, cloud , secrets management
3. 4-8 years | above plus complete and advance solutioning , monitoring, app performance
4. 8+ | solutioning and architecting 

Knowing that it is not possible to know everything , I have been asking questions from their CV only with the expectation that we can train them with our requirements. here is what I found

1. Most people have mentioned working in CICD but doesn't know actually is CICD and why do we require.
2. Jenkins is the most popular tool found in these CV's
3. AWS is the most common but people have hardly explored beyond EC2, S3. 
4. All of them has faked atleast something in their CV. While around 10% is acceptable, but more than 50% , totally not cool.
5. 80% of the candidates don't know a single programming language (even python).
6. Candidates claimed to have worked with load balancing but doesn't know the difference between application and network load balancers. Couldn't even ask about load balancing mechanism. 
7. Few candidates claimed to have worked with AWS Route 53 but doesn't know how DNS policies work (A record, CNAME, MX) 
8. People don't know what a subnet is but are expected to believe they wrote networking policies
9. Most of them doesn't know how to work with git. 
10. Only around 1 or 2 candidates knew about best practices of technologies
11. All of them mentions Kubernetes but fails to answer how to launch a pod or how to give access to someone or difference between deployments and stateful set.
12. Most candidates are coming from XZY service based companies and know only about CICD pipelines (even experienced candidates)
13. Could pass only 10-20% to second round. All basic questions were asked

With the advent of ChatGPT and bard, we are looking at a crisis. These service based companies would be losing devops clients requiring them to pivot. Only few would survive.

**Conclusion:** Fake it till you make it ! But overdo it and you lose the chance.

Tips to aspiring Devops engineers: Have a look at [https://roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops) and learn the basics

PS: Don't ask for referral since I will need to take first round , so conflict of Interest

Edit : 
Since people are asking about position
1. Multiple positions (beginner to experienced) for multiple projects
2. Pay differs according to experience
3. Both product and service based companies.

The issue I am trying to bring attention to is that 
1. the conversion ratio is low
2. most people are faking the CV to a HUGE extent
3. Very less knowledge on basics taught in degrees",2023-10-20 04:50:34

> The junior/entry-level market is oversaturated. There are a lot more entry-level applications than open positions, often a 100x+ factor in mid size companies.

If you get 1000 applications for 10 positions, it's not practical for the recruiter to go through all of them. So they filter. Either manually, or via ATS, the first filter they apply is does this person have a degree. If 30% of them don't, that directly eliminates 30% of the effort needed.

Now, that might mean that they loose out on some 10x dev, but that's a tradeoff they're willing to make since they have a lot of applicants to choose from.",2023-04-28 05:32:12

# 8 genius strategies that landed my first job

üì∑Q: I‚Äôm having a tough time finding a job in tech. What are proven strategies I can use to land a job?

Tech is a fascinating field, a blend of artistry and functionality, psychology and aesthetics. But breaking into it can feel like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. As someone who has successfully made the transition into the tech industry, I know firsthand the challenges and struggles that designers and product managers face.

Today, I'm sharing **8 proven strategies from my personal story**, a self-taught designer who landed a Design Lead role at Gotrade (YC S19).

Let's dive into the 8 key strategies (üì∑ with interesting historical references from famous figures).Step 1. Understand The Company

Before you can woo a company, you need to know them inside and out, like a biography writer researching their subject.

>**üì∑** **True story:** Remember when Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 and steered the sinking ship back into clear waters? He had an intimate understanding of Apple's mission and culture. You need the same level of understanding about the company you want to join.

Actionable steps:

* *Research the company's mission, recent news, market trends, and the backgrounds of its leaders and interviewers.*
* *Use tools like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and the company's own website to gather information.*
* *Try to understand the company's pain points and how your role could address them.*

Step 2. Leverage Warm Intros

In the world of networking, warm introductions are the holy grail. They're like a secret handshake that gets you past the velvet rope and into the VIP section.

>**üì∑** **True story:** In the early days of Airbnb, the founders used warm intros to connect with potential investors and mentors, leading them to their first funding round. It can work the same way for you in landing a design role.

Actionable steps:

* *Scan your networks for any connections to the company.*
* *Engage with their content and ask for advice or mentorship.*
* *Use platforms like LinkedIn or ADPList to find potential connections.*

Step 3. Craft for ""Tell Me About Yourself""

This is your moment to shine, to craft a narrative about your past, present, and future that will captivate your interviewers.

>**üì∑** **True story:** When Elon Musk explains his journey, he doesn't just list off his accomplishments. He talks about his passion for technology, his visions for the future, and the key decisions that led him to where he is now. This is the same kind of storytelling you need to master.

Actionable steps:

* *Develop a concise but compelling story about your journey into design.*
* *Highlight key decisions and insights that have shaped your career.*
* *Practice this story until you can tell it naturally and confidently.*

Step 4. Targeted Companies

Just like how different species of birds have unique calls, every company has its unique needs and preferences. Meta and Google, for example, lean towards data-led design, while Apple is all about visuals.

>**üì∑** **True story:** In 2009, when Square was just a small start-up, they weren't looking for a jack-of-all-trades. They needed a designer who could build a simple, user-friendly payment app. Knowing what a company is specifically looking for can help you tailor your approach and stand out from the crowd.

Actionable steps:

* *Understand the needs of the companies you're interested in.*
* *Learn about their past hires and what they valued in them.*
* *Tailor your portfolio to match the company's style and needs.*

Step 5. Targeted Network

Before you send off that job application, try to connect with a few employees at the company.

>**üì∑** **True story:** When Sheryl Sandberg was considering joining Facebook as COO, she met with numerous employees to understand the culture and challenges of the company. This not only gave her insights into Facebook but also helped her establish connections within the company.

Actionable steps:

* *Reach out to 1-2 employees at the company.*
* *Send a personalized note asking if they'd be willing to share their insights about the company.*
* *Use the information you gain to improve your application and interview preparations.*

Step 6. Challenge Them (Humbly)

When you're asked, ""Do you have any questions for me?"" during an interview, it's your chance to show your preparation and curiosity. You want to challenge their thinking, not just ask about vacation days or company culture.

>**üì∑** **True story:** When Reed Hastings was considering investing in Netflix, he didn't just ask about their business model. He asked challenging questions that made the Netflix team think deeply about their strategy and future. You want to do the same in your job interviews.

**Actionable steps:**

* *Prepare thoughtful questions about the company's projects, strategies, and challenges.*
* *Show that you've done your homework by asking specific, informed questions.*
* *Be respectful and humble when asking these questions.*

Step 7. Contribute Into Future

Interviews are not just about what you've done in the past, but what you can do in the future. People want to hire folks they're confident can bring in results (fast).

>**üì∑** **True story:** When Sundar Pichai was interviewed at Google, he didn't just talk about his past experience. He also shared his vision for Google's future and how he could contribute to it. This approach can work for you too.

Actionable steps:

* *Think about what skills and ideas you can bring to the company.*
* *Show them how you can contribute to their future success.*
* *Be specific about what you'd improve and how you'd do it.*

Step 8. Tell Story With Results

Forget about going on and on about your design process. What matters is the impact you've made with your work. It's like showing the delicious cake you baked, not explaining every step of the baking process.

>**üì∑** **True story:** When Jony Ive presented the design of the iPhone, he didn't just talk about the design process. He demonstrated the end result and its impact on the user experience. This is the kind of storytelling you need to employ in your interviews.

Actionable steps:

* *Showcase the results of your design work in your portfolio and during your interviews.*
* *Highlight the impact your designs have had.*
* *Limit the explanation of your process to about 10% of your presentation.*

Final key takeaways

1. **Research**: Thoroughly understand the company, role, and key personnel before the interview.
2. **Networking**: Leverage your connections for introductions and insights into the company.
3. **Prepare Your Story**: Craft a compelling response to ""Tell Me About Yourself"", focusing on key decisions and insights.
4. **Tailor Your Approach**: Understand the unique needs and goals of the company and tailor your portfolio and application to match.
5. **Connect with Employees**: Prior to applying, engage with 1-2 employees from the company to gain insights.
6. **Show Critical Thinking**: Use the opportunity to ask the interviewer questions to challenge their thinking and demonstrate your preparation.
7. **Internships**: Shine in an internship by exceeding expectations and making yourself indispensable.
8. **Apply for the Right Jobs**: Exercise empathy, make your CV/resume a story, and tailor your approach to the company you really want to work for.
9. **Nail the Interview**: Articulate your creative process, describe design challenges you've experienced, and explain the rationale behind your creative decisions.‚Äã",2023-05-30 17:15:31

To add to this, the team lead then asks me to submit a document highlighting what my plan is for the next 6 months at the job so he can get a ""better sense"" of his team.

Sadly, I forgot the syntax and he taunted me you have 5+ yrs of experience and still dont know how to insert document in mongodb. I felt embarrassed and humiliated at the same time. I clarified him that I've more experience in mysql and have had little experience in mongodb, and moreover syntax shouldn't be an issue. I generally take help of google search or documentation to look up syntax whenever needed and it hardly takes few seconds. To which he replied its a basic thing and you should know it.

I forgot the syntax probably because I've little experience in mongodb and I generally use mongoose in the projects.

# Fancy saying with warning for dramatic effect

*There are no absolutes in software development. Anyone who claims as such is wrong.*

**Warning: If you find my writing insufferable, just goto the resources section and read those books.**

This post will  be all over the place because I am writing this after staying awake for 48 hours with my adhd peaking. too If you want to ,understandbly , avoid the rambling of a guy high on insomnia, goto the resources section and read the books there. They explain these concepts much better than me.

# Prologue

Nothing much really. Just wanted to share some advice, world-weary knowledge, rants and some tips sprinkled with bad humour for the juniors in this sub.

None of this is tech heavy so don't worry if you need to do an AWS associate certification course.

The idea of this post is to provide freshers and even people new to software engineering, certain gyaan from someone with experience (relatively)  and to provide some advice developing yourself. on how to grow in their career.and actual talk about what career growth means.

Second warning:  This rahul dravid post is massive and also contains bad humor and lot of formatting errors. There's a TLDR at the end for people who want a short answer for career success.

# What this post (and others) can't answer

Let me get this out of the way. No, I can't answer if your 200% hike on job switch is a bad deal or if it's worth learning MEANIES stack for full heap role in EU or if you can get fully remote coding job with your nietzschean philosophy degree or if going to a tier 3 LKG school now affects your placement chances in 2040.

My answer to the above questions and what I recommend you give as the answer too when asked is: ""It depends. Please provide more context and what research you have done on it beforehand"".

Everyone has their individual situation and context that will have a lot of variables and the advice strangers give you on the internet for such questions will not apply 1:1 to your situation.

I'll explain the general Q&A trend I have seen on this sub and how unproductive it is for everyone involved.

Asking ""How much does full stack developer job pay in bangalore for 2 year experienced guy"" will mostly have answers like this, ordered by upvotes.

* 50‚¨Ü user1: 10L
   * 2‚¨Ü OP: thank you
* 30‚¨Ü snarky\_user: you'll getting more than 6L?
* 20‚¨Ü user2: bro apply for amazon. my friend interviewed and got 50L offer
   * 30 ‚¨Ü user3: pro tip. don't join amazon.
      * 2‚¨Üuser2: why?
      * 0‚¨Üuser4:how to prepare for oa test?
   * \-1‚¨Üuser5:How to apply for amazon?
   * 0‚¨Ü user6:Can you share what you did
* 5‚¨Üuser9 : it depends on the companies you are applying to and the expectations for that role. check on salary sharing websites like glassdoor or ask in blind for bigger companies.

Even though OP's question had multiple answers, it ultimately resulted in close zero collective knowledge gain.

OP got to know one figure but not the methodology or reasoning behind it. Usual go FAANG, no FAANG bad bs.  And one practical user who has said check salary sharing sites but not getting any follow-up or further discussions on it.  Even the passive lurker, i'm looking at you dear user, who is reading it, gains nothing.

You are not sure if these values given by the commenters are accurate and you have already got tired of naagin dance so it doesn't interest you. You are also not interested in going to some website and setting up an account to access data. No , you want the data now, presented neatly in an infographic and in an immediately consumable form. Since we don't have that, you push the information about those sites to the back of your mind and it waits there until the next salary question thread and the cycle repeats.

Now this might seem like me just bitching about these threads but no my dear reader. We are software developers. Problem solving is our forte and we can treat this like a software design problem.

My elaborate rant about the questions can be considered the **Problem Statement** and **The Current State of the System**.

So stupid questions are bad and don't increase the knowledge of everyone involved. So we decide on the **Requirements** and subsequently the **Solutions** and **Reviews**..

Our requirements are gonna be pretty simple. Users must do their due diligence on the question first and then ask it.

This should results in the comments of the post taking an indepth look and validating OP's reasoning and conclusion.  If OP's methodology is flawed, users can say it is flawed because of X reason instead of the blanket answer we have currently. If it's right, we can vet it and voila either way everyone involved has gained and propogated new knowledge, including you the lurker.

So for all inquisitive software engineers out there, do your due diligence and research on  your questions  and come up with your own reasoning and conclusions which you can then review with  peers and seniors for a productive discussion.

# WFH is bad and here's why.

Clickbait heading. While WFH comes with many benefits and might be the best way to work for some folks, it has definitely affected how freshers are developing in a new workplace and it can affect their growth , especially on things which experienced folks know but aren't documented.

In the current remote setting, a fresher can get the developer onboarding wiki, KT on their service or product and even tech stack walkthroughs by their mentor/senior.

Let's go ahead and say that there already is extensive documentation or video that the seniors recorded for an earleri onboarding which they recommmend the fresher to watch and subsequently ask if they have any doubts.  It makes sense from the senior's perspective as they have already covered the main talking points in that video. So the fresher learns all about the stack, the team's processesand the service thanks to the excellent documentation and the mentor is also helpful in answering questions.

Everything looks great till now, fresher has gained knowledge on the tech stack, and they have a guide they can follow for onboarding to the code base and they also start getting ready to contribute to their team tasks.

All good things from the perspective of everyone involved. The manager, the mentor and even the fresher.

**What's the problem then?**

This onboarding for the fresher likely only covers things that can help the developer contribute to their teamwork. A lot of the other small but important things get easily missed or dropped in this remote era where everyone hates ad-hoc discussions, extended meetings and long discussions on non-productive tasks.

Let me clarify, i'm not talking about off work hang outs or general fraternization with co-workers. I'm talking about the intristic knowledge transfer that happens in-person for these soft skills and how coffee conversations can flow from topic to topic naturally.

I'm talking about those times when we went for a snack break, started discussing on tata releasing a new car and how it's costly, to talking about quality control and how it affects the cost and then talking about how important it is in tech also to talking about a previous production outage which we might  maybe probably been our fault and how it caused the company to setup guard rails and auto pipeline reverts  and then talking about the hassle of rolling back partial deployments and trouble identifying what failure metrics to track and then eventually settling back into our seats.

And between all this, the freshers stay quiet until we ask them if they know what we are talking about and then us explaining these things briefly and then telling them to lookup articles or books on this and learn about it and eventually the freshers mind opens up to the bigger picture and they become active participants in the conversation.

All developers at a point in time in their career have been inspired by how their seniors have thought and worked during collaborations or discussions. Seniors influence juniors even extends to their preferences for vim or emacs or notepad (heathens).

A fresher can easily absorb this during office by how their senior works and this leads to inspirations or adaptations of the same process. It could be even be very simple things that are adopted like that moment when the senior tries open iterm but it's not installed and you are asked why you are using the default terminal and tells you to install iterm with custom zshrc commands for ease of use. Or even like the moment where senior comes to help you debug code and then instanly opens the class and line of code without using the touchpad. You know that look on the freshers face when he realizes that he didn't need to manually go through the package explorer everytime to get to the class  and he quickly adopts it and even spreads it to his peer group thus increasing collective knowledge.

All of the above can still be explained over a remote setting, but then a lot of the above are unlikely to come up naturally and even most onboardings don't have things like shortcuts because IDE is dev choice.

Another drawback in a remote setting, it becomes hard to initiate discussions like the coffee conversions because no one wants adhoc calls on non-productive talks.

The final major drawback in a remote setting is that the mentor and mentee relationship  has a tendency to become very formal and work oriented. Like i rarely crack sarcastic jokes in a remote setting as it can be inferred as serious compared to an inperson meeting where you body language gives it away. Not saying that sarcastic jokes are necessary or anything but since the senior is only matter of fact, the fresher might assume that they are very professional and can't be disturbed for any doubts and so they become hesitant to discuss non-work career growth in detail.

Okay there are some drawbacks for freshers but remote work is a realiy. We can't force people to come to office for coffee talks and onboardings. So what can you, a fresher, do so that you can get to know these intrinsic learnings which are incidental?.

Good question and I have an answer for you. You as a fresher, can easily develop or start developing such habits and this step can also help you address career questions you might have. It's really an all in one, all encompassing step. It's very simple really. You just have to.....

# Take ownership of your career

What a vague and unhelpful statement. Put your pitchforks down and let me explain in detail.

You,dear reader, you alone, are the **owner** of your career. You are the main driver for your career decisions and you should be the one who needs to be pragmatic and start asking the right questions in the right way for everything.

If you don't ask the right questions and rely on others for answers, you start losing ownership of your career and are now relying on others to **decide** the career path for you.

Note the emphasis on decide. My main point is not to listen to others, it's the exact opposite. You want to know what you don't know and you can only do that by putting in effort. So in order to know what you don't know, you need to learn to question.

Sounds a little confusing I know but bear with me. I'll describe my definition of software engineering and we can learn how to question and pick it apart the right way and then we'll touch up on how it will help your ownership.

And randomly from nowhere comes ü¶Ü-chan.   ü¶Ü-chan is gonna be your best friend from now on and they'll help you learn to ask the right questions.

Now for this learning to question exercise, **I want you to work in a pair with ü¶Ü-chan**.  They might not speak much as they're a little shy and it's basically a 2d image but hey, they are your best friend so you have to converse on behalf of them too.

So listing the rules for the excercise,

1. You and  ü¶Ü- chan have paried up to ask why? on the given statement.
2. One person will ask the why question and the other emoji has to give an answer to that question.
3. You then start asking why on the answer and so on till a point where you can't or shouldn't ask why.
4. ü¶Ü-chan  is shy so when they need to answer a question, you do it in their place. So you'l be talking to yourself.  [Interesting idea ain't it?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)
5. If the ü¶Ü-chan or their representative mouthpice(i.e you) don't know the answer to the question, you can consult Google senpai for the answer
6. On the extremely offchance that google senpai doesn't have an answer, you can consult any senior you think might know the answer directly or will know the way to the answer, i,e pointing you to ask that person. Eventualy you'll reach the place where someone can give a definitive answer to the question why?.

Seeing so many steps, your'e probably asking, ""Why?"". Which is great because that's exactly what we need. The answer will come to your mind after the exercise.

[Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)

# Statement-1

**Software engineering is about solving human problems through software with proper understanding and methodology and at the right abstractions.**

Okay my dear reader, let's start off this riveting exercise. Come up with a list of why questions on the above statement  and also come up with answer to that why question on ü¶Ü-chan behalf.  Take you time . And once you are done, go through the spoiler sections, First and second sections will only be there for the first why as references.

**First why**

First section: >!Why? even ask these questions.!<

>!If your answer to any of the questions in the section was, why ?, Why even ask this?. What's the benefit you are getting?, Why would you even ask someone that? Then Congrats. You have cleared the first hurdle of not asking obvious questions or questions that give irrelevant information. Such type of questions are asked for the sake of it or asked without any critical thinking. Don't ask such why's to anyone. You can and should ask these type of questions to ü¶Ü-chan and then answer to yourself on their behalf.!<

&#x200B;

>!Q1: Why?!<

>!A1: What do you mean why?. It's a statement definition for software engineering. What response are you trying to get?. !<

>!Q2: Why only human problems?!<

>!A2: Okay software can be used to solve non-human problems too but software is made by humans for humans. Even software for non-human problems would invole a human problem. Why even question this?!<

>!Q3: Why proper understanding? or any of the other stupid question!<

>!A3: Why even ask this?  Problem solving requires understanding of the problem. Really don't need to ask why?!<

&#x200B;

Second section:  >!I am whylocked ?!<

>!These are questions which have answers that are less obvious but still can be reasoned out through discussions with  ü¶Ü-chan .!<

.Q: >!Why call it Software Engineering? Why not call it software creationing?!<

>!A: On the uber level both software engineering and software creationing seem to just be about creating software. But if you just compare the terms themselves, Engineering is all about working in a process where you design, develop, test and release something. There is a stuctrued process and methodology you follow where as software creation doesn't really define it to be a structured even though it could be..!<

>!Alternate A: Who cares about what term is used? We are still creating software to solve problems. !<

>!Alternate A follow-up Q: Calling it engineering implies a structured process so we need to call it Software Engineering to emphasize that.!<

>!Alternate A follow-up Q A: But the statement already mentions that a certain methodology should be followed. So regardless of what it's called, you need to follow a standard process.!<

&#x200B;

>!Both of the above answers are acceptable. The first one is more academic and technical in nature focusing on the etymology. Basically a semantic nitpicker. The second is more focused on practicality over worrying about the minor details. Both answers understand the requirement for software development to be structured, !<

>!Also calling software engineering engineering and whethers it s a craft is a can of worms i don't want to open. Programmers worry too much about semantics and naming unlike us software developers.!<

&#x200B;

Third section: >!The actual good why questions!<.

>!Questions you can somewhat deduce but a senior can explain the concept much better. The right kind of questions.!<

>!Q:   Why do we care about the ""right"" abstractions?. Why do we even care about abstractions in the first place?!<

>! Deduced A: Abstraction is the process of removing details you don't need and only focusing on the things you are interested in. So it's probably included because we need to know that the abstractions we are working are correct for the software we are writing.!<

>!Senior A with examples:  Abstractions and the ability to abstract things is a fundamental requirement for a good engineer. Abstractions are not only about removing details but also understanding what matters when and to whom. !<

**Abstraction happens at every level in Software Engineering and it is a very important trait that all developers need to improve as theircareer grows.**

So dear reader,as part of this excercise we have asked a definitive why question and reached a statement. What futher questions can you ask on this statement?

# Statement-2

**Abstraction happens at every level in Software Engineering and it is a very important trait that all developers need to improve as the career grows.**

Second  why:

Q: Why should all developers care about the design and abstractions for their career?  It's not needed for someone to do their work.

A: A valid point. You don't need a software engineering degree to learn coding and grow. There are many great coders who learn through bootcamps wtihout going through a software engineering degree. However abstraction as a concept is not related to the engineering degree. Its your ability to see the bigger picture and  ability to focus on the details you want.

&#x200B;

# Statement-3 -

**However abstraction as a concept is not related to the engineering degree. Its your ability to see the bigger picture and only focus on the details you want. It is neeeded regardless of your background for career growth.**

&#x200B;

Q: Why would a fresher need to worry about the bigger picture when they just need to focus on learning tech and doing their tasks.

: The fact that the fresher doesn't need to worry about the bigger picture is exactly the point of abstraction. In this case, their team lead abstracted out the larger complicated details and gave them only a small piece of the puzzle to focus on. Eventualy the rookie needs to start looking at the bigger picture so that they can do it it for their own reports as their team lead did for them.

This is precisly why you need the right level of abstraction. Too big and you lose track of what is going on and too small means you are wasting time on nitpicky details. Getting to the right level of abstraction requires critical thinking and good reasoning and a pragmatic mindset. The process of which i'm explaining in this long ass post.

# Statement-4 - Senior Answer

**Getting to the right level of abstraction requires critical thinking with good reasoning and a pragmatic/practical mindset**

Q: What do you mean by having practical mindset? All developers try to be practical only na?, what do you mean by this?

A: Good question. This is a great example of the critical thinking and reasoning practice that freshers need to develop. Now why did I mention the word practical?. Primarily because you need to think from a real world and business persective. Developers are very practical but there are times where they might fuss over some implementation details which might seem important to them but will see zero business impact. So freshers need to strat a habit of thinking from the business perspective along with tech perspective in their career.

# Statement-5 - Senior Answer

**So freshers need to start a habit of thinking from the business perspective along with tech one in their career.**

Q: Why should freshers care about business details? We can spend our time better understanding upcoming technology or frameworks and become an expert there.

A: Why indeed my dear felllow. Apply the five whys on that technology statement and you're on the path to becoming a better developer.

Q. Why do you want to learn the latest and greatest tech framework?

A. Because it's in demand and has lot of job opening.

Q. Why is it in demand?

A. Because it has these cool new tech features that are amazing for developers to use and allows for faster and more robust development.

Q. Why do we need faster and more robust development?

A. Because it allows developments team to release the projects faster for customer. Which improves the **business**.

See how all the tech framework talk eventually led back to the business?. That's the crux of software development.  Cool tech and features are created as a response to business requirements. There is no company which works on cool tech for the sake of it.

Google is so cool they developed big table which led to hadoop. Yeah because they had a business requirement for large scale analytics of data and they were working to solve that.

AWS is so huge right now almost half the web goes through it. Yeah and it was developed internally first as a solution to developer productivity observations.

So all these cool tech mumbo jumbo, ML/AI/ ZZ, cloud certifications and all of those things you hear about from tech gurus. You shouldn't worry too much about it. Learn to abstract them out and you'll see their business case and how it led to that tech existing. Then you'll know if that tech is actually good or if its snake oil.

Now focusing abstraction and design doesn't mean you stop working on lower details. You still do, you're just not tunnel visioned into some framework or tech stack without the bigger picture understanding first.

Now my friend, I hope you have gained a little spark in your mind on the critical reasoning aspect and why it's important for your career. Just reasoning out the existing situation around critically would give you some insights.

So when evaluating your career path and choices, don't get obsessed over the buzz words and demand for x framework or some other bullshit that is thrown around. Start your questioning on the lines of, what are the things you don't know that these guys know?. You'll then eventually find out the actual reason and then you make the decision of moving your career in that directon or not. Don't let others influence your career path without doing due diligence and research.

# So what taking ownership really mean

Don't really need to spell it out at this point no?. Do your due diligence, ask the right questions and continute to generate more and more value in your job.

joitpu,Now WhiteHatJr got my LinkedIn account also BANNED.,"Hello

A quick update since the last post.

* ASCI didn't respond to any of my tweets. The whole [news about ASCI taking down WhiteHatJr](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/special/exclusive-advertising-body-asks-whitehat-jr-to-pull-down-ads/63767/1)  
 was to mellow down resentment against WhiteHatJr and give them a fresh clean slate. Their actions of giving WhiteHatJr an easy escape in case of false advertisement is getting more suspicious. They didn't respond on

1. Why only 5 ads were objected
2. What about the rest 100s of false ads
3. Didn't show the email threads regarding their complaint to WhitehatJr.
4. Didn't tell if they asked who is Wolf Gupta.

ASCI is not a govt body, as it might sound. It's a self-regulation body run by corporates themselves. So kind of their own front to give themselves clean chit when in trouble.

* A 2 min video of mine asking questions from WHJ teacher finally go viral. Thanks to all the people who contributed to our telegram channel. Got a good SM traction. Things were moving strong on LinkedIn. A LOT of people supported the cause, mostly techies who with a good understanding of coding, who knows the harms of pushing kids in such a rat race.
* Karan Bajaj does a post last evening (4th Nov 2020) around 6pm-ish and calls us a 'Troll' . He wrote ""*A troll works hard too but to tear things down to gain fame, followers, and perhaps fortune. Destroying value and lives in the process.*""
* I didn't respond to his BS. Although at once I got very angry I decided to not play by their rules and keep my focus on more solid proofs. Finally, I didn't comment or anything under his post. For many people who did, their comments got deleted.
* My LinkedIn account gets banned at midnight, around 6 hours after Karan Bajaj calling me a troll.

Now.

1. Karan Calling us a troll: Have you ever seen a CEO acting like this? He also said I am doing this for 'fortune'. So the one who is making $300 million for scamming gullible kids is doubting my intentions. Apart from losing 11 kg in 2.5 months and gaining 27k Karma on Reddit, I am not making a dime here. You guys know my intentions. If anyone still doubts, go to my Reddit posts, scroll down, go to the first posts and see I was posting against Crypto scams as well 3 years back.
2. First, they banned my videos on YT, Quora account, Twitter Id, LinkedIn posts, Panzy Saran tried putting false allegations of harassment on me, and finally, my LinkedIn account goes down. And YET I am a troll and Karan Bajaj is a saint for looting innocent Indian parents.
3. I tried to not make this public because some of my family and friends are also watching this thing getting unfold, I didn't want them to worry. But it's high time I must talk about the msgs I get in DMs. Ex and current Byjus employees tell me that I must be worried about my physical safety all the time now. A journalist and a good friend told me I am being watched. And even my phone number might be getting tapped. One other journalist told me that I must prepare a dead man switch.

[Such messages are regular these days. Hence I am living in a safe place alone now.](https://preview.redd.it/5ye1pe6vbfx51.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad6361660066272af7cdf66833c4c3950206445b)

 4. One of WhiteHatJr employee (the ones who makes fake profiles all the time on Twitter and tries to do fake +ve reinforcement under my tweets) crossed all the limits. He dared to abuse my mother. And I know these scums would be lurking around this post as well, so listen carefully, I will find out who you are and will make you apologize. 

&#x200B;

[I SSLY will make you apologize. ](https://preview.redd.it/vdxeag50cfx51.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e360165c629d4703f3f6c1cfd211d39880f4486)

 

5. I am still working on the list I talked about last time. I will try to find out every single post/video/tweet/article that was taken down by them and then try to get every single on them reinstated.

6. I have updated most of the journalists in my contact about the potential danger to my life, but seems like it's trivial for them. They are waiting for something to happen. Live Mint recently was doing an article on the WhiteHatJr issue and I was working with one of their good journalist Salman. But in the last hours, the article got canned. This has happened with 4 other publications already in the last 30 days.

Now this time it's time for YOU to **ACT**. You guys do something, write a post on LinkedIn, ask Karan Bajaj why my ID was banned, why his people are falling down to such low levels and abusing my mother, why isn't he answering any single questions.

The ENTIRE tech community is on our side, how come we don't have a say in how coding must be taught to kids. On one side there is the experience of lakhs of years of coding and engineering and on the other side there are a bunch of greedy VCs who wants to make a circus out of our entire educations system, putting lakhs of kids into the danger of life long depressions, and lakhs of parents into EMI traps.

I have been trying my best on all platforms, from one platform they make me run to another one and then to the third one. It's time to put a stop to this. Even after a couple of good articles from The Ken, Morning Context, Forbes are still daring to call us trolls and putting a ban on us. Let's make an example of this scam so that other 'EdTechs' never forget to stay within ethical limits.

# United we stand, divided we fall

Please **ACT**. Tweet, Write on LinkedIn, Medium, Quora, FB, IG, Reddit whatever. But in the comments, this time, let's talk about your contribution to this cause.

Thank you

18crwpj,Got 2 FTE offers being from non tech,"So, I graduated in May 23 from a tier 2 college with a degree in mechanical engineering. And I had an internship experience of 6 months working for a startup as a full stack developer which I secured through off campus. But due to the current state of the market, it couldn't get converted to a FTE role. 

After being unemployed for about 4 months and around 1000 applications for jobs, finally I got lucky getting 2 offers simultaneously. But this wasn't easy, you might think how a non tech guy is getting offers in this recession. 

I was always a hardworking person, scored great grades in school and college. I started learning DSA in my 5th sem when I came across a course. In the year 2022, i was very consistent, solved around 800 problems on various platforms. And side by side learnt web dev and built some good projects. I really enjoyed it. And beside this I was still maintaining a good SGPA. 

So, I got the internship off campus in jan 2023 with a stipend of 35k. I was told by the CEO that I was the only one selected from the 1500 applications they received(not bragging here, just to make you understand that I'm pretty good at what I do).

Okay, so how I got the current FTE offers. I did a lot of take home assignments (around 15) for various companies. But getting to the interviews was a difficult task. After around 1000 applications, and numerous ""unfortunately"" emails, I applied for another small startup for a full stack dev role. Got an assignment, did well in that, gave few interviews and got the offer last week. This offer was WFO role, six days a week. 

Before the previous offer was given, a recruiter from a well known startup approached me. This time as well, I got an assignment, completed it, did well, then moved to the interviews. The interviews were pretty rigorous. I got the offer from this company as well. They gave me a slight better compensation than the other offer, plus it's a hybrid role. This is obviously a benefit.

Since this is a well known startup, I was expecting a bit more of the compensation, but since I'm a fresher, I feel it's fine. Getting my foot into a product based company is good enough. 
 
Some suggestions I would to like to give people who are working hard everyday looking for jobs - few things I noticed were that, getting interviews in MNCs are pretty difficult if you are trying off campus. So apply mostly to startups. Combining all the interviews I gave in the past 4 months, I was asked a total of only 2 problems on DSA. So I would suggest that improve upon your tech stack rather than giving more time to leetcode. And keep applying, you all will get lucky in the coming days. 

Getting depressed is pretty common in these times, I was one of you few days back, but make sure that if you have an interview scheduled, try to be happy and in a good mood in front of the interviewer. It helps a lot.

I won't reveal the CTC, but the monthly pay would be more than 60k. Being a fresher from non tech, I feel this is good enough. I will surely work harder and switch to FAANG in 1-2 years, since I'm pretty good at DSA and have learnt LLD and other CS fundamentals.

1757249,The aftermath of faking projects in interviews for getting the job.,"I know about 3 people who did this ‚Äî let me tell you what happened with all 3. All these happened in Accenture.

1st person tried to pose as a developer and get a job. Cleared the interview and joined the organisation too. Was in the job for 24 months, even got promoted once untill the manager finally called the bluff ( there were a lot of complaint about the quality bof work and too many issues reported due to the code, was put to work with a tech Arch who finally found the reason) and smoked the person out. Was fired and is now blacklisted in Accenture.

2nd person posed as a support executive and told that they have hands on technology knowledge and experience and want to switch to Development. Was smoked our in the 3rd month itself as having no knowledge. Was moved to a Support team internally and failed to performed the same role as described in their resume. Was fired and is now blacklisted in Accenture.

3rd person also claimed to be a Developer. Cleared the interview and joined the organisation too. Spoke with their reporting manager, came clear about the bluff and told effort will not be problem, but guidance will be needed. Was moved to a support role and worked there since. It's been 4 years since this person joined and then got 2 promotion just due to amout of effort put in. Presently is leading a team of 15 and is considered a SME. Still reports to the reporting manager.

Moral of the story ‚Äî don't fake it, you will be ultimately found and acted upon. BUT if you have, come clear about it. Accenture has great learning opportunities and is committed to groom it's employees. If you need help, it can be arranged. But please don't fake it ‚Äî we don't accept it

1bo3561,"Burnt out & depressed in current org, couldn't quit because of bad market","I had to relocate to a Bangalore an year ago because of WFO.

I didn't like living there, so I planned on preparing well and finding a role back in my city.

Because of bad market, I got very few interviews in past, most of which are FAANG, or similar level companies, because there are very few startups in my home city.

I was unable to clear them since I wasn't good enough in DSA despite trying my best to practice after working hectic work hrs.

Though I tried to make peace with living in Bangalore for some some more months, recently my workplace got extremely toxic and hectic, even sometimes on weekends I have to work. People are leaving 1 after other because of this, half of them without any other job in hand.

I am literally burning out everyday and not able to focus on DSA even when I have some time to space.

I get this urge to quit everyday, but then remember EMIs, and bad market etc, just shut those thoughts and carryon with work.

I am feeling burntout, stuck & depressed, every weekday and even most weekend, not sure what to do.

Looking for any advice from people in similar position.

18aeeyp,Product I built raised $300k and I left the company without taking anything. Did I do the right thing?,"I was studying B.Tech and was in my final semester. As per the college criteria, in the last semester, everyone had to do some project or internship. So, it was my last day to join any internship, or else I would have failed, I guess. By the way, it was not just me; my whole group was with me, looking for an internship in the last days. A friend gave a reference for us in a startup and told us that we all could join. It was pre-COVID days, so there were almost no employees, just us and the founder in the company.

The founder used to assign tasks to us, and everyone tried to do them. However, only my friend and I from the whole group were working properly, and we used to solve any task he assigned us. Slowly, the task difficulty grew, and we (my friend and I) built a whole SaaS application from scratch within 6-7 months of joining the company. The other friend who helped build it was not interested, so he left, and the only people left in the company were the founder and myself. By the way, it was an unpaid internship for the first 4 months, and later he started paying both of us Rs. 25k/month. The founder used to look older than us, like in his 30s, but later on, I found out we were both the same age, 23 years old, lol.

Now, both the founder and I were working our tails off day and night, anytime, anywhere. Once, I was traveling somewhere on my bike, and a major issue occurred on the server. I stopped the bike on the side and started fixing the issue on the road itself, xD.

He was looking into sales, marketing, etc., and I was handling client onboarding, handling client issues, understanding their pain points, suggesting solutions, feature development, bug fixing, scaling, deployment, etc.

Fast forward, now the company is generating decent revenue, at least 5 lakh per month, and there were only two of us in the company. He gave me a hike and raised my salary from 25k/month to 50k/month. He started approaching investors during the COVID time, but he was persistent and failing to secure investment. It's been 5 months, and still no sign of an investor. I was also expecting to get some shares from the founder, as both of us built it up from scratch and worked hard. I raised my point that I wanted some shares in the company because we built it from scratch. He told me I would get shares once we raised funding, as part of ESOP, which I didn't like. During the period he was raising the round, I left the company out of self-respect.

On top of that, he needs daily mail reporting about our work failing which we're marked as absent. And additionally, we also have to update a worksheet about the status and time taken on tasks.

1b401so,Few Tips to get your Naukri resume shortlisted by HR.,"I can see that lots of people are posting here that, they're not getting any calls even after applying for hundreds of posts.

I am no expert in this matter but as a guy who got 10+ calls from naukri within first week, and also looked at how HR shortlists the resumes in my previous company, here are my 2 cents.

1. Don't use tables. It can confuse ATS.

2. If you're using word document, use Microsoft Word or at least check whether your dicument rendering properly in Microsoft word.

3. Don't use custom fonts. It's OK for pdf resumes but it's better to avoid.

4. World runs on Excel sheets, so does HRs. HR managers copy the details from your resume in to the excel sheet. So make sure copying from your PDF resume is not disabled.

5. Resume shouldn't be morethan 2 pages long. No one has time to read about your shitty auto-biography.

6. Your education, total experience and skills should be on top of first page.

7. Use total experience in bold. No one has time to add your individual experiences.

8. Create a section with heading skills and list all ghe skills you've. Don't include them in sentences. HRs just look over your resume and copies them into excel sheet. So, make it easy for them to copy.

9. It's better to have above details in bold text.

10. Freshers please do not use the same projects as your friend. Especially don't add the projects like tic-tac-toe, todos, food delivery app ...etc. It's better to have resume without any projects than above ones. Trust me, 3 out of 5 resumes have these projects.

11. Another issue with freshers(especially tier-3 colleges) is, entire college uses same resume template with just name change. Invest some time and create your own resume instead of using existing template which was already used by 1000s. 

12. If you know anyone with the employer account on naukri, you can use it to see on which position your profile is listed for your skills and city. Optimise Your profile till it reaches top 30.

I know thse are very basic and boring tips, but these helped me very much.

PS. Remember this, most HRs don't know have technical knowledge. They just search the Naukri using details given by Managers.

P.S. If you're not getting any calls after one week, create a completely new resume instead of modifying existing one",2024-03-01 17:29:55

I mean, I knew companies abroad had issues with Indian coders but since I'm not a techie, I wasn't aware of the details. Lots of interesting comments there:

*...We hired a team from India...coding standards were all over the map. Misspelled everything, which triggers my ocd like no other. Zero code comments. No naming standards anywhere. Output was often written only to match templates with zero flexibility...We've been rewriting that team's code every chance we get for two years. It's a huge mess...*

*...I‚Äôve had so many negative experiences with teams from India. Their work culture is so different that they come off as very demanding and rude. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the problems my female coworkers had to deal with when meeting with them...*

*...not sure if this is universal to all outsourcing firms in India, but my experience is they aren't very good at their jobs -- they'll solve the details in the ticket alright, without any consideration of the repercussions, other bugs they may have created, or being able to reuse their work in the future...*

*...I don't know if it's a problem with outsourcing to India, or a problem with outsourcing - companies you contract are always going to care more about easily presentable metrics like tickets closed, time per ticket, etc than they are about long term stability and quality...*

*...I work with a lot of other firms that rely heavily on India based teams and it seems like every time we get on a call it's a whole new batch of developers and we have to start almost from scratch. Feels like a revolving door of programmers and it's extremely frustrating to keep having to explain the same stuff over and over...*

*...There's too much work that needs constant communication and clarification to accomplish. There's too much work that needs a knowledge buildup to do good work, and when hiring offshore we get a rotating cast of workers that are constantly being replaced without warning. Its mostly not worth it to try...*

*...Every company I've been at that has outsourced jobs has backtracked and started hiring locally or within the US again. It just never works out. My wife's company is currently going through this with QA as well. The contractors just let too much slip by. They don't actually care about the product and are only worried about marking things complete. Part of her job description has been to go behind them and double check that they are actually testing things. 9/10 they missed glaring issues...*",2023-03-19 10:19:44

1bs9k0d,"Giving current bugs in their system as interview tasks. Company: Zuper, Chennai","I interviewed for Android Developer position. The job post mentioned Senior Android Developer and that was the only reason I applied. In the first call, the HR informed me that it is not a Lead position, it is just an Android Developer position. They also said their budget is 2 LPA lesser than my ask and I was fine with it.

HR informed me I would get a task by EOD and I received it over an email. The task looked like a new implementation they were working on and they could not find a solution with their way. Basically, it looked like a piece of code written by my junior and reassigned to me since my junior could not find a solution.

Nevertheless, I completed the task and submitted it in two days (received the task on Tuesday EOD and submitted it by Thursday night). After this, there was no response till Monday and I sent an email asking about the expected TAT. HR said they will reply by the next day. No response after that till the next Monday and by then I had received 2 other offers and 2 interviews scheduled. So I sent an email asking whether I should wait or I should proceed to other offers/interviews. By EOD I received an automated response that I have been rejected.

Thinking over it, its clear now that they could not afford me. Frankly, I do not mind getting rejected from companies like this because they clearly lack professionalism and shows all kinds of red flags that a good developer would not want from their workplace. I just wanted to share my experience here so that good developers will not consider interviewing for this company after reading this.",2024-03-31 12:43:27

188jzk8,Internships are scams in INDIA,"For a year or so I am trying to get a good internship but my DS ALGO is weak so a good company is out of the question. Now coming to the development part I would say I am pretty good at development as a student. Whenever I go to platforms like Internshala, Instashyre, cuvette, cutshort etc etc and whatnot best job searching platforms, I see many internships and after applying to those, I have the same results. They want me to do a big and complicated assignment. Time to elaborate.

&#x200B;

They are asking to build a full-stack MERN CMS, admin dashboard, quiz app, e-commerce app and whatnot. Some are even asking to build full-stack social media apps. And all of these complex web apps need to be built within 2 to 3 days as the deadline. Like kuch bhi. How in the world can someone build such complex web apps within 3 days and also with best optimizations and code quality. It happened to me multiple times. I made e-commerce and full-stack apps for them within 3 days by working my a\*\* off the night but after I submit the assignments,  they say I didn't made it to the second round or I am not good enough or they don't even respond.(Being unprofessional,""m\*ad\*rc\*\*d, then why make me do the assignments even in the first place, if I am not good enough).  They want best of the world code quality, enterprise production level quality from a student who want to gain experience and learn, wow. 

Now some will say maybe I am not good enough, but what do you expect from a student, code repo as good as 10yrs exp person. I know MERN stack and I build projects using that. I know what is out there, and I always grind and my code is as good as most of the students and I am hella confident in that. 

Also now some will say if you don't want to develop software then why come in the field?

My problem is not that mate. My point is why I will work for free to build a complex web application for a company that I don't had interview with yet and no guarantees of anything. Like I said some don't even respond after submission. 

&#x200B;

Coming to the conclusion, I personally thing these are scams to get their work done for free. I got assignments from assignment IBM and they wanted me to solve 2 ds algo questions. I also did interviews with good startups and they straight jumped to the phone call with interview scheduled later. None of the good companies wanted me to build a complex web app. From what I experienced these companies are scamming innocent students and grads. Like who knows, maybe they want a code template and want it for free, or some may want the exact app and get it done by a innocent student and then change it a little and then sell it to their customers.

And honorary brats(companies) that do these type of scams that I know are:-

1. BlackCoffer
2. Super Assistant
3. Stamurai
4. TheDigitalShift
5. QuadBtech
6. Cipher Schools
7. Cipher School
8. Inkoop
9. Emitrr   
and many more that I forgot the names even  


I thing our INDIAN government should take some steps to clean up this mess. Anybody's coming and making people work for free giving them hope.   


Sorry for the long write but full elaboration was indeed needed. And sorry for slangs but when you make complex apps for absolutely free without sleep multiple times, you'll also be angry. It does take a toll on my mental and physical health.

1721d4i,I went for an interview and was disappointed with the CEO's behavior.,"Last week, I applied for an entry-level Front-End Developer position at a startup company. The HR department contacted me and scheduled an interview for the following day. I attended the interview, and during the initial phase, the HR representative handed me an aptitude question paper and asked me to complete it within 15 minutes. After finishing the paper, I was told to wait for my technical round, which ended up being a one-hour wait.

&#x200B;

Eventually, the HR called me into a cabin and handed me a phone with the Zoom app open, explaining that the CEO would conduct my technical interview remotely. I held the HR's phone and participated in the interview. Initially, the CEO's front camera was on, showing his home environment. However, he soon turned off his camera, and mine was activated. He proceeded to ask me questions related to front-end development, and I answered all of them to the best of my ability.

&#x200B;

Towards the end of the interview, the CEO inquired if I had one year of experience. I honestly admitted that I had six months of internship experience. In a rather abrupt and impolite manner, he informed me that they were looking for a candidate with one year of experience. I tried to reassure him that I was capable of performing the role effectively and even offered to work as an intern without payment. Unfortunately, he rudely disconnected the call.

&#x200B;

I shared my experience with the HR department, but they dismissed my concerns, claiming it was my problem. I am disappointed because I had to travel 30 kilometers for this job interview, which cost me money. Furthermore, it was frustrating to discover that the CEO was comfortably working from home, yet I was required to come to their office for the interview. What adds to the disappointment is that, despite answering all their questions correctly, I was rejected solely due to a lack of experience, which seems hypocritical given the circumstances.",2023-10-07 08:37:23

18n13u1,Freshers need to standout from the crowd...since everyone is doing the same thing.,"Took interviews in a Tier 1 college... And everyone is doing the same thing... Like doing same questions on leetcode, mentioning similar kind of projects in their resume... Like, a Todo app using MERN, a real time chat using socket io or a movie recommendation system.. You know the projects which you see on the first page of youtube search. 

And on top of it, everybody had only surface level knowledge.. The one you get by following the tutorials blindly and doing it just for the sake of it. 

Though it shows a self-starter attitude but it is not enough.. As you took one step forward but everyone else also took that one step.. So essentially you are still a part of the crowd!

So what to do? 
Be curious and do what no one is doing. 
Do a thing using multiple stack. 
Expand the scope of the problem 
Do one project and do it thoroughly.. Know its in and outs. 

Say for example.. Everyone is creating a todo app using MERN
What you can do

Create it using postgres as well.. Make db schema.. Read about transactions, ACID. 
Use java as BE language (since it is static and compiled)
So create the same project in multiple variants 
React + node + mongo (usual suspect) 
React + node + postgres
React + java + postgres

This way you will know pros and cons of these competing tech stacks and have a much better understanding of the choices you made. 

To expand the scope of the problem.. You can add say... Undo, redo, attaching an alarm with each todo and sending notification at that time (think cron job). Thess things will create uniqueness in a rather generic project. 

To take it a notch further,explore what is in-memory db, its pros ans cons... use Redis...say to store alarms.

To take it even further, learn about docker and create a docker compos file which will spin up all of your components(fe, be, db, redis) 

And for ""salary kitni loge"" moment (3 idiots)... Have a look at Kubernetes and use minikube. 


I think all of this can be done diligently in a couple of months and it will make you truly stand out in the crowded job market. 

Note: this is another random opinion in the sea of opinions on the internet.. So assess yourself before following it. But if you do and it doesn't work out (I'd be very surprised though) then dont hold it against me... And yeah... Send me your resume in that case.",2023-12-20 18:11:18

So for starters, you get a mail saying that you pass the filter and are eligible the job. In this mail they butter you up and make you feel that you will definitely get the job.

Next they conduct a hr interview even there they ask general questions like how you would resolve conflicts, etc etc.

Then comes the technical interview, even there they ask the most common interview questions related to the position. At this point I feel great, like I feel i really lucked out since they asked questions which I read about. 

Then finally comes the feedback mail, wherein they say that you've passed but need to work on your main domain skill. Now mind you, i answered every question they threw at me, even tho they were basic bitch question, but according to them i should be an expert, so why poor performance on the technical interview right...


Then they tell me to buy a course vetted by them. I ask them ""do you have any recommendations"" they send me this link ""https://scala-language.org"" which on first read through looks legit right, but the official website is https://www.scala-lang.org

In general, I have seen that youtubers don't focus on stuff like test cases, code quality, architecturing an app, promoting learning through docs etc. They only focus on development of APIs, coding cool frontend and that's it, which is not bad considering the target audience may be beginners.

161ly2x,I wish Scalar would not follow the marketing strategies of Byju's.,"Last week, I received a call from Scaler. The person on the phone said that with my 3+ years of total experience, including 1+ year in automation testing, I should not be earning just 9 LPA. I should aim for a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) position at a company like Honeywell or VMware, where SDETs with my experience can earn 25-30 LPA.

I told the person that I am planning to pursue a career as a Backend Engineer or DevOps Engineer, and I am already investing my time and effort in learning those skills. I also told them that I am not an engineer by training, but I developed an interest in coding during my Master's degree and decided to pursue this career path. I know my strengths and weaknesses, and the plan that works for a computer science graduate will not work for me.

The person on the phone kept insisting that it would take me 4+ years to reach my goals if I went the self-learning route, and that some people prefer **""slow growth""**. Throughout the conversation, I felt like they were saying that I would not be able to get a job at a good company with a high-paying salary without their tailored training. They said that the course costs around 3 LPA, which I can easily make back when I secure a high-paying job at my next company. They have great teachers on their team, and I hope they will do great with this platform. However, I feel that if Scaler is using aggressive marketing strategies, they may end up like Byju's.

Is there not a company where my hike will always dependant on my on paper performance, than showoff or being vocal of literally everything??",2023-07-29 12:21:13

Google has recently proposed the **Web Environment Integrity API (WEI)** for ""*determining the integrity of web environments*""

It's a subtle attempt by Google to solidify Chrome's monopoly over web standards, prevent ad blocking, destroy Firefox and smaller Chromium and WebKit forks and promote its advertising revenue.

This (proposed) API allows websites to request an ""attestation"" from an ""attester"" to validate the client environment (browser and/or devices). Google could exploit this by favouring Chrome as the attester, subtly promoting Chrome's dominance over other browsers like Firefox. A vendor lock-in in disguise!  
""Attesters"" decide whether your device and/or browser is ""trustworthy"" enough - as defined by the website you are trying to visit.   
It is specifically designed to destroy the open web by denying you the right to use whatever browser you want to use, on whatever operating system.

Another concern lies with limiting ad blockers. With Manifest v3, Google intends to restrict ad-blocking capabilities in Chrome extensions. Combined with WEI API, Google could potentially gain more control over the browsing experience, monopoly and ad revenue.  
This API provides almost no benefit, but could end up hurting small browser forks, modded Android/iOS phones, custom Linux distros, user privacy by giving attesters more data points and limiting privacy tools, user experience by breaking ad-blocking.   


YouTubers like Louis Rossmann have also [heavily criticized this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i0Ho-x7s_U) and it is also receiving huge backlash on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues). We need to make sure that they fail, and the only way to do this is to spread awareness about it and talk about it more.

Considering the severity of the situation I messaged IRCTC on twitter and send the complete video of replicating the bug. When I was testing the same bug today for something else, I saw that now they are encrypting the data.

He started asking some questions about react and next.js which I was giving answers to in a short and precise manner no useless nonsense, In one questions I was stuck because I couldn't understand what he meant by it the question was ""How to show user's name on the header component"" yeah that's it there was no context to it, I gave the answer as "" If we have a user therefore we should have a session and in that session we should have the necessary details like name and user profile etc."" Then he interrupted saying in a disrespectful manner that "" aaj kal sabh jwt use krte hai session vagera koi nhi use krta"" which i still don't understand but I didn't said anything and said that I will look into that topic after the interview.
Third came the coding round where he gave a question of vanilla js which I did correctly but in the next question I was getting the output but it was a little different than what It was supposed to be so it took me 10-15 minutes to solve that question but after I solved the question i go back to the Teams app and see that he's already left the meeting without saying anything.

Look at Polish salaries, they are supposed to get even lower when it comes to PPP but they didn't because they decided to collectively raise the ceiling on salaries.

Which means they are saving more than the average European.

Europe is strange because Europeans not only save almost 1 L per month after tax+expenses but they also earn retirement money + universal healthcare, so they are actually earning alot more.

Now coming to Indian devs, unless we are earning like 25 LPA, we are literally making nothing compared to other devs.

I'm saying this because right now because of aws, azure and gcp anyone on the world can access and do any kind of dev work.

Currently I have 3+ yoe in azure/Aws architecture.
Now that they have put me in pip I think they will fire me in near future. I started to apply here and there for devops or L2/L3 support role. But I think current job situation is bit tricky. Barely getting any response from other end.

 I think my future over here is over. Let's say I give my best and revert my pip but I will not get any hike/ bonus for next 12 months. And after that they will observe another 6 months to give me the next hike. In short 18 months without any hike(this is what I think).


So other than switch from the current company i think I don't have any other choice.
I can barely think what's going to happen with me in next few months. I want to ask to all my experience folks that if my thinking is correct or considering the current market scenario i need to improve my daily work and revert pip.

15e8xfa,My Disappointing Experience Referring Software Developers,"**TL;DR:** Tried recruiting software developers from SM (including Reddit) for my organization, but many initially 'enthusiastic' candidates turned unresponsive or made unreasonable demands when approached by HR.

Wanted to share my recent experience with trying to help my organization recruit software developers from multiple social media platforms. I am a Software Developer myself, and since we were not getting quality CVs from our recuitment partners, I first scanned all of my contacts and also thought of checking social media for the same. Initially, I was excited to tap into this promising channel, but unfortunately, the whole experience turned out to be quite disheartening.

When I first mentioned about job openings at my company, I received an overwhelming response from many enthusiastic candidates. I had called them to check and resolve any of their as well as my doubts before forwarding their CVs. Most seemed genuinely interested and eager to work with us. It seemed very promising till this point.

However, things took a downturn. Some of the candidates who initially appeared keen suddenly turned cold and unresponsive. It was puzzling to see the shift in their attitude after expressing so much interest before. When our HR contacted, some of them even mentioned having other job offers on hand (which they did not mention to me before), and trying to get some compromise like WFH or higher compensation (again, WFO in the initial phase is required to get the candidate ramped up fast, and it was mentioned). As a result, from around 15 people that I had reffered, hardly 1-2 appeared for an interview, no one was selected.

Another issue that arose was with certain candidates not being ready to work in hybrid env, even though it was **clearly mentioned** in the job posting. We respect remote work preferences and are very flexible in accmmodating temporary needs as well as up to 2 WFH per week, but it was disappointing to see that the candidates who were intially okay with this, wanted full time WFH suddenly. This saga had a negative effect on my peace (albeit temporarily) as I got sandwitched between a ghosting candidate, and nagging HR. 

The most frustrating part of the experience was when some candidates simply stopped responding altogether. We understand that not everyone may be interested in the opportunity after learning more about it, but we expect to receive a simple rejection or explanation to the least.

As a result of this disappointing experience, I have to admit that I'm reluctant to make any further referrals from social media. I wanted to share this with all of you to take your opinion on what should be the correct approach. To all the job seekers (especially the freshers), please note that it is crucial to communicate openly and professionally.

To my fellow Redditors who have had positive experiences with recruitment (from SM), I would love to hear your insights and tips on how to make this process smoother.

Also if anyone thinks that compensation was the issue, then let me assure that we offer much better compared to the CHWTIA orgs.",2023-07-31 07:17:10

It's easy to get caught up in the allure of frameworks and shiny tools. While these can certainly speed up development, they shouldn't overshadow the importance of truly understanding the underlying principles.

It's becoming increasingly common to encounter fresh graduates proudly identifying themselves as ""React developers,"" yet displaying limited knowledge of the foundational JavaScript concepts that power the framework.

Being an engineer means diving deep into the core concepts, algorithms, and design patterns that drive our technology. It's about having a solid foundation that enables you to adapt and innovate, rather than just relying on pre-built solutions.

18j4e6l,Stressed AF | Code broke in front of MD while my manager was giving a demo.,"Idk if this is the place but need to vent out.  
I joined a company 6 months back as a Jr. Software developer and it uses Ext.Js which is a garbage frontend framework with a very stiff learning curve and delphi6 (Object Pascal-based) for rest API which is again very ancient. Their product takes almost an eternity (\~1.5min/refresh) to load (EXT JS doesn't support hot reloads) and with the junk of a PC that they have provided I managed to work on a feature that was about to be shipped in the release. Everything was working until they built the whole thing and deployed it on AWS. After a code review from my TL and sanity testing it myself I was confident that this would work with the effort I put in. But guess what... They are using some version of YUICompressor for compressing their javascript (Yes that's shitty tooling) which doesn't support javascript's ES6 syntax and after 3 hours of debugging and several breakdowns, I was enlightened to the above fact. Now I'm stressed out and rethinking my job here.

3. He gave me a poor rating in my annual appraisal because of merge conflicts and not making two documents????? inspite of so much good work I have done. Although, they were slow but they were delivered and good in quality.
4. Yesterday he threatened to take me to HR for some support work I did not want to do. He said i have to ""make up"" for my slow work but i clearly said I have delivered and there are no blockers on me.

14qgn4g,SDE1@Amazon: My mental health is deteriorating,"I joined as an intern in a company in Pune in 2019 when I got another intern offer as a QAE1 in Amazon. Even though my interests were in software development I was very happy that my dream had come true. Never in my life had I ever imagine that I will be able to crack and Amazon interview. I became a full time employee as QAE1 in 2020. After that I wanted to pursue my real interest which was software development. And that also happened very well as I got my role converted to SDE1 in 2021 Jan.

For a few months everything was very fine, I was delivering whatever was expected out of me. Then came this big project on which I had to work for extended hours due to last minute changes in the expectations from the PM team. I was working around 16 to 18 hours a day and all I took all my meals while my code changes were building.
After this project got over I got burn out and I lost motivation to work for around 2 months. After the two months my manager told me that I was not meeting expectations of SDE1 since I did not have any commits in the last 2 months. I got put into something known as a coaching plan. In this I would take a project and my performance would be monitored.

I did not question this coaching plan because I knew that I was not working at my 100%. I also had faith in my manager that if I work for 2 months he would take me out of that coaching plan and everything would be alright. Also I could not change my teams inside Amazon.

I did SEO for 2 months and after 2 months I was told that there is no impact of what I had done which was surprising because it's not possible to see the impact of SEO in 2 months.
I was told to take another project that has a significant impact on the team. In between this project my manager and my senior manager left the team. I got assigned another manager. I work very hard on that project and brought it to closure. I was in a lot of pressure because it was the time when the recession had started. I was thinking that I could lose my job.

After I completed that project, my manager told me that I cannot inform you if you are in a coaching plan or not. Because this information is not to be told to the employee and should only be between the manager and the HR. He even said that if you are previous manager was still in our team I would have handed him over to the HR. I contacted HR myself and talk about how I was not feeling good even though I was working I was not informed that I am in a coaching plan or not. After my meeting with HR, they did not tell me anything and were not responding to my texts. Before I could escalate it any further my team got shutdown.

When I went to the new team I thought everything would be new I would get a fresh start but the same coaching plan was continued. Even though I delivered everything that I was assigned I was not taken out of the coaching plan. It seems that everything that I am doing is falling short of the expectations that they are having. I been told that there are no technical gaps. Amazon has some leadership principles and my manager would just pick nitty gritty detail and map it to one of the leadership principles and tell me that I was falling short there. 

I have been in this coaching plan for 1 year now and my mental health is taken a toll. I can confidently save that there is no technical incompetency issue. I am fully confident about my technical skills. My pears have taken a promotion and I was not even given a raise last year.

I know I am only 24 and its not the end of the world but it makes me think that if so many people are saying maybe there is something wrong with me and myself confidence is getting lost. This is also impacting my judgement about various technical things. And I have started to second guess my every decision.

Does anyone have any idea what I can do?




EDIT: Thanks a lot everyone for all the support. This really means a lot when it comes from fellow developers. 

Also something to clarify, in Amazon there is something called as coaching plan if you don't perform well in coaching plan , they will bring a pivot where you can take a severance and leave or you can do a task which will be assigned to you in strict timelines. 

This task is generally impossible to achieve in the timeline and is a death sentence. If you fail in that task, your severance is cut in half and you are let go.

1238fkp,"People who think a fast-paced environment is good for freshers, we're just kidding ourselves.","Hello,
I have often read in this subreddit that people mention it's good to join a startup or company with a fast-paced environment. However, after actually working in this kind of environment, I've grown to think the opposite of that.

When you are a fresher, your foundation with respect to coding practices is weak. And when you start a project where things need to be developed as fast as possible, you start to develop bad habits. Habits like not commenting properly or not structuring your code, and not thinking beyond the feature being developed, like how it would impact the user who is using it. Instead, you just blindly follow Jira tickets or Figma designs. A fast-paced environment doesn't give you enough room to think about stuff like that.

One example I would like to share from my experience is when I was in a project where I had to write a unit test for React components. Since it was my first time writing a unit test, I just took an overview of how unit tests work and started following tests that were already written. The tests were written in a way where you'd get 90-100% code coverage, but they were not tested for functionality. The worst one I remember is mocking dispatch and selector for Redux to literally do nothing (mocking dispatch as jest.fn). Being naive at that time, I started doing the same, got appreciation, and continued the same pattern.

When I switched to a better company, there, I was given enough room to understand if I didn't know something, and best practices were promoted over half-baked approaches. I realized that the way I wrote tests in the past was completely wrong. Now, I focus more on testing functionality than just code coverage. My code quality and approach to solve a problem have improved significantly at my current place. Sure, it gets boring at times if things are slow, but I would prefer that over mindlessly doing things just for the sake of it.

So, people who think a fast-paced environment is good for freshers, we're just kidding ourselves.",2023-03-27 02:31:19

Last month I had gone to a job fair where I cleared first 2 rounds of a company (aptitude+dsa and group discussion) and I was scheduled to have my L1 interview.

Now, they took interviews in the morning (ik because my friend also had theirs) and when my turn came in the afternoon, right before my interview I saw that the 'event has been cancelled' in my calendar. I thought it might be a mistake from the HR side since I didn't receive any mail regarding the cancelled interview. I joined the meeting at the scheduled time and realised that no one is going to join :-)

I felt bad regarding this, the least they could have done was send a mail to me regarding cancellation of my interview, had I not checked my calendar I wouldn't have even known. The next day I mailed them regarding this, asking if there was any rescheduling and now they inform me that they have reached their selected candidates quota hence they won't be moving forward.

17msfpl,Leeson for every fresher,"This Wednesday, I received a ticket to resolve, and I started working on it. I completed it by Thursday afternoon. However, on that Thursday, my manager assigned me a new ticket that was quite complex and had multiple aspects to check. During the Scrum call, while my manager was explaining it, I didn't pay full attention and just responded with an ""Ok.""

I distinctly remember my manager didn't specify that this new ticket had to be included in the Friday build. However, when he updated the group later, he added a deadline of noon for the same Friday. Unfortunately, I didn't notice this change and proceeded to work on the Wednesday ticket as planned.

When I was going through the changes with the tester, they pointed out that this new ticket was critical and needed to be completed by the end of the day. I was taken aback, realizing it was already 5 pm, and I hadn't even started. I felt overwhelmed and stressed by the situation. Testers began questioning why it was taking so long for such a seemingly small task, and I explained that it wasn't clear in the ticket that it would be complex.

I had to work through the night to try to resolve the issues, but it was still not complete due to numerous unexpected complications. I communicated the situation to my manager and requested that the task be moved to the next sprint, but it didn't get approved. In the end, I merged the incomplete work, not fully understanding which parts were functional, and hoped for the best.

1amoca2,Be a good interviewer when you get a chance to be one," It's long. There is no TLDR.

To the junior developers, if this helps: 

Within a matter of time, you would be a good at your job.   
At some point in your career, of course, there would be this imposter syndrome. However, when you realize it happens to all, well then you know, you are fine and won't worry about it much.  
I have seen the worst developers transform into exceptional ones, many of them settled and happy in their comfort zones, and some of them who were laid off doing so much better now and so on. 

But what you need to learn and what no one teaches you, is to be a good interviewer. I have attended so many interviews in the past (both, abroad and here), failed in a lot many, given stupid answers too, but let me tell you, in 99.9% of the abroad ones, I was interviewed by a good soul (Left 0.1 just to be flexible)

Sadly, I can't say the same for our country. I have met so many bad interviewers. So many of them. 

Many of them don't switch on the cameras, well that is fine, it's a personal choice, let's not go there.   


But some have mocked me, insulted, angered me and cancelled the interview at the last minute. That's bad. 

People outside India, irrespective of nationality (they could be Indians too), have great interview etiquettes. They smile, encourage you even if you go wrong, inform/apologize to you if they could not attend. You don't feel disheartened even in case of rejection. (I mean you would of course, but not because of some stupid interviewer who doesn't know to conduct an interview)

Back here, I feel dejected, demotivated, frustrated if the interviewer was no good in his/her manners. 

Not saying there aren't good interviewers here, there are, but most of them still need lessons. I too, have interviewed and I make sure I don't hurt someone. 

So, my dear juniors, if you encounter one harsh interviewer, just remember that person is worthless and it's good you have dodged a bullet by not going to be his/her colleague.   
Secondly, in future, you too would get a chance to interview. Just be a good one. 

That's all.

I was good in school as I scored 90+% in boards but I was too dumb to crack JEE ,so went to a pvt clg.
I tried my best in clg to grab a good placement.
I believe in hard work , hard work builds luck.
Ik that my kismat is not like others so I had to give sacrifices, I never made frends in clg , no parties,nthing, never went to fests . I used to do DSA and webD.
In my third year I tried my best to find intern , and I found a startup jo abhi shuru bhi ni hua tha , mujhe uski website build krne ka kaam mila tha jo nhi hua mujhse to we had to shift to wordpress. 
This shows my dumbness to do webD all day and still couldn't build a calendar for booking .
It gave me 2000 stipend whereas my frends got some decent internship with atleast 10k stipend .
I am dumb ik , thats why I beleive ki mujhe sacrifices krne chahiye to compensate my dumbness .

I tried my hard and made good grip in DSA , solves 500+ questions with 1750 around ratings in contest(LC).

I recently got placed but It's not SDE that I wanted , it didn't ask me DSA jo mai aajtk krta aya hu .
I feel dumb here because other who got selected are ones who partied whole life , enjoyed fully , are dumber than me but there are at my level now.
They are already financially good so they will again enjoy their corporate doing parties with their salary but I have to save because my father won't be working anymore.

My close frend got a Good Placement 15+LPA base but he was from T1 clg so..

I am feeling bad for myself , I wanna cryy harddddd , because again I have to work harddd , again grind .

Sorry , I am being that guy jisey jo mila h usme khush nhi h .

12gwvd6,My manager gave me the lowest rating in review and made me resign the next day,"So guys I was in this company since last year. This new EM came to my team 3 months ago in January.

And at the time of last 6 months review, he gave me the lowest rating ""doesn't meet expectations"". In Feb, he gave me the feedback that I was doing 6-7 story points per sprint, that I should be doing 8-9. Ideally it was 12-15 for them. And few of my tasks rolled over to the next sprints, so he called me not as productive as I should be. I said I'll work on it but I was unavailable in March due to health issues.

And when I questioned him last week, he started talking about a huge task which was not even assigned to me. That I didn't work well on it. And I didn't contribute as much as the senior engineers. Also said that I didn't collaborate well with other engineers whereas I always talked to my fellow engineers, collaborated.

I said if the quality of code was questionable, it shouldn't be making to production. He said we're a startup and we're all about speed. He laid off another engineer like this. And our whole team is shocked.

Now I'm on to find new job in this market. Fuckkk",2023-04-09 21:45:25

This guy (Sde-3) after the technical discussion gave me 2 problems similar to Two sum with sorted array, and after carefully understanding the constraints and edge cases I needed to provide all the solutions which can come to my mind.

I gave him Brute force, Map and two pointers approach while explaining the code. And similar solutions to second question as well, which he approved and accepted as working one. 

To my surprise he didn‚Äôt passed me from the round, I don‚Äôt really know how much more optimised solution he was looking for.

I tried to make him understand that I submitted my tasks to QA, plus there was dependencies and other ad hoc tasks that I had to do, causing the delay. 

He started talking to me in a very unprofessional tone, in hindi, he started to scold me (I my eyes got teared up) for this delay. I also raised my voice saying that ""should I just stop following processes then? will deploy on production without testing, etc.). 

That call went on till 2:30AM. I couldn't sleep that night, and have been feeling anxious since then. I want to switch but unable to make time for interview prep/applying to other jobs for senior software developer. Thanks for reading till here have a good day, now I'll get back to work till I die

1435qwg,Got Placed via a pay after placement program. Honest Review.,"11 months ago, I started the course with Almabetter in their web development program.

Here's the link to the post where I had made my first comment regarding it [https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/w1rykd/almabetter\_data\_science\_program/igm59b9/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/w1rykd/almabetter_data_science_program/igm59b9/?context=3)

&#x200B;

After 11 months, I have been placed with a package of 5 LPA in a finance firm as a fullstack developer. (Pretty good I'd say for someone with no previous tech job and 4 years of gap).

Background: Graduated in 2018, Spent 4 years in UPSC preparation. Failed to crack it. Searched for alternative.

**Review:**

Paid 12k as fees, which was refunded once I entered the placement program and signed ISA for 2 Lakh over 20 months (10K/month).

Almabetter's course like any other *pap* course does not offer anything special. Most of my time was spent on youtube, learning about the techstack (react,node etc), going to watch the lectures to confirm that I understood what I learnt on youtube. We have people from Google, Microsoft and Uber (Yes, I verified their profiles) but I'd say a good developer will not necessarily be a good teacher, and that's what happened.

Approx 6 months in frontend and 3 months in backend, 2 months in placement program + 2 more months giving interviews.

If you think the course is worth paying 2 Lakhs, then you're obviously wrong because there is not a single web development course that is worth that amount.

&#x200B;

**Coming to placements.**

I applied on Naukri along with receiving interviews from the Almabetter team as well.

Currently my last 90 days naukri stats show **6661 search appearances and 253 recruiter actions**.

I had applied to 80 jobs on naukri and many more on linkedin. I received callbacks from not more than 10 HRs and no interviews once I told them I was a fresher with no professional experience whatsoever in web development domain.

&#x200B;

In almabetter I was shortlisted in 7 companies, 2 of them gave first round assignment (failed 1, ghosted by 1), 1 gave an online test (testgorilla) and 4 of them took interviews (3-4 rounds each), out of which I was able to crack 1, while being rejected in 2nd or 3rd round (some coding, some direct rejection).

&#x200B;

Since, my primary aim was to get placed as I had a gap and also had my savings to pay 2 Lakh post placements, I would say I'm satisfied with the program.

&#x200B;

**Should you join Almabetter now?**

Honestly, No.

They have made changes to their program. The pap amount has been increased to 2.4 Lakhs, the initial fees has been increased and the minimum placement salary has been reduced to 5 LPA from earlier 6 LPA.

They do not have 500+ partners. But they do have connections with HRs who are willing to give you a chance but it will be for max 1-2 companies. They send your resumes directly and stay in contact with HR, but the companies decide whether or not to shortlist you. So, pretty much your resume will do the job 90% and 10% the placement team.

&#x200B;

**Overall, if you are graduating or recently graduated, stay away from these programs. You can get placed on your own.**

If you are someone who has a gap, maybe you can look into these but research beforehand. I mean actual research.

&#x200B;

P.S. When people look for reviews for such courses, they often land up on sponsored posts. Hence it was my effort to give people what they actually need to know, since I went through the same stuff.",2023-06-07 06:46:36

192l2z4,Why there is hate for Mtech??,"Like the title said , Why in India there so much negativity about mtech from old IITs , like if you arefr  tier 3/2 collage student who is most probably gonna get 5 LPA or even less ( which is median in many of these collages), Mtech from old IITs seems a good option , all the Old IITs have approx average of 20LPA in circutal branches and moreover you will also get to experience environment in tier 1 collages. 

So why people say grind and improve skills instead of getting masters , like to jump 5 to 20 lpa you are gonna need 2 years atleast anyways and it is more hard IMO, cuz you have to all the things at your own like applying offcampus shit. 

Moreover, If you qualify gate , you get monthly stipend of 12.4 K which make your mtech almost free.

So, I've always loved this sub, and I can see and sense all the frustrations of people searching for jobs, and especially in this market, it's tough, it really is. I recently went through it myself so I'm just putting up my process and journey out here, just in case some or any of you can find it helpful. I'll try and be as detailed as I can, but I won't be addressing anything that might even remotely reveal my idenitity, so believe this if you want but I'm not providing any sort of 'proof', take my word, or don't.

All applications were for a frontend developer job with around 2 YOE and with react as a mandatory requirement (for me, I didnt want to work with angular, vue etc), average range would 12-18 L, location - either bangalore or fully remote, didnt apply for any other city.

Important numbers / dates -

* Old CTC - 13
* New CTC - 16L plus ESOPs - I know its not a big bump but I'm very happy with it.
* Old job left on Nov 2022
* Time spent being on a break - 6 months, nov-april, where I didn't touch code or try to interview or prepare for interviews.
* Job search started - May 2nd
* First offer (taken) - June 14 - around 40 days from start to finish
* Applications on wellfound \- 80 , heard back from 9, 1 went to offer
* Applications on linkedin \- 30, heard back from 1 (after premium inmessage)
* Applications on instahyre  \- 100, heard back from 4 ( I rejected them all as they were all too far for me, commute was 3+ hours)
* Applications on cutshort\- \~50 (mixture of them reaching out and me applying), heard back from 3
* Applications on career websites - 22 (emails sent from me to careers@companyx etc), heard back from 1 (this is the offer I ended up taking)
* Applications on other career sites (pyjama hr, workday etc) - \~20, dont have an exact number for this, around 20 I guess, heard back from 0;
* Take home assignments - 4, average time taken around 4-5 hours, 2 of these seenzoned me, 1 I left now because I already had an offer and wasnt interested further, 1 of them was the one that led to offer#2
* Online assessments - 3, failed 2 and passed 1, the passed company just stalled me and the process never went anywhere, even after 2 weeks they were just asking for more time.
* Face to face interviews - 19, this is the total meetings, including intro calls, etc from google calendar.
* Face to face tech or tech-related interviews - 13
* Bombed interviews - 3
* Timeline for offer #1 (taken) - Call #1 intro call -> Call #2 tech round -> Call #3 with PM -> Call #4 with CTO, offer rolled out on the same day.
* Timeline for offer #2 (not taken, but would have if #1 didnt exist) - Take home assignment -> Call #1 Tech round -> Call #3 CTO round -> Offer after 8 days - This company took too long, step 1 and 2 had 3 weeks b/w them, if they had been quicker I'd have been working there right now lol.

I've listed all the sites already but heres how I would rank them, just my experience, your mileage may vary -

1. Wellfound  \- best for startups, 1-100 teams, good UI, has recently processed flag so you can tell which companies are active. Got the highest hit-rate here. Biggest con would be lack of good filters for INR and search and filter algos are out of whack most of the time.
2. Career sites of companies - this is still the best way to things IMO, even though I received only 1 callback ( that did turn into the offer I'd take), I still think for early stage startups this is the best way to reach out, if you see an opening anywhere else, just go to the website, find their careers page/hr and email them, or linkedin message the HR/founder.
3. Instahyre/cutshort - both are a draw, instahyre got me a few calls, but not for the companies I wanted, cutshort got me 3 good interviews but I screwed up 2 and the other is just stalled. Both the UIs are not great and esplly cutshort is very annoying to use. Instahyre's algorithm for matching jobs is very weird and it ranks you very low if you apply for a job it thinks you're not a good fit for, even when the JD feels like a great fit.
4. LinkedIn - horrible, every new new job would have 100+ applicants within an hour, if I'm lucky, it could even be 1000+, none of my linkedin connects were any help, recruiters who were calling me for interviews before wouldnt even reply now, leaving me on seenzone lol honestly hate linkedin these days. Glad I dont have to go there anymore now.
5. Didnt use - indeed, naukri. Why? Felt it was too crowded, and few startups and salary ranges were low and expectations were sky high.

Why I got as many callbacks as I did (my thoughts, I'm not an expert or anything)

1. Simple resume - I used [flowcv](https://app.flowcv.com/) to make my resume, it was much less than 1 page, it was very very simple, clean and easy to read.
2. Writing a custom CV for every application, without any AI, would spend 4-5 mins on their website, their JD, and try to customize it as much as possible. Nothing fancy or anything, just highlight keywords, skills, experience. Add a custom sentence about how I'll fit in well there, either culturally, with skills or whatever. Highlight unique things about you that might interest them, for me, it was immediate joining, no notice period is a good thing for small startups.
3. Follow up with people on their linkedin - after 7-9 days if I didnt get a response from a job I wanted, Id find their linkedin and message them there, this has given me 2-3 responses on wellfound i.e they've replied on wellfound after I've messaged them on linkedin.
4. Know your target companies, its not the JD that matters, its the people that are hiring and the kind of people they hire. Offer#1 said I need 3 YOE, which I definitely dont have, but I applied anyway, and here we are. Some companies are strict about these things, some aren't, you can sort of tell from their JD, glassdoor, linkedin etc.
5. I would only apply for companies that had good glassdoor ratings OR had a good culture/about page, this increased my chances of getting shortlisted because they have something to lose by not keeping up their responses and they might actually be decent people. I never applied for any company with glassdoor rating lower than 4.
6. No spam, I only applied for where I would join, so I always had some interest to follow up, send a proper CV and stay invested, not just click apply and forget it.

Misteps -

1. Being unprepared - BIG MISTAKE. BIG BIG MISTAKE. I started applying immediately after my break without any prep, and suddenly got a very good interview 4 days in and bombed it. If I didnt, I probably could have gotten a better package AND wouldn't have to suffer this stress for another 30+ days. FFS I curse myself everyday. Imagine getting a job the first week, it would have been amazing. Damn.
2. Too much leetcode - Yes, leetcode is important, but for my role - Frontend, leetcode was minimal at startups, the very basic ones, easy mostly, they're important for online assessments thats bout it, wasted around a week trying to grind leetcode and I still couldnt understand anything and it never was an issue in interviews. THIS IS NOT TO SAY YOU DONT NEED GOOD DSA SKILLS. Basics like array manipulation, recursion, Dp are IMPORTANT. But mostly it was a combination of react with DSA instead of leetcode. Ex - render a component with a data object with n children.
3. Building a portfolio project - built something with typescript and next.js hoping it will help me stand out, but nobody cared or asked about it, or if they did, they never told me, took 1 week, probably a waste of time, if you're an experienced dev, wouldnt bother, if you're a fresher this is very important.
4. Scheduling multiple interviews in a day - I was in a hurry so I scheduled multiple calls in the same day, and it was bad, one of them went over by 40 mins and then i was tired and didnt do the next one very well. Thankfully I wasnt very into it but yeah, try and avoid this, or schedule them a lot of time apart.

Overall some tips from me from what has worked for me -

* Keep your resume simple, keep your cv simple, avoid AI, avoid spamming if you can.
* Know your targets, culturally, ctc wise and tech wise.
* Keep a number in your mind while negotiating but never say it firmly if you're truly interested, always say there's room for negotiation (if you're desperate for a job, otherwise, go for it)
* For javascript and frontend specifically be very thorough on these topics  
Closures, this object, prototype, events, event loop, callstack, let, var, const, basic OOP, css flex/grid, react virtual dom, why vdom, why react, what and how does diffing work. And practice gotcha questions and output based questions too, some of them ask random stuff. [react questions](https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions), [js questions](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions)
* For DSA - neetcode 75, should be okay for my range at least, more than problems understand the logic and be sure to communicate in interviews. In offer#1 I couldnt complete my tech assessment in time but they said I communicated it well enough that they were okay moving me up.
* Be in a calm environment, drink some water during interviews. They're also just devs, try and be yourself, be casual, try and build a rapport, talk a lot and think more, code only when you're sure.
* BE CAREFUL OF ONLINE ASSESSMENT PLATFORMS - so i failed 2 of my online tests, and I went to that platform and took a demo test and it would tell me I was cheating (eyes away, switched tabs, etc) even when I wasnt, be very careful and try and be facing the camera as much as possible and dont hit accidental keys lol.
* If you get a take-home assignment, really weigh the benefits of doing it, if it takes a lot of time. 2 of my assignments ghosted me and I put significant time into it :(

Closing thoughts -

I rejected around 5-6 companies because of their strict wfo policy, or their office was very far from where I live (3h+ daily commute) IDK if they would have turned into offers, I was hopeful for one, the rest probably not. Nobody cared that I was on a break, I was only asked about it once and even they said it's fine, and personally it was a huge thing for me.Actually most of the tech people thought I was still at my last job, just goes to show that they dont really read resumes properly lol.

Getting the initial call/email was the hardest, after callback/email, all the companies and recruiters I've talked to have been wonderful, I've learnt a lot about interviews, tech, companies and people in general. Everyone genuinely seemed like they wanted to help and I didnt come across any hostile or egoistic engineer or cto or recruiter either, they were all very cool, some of them reached out after I declined their offer/round and gave me their number for next time, 10/10 wholesome.

The past month was very stressful, my hairfall got exponentially worse and I had stress headaches too, but I never stopped trying, kept applying, and I never reduced my expected ctc, reaching out etc. I know a lot of you went through much worse, hang in there. Shout out to my family and friends, who were always supportive and never once doubted me. I did calm down after the first 3 weeks, and got more focused and less stressed but yeah, not a fun time. It almost reversed all the fun I had in my break.

Finally, this might be a very bitter or harsh thing to say, and if you wanna downvote me, go ahead, but there are jobs, there are companies, lots of them, most of the companies I interviewed said they're having a hard time finding good candidates, if you're not getting callbacks, it's not the market, yes, its relatively bad right now, especially for freshers, but you still can get a job.

It's either your skills, your resume, your way of reaching out, your job platform or a combination of all of those. Finding a job is a skill in itself. It is. Blind applying on linkedin, grinding leetcode and crying about it to my network wont do jack shit for me. If you're 1/20000 applicants, you're getting nowhere. Know where you can apply to maximize your odds, hopefully this post helps with that.

Having said that, hiring is broken in India, it really is, so don't be too hard on yourself, its fucked up on both sides. But that's the reality, you have to function within that, find ways to beat the system, whatever that is.

Sorry if this is too long or too short, I didnt really structure this well, like I'm lazy and I'm tired but I wanted to make this just in case it helped someone, so if you have any questions please ask here in the comments so it can be helpful for others as well, but like I said, I'm not giving any personal info about any of this. Pls don't send me your resumes, if you want me to review them, make an anonymous version (remove all personal info) and share that, I'll try to give my inputs.

Putting ""Not looking"" into all these websites was the best feeling haha.

I hope this was helpful, I'm too lazy to do that data flow thingy and all, all these numbers are approx from me literally counting them lol, but yeah general picture, I've tried to be as transparent as I can be. I truly hope you find your job soon if you're looking, it's really hell to be in that position, hang in there, keep going, you'll get there. Now, I will go get drunk, eat like a pig and sleep for 3 straight days. Take care of yourself guys, warm hugs.",2023-06-15 08:49:59

17ajwry,Got fired today because a colleague badmouthed me,"So, I work in a startup in Jaipur. The company is in the gaming space and I am a full stack dev there. I usually start work at 10 AM & leave the office at around 9 PM at night, there is one colleague who stays 11-12 PM at night with the manager and bad mouths everyone on the team, he told my skip manager that I leave early from office &  start late.  This led my skip manager to fire me b/c he thinks I am not working office hours, wtf, how many hours do they want me to work 24/7?

This company is a very early-stage startup(they don't even have any page/website/LinkedIn page) and people there work their asses off, sometimes, I have seen people stay at 1-2 AM at night. So, most of the managers expect people to stay late at night and work. There is no exit timing but the start timing is fixed at 10 - 11 AM.

I am not sure what to do now, I am fresher, and looking at the job market I don't think I will be able to get a job very soon.

Can anyone guide me on how to land a job? any openings anywhere?  


EDIT - The founders of the company live in the USA so most of the meetings are scheduled late at night IST. So people are forced to stay at night time due to meetings.  
Founders don't care about the meeting timing or they don't bother to schedule the meeting at IST time they do it whenever they want it.

17njabg,How do deal with juniors who work too much and know nothing.,"I am a service based employee working at a PBC as a contractor. I work on a large codebase and I have written thousands of lines of code in it. Recently a college fresher has joined this company at 3X my package but he doesn't have any relevant dev skills.

Keeps asking me for a lot of technical doubts and pulling on calls with things which can be done with a simple Google search. 

But he overcomes this lack of knowledge with overwork and extra work. For example after bombarding me with tons of technical doubts and finishing his story.

He started to look into the code and reading through all of it and then when he find some commit message that is wrong or some small flaw in a function name or code (nothing big but just small minor semantic changes here and there), he pings me with a ""I found this, kindly check."" As if he's my boss or something.

I have written a lot of code and all of that has passed QA and many things are in UAT and production. I value my time and fix things when something breaks in QA or when I am writing code for some story and related function or a piece of code has some problem.


I feel that he's new so he is feeling this need to prove himself or something and trying to do things which lead to a good resume for him or something which might not be wrong.. but I don't want to ruin my work life balance for his goals.

I feel somewhat stupid now for answering his doubts and teaching him to be honest, I feel like bailing and avoiding him in the future wherever I can.

Is my mindset wrong?

How should I deal with this junior.",2023-11-04 11:02:23

TLDR: Google and Amazon are trying to lay-off employees in Europe by paying 1 year salary so that employees voluntarily quit as they can't outright fire so many people due to strict labour laws.

On one hand, this is how the labour laws of every country should be, but on the other hand, this is the exact reason why more jobs are outsourced to India.

1acujlx,How to restart after bluffing for 5 years in IT? Feeling stuck,"I passed my B.tech from average private engineering college but in 4th year I realized I am not interested in coding that much but had to find job due to financial issues and education loan.

I got placed into WITCH company, worked as backend API cloud developer although I didn't enjoyed my worked but became top performer because I did hardwork and got several accolades but was at 5 lakhs.

Now my huge mistake, switched to another WITCH, got offer for my first interview only at 9 LPA was so happy but this turned out be worst decision of life. First 6 months there was bench, lost my will to learn, was sleeping all time due to wfh then allocated to a toxic project now being a slog to working 13-14 hours I got frustrated and resigned without offer but after struggle got offer in another WITCH at 14LPA. So basically stayed for 1 year in 2nd company.

In 3rd company for 1 year work was very light and great team but nothing new. From this year they transferred me to devops from development.

So my concern is after 5 years and at 14LPA  I don't know anything properly. I somehow make things work you can say hindi word JUGAAD. If you will compare I haven't learnt nothing new in last 2 years and have become so lazy. Sometimes I google, take help from teammates etc and eventually trying to sustain but honestly speaking I don't even know the basic of technologies I have been working upon and since my experience is increasing I don't think I can sustain like this longer but I will have to make this work since I have analysed and I have no other option left.

I also suffer from imposter syndrome, always get a feeling my teammates will get to know that I don't have basic technical knowledge also and will get fired desoite of several appreciation mails and accolades I think I am lucky dumbass who somehow got it and they will know the truth soon.

Since I got transferred to Devops, I want to give my career a restart. How to work on my career? 

I want to dedicate myself and switch to a product based company and really become good af what I do.

I know there are many people who became zero to hero here...pls help me how to progress in my career.

Since lots of people asked my skills are mentioned below:

Languages - Python, Node.js, 
Platforms - AWS, Azure, 
Tools - Git, Docker & Kubernetes, 
DB - Postgresql, Mysql

I applied to many internships and got interview for 4 and at last I landed this however after joining it quickly became obvious that work culture is not something I enjoyed but it wasn't bad either, timings however were little fucked as some colleagues operated from other side of the world it was 11am-5/6pm then 11pm to 1am
I was desperate so I agreed

Before the day of getting fired they told me I am not putting enough work and 8 hours is too less, i said I am doing what i can and am unable to do more than that, they told me they'll multiply my pay with good amt (i didn't ask how much) but I need to be available from 11am to 11pm (which may get extended to 1 am) now normally I'd accept it with good pay however due to family reasons it was simply impossible for me, my schedule was tight packed from 6-10, i explained them I can't and explained my situation they told me to think abt it, i talked with my mother and she also said if they're paying good then there's no harm so I was going to agree however before I could do that in meeting next day I was told they've decided to let me go, i didn't ask much questions and just said ok, they provided me with a formal internship certificate too with standard contents like ""your skills have benefitted us"" etc

129d4lt,Final rant on Cognizant,"So this is my final rant (cautionary post) about Cognizant and how they treat their employees.

This post is specifically for 2023 passout and future batches.

So here it starts.

What WITCH companies like Cognizant do is that they come for on campus placements at the very beginning of placement season in all the colleges/universities so that they can trap all the desperate or sometimes intelligent students so that those students become ineligible for further on campus placements and have to move on with Cognizant in the future.

What happens next is you will receive your letter of intent after approx one month of selection and your offer letter with salary details which is literally peanuts for living in a tier 1 or 2 City.

After that letter of intent, you will receive the option to either select internship or CSD for training before becoming FTE at Cognizant.

Keep in mind that internship seats are limited and those who are not selected for internships will be automatically placed in CSD program.

Now what's the difference between internship and CSD?

Internship is simply a paid internship with approx 10-12k per month stipend along with internship completion certificate. And this internship happens offline at Cognizant office.

On the other hand, CSD is literally unpaid training at Cognizant without any completion certificate which has to be completed from home. They will try to lure you with the fact that they will give you a skilling bonus of 25K (for the entire duration of CSD training, which lasts for 3-5 months) for completing the CSD training.

But the catch here is that you will not even receive that 25k unless you become a FTE. So you can guess it, they will delay your onboarding for infinity unless you give up and join another company after wasting your time here.

A lot of people feel lucky that they got placed in such a big MNC and stop learning new tech. That's where you make the biggest mistake.

Keep in mind that internship happens while you are still in college/university but CSD happens after your graduation. So you will waste your time if you choose/get CSD training.

Now what happens is, Cognizant gets the chance to cherry pick the top candidates for their internship and sends them the internship offer letter.

And the rest of them are placed in an uncertain CSD program and who knows when they complete this training period and onboard you as FTE.

If you are lucky, you will get the internship from Cognizant with stipend and certificate.

And if you are the unlucky one who don't get internship. Run.......

Unless you have any other offer in hand or really desperate for this job and your parents can support you at home, only then go with CSD.

So what happens in internship and CSD?

The timing of internships are 9 to 7 and you will trained on a specific domain either you like it or not. And if you want to change the domain, you will lose your internship and will be placed in the uncertain unpaid CSD training.

Recently, Cognizant started giving same learning pattern to both interns and CSD trainees.

So CSD people have to grind the same way as interns grind in training but without any pay.

Final project at end of training?

Some domains have a final project at the end of the training period. And no offense but Cognizant picks the least hireable people in the market aka slackers.

These slackers usually come from rich background and are unwilling (or I can say that they don't know anything) to do contribute to the project work. And then there are some people like me whose time got wasted at this company, who were desperate for a job, who were blinded by the big company name, do all the project work.

What actions does Cognizant take against those slackers?

Nothing, they don't care. The slackers will sit comfortably and the mentor (Kind of manager/boss in training) will force you to complete all the project work even after knowing that others are not working and at the end, they show the higher management that everyone contributed to the project but in reality, only a few people contributed to that project.

In simple words, slackers will get credit for the work you do.

And that's it. Training ends but the uncertain period has just started.

Even if you get internship, it might take them months to onboard you and after all the interns are onboarded, then comes the turn for CSD people to be onboarded.

Even I(2022 batch) completed CSD program in Feb 2023 but they started training interns of the 2023 batch with stipend.

They deserve internship plus stipend but I don't even deserve a single penny for the blood and sweat I pour into CSD training and still waiting for Date of joining.

So always make a wise decision and don't be desperate for any job.

Edit : a word

Edit 2 : Another reason I am stuck here at Cognizant was because of the Training and Placement cell of my university. When Cognizant came to our campus, T&P cell didn't mention about the mandatory internship/CSD training in the placement notification. It was only mentioned that all the selected candidates will become FTE with 4LPA package. Nothing else.

While in other companies placement notification, everything was mentioned clearly from training period to stipend to FTE joining, everything.",2023-04-02 06:59:59

18v3mqj,Architect forcing me to add verbs in rest api,"I am working in seed funded start up in india as a sde. We had java tech stack before this Architect joined. He changed java to nestJS saying java is slow.
Now brings this new standard where we have to put verbs in rest api like / getLoggedinUserDetail, /
getBookingDetailByuserld . As per him this helps in QA automation. God knows. We are 6 months old start up and he created 30 micro-services and team don't know what features belong to which services as they are highly overlapped. And there is wired systems design.
30 micro services but all are connected to one database and cross schema join and relationship. Backend services are connected to Hasura and do graphal queries send response to bff gateways then to kong api gateway then consumed by react app.
He says Hasura is ORM replacement. Whenever I raised my concerns he revoked my access and makes changes to my respos which own.
Have you ever face this?

TL;DR at the bottom.

I joined this Mumbai-based company as a data analyst. Things were fair for about a year until everything started going south in a matter of a few weeks.

Everyone quit. Or were laid off. My lead, manager, the project owner - all out.

This whole project came to my head. Since we don't have a manager, the managing director of this company is leading this project. With me being the sole analyst, reporter, manager, dev - you name it.

I've been doing my best to handle this project. But this is a work of a whole team that I'm doing alone & naturally, there's too much to do and little time to do so. This triggers the MD who stacks every brick on my shoulders.

Things have gone so bad that this guy abuses me with literal cuss words in front of our clients. He plays mental tricks, denies genuine sick leaves even with proper evidence, and traumatizes me in a way it's hard to put into words.

I'm afraid to break my notice period, which still has a couple of months remaining, as it might hinder my switch to another organization.

I feel trapped. Things incrementally worsened since I resigned, and I still have 2 months to go.

**Help me.**

**TL;DR**. Data analyst serving notice period (60d remaining). Handling the whole project on my own. Facing threats, abuses, and daily tantrums by MD. Genuine sick leaves denied. Afraid to break notice to not hinder switch plans. Not well mentally or physically. Seeking a way out.",2023-04-14 10:41:00

18p3ipg,"C programmers, listen up","Aloha, folks.

Throughout all the years I've been programming in C, I've come across a lot-- and I mean a LOT-- of incorrect articles and videos on C that promise to teach you the language. In fact, majority of the stuff out there on the internet on the language is guaranteed to help you with your rituals of summoning nasal demons. If you're expecting to learn C from your school or college, don't hold onto that hope either. Most schools and colleges, at least in India, will teach you incorrect C. Even courses like Harvard's CS50 is, quite unfortunately, not an exception, at least when it comes to the parts where it teaches you the language. I've read a couple of books on C as well, including the (in)famous Let Us C, and most of them were filled with false information. Let Us C was definitely the worst of the bunch though; in fact, I have yet to come across a book worse than that. I've also seen a lot of folks learning the language from sites like geeksforgeeks and javatpoint, and if you're one of those people, I'd recommend you to stay 4 miles away from these sites. Now as for what you _should_ do to learn _correct_ C: if you're not familiar at all with the language, The C Programming Language (2nd Edition), though very much outdated, might help you to get started. Then you should select a version of C you would like to learn. I started with C11, and C11 and C17 are still my personal favorites. If you're a beginner and are wondering which would be the best version to learn, there is not any ""best"" version, but I'd recommend starting with C17. If you're a student and can't yet buy the standards, there exist draft versions of them [here](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html). Some of them are pretty similar to the final standards, and you can read them for absolutely free. Now, the standards aren't really meant for beginners, so once you've selected a specific version, go to [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), apply the `C` tag-- and optionally a version-specific one as well-- and start reading random questions on the language, especially the ones tagged `language-lawyer`. This helped me quite a bit when I first started learning the language; you will come across a lot of things that you didn't know about before. While doing this, continue reading the standard on the side. You will never understand a specific concept on the first read, so keep on reading until you are confident enough you have understood (and interpreted (some of the statements in the standard can be a bit vague)) it right.

The first paragraph mostly applies to beginners. If you're someone who writes C for a living and yet haven't read a standard, I'd recommend you to do so. The amount of non-confroming code I have seen some people who claim to be using C for 15 or some years write, still baffles me. Reading a standard doesn't take that long.

TL;DR
1. Read the standard for whatever version of C you're using.
3. If you can't buy a standard yet, there exist free drafts of them [here](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html).
4. If you're a beginner, The C Programming Language (2nd Edition) and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) are good resources, even though the former might be a bit outdated.
5. Avoid sites like geeksforgeeks and javatpoint if you're learning C.
6. Avoid Let Us C and similar books.
7. Avoid CodeWithHarry, Neso Academy, Technology Gyan, Apna College, and others for learning C.
8. Schools and colleges will very likely teach you incorrect C.

Edit: For people wanting to know why I claimed the specific sources I talked about in my post to be spreading incorrect information, I will write a separate post on them along with relevant standard references for the language lawyers out there soon. It's hard to cram all of them in the comments.",2023-12-23 11:11:18
16tpoye,Closing Our First Startup: A Bittersweet Journey,"Hello fellow devs,

I'd like to share our startup story with you today, and it comes with mixed emotions as we bid farewell to our very first venture. (TL;DR at the bottom)

Me and my 5 friends (5 from B.Tech. and 1 from B.Tech + LLB) had a brilliant idea. However, we made our fair share of rookie mistakes right from the start. 

Our very first (And the biggest) mistake was that we didn't do any sort of market research. We just came to the conclusion that if we think people need this then people actually need this.... 

Our second mistakle: Didn't plan anything.  We coded away without a clear plan in mind. The result? An absolute mess, 5 noob coders with vastly different coding styles and no professionalism. Oh god the code base was garbage. We all agreed it was shiiit. We realized our mistake and began again, this time with a better plan, resulting in a codebase that, while not perfect, was at least serviceable. It took us a year and a half to get to this point. 

Finally, when we got the tech resolved we started searching for the investers. It's extremely hard to even get a chance to talk to the investors when you are 19yo second year studfent from a tier 3 college. Those interested in investing were demanding a staggering 75% stake in our company ‚Äì an offer we couldn't accept.

We got tired of investor hunting and thought let's bootstrap it (Turns out it was a good idea in the end). We pooled our resources, registered the company, purchased a domain, and launched the website. 

Third mistake: We thought an investor only brings money to the company. But NO!!! they also bring connection and experience, I regularly think it might have been different if we had an investor with industry connection and industry experience.

Initially, we experienced some success, likely due to the support of our family, college friends, and teachers. However, our earnings were far from substantial, and it took us eight months to break even. 

Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse after eight to nine months. Our customer base dwindled, returning customers became scarce, and new customers from ads barely stuck around. We were barely breaking even and heading downhill fast. 

Last Sunday, we held a final meeting and collectively decided to shut down the company. Starting on Monday, we began the process of winding down our services: we surrendered the domain, deleted the database, took down the hosting, archived the GitHub repository, and closed our mailing service account. We also initiated the cancellation of our GST registration. While the technical aspects are sorted out, there's still some legal work to complete. As I write this, I've just closed the last chapter by shutting down our mailing service account. Now, I'm pondering what's next.

Because we kept the company bootstrapped we have zero debt, and no pressure from any investor.

I have a job, so I'm not unemployed, but our startup used to be the driving force that motivated me to return home early from the office and continue working in the evening. Now, my evenings will be empty. 

Nonetheless, I'm grateful for this experience. We learned a great deal, not only about technology but also about the legal intricacies of running a company. We learned from our mistakes. 

Now, it's on to a new adventure: brainstorming a better startup idea and starting all over again. I don't wanna giveup on my startup dream. I believe someday I'll have a brilliant startup and It will be succesfull.

TL;DR (Generated by ChatGPT): A group of friends started a startup without market research or a clear plan, leading to a messy codebase. Investor struggles and a lack of connections added to the challenges. Initial success with support from friends, but later a decline in customers forced them to shut down. They learned valuable lessons and now plan to start a new venture, undeterred by the past. ",2023-09-27 16:49:46

Give your everything; this will reflect on your personality as well.

15n5kad,What is the logic behind firing existing high-performing devs and retaining newly joined comparitively overpaid devs?,"So some of the companies that I've recently seen and also heard from some peers, are hiring techies at exorbitantly high salaries, which is fine. But then they are axing existing techies who are doing the same amount and quality of work at the same role for a much lower salary.

I understand that a company might need to cut costs but logically shouldn't they be letting go of the high-paid individuals who have newly joined and have no clear understanding of the job yet.

One reason that I could think of behind these kind of layoffs is the age of the existing employees. Most of these comparitively underpaid employees are either getting old (say late 30s or early 40s) or are veterans in a company, so if a company wants to only hire fresh faces, then it makes sense to fire the existing. But I don't think many companies care so much about optics.

Another reason could be this weird fetish of hiring as many laid-off FAANG devs as possible at matching (or higher) salaries for roles and levels that are currently being handled by folks for much much less pay. Imagine a colleague with lesser experience than you working on same tech stack and delivering same quality work but getting paid thrice your salary. And when the push comes to shove,  it's the existing employee that's thrown out first! It's a terrible practice.

\*\*Why am I doing this?\*\*I have gone through most of the experiences in life during 8 years of work, I just want to impart those learning to the fellow folks who feel they are stuck somewhere in there career

**What makes me eligible to advise you?**

1. I have seen journey of 3 LPA to 70+ LPA
2. I have worked with almost a service company
3. I have been laid off in the past
4. I have co-founded a company as a CTO: scaled to 10,000 paying users (Not a part of it now)
5. Belongs to tier 3 private university, tier 2 city
6. Very average student through out my career.
7. Worked for free to learn actual coding.
8. Never been a part of any coding bootcamp (self taught developer)
9. **Never Lost Hope**

About me: I am an experienced software engineer with 8 yoe, I have experience of building a lot of products from scratch and scaling them for millions of users.

You can simply fill out your details here, I will reach out to all of you (**I promise**):[https://forms.gle/aFCw8Z3E11WacsMV6](https://forms.gle/aFCw8Z3E11WacsMV6)

PS: I am not a youtuber or any content creator. I am solely doing this for the community.

**EDIT 1:** Thanks for the responses guys. I am going through all the responses and trying to group them categorically. Once i am done with the process i will send each one out a calendly link to have 1:1 . Also, This is not any paid course or anything. I have no intention to bank on anyone's suffering. This is purely ""Back to community"". No other intention at all.  


**EDIT 2:**  I dont know, how should i thank you guys for believing in me and the cause. Due to the overwhelming respose. I would definitely need some help from the experienced techies to scale this cause. Time to give back to the community folks! Drop me a DM if you can connect to the cause.",2024-01-03 12:59:27
15m51o7,My Experience with firing a colleague,"This  has been bugging for some time. For the context, I came back to  development (has past experience of 5 years) as a backend lead for a  tech startup with a gap of around 4 years. Couple of things about the  tech team was that almost all of them were competent with good sense of  ownership. I enjoyed working with most of the folks and was pleasantly  surprised with most of them, with how they are able to pick up tasks  despite their less experience.

After  a couple of months, I had to lead a team with a junior dev (1.5 yrs  exp, 2nd company). From the start, I was impressed with the enthusiasm  she had shown, however, noticed that outcome is no where. I talked to  her and came to realise that the tech stack of the current company(node)  is different from her previous(Java). She said that she was struggling  with node and has been juggling multiple teams internally (she was already  working with the company for 6+ months).

I  always felt that node is one of the easiest ~~languages~~ to pick up.  Nevertheless, I asked her to brush up on her skills in node and asked  her to work on a mock project (simple crud application using express)  for a couple of weeks so that she will get more comfortable with node. I  covered her tasks during that time. However even after the project, I did not  find any tangible improvement where I felt comfortable to give tasks to.

I  used to allocate tasks which could be easily done irrespective of  personal skill and noticed that she was having trouble with even those  tasks. So I got on a personal chat with her (this is like 1+ month post  her joining my team), tried to explain some basics of node and asked her to take a week for going through the existing code base. After  the week, I asked her to take up a task which involves minor change in  the existing code base, which she was not able to. Now I began to doubt  if she had even put in effort to understand the code base. So I asked  her to explain the flow of the code base, which she failed miserably.

This  is where I lost my cool to a certain extent as I felt that the trust I  had put on her has not been reciprocated. I have always been candid with my colleagues with regards to their work/skill and I personally always  believe that feedback (good or bad) is needed to grow professionally and  individually. I gave a brutally honest and candid feedback on her  skills. However, communication is not my strong suite and  unintentionally I may have been too on the face (borderline aggressive  and came strongly according to her) which might have made her feel  uncomfortable.

After couple of  weeks, the director of engineering (whom I report to) had a chat with me with regards to her performance  and I gave my feedback honestly. We then put her on a unofficial PIP for  1 month, which involves some code refactor and some  future enhancements we are planning to do on the project which she has  now worked for more than 2.5 months. Post this PIP, I observed she was  able to improve quite a bit, but not to the extent that we can be  comfortable with providing tasks independently. I shared my feedback  with the director again, who shared it with HR.

Post  this we had to put her on official PIP for a time period of 1 more  month. This time, the PIP involved existing project and a new project. I  observed some more improvement but again not to the extent which is  enough in my opinion, where she can take tasks independently. I shared  the same with the director and HR. Post this, HR decided to fire her.

It  is at this point that she complained to HR that I was verbally  aggressive towards her on one occasion. HR reported the same to  director and director informed me about the same. Till this point, I  felt that I was harsh with the feedback but never felt that I crossed  the line (which obviously was not the case as per her experience) and  felt shocked. The director vouched for my character with the HR. I then  mailed to the junior explaining that it was never my intention to make  her feel uncomfortable and I felt that the feedback though harsh was  within professional limits. Nevertheless, I apologized sincerely that  she had to go through such an unpleasant experience and that I will take  it as a feedback and improve myself. However, I always felt that I was  more or less giving a corporate apology just in case it became a bigger  issue.

This happened last year  November/December, but the whole thing has left a big impression on me,  doubting myself. Though, I stand by my feedback, I always felt may be I  could have handled the whole thing much better and could have a helped  out a junior just like my seniors have done when I was in a similar  position.

So fellow  developers/managers, assuming that I am white washing a lot of details  just to make myself feel better what is the road not taken by me here.  Be as honest on what I could improve and how you may have handled this  scenario.

1abk7im,Made a pretty bad mistake,"I just want to share what I did a few minutes ago. I had a client interview at a company yesterday after completing two technical interviews.

Out of curiosity and impatience, I tried to push my HR to get an update on the client interview by Monday. This is the mail I sent.

**Hi AAA. Hope you are doing well.**

**Need a help. I have got an offer from ZZZ¬†last night for the same role for which I am supposed to confirm by 29th Jan 2024, Monday.**¬†

**I am inclined to join YYY, so just wanted to know if we are through in all the rounds to confirm my role at YYY before confirming the other company.**

**I know I'm rushing. But since I am nearing deadlines, I hope you can understand. Can you help me in letting know the status by today or Monday max if possible?**

**Thanks for all the help.**

I sent this from my phone. And damn, I missed to check that it was CC'ed to all the people from the client panel.

Bad. Pretty bad. I am sure on how this mail would have given ugly impression to the entire team.

I did the best throughout all my interviews for this company. But now I know, I lost it.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE** : Guys, know what!? Despite all this, I got this offer, with a 10% further raise!",2024-01-26 14:57:14
158codn,"Tips for young developers, who find programming overwhelming :)","There are so many languages and frameworks. LinkedIn and Twitter are filled with diverse opinions and advice for young engineers. There are debates around DSA vs development, backend vs frontend, OOP or no OOP.

It can be too much to process for someone just getting into the world of tech.

The cherry on top - there are only a limited number of jobs. Resume selection in itself is a huge mountain. As a college student, you are expected to have internships, projects, extracurriculars and a 90 percentile CGPA.

How can someone not feel like giving up? My suggestion: Focus on TODAY. Pick ONE language + ONE framework.

Everything else, the concepts and logic can be implemented in other languages with some syntax tweaks.

If you are confused about which language to pick, some of the most popular options are:

1. Java + SprinBoot
2. Python + Django
3. Ruby + Rails (reach out to me if you aren't sure which language is best suited for you)

After working with some of the best in the field, I realised that longevity comes down to two things primarily (of course, it is an oversimplification, but hear me out) -

1. Curiosity
2. Consistency

Plan for today.

* Make a commitment that¬†*'I will learn {insert a programming concept, eg: HashMap} today'*.
* Don't overcommit. Start small.
* Make incremental progress. Remember the famous maths: 1.01\^365 >>> 0.99\^365.

Check if you are good on your promise when you end your day. If not, the day hasn't ended for you.

**This is the consistency part.**

Don't just try to solve the problem. Know the fundamentals - what are they used for? What can we do with the concepts? Who invented them? What was the motivation behind the invention?

Let's take an example of a queue - it's FIFO (first in first out). Think of the big billion days on Flipkart. There are 100 phones on sale and 1000 concurrent buyers. How would you avoid double sale of the same item?

**This is the curiosity part.**

Lastly, try not to fall into the trap of comparing your journey with someone else. You don't know the full context. If you are trying your best, that's good enough. Looking at everything at once can and will make you anxious.

We have tried to make learning programming super fun by focussing on curiosity and consistency, at SkillCaptain. Learn one concept every day, practise it with an example and get your assignment reviewed by mentors like me. If you are starting to learn from zero and want to reach a point where you create your REST APIs, you can explore¬†[skillcaptain.app](http://skillcaptain.app/),¬†[tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm),¬†[educative.io](https://www.educative.io/).

184bjy0,For people interested in learning coding.,"**Edit :** I have lots of DMs and responses here. I am replying to them one by one. Also I will try to create a syllabus for the first few months to tell you what exactly I am planning to teach. This course might be good for someone who is beginning. Not for someone who knows coding and just needs mentorship. I will see what I can do for all the mentorship requests too.

I want to teach and mentor a few people starting early January or late December.

**About the course**

We won't be following bootcamp style topics. First few months, I will be teaching you how to program using python (or racket) and we will be learning problem solving and coding. Once you are comfortable with coding, every student will be given an option to choose what they want to learn next (web dev / mobile development / or something else). Then I will teach ideas around those topics and mentor you on those topics. Idea is to get you comfortable learning and working on technology you need to. Come with an idea of what you want to build and we will help you build that.

So assume a month or 2 to get comfortable with coding. And the next 4-6 months to get comfortable on the topic of your interest.

I can only manage around 5 to 10 people in the first cohort as it is the first time and I want to see if I can do justice to everyone.

**Cost :** None, just your time.

**For**

For anyone interested in learning coding. You could be some one trying to switch a career, or a PM trying to learn coding or some one just want to launch a startup. All that matters is that you are motivated and have time.

**Pre-requisites**

\- Motivation and belief to learn.

\- Perseverance to continue learning even on bad days.

**Gotchas**

\- I cannot promise that I can motivate you to learn.

\- I cannot promise an interview call. Companies are weird when recruiting people with non-traditional background. But we will build a portfolio for each one of you.

**Why**

I am planning to take a break from Jan 2024. I have always wanted to mentor / teach others. But never tried it before. So thought of giving it a go now. Also the idea of making a positive change to someone else's life is intriguing.

**About me**

Ex-google. But never felt comfortable working in office environment. Freelancing as a mobile developer for quite some time. Comfortable with mobile / web development. Currently trying to learn ML / AI.

If you are interested,  please feel free to reply to this post or DM me a bit about you and why you want to learn coding. Even if you want to stay anonymous, It is fine. We will mostly be conducting it using Zoom and Discord and you can continue remaining anonymous till you are comfortable.

&#x200B;

**Sorry** could not respond to all of you yet. It blew up beyond my expectations. I will surely respond to you one by one.

**Answers to common questions asked till now**

\- You don't need any background in coding or tech. Just motivation to learn.

\- I was hoping to help people who don't know coding to learn coding.  I received a lot of requests from people who know coding already. I will respond to each and every one of you and have a plan.

\- Classes would be mostly on Saturdays (and some Sundays) for 2 hours. And then there will be assignments for you to try. I will always be available on discord to respond to your doubts.

\- Mostly you will need to put in at max 10 hours per week.

\- Initially it would be concentrated on problem solving and coding in a language (mostly python or racket). Once you are comfortable, switching languages should be easy. Will make sure that you can learn other languages easily.

12fbp74,How married devs taking priority with respect WLB vs salary. Highly confused.,"Rant:

Myself a Fullstack developer currently working in a small company in chennai on remote. Need to go office once a week. The salary is 15.5LPA for 7 years of experience with a wife and 4 year old kid. The thing is what to choose at this point of time, I'm somewhat happy with my salary. I get around 1.1Lpm after tax and wife earns around 25K. our expenses are only 30K so we save around 1L monthly chennai.

 In current company the WLB is so good that I can logout at 6pm daily without thinking about issues. The job is also somewhat challenging with work spanning from dotnet, azure, terraform etc. 

Now whenever I look into reddit / fishbowl I can see large pay for some juniors with a less experience. I feel like I have a good capacity to earn well if I switch companies. But the comfort zone the amount of WLB I get from this company makes me to worry what happens if i switch company. I also given some interview the things is companies are ready to give only upto 20LPA in chennai location. Many calls which i receive is from bangalore who are ready to give 25LPA.

so im highly confused between whether what to choose a happy life with a okay pay. Move out of comfort zone like moving from chennai to bangalore for a high pay. So i can reach good level in life. 

On moving to bangalore things that may take a toll are the rent, child education, support from family when we are not feeling well, wife might leave her job or I can move alone and visit to chennai couple of weeks. 

I don't know how married devs take the decisions kind of breaking my head on what to go forward makes me sleepless.

14d65vp,Why not move on and avoid making Bangalore hell?,"This is something I have been willing to ask people for a long time now.

Almost all big and good product companies and startups are moving or opening offices in Bangalore. Recruiters reach out for jobs based out of Bangalore only. I also see a lot of colleagues and acquaintances moving there for lucrative jobs

While I agree that Bangalore has the best weather in  India out of all major cities, and even the best opportunities for CS folks or developers in general. And, boy! people who have moved to Bangalore never fail to boast about it ""we have the best weather, best air, highest paying packages""

But don't you guys think you're only killing that city? 

&#x200B;

Every day companies are expanding in Bangalore, some are closing offices in other cities and consolidating  all their staff in Bangalore itself. this will put a lot of burden on already struggling infrastructure.

&#x200B;

So I have questions for different categories of people:  


**To the founders, decision makers, leaders of companies of startups here**: Why not try other cities? I believe a lot of you are moving to Bangalore because you get good talent there. But don't you know that talent is also moving there because you guys are going there? 

&#x200B;

**To people who are looking for jobs:** If you can afford to, why don't you say no to the recruiters who say we only have Bangalore location? Why give in to the companies' pressure if you can get similar jobs in other cities which may be closer to your hometowns? (like Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon, Noida, Hyderabad, etc). They are hiring for Bangalore because talented people like you go there in huge numbers. If more people start declining it, companies will start expanding to other cities, maybe even tier 2 cities someday.

&#x200B;

**To the local administration**: Instead of building IT park after IT park in Bangalore itself. first spend money on improving infrastructure to sustain the existing load of the city. why inviting more companies to setup companies when you already know traffic situation is hell in your city?

&#x200B;

**to the central government (not sure if message will ever reach them)** : why are you not trying to spread out this industry? give incentives to companies for setting up offices in smaller cities, and stop incentivizing them for setting up in Bangalore (or other cities with infra issues)  


Looking to hear views. i am sure I am not thinking about a lot of logistic, economical issues etc here, but things can be worked out if people have intention. But bigger point is, people like us, developers, will have to speak out and not give in to companies just moving everything or setting up everything in Bangalore. they don't really care about employees spending 4 hours everyday in travelling (btw. thats 20 hours every week. If you take leaves for about 3 weeks in a year, you're spending 1000 hours travelling in a year, thats 41 days of your life per year). their senior folks have money to get homes near offices to reduce travel time, but they really don't care about people who can't afford that

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***PS: I am not against Bangalore. In fact, it is more about saving Bangalore from greed of governments and corporates***

Obviously I was shocked, really really shocked and reached out to the interviewer on linkedin about why I got rejected.
Guess his reason..it was availability.
Apparently they wanted an intern who could come to bangalore for 6 months and work.
Even though they had posted their opening as a remote opening and I even discussed this with them during the interviews, that I can only work remotely and will that be an issue.
They just said it's all okay, we can manage that as an answer to this in the interview!!!

15y2etv,Had an Eye-Opening interview for the role of Power Programmer at Infosys.,"I'm a regular self-taught developer working at a small-time service company with 1.5 YOE.

Today I learned firsthand what is the difference between a problem solver and someone who writes code (strictly in my reference). 

My first preference as a 29 YO guy was to secure a better-paying job, for that, I was learning a particular stack and made some projects using those. Interviewers liked those side-projects and interviewed me about my current job profile and my knowledge of the frameworks and languages. Some gave me problems to solve, some gave me assignments to make, and some asked me to create a small webpage or API during the interview. 

But today's Power Programmer interview was something different. This was the second round with someone senior(20+ YOE) at Infosys. The interviewer and I introduced each other. Then he briefly explained to me the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of a Power Programmer **(he referred to it as a part of the Strategic Development Team)** and how it barely constitutes 1% of Infosys' development workforce. 

A bit of context. In round 1, I was asked to solve a problem (along with other Language and Framework specific questions) which I solved. After the interview, when I was looking for an optimized solution, I came to know that this problem is known as **3Sum Closest(Dynamic Programming)** on LeetCode. 

During my limited time, even though I have a fair understanding of basic Data Structures and different types of Algorithms (I'm currently reading Introduction To Algorithms by Cormen) I didn't prioritize solving problems. 

Anyways back to the second round, the first problem was a simple one. But the interviewer explicitly said that I'm only looking for an approach and not the whole solution instead. I took some time refactoring the code to make it more readable. This was the type of question that someone with a basic understanding of the if-else construct would easily solve.

The second problem was the Largest Common Substring problem which again used Dynamic Programming. But this time I was stuck. I somehow managed to come up with a partial solution. But unlike the last round, I couldn't solve it. So the interviewer was kind enough to make me go through the whole algorithm iteration by iteration. Finally, he asked me to write the code that would create such iterative results, which I somehow managed to do (I still doubt my final code).

I was able to follow the logic he was trying to convey, but I was so not ready for such an interview. 

In the back of my head, I was like Damn! I got such an amazing opportunity, but 6 months earlier :D

I realized that the whole interview was only focused on problem-solving and problem-solving alone.

Finally, after 1 hour, the interviewer gave me some feedback, which was nothing just keep on doing whatever I am doing and get better at it, along with some appreciation about my past.

I know my outcome, but it's the experience that made me flair this post as a Personal Win (apologies if it doesn't go by its definition) and I wanted to share this with the community and get your thoughts on this.

I was presented with an opportunity and I missed it because I was way too much under-prepared. I'll focus more on problem-solving in next upcoming months and will apply for this role again, and who knows!

So this person has 9+ years of experience. He did dual employment of 10 days in corona period (2021) between TCS and Capgemini.
(Dual employment days: last 10 days of TCS and first 10 days of Capgemini). At that time, it happened mainly because of not knowing any better and having no other option but to join. 

In 2023, capgemini terminated him stating 10 days of dual employment of 2021. 

Now this dual employment and termination creating a problem in future employment prospects in BGV process.So, even after clearing all the rounds, he's not able to join any new company as background verification is troubling him.

But I have started building interest in tech and started learning sql, python but not sure where I'm heading, one of the biggest reason I'm attracted to tech is the salary I hear day in day out how ppl are Making high salary within 5-6 years of experience, I just want to break out lower middle class life and make my mom leave her garment which barley pays her 10-13k.

So. I'm I being too ambitious here thinking to break in into tech for high salary coming from bcom background but I consider myself a good problem solver and a logical person so far having fun what I'm learning

165c3mf,Accidentally revealed that I freelance in an interview and fucked up,"So I attended an interview a few hours ago and the over enthusiasm led to me telling the interviewer that I had started a smma with my friends a few months ago to the ""tell me about yourself"" question. He started asking more questions like ok so how much do yall make etc etc...  

After that, he told me all concerned that it is not allowed in any company to work anywhere else. I understand the non-compete policy, but I thought it was only applicable if one works in the same domain. This was more part-time, passive income that's based on deisgn and not tech, but he kept on insisting that it is not allowed to have any sort of clientele. He asked me why I needed another job when I already had one. I tried explaining that I m ambitious, and my small venture doesn't stop me from pursuing a full-time job where I can learn more about the corporate world and upskill myself. After a while he told me that he is not able to put a finger on his decision because eventhough he thinks I m otherwise perfect for his team, he also feels like I wouldn't stay long term with them or would do fine even without the job. This was the technical round, btw.   

Now, two things. 1. I m not looking to join this company because they have absurd work timings(1-10, 2-11,5-3), or maybe it's only absurd to me. But they also have really good growth internall,  so I feel like I would miss out on that if I decide not to join. So now it's not like I want i,  but I also don't want to lose i,  ykwim

2. I know I know I know I should be more diplomatic in my answer,  but this tim,  I feel like I was honest rather than diplomatic with my answers. I need a poker face fr. Have you ever lost your facade in an interview and been just honest rather than smart?",2023-08-30 11:30:30

It would sound exaggerating if I say that they are not able to use even print(). But its true. I'm not sure if they're not interested in the work or if they cheated during the interview process (since it was online). I doubt that they might have cheated because the person was too good at solving challenging questions during the interview. The problem is, I'm the one responsible for this hire and it's costing the company money to potentially terminate them. I've tried to talk to the developer about it, but they take leave when questioned. We don't even have a leave policy and basically they are taking advantage of this.",2023-03-31 19:59:06

Also students with their masters (or even PhDs) from abroad will be back to India as market there (specifically EU) has already saturated and it is tough to get job as a expat. With new EU regulations on AI, don't know how it's going to turn out but it's definetely affecting the current ecosystem.

17i69oc,Parents pressurising for Govt exams,"

I graduated in 2022 from an IIT (General Engineer Male) and am working as an SDE in a startup (wfh). The pay, work culture, learning, team etc is good. No complaints. I like my job and am optimistic about my growth and career progression in this field. 

But my parents have been pressurizing me to give Govt job exams like UPSC, state services, Assistant Engineer etc. I understand where this is coming from. My parents grew up in a middle class family in the Hindi Heartland (MP, UP etc) and all they have seen are Govt babus who are corrupt, wield influence and respect (Isn't it ironic how our society tends to ""respect"" those who are the most corrupt). I have repeatedly told them that I don't want to work in the Govt because of it's corrupt system, political interference, poor work life balance, limited freedom to work, strict hierarchies and of course limited pay (also reservation in promotions). Also UPSC is such an uncertain, poorly structured exam ki kab jawani ke 5 saal barbaad ho jaenge pata bhi nahi chalega. Why to waste your most productive youth years preparing for a Govt exam? It might be the case in pre 1991 era (limited provate sector opportunities) but now the opportunity cost is just too high to ignore for a GEM IITian.

But somehow, these reasons are not enough to convince them. I know most of you must have been in this exact same situation. How did you go about bringing this mindset shift in your parents?

Edit_1: Ok, since some people are suggesting me to prepare for UPSC alongside my job, I think some context is necessary. I did not sit for placements in my 4th year as I was preparing for UPSC (I was naive that time, probably was in a bubble and got too influenced by society and parents). Gave an attempt, it did not work out. Decided that I cannot do this to myself and let my prime years go to waste (parents were super supportive here). Then I switched to tech industry and got a full time SDE role via LinkedIn. So, UPSC was my past which I am never revisiting again. But cannot say the same for my parents.",2023-10-28 04:47:49

18rwaqn,Supporting Internet Freedom in India: Why We Need to Rally Behind the Internet Freedom Foundation,"This might be a rant post, but I've wanted to share this for over a year now, and I believe it's something everyone here needs to know! The Internet Freedom Foundation (https://internetfreedom.in/) has been fighting single-handedly for internet freedom, digital rights, privacy, and data protection in India for over a decade. They've been vocal about how every issue and law that is discussed and passed affects our lives. They take up litigations, engage in policy advocacy, and promote public awareness and education. They have a robust team of lawyers and policy experts who dissect complex bureaucratic matters and help ordinary people like us understand what everything means and how it impacts us.

  
What baffles me is that in a country with millions of internet users and developers like us, whose lives are directly affected by laws like the Telecom bill, Broadcast bill, Internet shutdowns, Dark patterns, and Data protection laws, from last I got to know, the total number of individuals who do a monthly contribution towards IFF's work is just around 200. Just 200 individual donors in this whole country! This is beyond comprehension. People here boast about earning lakhs and crores through IT jobs, and I don't think it's fair. We all enjoy the internet freedom we currently have, thanks to the work done by organisations like the IFF, who are fighting these battles on the front line.  


I was reading their latest email about the winter season in Parliament (https://mailchi.mp/internetfreedom/iff-members-donors-briefing-call-regulating-online-gaming-12671501). Just between January 2023 and November 2023, the IFF had a gap of approximately 23 lakh rupees between what they received in donations (from individuals and organisations) and their total expenses (including operations, salaries, legal expenses, etc.). They will need to organize more fundraisers to cover this gap. While we can all support them in our individual capacity and let them do the work they are meant to do, they are forced to invest time and energy into running these fundraisers.

All companies want a 10x developer, rockstar who can work on anything but only pay that person for survival.

Your interpersonal relations, professionalism, communication skills gets a great exposure while working with experienced individuals. Plus, you get to learn more about your team members and management, your decisions are influenced.

Yes the benefits of having remote location is immense,
You get to save a lot of money, you spend time with loved ones but the demerit is that nobody really cares in the online mode. Almost everyone is trying to cut corners, people using hacks to stay available by keeping something on the touchpad.
The connectivity is less in general.",2023-12-20 11:19:30
1679xju,Nightmare of Interviewing Backend Developers - A Rant!,"We're interviewing for a founding engineer (Java backend) position for our startup based in Chandigarh.

We are looking at devs who have 2+ years of experience in Java. Finding a quality developer is proving to be a task, and I'm about to vent my frustrations 

 

1. The ""Java Experts"": So many candidates claimed to be Java experts, but they couldn't even explain the basics. It's confusing when someone says they're an expert but can't explain simple OOPS concepts
2. The Buzzword Overload: Candidates love to throw around tech buzzwords like ""microservices"" and ""scalability,"" but when I asked them to explain these concepts or use them in practical situations, they were lost.
3. Startup phobia: Some candidates didn't show up or declined because we are a startup, despite us telling them we are profitable and promising a stable job for at least a year. They would rather slog at their jobs than grabbing this opportunity to grow quickly.  
4. Overconfident and Underprepared: Some candidates came across as overly confident, bragging about their Java projects. However, when I asked for details, they couldn't back it up. Confidence is great, but skills matter more.
5. Algorithmic Teasers: Solving basic algorithm problems seemed impossible for many candidates. It's like they'd never seen a simple loop before. This made the interviews incredibly frustrating.
6. The ""Years of Experience"" Trap: Many candidates boasted about years of experience, but  struggle to write basic SQL queries. 

 In conclusion, the struggle to find a developer who can code, communicate, and genuinely cares about their craft is real. 

Edit:
It's really amusing to see how quickly people love to jump to conclusions. As they say, if jumping to conclusions was a sport, India would have won Olympic gold medals.
Here are some more details based on comments:

1. When I mentioned ""stable job for at least a year"" : people didn't understand what 'at least' means here..we are profitable enough to guarantee that there won't be layoffs for a year even if everything goes 0 today.
2. We are offering up to 12LPA at 2 YOE level, it's above market average salary. 
3. We are a service as well as product based company. We want to remain bootstrapped to launch the product and services is a way to achieve that. There's nothing wrong in doing service business either.",2023-09-01 15:16:05

I believe that every person should give back to the community in some way or the other.

Recently, I wrote an article on how Cloud Computing is basically the stepping stone and the main catalyst for the fourth industrial revolution. How the gradual migration to microservices and distributed systems in order to produce scalable, lightweight and efficient solutions is the way to go. You know how every person looks for the meaning of their life? I believe this is mine, to be a part of this revolution, to help migrate our society to a better one, to create better solutions, to adapt, to improvise, to innovate.

Now that manager is a dear friend of the CTO so naturally he didn't say a word to her and instead lashed out at me that why these issues keep coming up and indirectly said I am a poor developer

Usually I don't mind his words but this poor developer thing hurt me.

And that manager has the CTC of 50LPA and she writes code like a 11th grader. 
It always baffles me why is she getting paid that much. She has never worked as a developer before joining us and only ""tech"" experience she has is from a service based company she founded with the help of her friend.

I am not a bad developer at all. I only have 1.6 yrs of experience and whatever I have learnt is on my own. My manager doesn't know nodeJs and she holds the profile of VP of engineering, my CTO has told to my face that he wanna get out of tech.

Also, during this period I decided to make a switch in my career from developer to Data Science and Analysis. So I signed up for a course (which is about to end in a few months) and also started looking out for job as a Data Analyst. While I am applying from LinkedIn I am getting rejected either due to poor ATS score (I got a mediocre resume) and even if I do get shortlisted the companies are taking too long to reveal the result.  While I am keeping myself busy with this course I still am suffering mentally with no job in hand. Although my father is bearing the finances even after the surgery, I can't let him bear all the expenses, since he is also getting older. And also getting job referrals is quite a struggle as I have to pay a premium for it in order to contact the recruiters.

14y0uml,"Replying to unsolicited recruiters with ""No fully remote? not interested"""," 

Have been fully remote since Covid started and have shifted companies to one that is completely remote in India. I had always intended to move away from Bangalore and commute only a few days a week but having been so spoilt the last few years I've realised fully remote is the way forward for at least the next decade while my kids are young enough to really enjoy.

I had a bit of an epiphany after getting some of the usual unsolicited emails from recruiters that I could, in a small way, help ensure the status quo can be maintained and push back against the companies that want to enforce attendance in the office.

Now every time I get an email from a recruiter I've no interest in, I ask about it being fully remote and if it's not, I use that as the reasoning for not wanting to proceed any further. It's a small thing but if more folks did it, it could help feed metrics into recruitment folks that roles are not getting filled because of the inability to offer remote roles.",2023-07-12 21:12:32

1ao43zj,My tips for interview in product companies in current environment.,"I will keep my profile a bit ambigious to ensure privacy. I will not share my company's name

&#x200B;

**My credentials:**

Working in India throughout. 5 YOE, laid off twice. Once during last year's process from a FAANG, second during this year's process from a fintech which ran into difficulties. 1st one was my fault but caught me unaware, second I expected seeing the company's state.

Salary progression: Started: 13 lpa

1st year 15 lpa

2nd year 32 lpa (Got promoted)

3rd year: 54 lpa (Salary hike all across tech)

4th  year: 36 lpa (Got laid off, joined at lower salary)

5th year: 90 lpa (Got laid off, somehow got a very good salary job)

Have interviewed a ton. Have appeared for all sorts of companies from very huge tech to startups.

&#x200B;

Below are my observations. Fair warning, it might be biased according to my experiences.

**My tips and observations:**

1. General:
   1. Have general coding and system design practise. But practise for each interview specifically (will explain more below). Initially my practise was generic and so I missed out at places
   2. Currently most interviews require you to be 95%+ correct or you might not get callback. I have had interviews which I answered and solved all questions well before the hour (40ish min) but because I didn't know say the inner working of transactional dbsI was rejected.
   3. If asked about salary expectations, never say a flat number. Say ""according to industry standards"", ""more than current"", ""I do not have a number in mind etc"". Try to postpone saying a flat number to a later date to atleast enter into the interview process.
2. For tech screening round,
   1. Prepare college fundamentals like transactional dbs, multithreading, oops etc. Some language specific knowledge of java like lambdas is recommended if backend or full stack.
   2. People tend to ask very obscure questions which only they might know in their niche. Example: If the position you've applied to has products in say network analysis or security, those will be the questions asked. Do prepare for them
3. For coding rounds:
   1. These are mostly standard rounds. You code you pass, be vocal and justify each decision
4. For design rounds:
   1. The interview question is always 1 of 2 possibilities:
      1. Either one of the first few questions from Grokking the system design book. (I have been asked the tinyurl question too many times now)
      2. The team which you are interviewing for will have a product. If you know it, that will be the design asked. Example: If cybersecurity, their tool's design. If big data aggregation, their product etc. Always practise a hypothetical design of the product of the team which you are interviewing for.
5. Fit rounds:
   1. Have definite answers to tough questions. Indian interviewers tend to ask the most personal questions and try to undermine you, be prepared.
   2. I have failed this interview a ton. When I didn't admit I was laid off, I barely passed this. Later on when I admitted the same and prepared I began getting more callbacks
   3. Do not take this interview for granted. I personally made a list of questions which I have or might be asked and created answers and practised them.
   4. Since this is mostly the last interview and it's rather subjective you will not always get an honest answer or even sometimes an answer at all.  Be ready to hound HRs for a response.

One very generic observation is Indian interviewers always tend to ask difficult, obscure, niche, personal questions. Only have met 1 foreigner who has asked such questions. Be prepared and all the best

**Edit:** Regarding how to land interviews. My suggestions are:

1. Contact recruiters in your network from the front. Recruiters generally work for some company, do message them and find people in their network. Generally different recruiters are hiring for different profiles
2. You will convert  a very low percentage of messages you send out or a very low percentage of jobs you apply for. Do keep it in mind and keep applying
3. It takes time to start getting interviews. You might start applying today, but will receive callbacks only after 2-3 weeks. Do be patient and keep applying
4. Do check for referrals from people in your connection. Generally, people do give referrals to others relatively easily
5. Do make a list of companies you want to join and check their career page. Career page sometimes have openings not present on linkedin
6. Basics is do apply via websites like linkedin, indeed, naukri etc
7. Do check out sites like uplers, turing, crossover etc. If you clear their AI screening process you will definitely get a callback. Most people I see give up before that assessment or don't give it seriously
8. Do check for linkedin jobs you like. They will have tags, do ensure to add them to your profile and CV. Recruiters search with tags. Having them in your profile increases visibility.

People with experience do add more suggestions in the comments.",2024-02-11 09:23:22

I end up refactoring the code and getting assigned JIRA tickets for their work. I brought this to my manager's attention, but they don't give a f\*\*k, of course.

18wfco3,Stuck in an exploitative startup as a fresher. Please guide me.," So I had been placed in a startup in Hyderabad via campus placements. The initial package promised was 16 LPA, they delayed the offer letter by 5 months, and after that, they changed my offer to 12 LPA, I was supposed to join within a week-1 day was given to accept/reject the offer. I spent these 5 months trying to get a job, but I just could not-also I did not try rigorously since I had my current company to fall back on (big mistake). Also after I moved cities and came here, we got another email saying that we would be put in a training program since we are freshers - this training program will not have any fixed duration and the pay during this training is gonna be 22k per month. I called them to ask wtf is going on, they said they cannot change anything. I called placement cell, they said the best they could do is let me sit for placement - but I will have to leave this company first. Then they warned me about how 100% of the companies so far as taken 2024 grads only, and no company was taking 2023 grads. So I made a decision to stay back, and keep applying elsewhere. 

Now after joining the company, the HELL broke loose. There is no training - only self learning and ""evaluations"" through projects and 'viva'. I was hired as a junior data scientist - but ALL my projects so far were related to web dev, api and all. I have worked on Angular, Django and what not, on mock evaluation projects where the deadlines were in like 2 days. Of course there was a lot of just replicating stuff from YouTube since I was actually clueless.  I spoke to the manager about this, they said its 'normal' and that they are just pushing us. 

Again, there has been no training, only evaluations and vivas. We are made guilty and shamed for not working on Sundays and on holidays. -When I ask how long will the training last, they smirk and tell us dekhte hai - followed by guilt-tripping us for taking off on Sunday and Christmas. They eliminate people every week like masterchef and some seniors from 2022 batch are still in training. 

I have a theory that they are doing this so that we just resign / they get a reason to fire us, so that they do not get blacklisted from campus placement.  

Anyway - I wanted to ask you guys - 

1. Is this normal? 

2. I am really having a hard time escaping this mess since fresher hiring is bad at the moment - what can I do? 

3. Every evening I am on the verge of resigning  but looking at some people here talking abut how hard it is to get a job rn, I am holding myself back. 

I have lost people to depression and I have always been careful about my mental health, but this is the first time in my life I feel like I am slipping into actual depression. I truly wanna quit this company but I am not doing so, fearing that I would be jobless for half a year ahead. Please tell me what can I do, i truly need your suggestions and help.

167qaq9,[Rant] Recieved My first salary and I am not happy,"2023 Passout, First Job. I got my first salary and I wasn't happy with it. 22k In hand in Bangalore, I have read stories about how people spend their first salaries on things they like the most, how people give parties with their first salary and how people send money back home to their parents and many other things. I can't do any of those with the amount I have recieved, I mandatorily have to save 5k to pay some SIP's n stuff, and I barely have anything left afterwards. My only thought is of survival and it feels like I am getting bare minimum so I can just live frugally. Wanted to buy new shoes for office... I even have to think for buying shoes as it may fuck up my budget.

It feels all the effort I put in my years of college, LC, good projs etc. went to waste. What was the purpose of doing all that, spending money on education and stuff if I could just do a small hustle and earn more than I am earning currently after years of education.

 I tried finding better opportunities while in final sem but didn't even get any interview calls let alone offers lol. Call it bad market or lack of skills in me or whatever else, I just feel like it's unfair considering the amount of effort I have put on upskilling in the past few years.",2023-09-02 02:18:43
162vfb4,Worked as a freelancer in a company and now the company is not paying me money.,"So i worked as a freelance flutter developer in a company in nagpur, they had a project of mahindra and i worked on it. It was initially a 1 month project in May-June and it was completed within the time. I was working with one more developer on the app and completed the requirements given by the company in 1 month + 1 week. After the 1 month period the asked us to add some more features to the app. Now since i completed everything i was taking an off day where i get a call from the project manager saying ""how can you take off without informing."" I said i completed all the work and the app is complete for which she said that it is not complete and we need to work more on it and started telling me that i am under contract and all. I said that the contract was over 1 week ago and then she hung up the call. Now i said that i quit the very next morning because i hd to join some other company and asked her ofr my payment. After getting no reply for the day i checked again and my access to slack and repository got revoked.
I asked her for payment on whatsapp and she said it will be paid when the app is completed. Now i didn't text her for 2-3 weeks and then asked for payment for whcih she said that the whole team's payment is on hold and will be paid after they complete the project, then after 15 days i text again and her answer was same. I texted the HR and the response was same. Now after a week i ask the second developer and he said they completed the project 1 day ago and they haven't paid him either. We both waited for a week and haven't got paid. I texted the PM again in August first week and she said it will be paid soon. Now i texted her 5 days ago and haven't got the reply.
Now what should be done? What are my options here?
I have the contract/offer letter that states the payment amount and duration.
I also have the pdf of the time i worked(we used to track the time we work on a website, so i downloaded the pdf of my work time before the access gets revoked).

Any advices fellow redditors?

TL;DR: worked for the company for 1 month as a freelance developer and the company hasn't paid me even after 2 months after leaving the project.",2023-08-27 16:47:13
14rft8h,Salty opinion from interviewer‚Äôs perspective at small company,"Hear my perspective out and let me know what‚Äôs wrong with it.

Your leetcode, hackerrank or hackerearth status doesn‚Äôt matter if you can‚Äôt even use git let alone frameworks.

Recently, I saw more number of candidates who showcased their leetcode or hackerrank profile and that‚Äôs good but when it came to technical round most of them couldn‚Äôt even tell why one needs to use git or difference between git and github. 

I understand one should have a good grasp in problem solving but if the candidate can‚Äôt even use tools (git or the tech stack companies are working in) then the candidate is no good. It sounds wrong but no company would hire non-fresher dev who is only doing DSA and not familiar with tools for which he/she applied for.
After all, in service based companies most of the time it‚Äôs CURD.

Resumes with better profiles might get shortlisted by the recruiter or hr but I‚Äôd hire someone who has worked on some actual projects than with top ranking on platforms but no real work.


Edit: Git vs. github is just one of the question I asked in one of the interview, we don‚Äôt reject if they know mercurial. Some other questions that I ask are:

- Diff between NoSQL and SQL (if they have written mongo and mysql in their resume)
- Django signals, api classes
- React functional vs class component 
- Hooks life cycle 
- Practical problem like tell/draw how you‚Äôd handle live post upvotes (answer is along the lines of web socket)",2023-07-05 16:33:50

123pcmj,Sharing my frontend interview experience at a big tech,"I recently gave 6 rounds of interviews for the role of Frontend Engineer (2+ yoe) at a big tech.

Sharing my experience with you all.

Round 1 - Make calculator class (add, sub, equal)

Round 2 - 
- Make String repeater (Str.repeat(2)), optimize it to O(logN)
- Make polyfill for contains method 
fn contains(parent, child)
parent, child are DOM html elements

Round 3 - How would you make a typeahead feature, write html, css and js. Increase efficiency, performance, web accessibility, fast dom rendering, pagination, infinite scrolling, debouning.

Round 4 - which website you like, what you like about it, things you can improve. Judging me on my choices of UI, why you chose this, how can you make a good UI. Talk about different UI patterns, like overflow pattern design, smooth scrolling, etc.

Round 5 - Past projects, challenges you faced. Things you did to make an impact in your current role. 
Suppose you have to make an e-commerce website from scratch, what things you would think of before start writing code. What things (MVP) you would want in your application to be? Performance, responsive, etc.

Round 6 - System design an app which will show a world map and will add new location pins whenever a new user signs up on the platform. Should give real time / near real time experience to the user.

PS: It was my first time experience giving 6 rounds of interviews for a job. Prepared hard to get all the knowledge i could in a short span of time. I think i could have done much better if i was more prepared from the starting. 

Things i learnt in the process:
- Frontend is a big space and there are so many things i still don't know about.
- Need to start using these best practices into my daily job as well ( like making js classes, thinking about performance, accessibility)
- Need to keep giving interviews, mock or real to always be in touch, because these opportunities doesn't come often, need to be ready
- Frontend system design is really good, need to understand it better ( not much internet resources on it though )
- Although i was not asked any DSA question, but having knowledge about how to solve those problems will make you sharp.
- No framework knowledge required in a big tech, but they expect you to know how to use it. You should have your basic Vanilla JS mastered.


Edit :

Resources i used:

1. JS, React, CSS: Brad Traversy, Web dev simplified, Kevin Powell (ui god),
Code evolution, Codedamn

2. System Design : Frontend Engineer (YT) , Chirag Goel (YT) , these are good starting point. Watch there videos, there would be tons of things you haven't heard of, note down those things, go back, do research & understand them.

3. Concepts like infinite scrolling, debouning, throttle: you can find videos/ articles about all of them on YT, medium, dev.to ( no specific resource for them)

4. Widgets : https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/
Master the widgets patterns mentioned on the above page. Checkout codepen examples, understand how they have written JS code, this is the same way they expect you to write in interviews. Focus on user accessibility too.

5. Interview questions : 
-- all of interviewbits's html, css , js sections
-- https://www.thatjsdude.com/interview/
-- https://bigfrontend.dev/problem

( These are some things i could think of right now, will keep this thread updated if I can find more)

Result : Not selected. Coding round didn't go well as per their expectations, all other 4 rounds were good. Kinda sad but happy with the way i gave my best. Lets see what destiny has in mind :)",2023-03-27 14:57:18

144hpnr,India much likely won't be able to create something like ChatGPT,"Having closely observed the Indian startup ecosystem and interacted with numerous entrepreneurs and investors, I cannot help but reflect on the thought-provoking comments made by Sam Altman during his recent visit to India.

The question asked was whether India can develop foundational models like ChatGPT to which he replied it was pretty much hopeless

he‚Äôs not underestimating entrepreneurs from India ..

what he knows is that investors in India do not have the guts to back entrepreneurs the way they do in the US .

&#x200B;

1. Lack of Risk-Taking Culture:

It is disheartening to witness the risk-averse nature of many Indian investors. While their American counterparts seem more willing to back ambitious ventures, Indian investors often prioritize stability and proven success over daring innovation. This risk aversion stifles the growth of audacious ideas and discourages entrepreneurs from pursuing groundbreaking solutions that could propel India to the forefront of global innovation.

2. Reliance on Degrees and Names:

I have personally experienced the bias towards educational degrees and established names among Indian investors. It often feels like the weight of one's alma mater or professional connections holds more sway than the potential of their ideas. This emphasis on credentials limits opportunities for individuals with non-traditional backgrounds, hindering the diversity of thought and fresh perspectives necessary for true innovation.

3. Lack of Long-Term Vision:

One cannot ignore the short-sighted approach that plagues many Indian investors. Instead of envisioning the long-term impact of transformative technologies, they tend to focus on immediate returns. This narrow perspective prevents the allocation of resources to projects that may require more time to mature but could ultimately revolutionize entire industries. Without a forward-thinking outlook, we risk falling behind in the global tech race.

4. Inadequate Support for Failure:

Failure is an inevitable part of any entrepreneurial journey, fostering resilience and invaluable lessons. However, in India, failure is often stigmatized and penalized within the VC ecosystem. This fear of failure stifles risk-taking and experimentation. As entrepreneurs, we need the freedom to explore uncharted territories and take calculated risks without the constant fear of severe consequences. Failure should be seen as a stepping stone towards success, not a mark of incompetence.

5. Limited Thinking and Lack of Futuristic Investments:

To create groundbreaking innovations on par with models like ChatGPT, we need Indian investors who are willing to break free from the shackles of limited thinking. Unfortunately, many investors prefer to replicate existing success stories rather than support futuristic ideas that can shape the future. This conservative approach undermines our potential to disrupt industries and hinders India's ability to make its mark on the global tech stage.

Sam Altman's comments struck a chord because they highlighted the underlying issues within India's VC mindset that hinder our progress. To foster a thriving entrepreneurial culture, it is essential for Indian investors to embrace risk-taking, support visionary founders, nurture an environment where failure is a learning opportunity, and encourage futuristic investments. Only by challenging the status quo and embracing a more progressive mindset can we unlock India's immense entrepreneurial potential and contribute to groundbreaking innovations that shape the future.

I really need advice on some of the aspects of my life. I won't take a lot of time and try to minimize it down to important stages.

My father was paralyzed since the day I have a memory of him, never seen my father walk without stumbling - people used to make fun of me. Father did not earn anything¬†from day one and so our relatives never talked to us and never helped in any way.¬†

My mother is a private school teacher she still earns just 24000 till this date. My Nani(mother's mother) used to work for BSNL So she gets some pension and at that time she helped my mother to buy a house in 1990's in a small town in gujarat,kutch.¬†

My mother has been working for the entirety¬†of her life, she wanted me to crack IIT JEE but i was not able to do it. Got admission in a small college in Gujarat. Completed BE Computer Science in 2022-got a job for a mere 32000p.m.-started living in a pg- Saved some money - helped mother repair our existing house - bought a washing machine for her - bought a simple commuter bike for myself. I need to ask what should i do in order to be able to ask my mother to leave her job and i can pay for her entire life expenses. For once in her life she does not have to get up at 5o'clock and not to go to her school where she is disrespected each day.

I want to buy a place in Ahmedabad, Where i can ask my mother to stay and be with me till the day she is alive I want to give her facilities she never had.

Technical Background :

I have been working as a frontend developer for a firm in Ahmedabad for the past 1.7 yrs. I am good in DSA but no firm in Ahmedabad asks that. Nobody from out of Gujarat is ready to take my interview and give me a chance. I know react, javascript, html css redux.

Alot of amount wasted. And most importantly, lesson learned. Never to go for live online classes.

Udemy is the best. Course fees are not more than 400-500. And you can learn at your own pace, with certifications at the end.

1bk77ul,Some positive news for all the developers out there!,"I started my career in Infosys as a System Engineer Specialist at 5LPA in 2019.

Had mixed experience with working on multiple projects at Infosys. But at least I learnt a lot.

As a CSE graduate, after college/University we mostly are not exposed to the intricate details and systems that are there as a part of any software development
All we know are programming languages and bunch of frameworks and software engineer theory.

So putting all those in practice is not easy!
Infosys did help me in learning that.

After 3 years at Infy, I was looking for a switch in 2022.

What happened with me is a funny story.
I got an offer from a startup for 30-40% hike on my current CTC. I accepted it and resigned from infy.
But after a week offer was revoked!

I did not want to revoke my resignation becoz in my last project we had bad politics and toxic seniors which made so many troubles to the SEs that 8 out of 10 of our team members had quit the company!
So I took the risk.
I told myself I will not go back to that same place and will try to find to a new offer.

I got another offer after a lot of interviews and rejections after 2 months.

That is the place I still am at.
Will completing 2 years here in Aug 2024.

But I can't tell you guys how much I enjoy working here

No micro management
Chill and helpful seniors
Wonderful WLB
And on top of that good hikes and bonuses!!

After first year I got 10k as bonus and 1.2lakhs as hike.
This year after the financial year comes to an end
Bonus is finalized at 58k and hike will be determined after that which would be around 12-15% of current CTC.

Some might say that's not a lot.
But coming from peanut experiences of Infosys 
This is huge for me.

I don't wanna brag or boast
I just want to say to all the devs out there that although situation and market is getting worse for IT.
But pls hold onto your skills and confidence
You will and you can find a good place which will value your skillset and give you your worth!

Just have a lil faith my brothers!

1b75we3,Funny exchange at screening call for God knows what company .,"

So I have working for two years first year as a FTE and 2nd year as a freelancer and decided to get back in the FTE role and got a call today whose exchange went something like  this 

HR - Hello, is this OP ?

OP - yeah this is OP speaking.

HR - we calling from (some random company) for the role of backend engineer.

OP - sorry , which company?
* This happened 3 time and I still couldn't get the company name and just said ""Yeah , go on "" *

HR - what's your experience and tech stack?

OP - 1 year FTE and 1 year freelancing my tech stack .

HR - yeah we will only be counting your FTE experience.

OP - alright.

HR - OP * random banter about projects *

HR - so what was your last drawn CTC?

OP - Around 8 lpa.

HR - (SHOCKED) WHO GIVES 8 lpa to people with one year experience? (Exact wordings of HR)

OP - well , I joined that company as a fresher and got selected with that package .

HR - (SHOCKED) YOU GOT 8 LPA AS A FRESHER ? What was your in-hand salary ?

OP - 65 k pm after deductions.

HR - OK which company is that ?

OP - gives company details . ( Now I am just fed up with her, bitch didn't even asked for expected CTC)

HR - ok we will get back to you .

OP - one more thing , it was remote and they gave me travel expenses as reimbursements and another 50k bonus every quarter. ( This is not true but just for shits and giggles).

So I don't know how to feel about that , but made my day some what odd.

What's your opinion on this , did I handled it unprofessionally after her remarks or was it worthwhile?

Please over look the grammar and spelling mistakes , autocorrect has its wonders.

1bl1es4,Tired of the the IT Job life-cycle already. Upskilling seems like an endless cycle.,"Hello all,

I might face a lot of hate for asking this, but I still want to.

I have started feeling I might have landed in the wrong field of work, development and It in general. 
Why? The constant need of upskilling. 

I work at my job for the day, then I have to upskill myself to stay relevant. Or else I have to upskill myself to get a better job. If I get a better job , there too I have to upskill myself again.

So work for the day, then stay busy upskilling again. And all this for earning money to enjoy the good life..but how the hell will I do any of that I'm in spending the day at work and the time after that to upskill? 

And it's like you will always need to upskill...it can never stop. It's just been 3 years in the field but I find this exhausting. 

What am I even working for ? Staying more busy? And it never matters if you like it or not. You have to upskill in the stuff that's relevant, always.

I don't know how to think positively about this. I have started feeling I'm in the wrong place and I need to switch to some other type of job than development, where I can keep learning at work, and can have some kind of life after work.",2024-03-22 15:04:06

1bgdjo3,"Horrible Experience interviewing at AGODA, Gurgaon.","I am writing this experience after a few months since it happened, mostly because I was busy in my interviews. This happened in the month of Sept. The whole thing started around 15th of september when I received a mail communication from Agoda HR team and they wanted to schedule my first round. I had applied through their website and they liked the profile. There was no call regarding my expectations, role to be offered, location or anything. A scheduling link was sent directly. I accepted the invite and scheduled the interview after one week (this was as soon as I could).

First round happened at 21st and it went pretty good. At the end of the discussion I asked my interviewer about the basic information of role like location, seniority, technology. Since he was from the bangkok team he did not have this information and also couldn't get me in touch with the recruiter.

The HR team went completely silent for 1 and a half week. No response, no feedback, nothing. After almost 10 days of gap I got another similar mail asking me to schedule the second round. Please note, till this point I did't have any conversation with my recruiter. I again scheduled it after a week (earliest). This round was also taken from someone from Bangkok and it went pretty well too. The HR team again went ghost. After almost 2 weeks, I got a call from the HR that my rounds were clear and they want to move ahead.

The same thing happened with next 2 interviews. They took atleast 7-10 days to come back for each round and then take 5 more days to schedule the round. I had already spent close to 50 days to complete my 4 rounds.

After completing 4 rounds, HR team kept a introductory round where they asked me for my expectations in terms of salary. They said that the panel is still reviewing my interviews and they will soon get back to me with final results. I tried to contact them twice after a couple of days but no reply.

Another week passed by.

Then they came back saying that they want to keep a director round to which I agreed. They said that he is currently in Bangkok and we would be able to schedule this next week, to which again, I agreed.

Another week passed by and I finally gave my final round.

Again, after 3-4 days (really really fast this time :P) I received that the overall feedback was positive and they would like to move ahead with the offer.

Next day, I got a call from one of the Senior HRs and discussed salary. They were offering quite low from what I was asking for and we agreed on a middle number.  
Again next day, I got a call from the same person and said they can't do what we agreed on a day back, and they would only offer a slightly lower number, to which I agreed.

After a couple of days, when I followed up for the offer letter, I got a call from the same HR person.  
She informed me that they will not be going ahead with me since they have stopped hiring engineers for my position and said they will only look for Staff/Principal level engineers for GGN location.

I was extermely pissed. Literally 2.5 months of interview process including interviews, so many followups, calls, negotiations, feedbacks, NOW you are informing me that you are not hiring for my level.

I can't even imagine how messed up things at a company have to be to treat their potential employees like this.  
Imagine the state of tech and engineering at a place where hiring process is so so inefficient and messed up.  
I thank the almighty I didn;t get into that company, although at one point I had almost made up my mind to join them.  


  


TL;DR (thanks chatGPT)

TL;DR:  
Went through a lengthy interview process with Agoda, enduring delays and poor communication from the HR team. After multiple rounds and negotiations, was told they weren't hiring for the position they interviewed for. Frustrated by the inefficient process and glad to not join the company.",2024-03-16 19:08:00

Q) Explain one of the service in depth

A) Explained end to end without revealing much of the secret sauce 

Q) Discussion about a failure point - 

A) while explaining the above question, he pinpointed one scenario which could lead to a failure point, I accepted that it is indeed a failure point however it has never happened and alerts are in place and SRE has the SOP of what to do in that scenario.

Live coding round 

Q) Write a producer / consumer code that prints 1 to n.

A) I was able to properly write it and explained it to him. ( I had used unbuffered channel initially)

Q) What will happen if by any chance the consumer routine is not able to read from producer routine.

A) unBuffered channels are blocking channels unless the consumer reads it wont be able to push next elements. 

Q) What will happen if you use buffered channels

A) Buffered channels will allow producer to push upto n elements irrespective the consumer reads it or not, however as soon as buffer is full it will block.

Q) How will you read from multiple channels in the same function ?

A) Updated my consumer routine from range channel to a for loop with select. 

Q) How much handholding do you need ?

A) I am a self starter and a good documentation would help. But I feel when I am stuck its time saving to reach out to someone rather then going in the rabbit hole.

Q) Theres no documentation in early stage startups 
A) okay

1bifqeo,Startup refusing to provide me the documents and salary.,"I have recently(on 9th March) quit my job from a Surat based startup due to toxic work culture and they were asking me to either fill the weekends (both Saturday and Sunday) or quit, so I quit. Now it‚Äôs 19th of March and my salary for February is still pending.

I made a big blunder when I joined that startup, and which was to not take offer letter and appointment letter beforehand. They keep promising to provide the offer letter and appointment letter soon and called me to their Surat office. In hope that they will provide me these docs soon, I waited and reminded them about this every week or other week and they said soon every time. So I got tired of asking and played along because I kind of started trusting them at that point. Then they hired a senior backend developer and fired them within 20 days because the startup refused to hire a CTO which the investors were insisting since the start and so the investors backed off and suddenly there was funding issue and the biggest chunk of that was going to that backend developer. The best part was he wasn‚Äôt even given the salary and put the condition that if you want the salary, complete the authentication part end to end while there wasn‚Äôt even such contract but yet he did it. But they kept finding bugs into it and asking him to fix them. Even after 3 days of continuous working, the people still weren‚Äôt satisfied and finally that backend developer gave up on the salary and left crying.

After that they also fired an intern and didn‚Äôt give him the salary either.

Now since I have left, initially they told me over the call that they are going to provide me all the documents and salary and won‚Äôt bother me so I was kind of relieved but it has been 10 days since then and the boss has blocked my number so I can‚Äôt call him and the manager isn‚Äôt answering my calls either and just replies on the WhatsApp they he will talk to the boss and clear your things tomorrow from the past 4-5 days.

Even I worked on the weekends in November 2023 as they promised us overtime pay which we never got, we kept asking and they kept saying soon and so eventually we lost hope and gave up on that also.

Knowing their past practices, I had a gut feeling that they won‚Äôt provide me my salary and now I am starting to lose hope since I don‚Äôt have anything to fight a legal battle even if they refuse to provide the salary except the bank statement which has the company name from which the salary was credited.

My EMIs are due in 10 days and I don‚Äôt have a job and doesn‚Äôt even have the funds to pay EMIs for this month let alone surviving for 1-2 months while I prepare for interviews.

Please help me. I'm always depressed these days and its affecting my interview performance also.

EDIT:

1. Added tech stack and experience as suggested by someone. It would be a big help if anybody could refer me.

I am a **Frontend Developer** with 2 years of experience.  
Tech-stack: **React(NextJs), Typescript, Javascript, redux, RTK.**  
I also know a little bit of NodeJs, express, mongoose, prisma, zod, mongodb, MySql etc and can create basic crud REST APIs.

2. The EMIs are for my education loan and I currently do not have any savings because I assist my parents in covering our family's expenses.

Update: I had talked to them today over call and they are way more evil than I initially thought. Now they are saying that they would provide me salary in the next month(around 15-20th April) and to which I believe that they still won't. And meanwhile, you need to keep in touch with us and help us with stuff (free developer) when required till you get the salary which is for the month of Feb. So I won't get salary for March and April but I'm still obliged to work for them because they said we haven't released you officially, so you have to assist us in completing your pending work (again work for free). I mean wtf does that even mean? They also mentioned that they are not working on the documents and you have to sign a bond where you have to declare that I will not use the code that I have written for the company and have to destroy it in their presence, even though they have already removed me from the company github and figma accounts. And after all that they are going to release me the cheque for when the salary time comes i.e.: 15-20th April.   
I don't understand what that means or even if they are going to provide me the salary or not. If I work for 15-20th April and still if I don't get my salary then what am I going to do?   
I am on the brink of breaking down and I don't know what to do. I have been working on an take home assignment for 2 days now due to this drama, I haven't been able to complete it fully (I have done it like 80%) and now I am not even motivated to work any further on this and today EOD is the deadline for submission.

The inside news is that we are going to have a bad appraisal coz our company has a lot of debt and the interest rates haven't gone down in US.

But I have received the best possible ratings and hence, my manager has asked pe specifically to share a trajectory that I aim for in next 5 years.
(Maybe it's just his way of making me feel optimistic about the idea of me sticking to the company coz the work that I have done in past year they all know that if not given a good hike I'd switch.)
 
I need help with what numbers should I pitch as a target for 5 years down the line and what's the bare minimum I should ask for this year?

From my seniors I've heard that the max appraisal in below 5 yoe is around 40%.",2024-03-11 11:29:44

1be682h,Why we need to stop worrying about AI trying to replace us.,"Why ai won‚Äôt replace programmers or software engineers

1. Time : AI code generators aren‚Äôt that good (for now) , to be able to keep the context for the entire codebase and the purpose of every function it is asked to perform , tinkering with it wastes time for the company as if the one tinkering with it is not a techy , it will take even more time and ultimately the task will lay undone still.
2. Responsibility : humans are susceptible to accountability , being responsible for fixing bugs , implementing new code and testing it requires some sort of personal responsibility so as to not screw up the production line and get the department in trouble , if an AI screws up , nothing is certain if it will be able to fix the issues itself or if it won‚Äôt just malfunction due to a misinformed prompt.
3. Security : Believing that every company out there is going to implement their own Custom AI for their workforces is a bad bet because the only thing to be sought after in AI is the ease of using it and the only way that is possible is to commission technologies made by other companies like OpenAI(ironic i know), Microsoft and such , companies dealing with sensitive data and codebases cannot afford a security malfunction in any shape or form as it will be holding up its data to be protected by a third party which is not the best idea.
4. Jobs : yes this will cause some thinning out of employees in the long run , but tbh it should be , as technologies progress , so should the programmer , if they don‚Äôt possess the knowledge to understand the codebases themselves then they are liable to be replaced by AI , but those with keen eyes on context , design , scalability and overall general good coding practices with good strategy to build even with pen and paper are the ones that will survive the apocalypse.

Legacy Truth : Website builders like wix always existed , AI writers always existed , Autofilling code always existed , even in music , Fruity Loops and Logic can just create melodies according to scale for you , but in the end the truth of the matter is these are all just tools , and most of these tools are great for college projects or maybe creating something to impress yourself or your friends , but to go out there and get a job or start your own thing , you need to be good at it .

You can‚Äôt open a restaurant and serve packet frozen food , You can‚Äôt sell AI generated country music as an artist and not know how to play the guitar on stage , You cannot be called a painter if you haven‚Äôt touched a paintbrush in your life, You cannot make AI generated actors and expect people to love them , You can‚Äôt build a website for you or your company without knowing the ins and outs of the website yourself instead of rubbing the AI lamp and letting the genie decide what your future holds .

That was my two cents , I hope you could understand my perspective on this AI thing

Have a great day.",2024-03-13 23:22:48

1b4gwbl,[Rant] Cloud Compute is costly for solo tinkerers üòî,"TLDR: Had a budget in mind for running a small app for personal curiosity to at least run 7 days through some cloud provider via cloud compute. Found out I can only run on it for less than 4 days.

Few weeks ago, I was able to set up my personal chatgpt server on my laptop and expose it to the internet for people to access. During that exercise I learned about a few language models to experiment with. But, the most popular one - mistral - required powerful hardware - minimum 16GB ram!

So I had a plan to keep app running for a week, and, decided that 1000 rs should help quench my personal curiosity. Most of the popular cloud providers list their prices in USD (Without taxes). They also commonly have a per hour rate, and, I find that useful to help me budget and plan how long I get to keep the VM running before decommissioning.

So for a vm of 6 vCPUs, 16GB ram, and, 320 GB storage (and, not considering the network bandwidth requirements), I can hardly run for 3 days!!! Actually I don't need 320GB of storage, but even if you find a provider that allows for customized storage (and even vCPUs) the end result is more or less the same!!!",2024-03-02 05:47:43

So, after spending a good chunk of my time diving deep into Flutter over the past year, I've noticed something pretty interesting. Across all the projects I've worked on, there's this recurring theme: we often end up needing the same set of components and integrations.

That got me thinking. Why not create something that could make life easier for all of us Flutter devs out there? And thus, the idea for Flutfast was born.

It's not just another boilerplate. Flutfast is my way of putting together all those common bits and pieces we keep needing into one handy toolkit. The goal? To help you get your mobile app up and running in Flutter in no time.

>TL;DR: Seeking career advice with 10 years of software dev experience, currently at 31lpa. Feeling stagnant compared to peers. Good work-life balance but salary feels less compared to peers with same working experience in product companies. Upskilling with AWS, DSA, and system design. Seeking insights on WLB in companies offering >40lpa, upskilling time, and other career growth suggestions. Tech: Java, AWS, Microservices. Tier 3 college, not willing to relocate unless for a significant salary increase.(generated by 'chadGPT'  :P)

Complete post :

I'm seeking advice on career growth. With 10 years of software development experience, I'm currently working as an SSE in a service-based company as a Java backend developer with a CTC of 31lpa. While my salary saw decent growth until the 5th year(as it was before covid boom), recent years have felt stagnant compared to my peers. I've also worked in product-based companies and believe there's room to increase my CTC based on my years of experience. My current work-life balance is good, work is good(development) and I typically finish work in 6-7 hours.

I'm planning to buy a home/flat in Gurgaon in 5 years, but the salary feels insufficient due to skyrocketing real estate prices in recent years. After reading posts on Blind app and other forums about career growth, I believe there's potential to increase my CTC.

I've already started upskilling with an AWS certification, and DSA and system design are next on my list for the next 4 months.

I'm seeking advice on the following:

1. For those earning >40 lpa(with around 10 years of work exp) in FAANG or tier 2 product companies, how is the work-life balance and pressure? Are you able to manage the workload?
2. How much time do you typically spend on upskilling?
3. Any other suggestions for career growth?

Tech stack: Java, AWS, Microservices

College: Tier 3

Location: Gurgaon (not looking to relocate unless there's a significant salary increase)

Career progression:

* Year 1: 3.2 lpa
* Year 2: 4.2 lpa
* Year 3: 7.5 lpa
* Year 4: 12 lpa
* Year 5: 18 lpa
* Year 6: 22 lpa
* Year 8: 28 lpa
* Year 10: 31 lpa

I was looking for an course for learning devops and some how landed on scaler page. Scaler team quoted me 3.6 lakhs for the whole course ( for the devops and SRE course ) and in which 1.2 lakh will be paid by me during the course and rest will be paid once I get the job ( by the joining bonus that company will give me). 

So please let me know whether it is a good deal or not....

1bd73gz,"Rant about the Quality of Developers in India. Where are all the average/good ones? We need them, but can't find them even after months.","**TL;DR: We need PHP/MySQL/React developers, but can't find above average devs, while offering decent salary and perks.**

Well, I‚Äôve been hiring developers in India for 8+ years now. While I appreciate the talent and hard work of many candidates, I‚Äôve noticed many recurring issues that I‚Äôd like to address. These have grown post-covid a lot.

1. **Unstructured Resumes/CVs**: It‚Äôs surprising how many candidates submit poorly structured resumes. A well-organized CV is the first impression, and it matters. Why can't people even write their address in a proper format, with capitalizations and commas.
2. **Basic Programming Questions**: We often ask simple programming questions during online-test-screening round or interviews. Unfortunately, most candidates struggle with tasks like transforming dates or sorting JSON arrays. These are fundamental skills that every developer of 3+ years of experience should very easily have, of course, even with help of Google (that's available).
3. **SQL Queries**: Writing SQL queries is a crucial skill for our roles as a developer. Yet, we encounter candidates who struggle with basic queries, like involving left joins. Or simply naming the types of data-types available in a database.
4. **Salary and Work Environment**: Despite these challenges, we offer competitive salaries (INR 12-18 LPA) for 2-5 years of experience, and **permanent remote jobs** in a product-based environment. We also prioritize **work-life balance**. All Saturdays/Sundays are strictly off. No overtime. Of course, there's EPF, Medical Insurance, 16 GB RAM laptops, etc. all standard good things.

I truly believe in the potential of Indian developers, but I am flabbergasted on where exactly are these average/good ones. Yes, we're not offering 50 LPA, but we are trying to hire just decent coders, not crazy specialists.

* Tech Stacks:
   * PHP/MySQL with or without React. Both front-end and back-end guys are needed.
   * Python/R for data-science. Of course, the rant is not about this stack (yet), just mentioning here.
* Requirement: 10 developers.
* Hiring Platforms Tried: Naukri (8 years) and InstaHyre (1+ years).

*Note: This post is meant to spark discussion and encourage growth.* 

*Of course, if you're interested, can solve those things, and fit in the tech-stack, and are open for work, please contact me (reply or DM). I am not sure, if openly posting the company/contact details is allowed in this sub or not.*",2024-03-12 20:07:08

1bhhwgm,My 6-Year Odyssey: Endless Pursuit of Coding for Money,"
Alright, buckle up, folks, because this is a tale of six years spent in the purgatory of security support, where dreams of dev glory go to die.

For the past half-decade and then some, I've been trapped in the thankless void of security support, grinding away at a job that I despise with every fiber of my being.

Despite churning out over 30 tools to help the team, I've been unable to shake off the shackles of my support profile. I've tried everything ‚Äì faking my experience as a dev, pursuing an M.Tech in a desperate bid to pivot to ML engineering ‚Äì but to no avail.

Two years of my life were devoured by the pursuit of a dream that only led to below-average performance and a soul-crushing level of stress.

My relationship with my spouse suffered, my mental health took a nosedive, and all for what? The elusive promise of a dev role that seemed to slip further and further away with each passing day.

The biggest hurdle? Starting fresh at a lower salary. It felt like a slap in the face after years of dedication to my craft.

And don't even get me started on trying to fake my way into a dev role. No matter how hard I tried, I always got caught in the tangled web of industry jargon and technical expertise that I simply didn't possess.

But you know what I've realized? The grass isn't always greener on the dev side. I've seen the horror stories of burnout and disillusionment, and I've decided that I'd rather spend my time tinkering with LeetCode and Kaggle than subject myself to that fate.

Sure, financially, it's not the most lucrative path, but at least I only have to endure 3 to 4 hours of work a day instead of the soul-sucking 8-hour grind.

And now I have woken up to that fact that my job is not so bad. I mean some tricky tickets are actually fun to solve.

So, consider this my cautionary tale to all those out there dreaming of making the leap to dev-dom. Sometimes, the pursuit of a dream can lead you down a path you never imagined, and not always for the better.",2024-03-18 04:07:25

1beo4xl,Fucked up a simple coding assessment..............,"I fucked up a very simple coding assessment from IBM. The question asked me to build a table of content for a given text. If the text line starts with ""# ""  it should be a title and if it starts with ""## "" its a section under that title. Ignore the rest of the sentences in the text. Pretty simple right? I thought so too. And i did the solution thinking so too. 

But being the giant fucking moron i am, i didn't pay enough attention to the return type. I kept seeing the expected result which seemed like a continous string but actually they wanted me to return a string array (much simpler than making that giant string yourself). I keot running my code and wondering why my string was getting split character wise on the output. I went so far as to report it as an environment issue to hackerrank, only to realize later that the mistake was mine. 

Feeling pretty fucking shitty rn. Im at a bad place in my work, almost 2 years (1year during college, 1 after) as an intern with the onboarding date looking like a mirage in the desert. Was getting 0 Callbacks and this is the first opportunity i got since months and i let it slip over something so stupid like this. I fucking hate myself for not being attentive enough especially in a situation like this. 

I want to blame hackerrank for not being clear with the return type but i just cant. 

What do i even do at this point? 

TLDR: fucked up a milk run of a coding assessment over not paying attention to the return type.

1bd34h1,This might sound unethical to some but hear me out,"
Did u guys check out devin ai by cognition labs? Its still in preview but what it does is something we spend so much time on if we have to build literally anything.

It uses a browser, terminal, code editor, etc. our tools basically and keeps iterating to solve a problem given to it, also has capabilities to read blogs articles and stuff, this could be a breaking point for many people pursuing a CS degree. Computers are incredibly efficient at doing anything if they pull this off successfully even in the next decade its scary.

There was a time in the last century where light bulbs had become so evolved they could last forever, many companies formed a cartel and reduced the life span of these light bulbs.
Now this particular example was done mainly for profits, but there have been other industries doing planned obsolescence for decades now.

We can make the best thing, but we choose not to so as to maintain jobs, economy, profits and whatnot..

But AI it scares me now i have seen other llms hallucinating and believed that good things like these were atleast a bit far away, but if a AI becomes sufficiently smart enough and has access to tools like Devin AI does it could become a near perfect creation which could cause this entire industry to change forever.

There are a very few things developers can do anything to stop corporates from reading our code or scraping our websites. You could add anti bot protections and what not but if ur page can get read by a web crawler someone might as well feed it whole to his Enterprise AI  Model.

Other industries still follow practices like planned obsolescence so why can't we??

We should also take active steps to add characters, implement a technique so we can self poison our data(by adding keywords and stuff)so that when a llm reads it will hallucinate horribly but its hidden from a normal user and doesn't change the resource much.

This has good ramifications, these so called Enterprise models have to manually sift through terabytes of data to avoid major hallucinations if they irresponsibility use data to train on without the authors explicit permission, nobody yet knows how to completely avoid these backdoor attacks, etc..

I think we also have a right to think about ourselves.

What do you guys think?

1blpgt7,DO NOT TAKE ONLINE COURSES IF YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOUR CARD DETAILS !!!,"This is an urgent message for everyone out there who wants to upskill. Do not, and I repeat, do not give out your credit or debit card details if you are doing online courses.

Hear me out. I have posted something like this before but just now I realized the extent of the scam in this online coaching industry. Do not, under any circumstance, give out your card details. If possible, pay only using UPI.

I'll make sure to give you an example. Let's say you took a course of 1 Lakh rupees. You decide to pay the amount using EMI, thinking I'll cancel the course if the instructor is bad or the course is not up to the mark, or worse yet, the course doesn't even start. But guess what? You can't. The banks won't even inform you of this, but they have already paid the required 1 lakh amount to the merchant. Now the money will keep deducting from your account, and you can do nothing to stop it.

You may be thinking ""Hey I'll close my account, or transfer the money somewhere else."" But if you do that, a legal notice will be sent to you, forcing you to pay the required amount even if you did not take the course.

Some people may also be thinking ""I'll just take the pay after placement course."" But even with that, at the start of the course, they will ask you for your card details. After the course, even if you do not get placed, money will start deducting from your account.

There's a reason I love Udemy. The courses are cheap, certifications are valuable, and you have an option to pay using UPI. 

Would love to hear if others have suffered because of this?",2024-03-23 10:55:21

Additionally, 90% of the URLs (14 in total) for the projects mentioned were either dead or inaccessible.

There were typical formatting errors, but what stood out was the mention of using WordPress and Node.js together as a backend. This seems technically implausible and raises serious concerns about the candidate's understanding and credibility.

1b8r56f,Update-01: Done with the rat race. Started my own business.,"Hey Fellow Developers,

I am Shashank. A little backstory I was so done with the rat race and was so burnt out with my job that I quit my job last year in Dec and started my business in Jan. I have a good hand of technology, and I love building software applications. I want to start my own D2C e-commerce company. Although the market is cluttered still I believe my USP is good. When I quit my job I had Rs 22,455.00 in my bank account. Although I come from a decent family background I don't have any liability as such, my family is really supportive but I was clueless when I left my job. I moved back to my hometown from Blr, since I didn't have enough funds for my e-commerce business, I thought of freelancing, and by god's grace, I got a good project. The client was super happy and offered me stay for a longer term. In the meantime, I also onboarded my friend who was struggling with finances and he's a great coder.  
We planned to start an agency and till now I have two clients who are extremely satisfied with us and that is our core value. One of my clients offered me an apartment so I can build from there and I am writing this post from there.

Now that was about me, my next course of action is to onboard more clients I have calculated I need an initial investment of 8.5L for my e-commerce business, which will make a runway for 7-9 months and after that to scale it from there I would require more, but the amount I need can be calculated only after entering the market for 4-5 months. 

Now I need a few suggestions:

1. How does my strategy sound to you? Every feedback is highly appreciated. And would love to connect with like-minded people. Do DM me if you have anything to ask about.
2. I am looking for a mentor. I have potential and a great team, but I need guidance. Anyone who has done it in the first place I would love to connect to you.
3. How can I raise investments?

Last but not the least. If any of you brilliant developers want to build anything and need any IT assistance do reach out to me.

**This sub has been really supportive towards me so I believe it's time to give something back. I have a few clients and projects lined up and I need 1-2 developers and 1 UI/UX designer. DM me if you're looking for new opportunities. I might help you a bit.**

My mental state has deteriorated a lot, I mean I keep thinking about the work 24*7. I'm not able to sleep properly.

1bah4cn,How to be a millionaire as an employee with stocks !!?,"Amateur here. I always thought that base salary is what is important, and stocks don't hold much value, often being used to inflate the CTC. However, while surfing the internet, I discovered that stocks have the potential to generate significant wealth. For instance, SDE 2/3 employees at FAANG, Uber, Atlassian, and others can receive vested stocks worth $100,000-300,000 or more over a four-year period. Considering the average stock increase of 2-3 times in four years, this can amount to a substantial sum. It's mind-boggling to think that individuals with 10 years of experience at companies like Nvidia could potentially earn several hundred crores. 

Now, I have some questions: What exactly matters in stocks? Is it the share price or the percentage increase? For example, is a company's share price going from $1 to $10 equivalent to it going from $100 to $1000?

 Additionally, I'm curious about stocks of startups that aren't listed on Nasdaq. is it valued ? Could you please shed some light on that?

I quit my job recently due to following reasons:

1. I didn't get a pay raise for all the time I was working there (2 years and 4 months)
2. I was exploited and overworked. Often times my manager would assign the low priority tasks in the day and the high priority tasks at 9 - 10 PM at night, he/she would ask me to drop a message before I logged off for the day.
3. I was working with a propritary platform (making it hard to market my skills)
4. The company had really stupid policies for example you have to come 2 days office in office a week otherwise they will deduct your salary (WTF??)
5. I got scammed and lost 84k rupees, this is a personal reason and not related to work but it took quite a lot of mental toll on me eventually forcing me to resigned my job and to look for better otherwise I could've stayed and looked for jobs side by side without any issues. I don't want to get into detail on how I got scammed but I am trying to forget it and focus on improving myself and my career.

I don't know what should I do, my job gap is accumulating over time and I have no idea what reasons to give to an employer who might wanna hire me; I'm afraid of saying something negative about the company I worked at as that can be a red flag to a recruiter/employer.

1b8mezq,Does your salary decide how much support and respect you get in a team?,"A friend of mine is a staff developer, leading a small team. He has over 15 years of experience and has delivered some incredible projects. When I met him other day, he seemed quite disheartened by the way things were going in his team. His team mates of 5 years have suddenly turned cold, unresponsive and sometimes downright rude. They are apparently overriding his authority and reaching out directly to his manager to influence him. He tried to find out what went wrong and if he's been rude to anyone to deserve such a treatment. 

So, one of his newer team mates recently found out about his salary through his boss's acquaintance, and turns out my friend takes home much less; only a couple of lakhs more than the junior most team member. This, according to him, has caused a shift in team dynamics. He feels that they think of him as a lesser person because he earns lesser than them. His manager seems to be trusting him lesser and lesser, even doubting his technical judgements and managerial credibility due to his team skipping the line of authority. He's a humble guy; not very political,  authoritative, or micro-managing. He is also abreast with the latest tech stacks even for his years of exp. But this issue seems to be taking a toll on him.

*tl;dr A developer friend makes less compared to the team he leads. His team mates found that out. Now they are giving him cold shoulders.*

Have you been in situations like this before? If you earn less are you less respected? Are people with higher salaries automatically perceived as more competent and respect-worthy in a team? Is it common?

1brfs4u,"Found a better job, better environment in current market","Hi! Just want to give hopes and wishes to everyone who is actively working hard on switching/getting their desired role in this cutthroat market! I received 3 offers (1 Indian startup, 1 US mid-size company, 1 Indian corporate). Can't reveal too much because of NDAs... Spent 2.5 years in a very toxic place where our learning is very limited as we do vanilla development. Have taken a celebratory break of 2 weeks haha.

Some background info :

* Positions offered -> SDE II (Backend specific)
* CTC -> All 20 LPA +
* YoE -> 2 years 9 months

All the best to you guys out there!

Some suggestions :

* Keep your naukri/linkedin/instashyre/any other platform profiles updated with crisp details in such a way that ppl needn't open your resume to make decision about extending you opportunity.
* Imo, unless you're lucky, you'll have to exhaustively apply & make connections + ask for referrals till you crack it, don't bother about rejections, look further towards new opportunities.
* Pls try to have positive attitude and healthy life! It's ok, life can be hard sometimes, reach out to ppl if you want to talk/vent to get better.
* Practice DSA consistently instead of cramming, try to learn it for the concepts & usages, this way you'll not forget it and would be able to apply the concepts when you see new problems.
* Don't lie to yourself and others about how much you know.. Often via bootcamps and self-pace learning we skip over problems/concepts after superficial reading that yea we got it, pls be honest that you need to revisit or relearn.. It's ok, we're not superhumans.
* Keep your resume clean enough in terms of content & formatting that person reading it should be able to decide if they want to extend opportunity to you within 30-50 seconds! Because that's the amount of time most recruiters spend on resumes due to sheer volume.. Look at your resume from a recruiter's perspective with 30seconds frame and see how you can make it better :)

Edit : Adding things I was assessed on:

* Problem solving (Some required working solution/some pseudo code + dry run/ some implementation + dry run)
* Time & Space complexity calculation
* Communication skills, I never let it be one sided interview and kept discussing, thinking out loud
* Confident answers around my resume.
* SQL commands + Indexing + Table designing (For few)
* API Development affiliated questions, how you'd design for XYZ scenario (For few)
* Code review (For few)
* System design, how I'm going ahead with deciding components, trade off discussions (For most)",2024-03-30 11:35:48
1birf8c,Got Debarred from TCS prime interview for doing ML consulting at a start-up.,"I am a 2024 graduate with interest in ML/DL. I joined a start-up on July 2023 as a ML engineer Intern at a start-up. After 3 months, I was promoted to a consultant role with raised pay. 
On January 2024 I appeared for TCS NQT for privileged Institutions and cleared the screening for the Prime (9LPA) package. But while appearing for the interview I was debarred in the document verification stage since I had previous experience as a ML consultant. I was said that it invalidates my degree and is against the company rules to hire someone who has work experience while in college.

you took engineering because your parents told you to and now are pursuing the path that was set up for you by the universities that you paid dearly for you *WILL* end up as a statistic.

*Why?*
because you don't give a fuck about computers and you simply cannot follow a course to fullfill that requirement. your insatiable need for coursera is going strong.

also some people are simply dumb and coaching institutes will *NEVER* let that thought cross the mind of the parent and just tell them he/she needs to work harder and the parent keeps pushing their kid towards jee because they don't know any better and the kid has no goals or aspirations all he has is a severe lack of personality, no experience with the real world and  has never had the chance or a desire to explore his interests.

1bpp9k4,Job market disruption due to AI and Failing Economy ,"Just had a discussion with my partner over a cup of coffee and she made me think of things in a new light. 

I would explain with an example. Please bear with me. 

Suppose you run a company, you hire 400 people. Things run smooth for a while. Then you introduce an AI software which automated let say 50% of the stuff. So you fire 200 people because you don't need them anymore. After a while you introduce another software which would, let say, automate more stuff, resulting in your firing 100 employee again. By far, It's clear in order to maximise Profit, you are firing people. But, at the same time the remaining 100 people are rarely getting a hike. Not to mention their work load and it's adverse effect on their mental health. 

So what is the solution ? 

How about, on introducing the Ai softwares, you retain all the employees but at the same time, you reduce their working hours. Is this not an healthy way to thrive? Your employees are gonna be happy and productivity would be on the rise too. 

The mentality of wanting more and more is an orthodox way of looking at things and is causing an unbalanced work-life culture. This is a concept which has been fed to us by older economist and I know that it had worked for ages, but don't you think it's time for a change? 

Let me know if I went wrong somewhere or is there any pointers that we are missing here!

But now his way working is so bad that i m so pissed , he doesn't update the ticket status, nor care about the code review.

As he is working on new language its understable that his code maynot be upto standards, but he fucking wont listen and thinks that code works (though it doesn't), i wont be merging the garbage though.

I dont wanna report this to my lead as we are very small tech team it would not be good to complaining of each other.

Even after joining we had to go through a merciless elimination round in which a lot of people were laid off. Again we had a Java Full stack refresher program as training. Till then I was well versed and project ready in development especially Java backed - Spring boot and microservices. 

Then I got tagged to a project and they didn't give me any real work for 8 months even after asking multiple times. They would simply tell me Java in not much required in this project learn .NET. I learnt .Net as well but they didn't give me any work and ultimately released me after the last billing date. Tbh I was somewhat ok with it. 

Then I was in free pool and started getting many calls for project allocation i tried to choose the best opportunity and wanted to go for DevOps as it would be a continuation to my learning but some other guy tagged me in his project (cyber security support related) even after I had already denied the offer. Hence, i couldn't get into the DevOps project coz I was already tagged. I also had got a call from a delivery head he wanted me to work for him for some GenAi and GitHub copilot related team. I told me it is not a support project and its an internal team you will have to do 30% non-technical work. So I joined there. Now I realise it some bull shit team which keeps track of the account who are interested in integrating genAi and other related work. It has nothing to do with any technicalities. I feel cheated. 

What should I do now? I really wanted to learn and work on real-time projects and get used to those environment. I just feel wasting my time in these random stuff it has already been a year and I am most probably stuck with this team for next 6 months. Please help what to do?",2024-03-26 16:58:47
1bn7fzc,2023 grad feeling the unemployment blues.... feeling hopeless ,"It's being quiet some time of unemployment ! It's so frustrating waiting for response of recruiter. I got reply of recruiter for a unpaid internship leading to paid fte, they then asked me to build web3 next.js project as assignment test. 

Another recruiter wanted me to build ith their Django framework . I started the project then got stuck heavily.  The thing being I feel like I  am either being scammed or being wasted.  Or whinning about task being so difficult it will take me some weeks to understand   , contemplate, courage and the build. I don't even the proper tool. I built all my mern frontend,  backend with replit with slow browser. I wait for job for me buy tech gadgets and good stuff. But job is not happening?  

These speed dumps and delays never tends to end. Why universe soo unfair. What kind of hell I this. Nomatter what effort  , standing on tip toes at all time gets you nowhere. What fucking standard these recuiters actually looking for? Is it sexsism? Is it my name (btw its littke unique not regilar abhishek) ? My low cgpa which is 7??  I tried experimenting with tailoring resume with exact jd it's still not working??  Are they lying to seekers when trying actually not hiring?  The kind of trust issues these recruiters have given me in last 2 year has made me nit trust anyone  , I even think all my parents, teachers  fekends ever did was lie and ven now every person lies .

Why so competitive like serious?? For chidi small package.  I sometimes think  what exactly will get me there? Don't say open source ...  that's just  very unrelated and wierd. Personal projects are not even helping.

1bflizn,Writing as a frustrated manager who is trying to recruit data engineers for her team. ," Its scary how many people with even 6-7 yoe still don't know how to make a resume. 

Some must haves
1. 4-5 lines of professional summary -please keep it short
2. Most imp thing- Techstack just below it. Not after your work ex at the last. Not after your education. Just below the professional summary. As a manager that's the first thing I want to know about you. Recruiters do not have the patience to read your huge lengthy professional summary paragraphs to know what tools you have experience in.
3. If 5 yoe -1 page. More than 5 yoe 2 pages
4. No one is reading your work ex paragraphs. 2-3 bullet points each project with result oriented language (more numbers and less text) 
5. A nice clean resume is better than a designer template. 
6. Not a must have but it's often good to know your notice period in the resume too. 


Sorry If I am coming off as rude. Just want to help people who might have reqd skills but not able to get responses due to bad resume. Will keep editing this post if I find something relevant.

Edit : Didnt know CV is diff from resume. Corrected in the post. Thanks for pointing it out. 

Also,views are personal. There are alot of videos out there too on how to prepare a good resume. Doing that due diligence is reqd to understand what works and what doesn't. The advice that gave is based on my research and experience. 

For people who are asking on what to put in professional summary: Years of exp. Current position and domain/industry. And 1-2 more lines which ties your experience to the job description. The focus of last two lines should be to show how you are best fit for the role so try to pick keywords from job description itself. That's why it's needed to tweak this summary based on job description. Again, advice is based on my experience. ",2024-03-15 18:58:05

* Password reset confirmation
* One Time Password, in case a user has forgotten the password, and wants to change it

1bna8wx,Changing careers to web development after a Masters in Mathematics.,"Background: I have been a relatively bright student in my life and  got into IIT Delhi for my Master's in Mathematics, which I am proud of.  However, mathematics is an isolating subject and my mental health took a  hit. I sat for PhD interviews last year, but didn't get a good IIT, so  decided to shift careers rather than wait for the next round of  admissions.   

&#x200B;

This was in December 2023. I started with DSA using C++ and am currently pursuing a course on full stack development. Also dipping into python on the side (basically pursuing the NPTEL Domain certification on programming).

&#x200B;

The problem: Everything feels kinda hopeless. I know that learning things take time but I feel like I'm getting too old to get hired as a  fresher. It seems like I'm putting in effort for something which might  not pay off. Colleges have now started taking in PhD applications for the august 2024 session, and I am really confused about the direction I should go into. Any advice will be helpful. Thank you.   

&#x200B;

Edit: I would like to add that if I do get employed as a web developer, I will keep up-skilling myself to expand my employability.  What I'm primarily worried about is if someone will hire me as a fresher in the first place.   ",2024-03-25 10:24:14

After spending 12 years of schooling I have realised that IT sector is the only field where I can make a sound career, since I started to learn coding in 8th standard but due to my studies I had to leave it in between, but I  started it again in 11th standard when I choose CS instead of PE. 

After my failed attempts to prepare for JEE I have come to the conclusion that it's almost impractical for me to get into CSE/IT or any CS related branches in IITs, NITs, IIITs or even government or good private colleges. Now before giving the second attempt of JEE in April, I have to decide the degree I should pursue and make it clear to my family.

There are 3 major reasons due to which I am planning to go for public university or any Tier 3 college of my hometown to pursue IT related courses:

1. I don't want to prepare for IIT-JEE anymore, as it have questions from Physics and chemistry which are totally irrelevant in IT industry. 

2. I don't have a strong financial background to go to PVT. Tier 2 engineering or BCA colleges in metro cities like Delhi, Banglore etc. 

3. I have a keen interest in IT related subjects like Web dev, Networking, DSA and so on. 

To sum all of this at once, I would say that I am just worried if going for Tier 3 BCA instead of Tier 3 Btech CSE or going for Tier 3 Btech CSE instead of cracking a good college through IIT-JEE would adversely effect my placement journey or maybe the hiring companies are gonna ignore my skills due to my degree Or college.

So I got placed at ninja role. After waiting for a year, they gave us joining. We were trained in 'full stacks development' in different technologies for 3 months in their location ( honeymoon period). After training ended they sent us to the base location where we had to report to the office even when we weren't in project.
After waiting for a month, I got project, a support project ( accepted as I thought it's better to be in project than bench). They (SDM) basically made me fool by saying we have development project, devops project but in reality they were just giving support to the applications.
Then, we wasted another 3 months coz they were just saying learn this learn that. After this my manager connected us to the leads and then I got some work which is obviously not related to what I learnt in the training. I was doing it but then comes the worst part.

Night shift. Yes. My manager told me now you have to do the night shifts half a month. In night shift, work is of monitoring. You just have to see the system if there is any incidents you have to assign it to the particular person. I mean this is what you give to the people who has completed btech in computer science?
During the training, I knew that whatever I am learning here would be totally different to the work they would give to us. But this kind of work I didn't know.

Now I need to leave this. But I am confused whether should I switch to another or prepare for govt. If I switch then I think I would not get time to prepare for govt as responsibility would increase. And If I somehow prepare for govt and get failed then my that time would go in vain which could have helped me in upskilling and switch. Just procrastinating and not able to take decision.
I am depressed and keep regretting to my decisions which put me in this situation. Being homesick, just came back from a few days ago, am feeling worse here.

I have developed small web applications (mostly CRUD) design to deployment in different stacks (python flask, django, MERN stack serverless apps),

some c# WPF desktop applications.

I have worked on tons of automation scripts in PowerShell, python, bash etc.  
I have work experience with many of DevOps tools and some cloud (aws and azure) (I was initially looking at my career in DevOps).



Some how my role looks like Full Stack DevOps Engineer. But the DevOps is totally unconventional to what is perceived in the market.

I am still trying to catch up to DSA and System Design,  and a lot of things that I don't understand.

I have no sense of direction over my career path as my current and previous employers just demand work out of any tech stack or domain.. I couldn't say no as I cannot afford to lose the job. This is affecting my confidence. couldn't muster up the courage to attend interviews as I couldn't gain expertise in specific field neither I worked on enterprise level products. I am afraid I will always remain Coolie Generic developer. I do not get any kind of mentorship or guidance from managers apart that generic motivation bullshit on upskiling which infuriates me everytime I hear it.

I am well paid around 19 L as I work really really hard to deliver projects. but I am not sure if I can justify my pay and experience if I have to attend an interview in any specialized domain. Job Descriptions at my experience level scare me.

most of the time I am having to refer Google which is not a big thing now a days but still keeping everything in mind is really really hard.

does anyone relate to this? please share your opinion on how to come out of this Hell Hole?",2024-03-27 11:31:43

1bjm4mu,Company asking me to pay an obnoxious amount for MacBook Air repair for no fault of mine and things getting weird. ,"My MacBook Air 13‚Äù 128GB (2018) was getting heated up when I was recording and sharing my screen as well on video calls. I raised a request for the concerned team to look into this. They came back to me saying we don‚Äôt have a spare machine at the moment. Alternatively, I requested for a cool pad which should help me temporarily.

They suggested me to wait a few days so they could arrange a spare and get the current one serviced at the Apple service centre. Few weeks later, I migrated the data in the spare MacBook Pro 2015 and handed over my laptop. A week later, they came to me saying the laptop‚Äôs display, battery and motherboard has to be replaced.

I suggested them that the laptop otherwise is fine, and only when I use it for a couple of hours doing resource intensive tasks, it heats up and starts lagging. There is absolutely no need to make these repairs and you can return it back to me and give me a cool pad instead which costs 650rs. and I‚Äôm good to go. But the admin team said, ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt fit into our policy and we need you to work without worrying about the hardware, let us take care of it‚Äù

One week passed by, the admin came back to me saying, ‚ÄúApple Service Centre has suggested that there are some accidental damages to the laptop due to which the battery has leaked and other electronics have been ruined. As per our asset management policy, in case of accidental damages the employ needs to pay for the repairs. Give me one good reason why we should not make you pay for the repairs.‚Äù I was taken aback, not only I kept using my laptop for weeks after raising the issue, I also handed my old laptop after proper data migration and reset. If the battery had actually leaked, how could I possible use the laptop for such a long time?

I agree that the laptop had a huge dent at the base, but that happened 3 years ago when I had to carry my laptop on site for work and I had proactively informed them about the damage along with pictures and offer to pay for the damages as it was my fault. And this has been documented in the annual asset review process. 

Today I escalated the issue with her manager who also happens to be the COO of the company and he‚Äôs also my manager. He said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm aware of the situation and have read the report shared by Apple service centre. The damages seem extreme and we may have to enforce the policy. But let me speak with her first.‚Äù The admin then called me up and shared an update that they are going ahead with repairing the laptop and regarding the policy we‚Äôll need a few weeks to work it out. 

1. I have been asking for the report from the COO and the admin but he said she will share it. She says, I‚Äôll have to check if I‚Äôm allowed to share it and how much can I share. I haven‚Äôt received the report yet. 

2. They weren‚Äôt even sharing an estimate for repair. I said, ‚Äúthere is a possibility that I may have to pay, so I have the right to know the cost of repair.‚Äù After much insisting, she shared the estimated cost of repair which comes to around 52000. I immediately asked her, ‚Äúdo you have a business justification to spend 52000 on a 7 year old MacBook Air which today costs less than half of what you‚Äôre spending?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why I asked this, but she had no answer told me she‚Äôd get back to me on this. 

Help me out guys, I don‚Äôt know what happens next and what should I do. 


Tldr: I asked for a cool pad, company suggested to send the laptop for service. Service centre sent an absurd estimate and now I am being asked to pay for the repairs. ",2024-03-20 19:32:38

I have helped my professors also.

And for the presentation part, I didn't wanted to stand and press any key on keyboard, I searched a lot for a solution for controlling computer from my mobile, didn't like any solution, so I coded a website and my presentation, and that website allowed me to navigate my presentation using my phone even when both (computer and mobile) were on the different network.

1bdq7p2,Work sucks and I dont know what life looks like moving forward,"Hello! 

This is a throwaway account (will become obvious soon enough). I got placed in 2022 at  sister of a WITCH company (definitely not one that rhymes with Bata Berexi) and while the pay is what you'd expect (the unchanged 3.5LPA)  I was happy. I had struggled in my 11th and 12th and while the interview was nearly a joke with how bad I did I guess they were in the mood to hire a ton of people and thats exactly what happened. I was ecstatic but soon that excitement died as I realzied they cancelled my internship and then delayed my joining till Oct 2023 where I now work.
 
The issue is I am not given work and my batch(4 people in my unit, 23 of us overall) is stuck in training hell. Joining at the start of October we had 1 month of HR and basic tech training and then (the 4 I spoke about) moved to Kotlin where after completing that we were informed there was actually no requirement for people.

Now theyre training us in React and are barely giving time to understand what we are even watching in the training vids. I get that as a CS grad I should continuously polish my skills and not learning React earlier was a mistake but are we really expected to complete a 50hr long video course + hands on work in 10 days (including weekends) while also commuting to work (3hr commute) daily? 

All the reviews I read online and the people I spoke to who worked with or at the company said while the pay might not be great, the work you do will matter and I'm finding it hard to believe I'll even work at this point. 

I know I'm very lucky to have a job rn and this is a free paycheck every month for watching tutorials but with the 6month mark not too far off I see my peers who joined earlier are already making meaningful progress in their career while I feel like I'm still in the same place from when I graduated. Was I wrong to expect that life at work would be nice? Is this just what being a working individual entails?

I was thinking if this persists any longer I just ditch CS as a career and try to do an MBA because I cant imagine wasting so much time on a job whoss only upside is the paycheck and in a time where jobs are already scarce I cant re-enter the market as a fresher after wasting so much time.

First and foremost, I want to extend a massive thank you to everyone who reached out with their resumes and shared their stories of struggle.

When I offered to collect resumes and provide guidance, as a comment under a certain post.  
I didn‚Äôt anticipate the overwhelming response. It's been both humbling and enlightening to see so many talented individuals coming forward.  
Although I‚Äôm just one person with two years of experience in full-stack development, I've done my best to respond to each of you. However, the sheer volume has made it clear that the challenges we face are larger than any one of us can tackle alone.

This is a tough period for our industry, with job markets feeling the pinch and many of us facing uncertainty about our futures.

I want to specifically call upon our moderators and fellow members of r/developersIndia to join hands in supporting each other more actively during these times. Whether it‚Äôs through sharing opportunities, providing mentorship, or simply lending an ear to those in need, every little bit helps.

If you‚Äôre in a position to help, whether by referring candidates, offering advice, or sharing resources, please do. And to those in need, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help. We are stronger together, and it‚Äôs by lifting each other up that we‚Äôll overcome these challenges.

Once again, thank you to everyone who has reached out. Your trust and openness are what make this community great. Let‚Äôs continue to support one another, share knowledge, and grow together.

Warm regards,

1bkd8e3,Staying in the same company/project will hold you back,"So, I have been working with this company for almost 3 years now. I have been in the same project all this time. I was involved from conceptualizing the project till the final stage of the product being certified and to be used by clients. 

Within this duration a lot of folks were onboarded and offboarded because of the budget cuts at the client or product. Most of them have switched to better roles and here I am stuck in the same company and project.

Is doing better for your company a bad thing, Because they have been retaining me in the same project and I have been working day and night to make the product a success. But the reality hit me now when I saw an ex colleague whom I mentored got a better pay then me and he only worked with me for 3-4 months but has his complete resume filled with the things that I have built and lead.

1b8kee5,Companies which giveaway used servers / at less cost,"Hello,

I am a homelab enthusiast and I run a basic homelab right now with a server in my home which runs many services. I have spent a lot on my existing server which is also a used one. I see many companies giveaway used servers after a year or so when they aren't in need of it. I could go ahead and buy one, but the costs are too damn high. So I wanted to know if any of you guys are aware of companies giving out servers either as giveaway or at less cost? 

I saw one shop selling a used server from a company at INR 1 lakh. I was under the idea that no company in India would give out used stuff like that. But that's not true when I saw this. So if any of you guys know about this, I'd be willing to contact those companies for this.

1bo42b1,How can I get a job at big tech companies without graduation?,"My story till now:
I am 20M and I am not enrolled in any graduation program. I really wanted to pursue B.tech in CSE but couldn't because of my serious health issues. I started programming in 9th standard and Java was my first language. As I move forward in my journey I studied more stuff on my own like Computer Science topics, mathematics, C++, Python, MERN stack. But eventually I got bored and wanted to dig deep instead of learning tools and technologies. I am learning C right now (half way through the book C Programming: A Modern Approach 2ed). I am planning to start grinding CodeForces and DSA. And I am also thinking of going to my first love (Java) at some point to do development.

Straight to the question:
The thought of not having graduation done and not having a degree really bothers me. I am not a job oriented person and I only study becuase it feels good studying these things. But deep inside there's a fear that will the good companies in my dream list accept me. It always feels like what could I do to fill the gap of no degree and balance it out. Anyone who works in a product based company please give me some of your words of wisdom.

1bje169,Got a job offer from a startup. Accept/Reject? (Need suggestions),"Hey there, So as the title says, I got an offer from a startup where I used to intern a year before. I did internship for around 3 months at 10k/month as a full stack developer but mainly worked on backend. Yesterday I got a call from the co-founder and he gave me a job offer. The position is of backend developer and he is currently offering me 4lpa (in hand). He said once they get the 2nd investment he'll increment the salary. The founders are young and very helpful and there was no pressure even when i was intern. So this was about job offer.

Talking about me, I'm currently in last year of engineering (IT) last semester (already half done). Never had KTs (internal/external) before. Current average cgpa is around 8.65.

So considering all these factors, what do you think I should do?? Should I accept the offer or no? And why?

You all are more experienced than me so your suggestions and opinions will help me a lot.

1b4mcjw,Forceful early release after resigning. Is it ethical.,"So I recently joined this org. (< 4 months )
But since I joined, I was suffering due to the toxic culture and shitty people (especially the reporting seniors) working overtime and micromanaging the employees ...  I resigned last month without having other offer in hand. ( Yes I know thats fcked up but I stopped caring anymore )
We have 60 days of notice period and I have completed 30 days with proper work. But my manager has taken my resignation to his heart and releaving me in one month.. I have not got any offer yet and dont want a month of gap in my employment.
Am I obliged to leave early as they are asking... Are they saving money deliberately? Can managers do this kind of shitty things... Then what is the role of notice period?? I am starting to realise we are all slaves and these people are taking advantage of us...

Please guide whether should I stand on my ground for 60 days notice or agree for the early release.

Edit:
I have contacted 2 3 people who are HRs (in other company) and they said its upto the company to decide whether to releive me early as I was the one who resigned. Anyways I was not happy with the work culture hence I returned the assets and dont want to fight against the odds.. thank you all for the replies. Peace.

1bq9t5y,Don't understand how people crack product MNCs. Can anyone tell me.,"I have given interviews in many product based MNCs.  (Fresher)
1st company: technical questions on computer networks for 30 mins, I gave a wrong answer on 20th minute, was asked to leave immediately.

2nd company: didn't allow me to give interview as they already selected required people.

3rd company: Asked a technical question on bit manipulation + linkedlist, I coded and ran it on an ide, got expected result for his suggested test cases, rest of the interview he talked about his team's work, then sent to hr round. Hr asked some basic questions and then they put me on hold and rejected me in the end.

4th company: Asked oops concepts, made to code inheritance example, then asked projects, then asked a coordinate geometry coding problem. Struggled a bit as I didn't have practice in this topic but finally solved it. Interviewer again put me on hold, rejected me after all interviews were over.

5th Company: Took 1 hour interview, asked everything there was to ask. 3 coding questions(maps+string, easy topics for me)+ all projects+core subject questions+questions on skills listed in resume. Answered everything. Rejected.

6th company: Asked to write exception handling + oops problem code. Ended up writing oops in c++ and exception handling in Java, then asked if I know docker, azure, etc. replied no. Rejected.

7th company: Asked general questions like family background, marks, do you like embedded systems. Nothing technical or even behavioural. Rejected.

8th company: Asked java basics, 2 coding questions, design patterns, i didn't know any design patterns, interview ended.

9th company: Asked maths puzzles and python coding problems, passed 1st interview. 2nd interview was machine learning design for real world problems, then puzzle, then asked another 2 maths puzzles both I couldn't answer so rejected.

10th company: Final company after which I just gave up. Asked c++ concepts in depth for 0.5 hour, system design discussion of Google maps for 15 mins, c++ design patterns discussion for 10 min, ml project discussion for 15 min. Interview was supposed to be 1 hour but interviewer extended it to ask more, asked geometry puzzles for 10 min and then 2 coding questions, just different approaches for another 10 mins. Then allowed me to ask questions on the company for 10 min. I felt it went well. I mostly answered everything except 1 c++ question. Company never gave results and ran away.

How can I make myself so good that I can answer 100% of the questions with 100% accuracy in almost 20 different topics of computer science. I feel I can never achieve that level of perfection. My friends were only shortlisted in 1 or 2 company, they got selected in them. How do you guys do it? I wish I could see someone's interview cracking a product company in real time to understand why I am failing. If I ask my friends they just say it's all luck. But that doesn't help me in any way and I don't feel it's true. Luck can screw me once or twice, not 10 times.",2024-03-28 23:15:17

1bnivuj,Complete Competitive Programming/DSA guide that i followed for grabbing a job as SDE,"I know this post may not belong here, but there are a lot of Btech students who are aspiring to be a developer. Also i ve been getting a lot of dms from the users of this subreddit. Hence im posting this here.  
Hello everyone, I (21M) am currently working as a Software Developer. I've been getting lots and lots of DMs regarding how do I get a job, how i prepared for it and queries regarding that. I'll try to cover maximum such questions here in this post.

A little about me -> I did my B-Tech from a Tier 1 college and i used to teach my juniors Competitive Programming and DSA there (completely free), and these all resources, list and advices are just a compilation of what all i learnt throughout my teaching journey.

My advice to everyone in their 1st/2nd year is become good at competitive programming(CP) rather than just focusing on basic DSA. DSA is just a small portion of questions/topics, CP trains your mind how to think when a certain problem arises, this is exactly what big IT companies look for, the ability to find effective and efficient solution to new problems quickly. DSA is just a some certain pattern of questions that are most frequently asked, but if you have a good grip on CP, solving DSA problems will not be a big deal for you.

My recommendation would be start with **C++ language**, as its the most preferred language in CP/DSA

So now coming to the topics/roadmap that i covered, i started CP from my 2nd semester of Btech.  
You can start from

**LUV C++ youtube channel -> The best resource for CP** watch the entire video thoroughly and practice the questions given in description. Practice similar questions on **HackerEarth, Codeforces, Codechef**  
Cover all the topics from his playlist, this is the bare minimum.

The following topics are very important with respect to placements and interviews, so along with LUV C++ playlist you need to cover them from a lot of other resources

**Dynamic Programming** \-> In addition to Luv C++, go through **ADITYA VERMA's DP PLAYLIST** and practice a lot a lot of questions of Dynamic Programming

**Graphs** \-> Go through **CODE N CODE's Graph Playlist** 1 & 2 (1 is a must do) and practice a lot a lot of questions of Graphs

**Binary Search** \-> Go through **CODEFORCES EDU** videos and try to solve the practice questions yourself

**Two Pointers** \-> Go through **CODEFORCES EDU** videos and try to solve the practice questions yourself

**SegTree, Lazy Propagation, Binary Lifting, LCA** (very advanced topics only asked in top companies) -> **CODE N CODE**

**Fenwick Tree** \-> **LUV C++** (old videos where he explained everything on the whiteboard)

**DSU** \-> **LUV C++** and **STRIVER** **(TAKE U FORWARD)**

Don't just focus on covering these topics, try to learn how to approach a new problem cause most big companies will be asking you questions that have never been asked before and you should know how to approach them.

**THROUGHOUT THE JOURNEY OF LEARNING THESE CONCEPTS, TRY TO GIVE AS MUCH CONTESTS AS YOU CAN, ON CODEFORCES, CODECHEF wherever you can**

**THERE IS NO BETTER WAY OF LEARNING HOW TO THINK THAN TO GIVE CONTESTS, after each contest try to solve atleast one more question that you were not able to solve in the contest.(UP-SOLVING)**

**-------------------------- DSA ROUTE ------------------------------------**

If you just want to go through DSA (3rd year) quickly, and dont want to follow the CP route, just go through these topics and do them thoroughly. But as it's just a shortcut, so don't expect the results to be same as the ones you ll be getting after following the CP route.

**PREFER CP ROUTE IF YOU HAVE TIME**

Those who have already gone through the CP route, these topics below will not take much time and you can quickly wrap up on them in 3 months. Just practice their questions on **LEETCODE** and you ll be a DSA GOD

1. Arrays (Questions Practice)
2. Strings Algorithm (Striver + CodeNCode)  

   1. **KMP**, **Rabin Karp (must)**
3. Maths (Questions Practice)  

   1. Number Theory, Combinatorics
4. Binary Search (Codeforces EDU + Luv C++ Yt)
5. Bit Manipulation (Questions Practice)¬†
6. Two Pointers (Codeforces EDU)
7. Linked List (Striver)
8. Stack & Queues (Striver)
9. Recursion & Backtracking (Striver)
10. Hashing (Questions Practice)
11. Heaps & Maps (Striver + Aditya Verma for Heaps)
12. Binary Tree & BST (Striver)
13. ¬†DP & dp with bitmasking (Aditya Verma + Striver DP playlist)
14. Graphs (CodeNCode + Striver + Luv C++ Yt)
15. DFS, BFS, TopoSort
16. Shortest Path Algos (Dijkstra, Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall)
17. MST (Prim‚Äôs & Kruskal)
18. Articulation Points & Bridges (very rarely asked)
19. Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju‚Äôs Algo)
20. LCA (Binary Lifting)
21. Hamiltonian Path (directly asked in coding rounds)
22. Trie (Striver)
23. DSU (Striver + Luv C++ Yt )
24. SegTree (CodeNCode), Lazy Propagation(CodeNCode), Fenwick Tree (Luv C++) 

Along with DSA, practicing questions on **LEETCODE** is a must. **Pick up a DSA sheet like STRIVER 450 DSA SHEET and solve it completely**. Along with it you can complete the entire problem list of **InterviewBIT**.

**------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Try to reach an **EXPERT ON CODEFORCES & 1900+ rating on LEETCODE.** Boosts up the resume and once you are on this level, cracking a job in a big high paying MNC is not a big deal for you.

**IF YOU WANT TO BECOME REALLY GOOD AT CP, GO THROUGH CSES QUESTIONS LIST**

**Some questions & answers -**

**Q1. Did i solve all of them myself?**  
A. Yes and Yes, i did both CP & DSA, i solved around 1500+ questions combined of both. I've personally gone through a lot of other resources as well, but the ones that i have put here are the finest ones.

**Q2. Is doing all this worth it?**  
A. At the position I'm currently at, i can tell that every single minute that i dedicated to this is worth it. The salary that gets credited in my bank account at the end of every month is only cause I did all this hustle and hardwork.

**Q3. Question i receive a lot in DMs -> Im from Tier 3/Private college, can i still get a good placement?**

A. Yes you can, by believing that you cant grab a good placement you are actually finding excuses of not putting in efforts. I've seen Tier3 college students grabbing really good packages. You just have to work hard, you may not get the peer group that guys in Tier 1/2 colleges will get, but you can still work hard and get to their level by compensating the college drawback with good skills.

**Q4. Am i doing all this just cause i want to sell a course or earn money ?**  
A. Haha, nah I'm writing this post just to help you folks grab good placements and improve the lifestyle of you and your families. My sole aim is to help all my juniors in their journey, so i can contribute back to the society.

**Q5. I have XYZ months left, what can i do now?**  
A. Just stop complaining and start practicing. Only you can help yourself. Noone is gonna come to save you once you are sitting in front of an interviewer.

So now you folks dont have any excuse of not putting in efforts, you have all the required resources and the complete roadmap. JUST START PRACTICING.

To all the experienced folks, i tried to mention everything in this post, but if i still missed out on something, add your advice in the comment section. *I ll include that in the post.*

If any of you still have any queries, feel free to use the comment section.

I am in my last semester and have a job offer in hand with a salary of around 6 LPA, but my family thinks that I should just complete my graduation and help with the family agriculture.

My father believes that I should focus on agriculture mainly because of these reasons:

1. They earn much more through agriculture than what I would be earning after working in the IT industry for 10 more years. Also, in his opinion, I'm just an average kid and wouldn't grow that much in the IT industry. Agriculture also offers more stability and greater potential earnings if done right.
2. I have a younger brother, and my father says that if I stay and focus on farming, my brother would have the freedom to pursue further studies, and having me at home would help him immensely.
3. He also mentions that agriculture has massive potential if combined with technology, and he doesn't have the proper education to integrate our agriculture with the latest tech. Therefore, he believes I should be in charge of that.

So I'm in a dilemma because somewhere I too think that maybe my father is right. But then, having spent most of my life in various cities, I would have to change my lifestyle completely to adjust to village life.

What factors should I consider while making this choice. How should I approach this decision? Any advice/suggestion are really appreciated.",2024-03-14 06:12:41

I am having 8 months of working experience, 2 months back I joined this company as a Jr. Android Developer, I got good grip over their one of the most important codebase. What happened was their one and only iOS developer was going on a sabbatical leave of 4-5 months and due to certain reason they were not able to find any candidate during his notice period. So 15 days before his notice period ends they had a thought that I might be a fast learner and new to company so they asked me to learn iOS development ASAP.

I started learning it from yt, then within 2 weeks I got a level of grip that I was able to understand their iOS codebase and then the guy left I had to take interviews of people having more exp than me. I hired one of them, but he'll still take few weeks to get into prod.

The thing is everyday they have tasks and anything I am doing they want it by ""Shaam"" (EOD). At this point it doesn't even feel that they are having a thing in mind that I am a fkin 4 weeks exp iOS developer. They just gives me shit ton loads of work, sometimes when we have to go live, they give work just before it and make me do overtime.  

My personal problem is that if I have a task which may be a smaller for an exp iOS dev, even if I am not able to do it within few hours or by EOD, I feel bad about it and stressed about it. Even when I leave the office, my mind cannot and this is a very bad experience I just woke up from sleep and all I am thinking about is that how to do that task. It just makes me feel bad that I might not be competent even I am new to all this.

But in the new org it is all the same, on top of this I am expected to work 24/7 and meet unrealistic deadlines, I waste time in commute for 2 hrs a day and I am feeling very under productive. Apart from being a developer I am also expected to provide Support / SRE which was not told to be during the interviews and I am also not allowed to take leaves (Apart from 5 days of sick leave) for one year. Adding to this, since I am coming from outside I am getting paid the highest and my team mates are juniors/interns who really don‚Äôt know what they are doing so I end up helping them and I am unable to focus on my work again hampering my productivity.

I am in a really bad state right now, every night I come home tired, unable to take care of myself, and having 0 motivation to go to work, sometimes I feel like just quitting or going back to the previous org or taking a break after quitting and start applying for jobs.

On top of this, the current org had a point in the acceptance letter where I have to pay them one month of salary to them if I am quitting before one year, but this point was not there in the offer letter and they have taken my degree certificates for verification which they said it will take 60-90 days (I am baffled by this, and something I get scared what if they don‚Äôt return at all, but I have an email written by them saying they have collected my certificates).

All of this if making my day and life miserable. I am really not sure what to do, should I quit and start applying for other jobs ?, should I take a break ?, How this will affect my career? And quite not sure what to tell the HRs about the immediate switch.

1bf9c6u,Afraid of not getting Promoted *again* in the upcoming Cycle (CHWTIA),"I work in CHWTIA. In the last performance cycle in Dec 2023, I was denied promotion.  


The reason my immediate supervisor gave me was that she didn't know I was hired at career level 11 and thought that I was hired at career level 12. So she thought I have been promoted once already in my 3 years of career, and I am asking for a promotion again.  


Another reason she gave me was that she didn't know the amount of extra effort I have been putting through as I was working as the only resource for the past 2-3 months in the project from offshore.   


I tried escalating this to the higher management, but as it went above and above, their reasons started becoming more and more generic, like they don't have budget, they cannot promote everyone etc etc. I even asked my HR the criteria to get promoted and he said that they usually promote after staying 2 years on the same level, while I have been on the same level for 3 years and also putting all the efforts which I can. But he said that the decision of promotion is entirely up my management, what's done is done and he cannot help me in this.  


Feeling helpless, I somehow gulped this and blamed my own luck for not getting promoted.  


But ever since that day, today also, more than ever, I am afraid that what if they again do not promote me and give me some vague reasons for it. What will I do? What can I do in that case? Is there anything which I can do if this happens again? What will I say if they again tell me that they do not have budget in this cycle also? Is there any legal action which I can take?  Is there literally anything I can do in this case? I am already drowning in fear and despair thinking about this.

1br66hc,"I'm getting anxious that people will ""steal"" my project","I have two  fintech projects that I want to show on resume. [One](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chooseausername6544/comments/1bbbl8e/write_up_on_my_blazingly_fast_fintech_project/) is written in C++, Lua and the other one is that I'm writing in Go and frontend technologies.

Both of them are unique and extremely niche. In the era where everyone is just making a e-commerce app or just calling libraries from Python I'm making unique projects with *real life use case*. I'm getting anxious that people will *steal* my code/ideas. I actually read a comment here which read, ""I'm stealing this"".

To counter this I've written some vague stuff in my resume. For example, my resume reads, ""Used principles of algebra, buffering and <a brief intro of my custom algorithm> to increase the speed by x% as compared to <na√Øve approach and using built in data structures>"".

I feel like this is okay enough but I'm still feeling uneasy. Both of projects are hosted on my private Git repository that's hosted on my VPS. Only few friends have read only access to the first one and no one has access to the second one.  I wouldn't be so paranoid if my projects didn't had relation to the fintech *startup* I'm working on.

I'm in my 8 sem now, and currently doing an in-office internship (10AM-7PM, 5 days), in a ""7 year old startup"" with 4 full time employees, including the founder, and 3 interns including me.

They have a product, but it is built only by interns and it's nowhere near production ready. It is 2 years old and legacy at this point. They know about the state of their ""product"", but still run full fledged campaigns to promote it.

They survive by providing software services, and most of the times the founder forces everyone to complete whole project by deadlines like ""tomorrow 12 PM""  or ""next 2 days"".

I can go on and on about it, but I'm confused whether to wait 3 months till it ends, or leave now.

1bkge7h,Some tips for fellow developers who are new to IT industry,"While most of us knows these basic tips, I hope these'll help some people.

1. Product knowledge is as important as technical knowledge. This makes difference between good developer and mediocre one.

2. Keep a list of SMEs on each service/project in your company. 

3. Learn how to search/query and read logs in kibana...etc. This will help you a lot when debugging the prod issues.

4. No question is stupid one, and if you ask the same question more than once you're the stupid one.

5. Don't spoonfeed anyone. Don't do other guys work. Just give basic idea on how to work on the issue. If he/she asking for more help just say I also don't know much, and point them towards your team lead.

6. Keep an eye on what's happening in the other teams also. Best way to do it is joining as many slack channels as possible and look through them when you've time. It'll help you lot when you face an issue. Most of the times issues you face are because of other teams messing up their services. Keeping on eye on them will help you finding the fixes faster.

7. Don't forget to say thanks to someone I they helped you. Some companies use useless point systems, give them some points.

8. Review your colleagues MR/PRs. You don't need to find problems, just read and try to understand their code. You can ask your doubts, it'll help you get better knowledge.

9. Don't pick other people's slack. Some people just mysteriously gets sick just before the deadline. He'll say things like I done 95% of work , very small things are pending. Never trust words of those kind of guys. They most likely haven't done even 5% of the work. If manager/lead asks you to pick that up, don't agree immediately. First look what he done, how much time he exhausted and how much left. Then give your feedback to them, asks for how much time you need. If they it's urgent then say you can't do it in given time frame.

10. Also when picking up other people's assign it yourself. Some managers especially in service companies keeps the ticket in original guys bucket, so client don't fire that guy for non performance. Never agree to it.

11. Talk what do you done clearly at standup. Just don't say things like I'm working ticket-25. And clarify your doubts immediately.

12. In estimation and grooming meetings, fucking talk. I see so many people who just completes their tickets nothing else. These meetings help your manager/lead to understand your knowledge. These also helps in understanding the ticket/feature better and you can identify edge cases easily.

13. Help others, clarify their doubts even stupid doubts. But if a guy is asking same things again and again ignore him.

14. Don't gossip on colleagues with other colleagues/managers. Manager is not your friend, he acts friendly with you to make you spy on others. He does same with others also.

15. If any incident happens like prod errors...etc. Participate in the discussion, debug if possible. Dont be like It's not related to my ticket, I don't know anything about it ..etc. Just read the issue and follow what is happening.

16. Last but not least learn how to debug every language/tool you work.

And fellow developers please add your tips and insights also

Looks like some scam or data collection HR/recruiter Mafia thing. 
Really like to know from other if they know anything about this or facing similar thing. 

Also, I have noted that these calls have become extremely rude and unprofessional. These don't even sound like real recruiters or HRs. May be third party contractors working from home at low rates, as a result they have no obligation to be professional.



Edit:
Thanks for sharing your replies and details related with your experiences. I am sure it is helpful to many readers.

Please whoever comes across should share their opinions as well. Spread the word. 

I think the HR and recruiters are becoming unhinged and cause they have upper hand in this whole interview process, they know most people will give their personal and sometimes even bank/pan/aadhaar details which can be used in many wrong ways - creating fake profiles and who knows what.

Regarding one should not share their details - most candidates are desperate to find any job now a days, so it is easy to exploit from Hr/recruiter POV. 
Beware most people may not be even HRs or recruiters , but again candidates will not dare to ask for HR or recruiter background right. 

Some have told me to go ahead and share INcorrect Pan or aadhaar numbers , but wouldn't that will cause even more issues. Cause when they will check incorrect pan and addhaar it will come as non-existent and then they will idiotically tag your profile as fake or fraud. Thereby destroying any future calls or worse if they are part of bigger HR mafia company, then your profile will never be selected for any company.

1bqodt6,I got laid off and seeking opportunities in React/NextJS,"After recently being laid off, I am actively seeking new opportunities within the realm of React, Next.js, React Native, and GraphQL. With 1.8 years of hands-on experience in these technologies, I've had the privilege to contribute to various projects, refining my skills and delivering impactful solutions.

While I've gained valuable experience in React Native, I've realized my true passion lies in web development. Therefore, I'm eager to transition back to this field where I can fully utilize my expertise and drive meaningful results.

If you had recently laid off, what strategies did you apply for your next job?

1bg2jug,How hard is it to get a web dev job as a fresher in India?,"My sister(24) is trying to get an IT job. She finished M.Sc in 2022 December from a local tier 3 college near Hyderabad. And since the past year she‚Äôs been learning some coding languages. She learned HTML and CSS on her own and built some web pages like a resume website, a portfolio etc. Then I taught her python and she‚Äôs currently learning javascript from YouTube, with the aim of learning React(or vue) and eventually being placed as a junior developer.

But my parents are forcing her to get married, manipulating her and emotionally blackmailing her saying that she is never going to get a job and will grow old and stay single if she doesn‚Äôt get married now. She has PCOS and a mild unwanted hair problem. And my parents are using this problem as a weapon against her and messing up her self confidence. I hate my parents for it. Even I(29M) want her to stand on her own feet before she gets married. My question is, realistically, what kind of effort does she need to put in to land a job?

What is the current job market like for freshers? Are fundamentals of web dev, react, some back-end framework, and a couple decent projects going to be enough? What more does she need to learn and what kind of projects does she need to build? Or she‚Äôs going to have to learn DSA and solve leetcode problems as well?

1bcqvq0,Deliveroo Interview Experience for Softwarre Engineer II profile,"I recently got chance to appear for deliveroo's interview. I would like to share my experience so that it can help you all

There are 5 stages 
1. Prescreening - you get a standard hackerrank test consiting 2 medium difficulty question.

2. Take home exercise - I got the exercise of cron parser implementation. Even though they ask to write a script you are suppose to implement a full fledge production grade solution having testcases, abstraction, modularity in mind.

3. Behavioral - It was interview with the engineering manager. The question asked were situation based and they try to learn how you reacted to a real life situation and try to understand you professionally whether you are resilient, make impact and try to colloborate or not. Its better to answer the question based on STAR method.

4. System Design - The problem I got was to design a system which can handle a compaign where we are suppose to sell coupons for 6M burgers within 10 min. You can use cache and load balancers to implement a design. You need to design this on platform like draw.io.
Although they try to skip capacity planning but they care about qps and internal working of tools you are using in design

5. Coding - The question were extention on the take home exercise. I was first asked to discuss the approach i followed to design solution and trade offs which are not implemented in the code. If there were any edge cases missing I was asked to handle those then I was asked to implement the case to implement cyclic order for ranges. Suppose if the days are supported as 2-5 and return 2,3,4,5 then if I give 5-2 that should yield me 5,6,7,1,2. 

Overall the experience was great. I was not got selected due to coding round reviews. I didn't used right data structure and there duplicacy in my code and interviewer thought i could have used abstraction at few places.

Its a great opportunity for individuals who are working in java and want to move in go language.
I am hoping to try again in 6 months.

1bam66n,The love for computing and programming..How I got into programming ,"A conversation today caused me to recall why/how I got into software development..
I remember I did not like computer/software..was afraid of turning on a CPU.
And I wanted to do mechanical engineering. But family members convinced me otherwise, and I joined computer engineering branch in 2007. I was unhappy with the choice 'enforced' on me.

Now in first semester I came to understand that 'we can tell the computer to do a thing, and it will do exactly that .. we have to learn it's language which is like English but needs some additional logic'. And I remember getting the 'Let us C' book one semester in advance.. 

as I read that book I realised 'this is great .. It's like a superpower. I can tell computer to do a task and it will do exactly that..it's deterministic..it's not like the real world where things are dependent on lot of external factors like - people's emotions, their preferences etc. this machine is my lab and I can create my world in it, I can build things. I don't have to worry about the nondeterministic/unpredictable nature of the real world..it's not like other engineering domains where we have to do something physically..all we need is a some logic, creativity and the will to persist some hard problems.. programming is just like communication with a computer , sometimes it does not understand our intention, sometime we don't understand it's error messages, and that is a good challenge for me'.

And when I got the first 'hello world' program working on the turbo C compiler, I was so happy.. 
And now after 13-14 years in the software industry, I see that it turned out to be the most appropriate decision which my parents made for me.. I am sure I won't have survived another branch like mechanical engineering..at best I would have been mediocre mechanical engineer.. I would not have the passion for programming which I still have..

Granted things are not always ideal..there is office politics , things which we can't control, and even in software development not everything is 'deterministic and predictable '  with ambiguous requirements and edge cases..

But overall the choice my parents made for me, turned out to be one of the best life decisions .and I will be grateful to them always.",2024-03-09 16:52:31

Initially trained on Angular and Spring Boot, I was quickly thrown into an open-source project for three months. Then, I was tasked with building a React Native app from scratch, followed by backend development. The learning curve was steep, and expectations high, with little formal training provided.

Now, six months into the job as a full timer (into the product- the main one)with a 6LPA salary, I'm feeling overwhelmed by the constant pressure and comparisons to more experienced developers. Seniors are quitting due to workload, and I'm struggling to keep up with customer escalations and bugs.

It's made me question whether I can meet the company's expectations and whether this demanding environment is sustainable for me in the long run.

1bn9t5h, Paid Internship Opportunities is a Scam or Not? I believe it is. Change my view. ,"So, I was applying for internships on LinkedIn. I was applying randomly and my resume which has nothing got selected for the interview. It was for backend role, i asked the interviewer what topics i would be asked, they said basic html, css, js. Here is the red flag. 

Today i had given the interview, asked me nothing just told me what technologies i will be working on. And then proceeded to explain there is a training period for which I have to pay and then I will be assigned a client's project. For that there is a stipend of 1k. And i need to pay 1k for the training. 

I think since companies are not making money, they are selling their own course materials to make money off desperate students. 

Should i pay 1k or not for this crap? 
I DECIDED NOT TO PAY, AND NO ONE SHOULD FALL FOR THIS TRAP.

1bfahlf,I quit the job two months ago for numerous reasons.,"\*\*Reasons for Leaving:\*\*

\- My manager wasn't very tech-savvy.

\- Working six days a week was exhausting.

\- Having to use my own laptop was inconvenient.

\- Not having fixed days off was frustrating.

\- Appraisals were unpredictable.

\- The constant supervision was overwhelming.

\- The HR department wasn't very helpful.

\- And more...

&#x200B;

\*\*Background:\*\*

I started as a fresh full-stack developer but ended up stuck doing only frontend work in React, which was very monotonous .

&#x200B;

\*\*Current Situation:\*\*

For the past two months, I've been on a learning spree. I've broadened my skills to include backend work, managing databases, deploying websites, and exploring new technologies like Next.js. I've completed a few projects that cover both frontend and backend aspects. I've also picked up skills in tools like Postgres, Prisma, Recoil, and Zod. I've even dabbled in Hono for Cloudflare. Additionally, I've made few  contributions to open-source projects, expanding my experience and knowledge.

&#x200B;

With my expanded skill set, I'm now eager to explore new job opportunities. **I'd love to hear any tips on how to approach job hunting effectively**.

Lately, I've been on the job hunt, and it's been tough to keep my focus at work. I usually pride myself on giving my all and meeting deadlines, but lately, I find myself distracted by applying to jobs, working on leetcode problems, or reading up on system design even during office hours. As a result, my tasks are getting delayed, giving the same updates in daily scrum calls for few days. It might also be because of my disturbed sleep cycle, I sleep at around 11.30 pm and wake up early at around 5 to solve leet code problems.

Building projects are like my best friend; we're always together. While browsing LinkedIn, I found a startup looking for interns with no pay. I thought, ""Why not apply? I might learn something."" After a smooth onboarding and answering some random interview questions, I joined them.

I checked the GitHub(it's even person account), and it was empty except for the two projects we're currently working on. I decided to look into the two Team Leads, both of whom are still in college. Their projects seem interesting, even though they're in the early stages, and the ideas sound good. However, what really bothers me is that instead of adding me as a contributor, they prefer forking the repository. I find this frustrating. When I asked why, they explained that it's because I might make mistakes as a beginner. I tried to explain that we could protect the main branch and only merge changes through pull requests after they've been approved. If something goes wrong, we can always revert back. However, they were adamant and insisted on their approach. Their primary mode of communication is WhatsApp, which I really dislike,

They will tell you after the internship company will provide full time job and If company didn't give offer, we will help you to get another internship and that might give you full time job after the internship , otherwise they will tell your performance might not be good so that companies are not providing full time job and In the end you can't win this discussion and you lose money and your time .Internship duration might be vary from 3 months to 6 months .

Cuvette team is very smart , they are taking upfront fees so that you can't complain on hiring process . If you complain they tell you they can't help you in hiring process and you will be out of the hiring process . They are tie up with very small company , Most of companies are startup or consulting company. There are few companies i got selected , once i did research about the founder , I got know some of founders are working in another company .They are doing side hustle project for making extra money .  Forgot about the glassdoor , Some of the company are not available in Linkedin. Many companies Team size will be 4-15 people. if your luck is good ,  they may be selected for good company.  Once you get selected in one company , they will remove you from hiring process. They don't care what is your package  , how can you get good package. Actually these companies are easy to crack even anyone can crack this company.

From the beginning to hiring stage, it will take more than 9 months.

This is the bitter truth .


Regrettably, I still find myself falling into traps despite being a person with good understanding.
If you are joining cuvette for placement , please ask verify all the details . ask the previous hiring data and previous students offer letter . Ask student details and go to the linkedin connect with them ask details about process. Talk with 10 - 15 students who are graduate from cuvette .  Dont fall after see there advertisement in there website.

Ask every data because you are putting money and time (Which is most important).
Then its your decision to consider or not .

So I got a on campus placement from a service based company similar to WITCH from my college. I got the internship and pre placement offer from that company. So my internship started in Jan 2022 till Jun 2022 where I was assigned java track and trained on Java backend technologies. After that I was converted to a full time employee now here comes the twist for project allocation, all my friends were allocated to the project one after another but I was un-allocated even after asking my managers and resource managers every week, they keep delaying my project allocation even after taking interview they keep telling that they require experience candidates. They put me in a unit where there is no projects I was unlucky AF.

There was no work at all, no one cares what you do in office just come office punch in and punch out. So my task was to come to office eat and go home, I was enjoying this phase people say it as a honeymoon period at my early stages, but later I realized that I was unable to focus as there was no work pressure, I am unable to concentrate and this period never ended and continued till 1.4 years and one day I got a call from HR to resign as I was not allocated to the project. I was completely devastated then after that I was jobless for 4 months then after immense hardwork, struggle and rejections I finally got a job in a mid scale company by faking my project experience in a different city. 

So now It's been 2 months on this company I am still in bench no work at all just come spend 6 hrs in office eat food go home. Same thing different place. After some months I will be in bench for almost 2 years. I am a type of person whose real potential comes out when there is pressure otherwise I am a very lazy person. Now I am thinking of doing MS from abroad, as I am learning from past 2 years why don't I go and study in a university as I don't know how much more time it will take for me to get the project. I have 1.6 years of total work experience with Java backend technologies without any realtime project experience. Need your advice guys.

I didn't switch early because the office job location is near to my howetown and I was applying but not getting interview calls because of recession as I had less than 2 years of experience at that time and I was waiting to get some project experience before 1 make a switch.",2024-03-19 08:39:33

Santhosh is a Principal Software Engineer at the Language Engineering team of the Wikimedia Foundation, where he works on MediaWiki language support, internationalization, localization, translation tools, etc.**

&#x200B;

[Santhosh](https://thottingal.in/) hails from a remote village in Kerala. His exposure to computers and free software ideology started while he was studying engineering. He started working with FOSS communities and got a special interest in language computing, especially for Malayalam. Just like all other engineering graduates in his time, Santhosh's first tech job was at Infosys.

In 2006, he started studying and developing language computing tools - from its foundation - Input tools, [fonts](https://smc.org.in/fonts/), complex script rendering improvements, text-to-speech systems, spell checking, collation, and so on. Many of these tools became part of the day-to-day life of people who use Malayalam on computers or the internet. Some of these libraries, and algorithms are part of operating systems, browsers, and editors these days. It was at the same time he was helping Wikipedia projects in local languages with these technologies.

For his contributions during those days to the Malayalam language, Santhosh was honored with [Maharshi Badrayan Vyas Samman](https://thottingal.in/blog/2019/08/16/presidential-award/) by the Hon. President of India in 2019.

In 2011, Santhosh joined the Wikimedia Foundation as a full-time staff. At Wikimedia, Santhosh is working with other team members to build & maintain language tools for 300+ languages, becoming the largest repository of input tools. Wikipedia also has one of the largest machine translation infrastructures to translate between 250+ languages, and that was used by people to create about two million articles in 300 languages.

1bsaoya,Jobs posted over LinkedIn is a scam or is complete bullshit,"So I have been looking for a role in wholesome BI space at a senior level and have been applying via LinkedIn Job posts and till this date I have only received a message saying ""Thank you for your interest in [company name]. Unfortunately, we will not be moving forward with your application, but we appreciate your time and interest in [company name]."" I simply don't understand even when my profile exactly matches their requirements then why the hell they reject"" üòÑüòÑ.. Moreover.. I have many posting where the job was posted an year ago and the company or the recruiter is still looking for someone to fullfill that job üòÇ

I might have applied like more than 40-50 jobs through LinkedIn.. but not even single came out as a positive response.. LOL .. not even a single sign of comm. Just the same message every time.. which is utmost bullshit!

I have tried learning DSA back in 2022 from a paid web site that had a pretty annoying timer for their content which gave me a sense of rush and a feeling that i am not enough as I am lagging behind the prescribed time for each module. Eventually the access for the course ended and i am left with a sense of low self-esteem, self-worth and a high self-doubt.

The course is pretty vast ranging from data analytics to mathematics to deep learning etc and i am getting a hold of it as well.

1bo55ox,"Masters abroad, barrier to entry for freshers with money?","Hey all

I'm from a Tier 3 private university where I had a lot of affluent kids with me. Through them, I saw the admission process of many universities abroad, primarily the US. For most students in my university, money is non issue for going for MS abroad.


Keeping the top 5 or top 10 schools aside for Engineering, it seems to be fairly easy to crack amazing colleges abroad. It seems that it's a mix of doing decent in college academics and maintaining a rapport with the professors for LoR and awareness. 


1. CGPA/GPA: Honestly, if you have your aim clear, and won't be doing anything besides academics, it's fairly easy to get a good gpa in private universities (Expensive Tier 3 at least). Merely attending all classes properly and studying 10-20 days before your exams can lead to a pretty good cgpa. 


2. GRE: let's be honest, GRE cannot be classified as a tough exam. It's pretty doable if you devote 2-3 hours daily for 2-3 months. For students who aren't interning anywhere substantial, one summer is again, enough to get a phenomenal score.



3. Research papers: They aren't VERY TOUGH to author either, if you're doing it purely for namesake. Sure, it's a trash research paper if you're doing it for namesake, but it is something to talk about on your resume. 



4. Resume: Even your resume is hardly ever double checked thoroughly during admissions to the unis.   Write whatever project, no one is going to interview you on it deeply.



5. SoP: it's essentially a glorified essay writing competition, which never even delves into your technical know-how of anything. Write whatever story with the help of education counselors and as long as it's believable, you're good to go.




Bottomline being, good unis outside seem to be doing no due diligence on the actual technical ability of people they'll be admitting to these prestigious programs. You can go into a CSE program at a decent school without ever installing VS Code in your undergrad if you're simply aware about what to project in your profile. That seems insane. 


So my question is, outside of money, how high it the barrier to entry to a good/decent MS program abroad? 

And if the barrier to entry is low, then why are these universities using an entry process like that?",2024-03-26 11:05:44

Although its a hackathon, consider it as a startup competition, there's $50k grand prize and 6 tracks with top 5 winners having their prizes in tens of thousands of dollars as well.   


I know some of you may have no idea about blockchain right now, its fine, I would recommend trying to give it a shot and participating, it will teach you a lot. I also see many of you who are very experienced yet having hard time with jobs, startups, internship etc. This is a good opportunity for you to test your skills. Prizes are big, and you'd also get free mentorship and potentially $250k seed funding if you end up winning any position.

1b9kyy1,What to do about unfair review and PIP? Is it better to resign?,"Hi, this will be a lengthy read. 
I am a Software Engineer with 1 year and 11 months of full time experience.
I started my career as an intern in my current company and converted full time. So far I have only worked from home, never been to office due to covid and later due to medical conditions. 

I was in the AI/ML department however last year in October the company decided to dissolve the AI/ML team and moved junior devs (like me) to other departments. 
So the manager of my new department did not ask about my tech stack, did not provide any KTs and asked me to work right away, it took me some time to learn things and I took help from Senior devs to understand the project. 

In the Review cycle my manager gave me the lowest performance band based on two months for the entire year. I discussed the same with her and her manager who assured me that in 6 months they‚Äôll do another review for me. I mentioned that this unfair review has affected my morale as I had worked very hard and delivered many projects as a part of the AI/ML team for most duration of the year. 

Edit: New manager said she could not find the data provided by my previous manager who was let go the company, hence she provided the review based on her observations. 


Now 3 months later, my manager has put me on pip stating that I deliver all my tasks on time but she doesn‚Äôt see enthusiasm in me. 

I want to resign before this 1 month pip ends and for the reason of my resignation I want to narrate this entire scenario but I‚Äôm worried whether this will be found out by my next employer. 

Also if the company lets me go after pip, will it affect my records, i.e. in getting new jobs? 
Is it advised to resign before pip deadline or wait? 

I‚Äôm also worried about getting new offers due to the job market and not having much experience.

Discord migrated to Scylla DB and started using Rust. They had very few engineers and nobody was an expert.

I guess I just want to ask, how to be a generalist? or do they even exist?",2024-03-20 07:04:18
1bh5qvm,What should be my roadmap for the next five years of my career?,"Hey guys,

I (23M) recently joined a startup as an SDE. Given the current recession in the tech world and the fact that I come from a tier 3 college, I am one of of the lucky ones to actually get placed and get a decent paying job. 

The work in the startup though isn't as tecnically challenging as I would have liked, so I am trying to self learn a lot of new technologies as possible. 

I just wanted to know what should my plan for the next 2 years be ? Like what should I focus on so that firstly I am not replaced by the tremendously advancing AI and secondly my skills provide me with a significant leverage against the big companies. 

If its relevant, my current expertise, well not expertise but mild knowledge lies in mainly django and spring boot. And I know a bit of devops as well.

1bgk3fj,5 Years in Coding: AI's Making Me Question Everything,"Hey everyone,

When I started coding 5 years ago, it was all about cracking codes, fixing bugs,  and sometimes, just making things work somehow. 

I am talking about a majority of IT developers here . A lot of us aren't building fancy tech for ISRO or making breakthroughs in AI. We're usually sorting out errors, figuring out why that one line of code isn't working, or, let's be honest, finding that perfect piece of code on Stack Overflow  that just fits. At many times, we also draw on existing services‚Äô code for guidance. 

However, AI is now integrating into our everyday coding activities, creating quite a dynamic shift:

- AI Surpassing Average Coding Skills:

Tools like GitHub Copilot are like that friend who always has an answer, making you wonder, ""Why didn't I think of that?"" And many AI tools can give you 10 alternatives way of writing that piece of code.


- What's My Place? : 

Being the go-to person for bug fixes in the team was something. Now,AI tools spot issues faster than we can sip our chai. While not yet fully realized, integrating AI into our IDEs could soon make these tools even more precise than human troubleshooters.


- Keeping Up is Tough: 

It feels like just yesterday we were all trying to get our heads around Angular, and now there's AI writing entire sections of code.


- Reevaluating the Grind : 

i don‚Äôt find grinding the leetcode problems just to crack the interview and eventually while working on a project use AI tools mostly for your job is of any use.


**Note**: I know AI isn't perfect yet. It can't replace the unique solutions we come up with or the creative touches we add. But the speed at which it's growing makes you pause and think.

In this ever-changing world of tech, I'm reaching out to see how you're all keeping up. How do we balance what we know with what AI can do? Any thoughts or tips would be great to hear.

Looking forward to hearing from you all.",2024-03-17 00:10:36

Its actually looks very good i remember for my data science project we had to spend so much time and now chatgpt doing fairly advanced tasks like nothing its kinda scary.
It might not work for very complex but it could easily surpass humans in few years and it wouldn't make sense to hire data analysts as much as now.

https://youtu.be/SzTjGAO6fKo?si=DKgD-Ro_Tcyvts-f

There are actually more detailed tutorials out there. 
It might sound expensive for us indians but in US  $20-25 is nothing.

Note: I believe that AI is not good enough to replace engineers yet and maybe it would never but this is actually really impressive even now and i believe that it could allow a company to reduce the no of data analysts jobs significantly.

Now once we have devil worship out of the way,

I would like to have an opinion on the management style i have been following and would like to invite your opinions and suggestions and constructive criticisms



1. I ask my teams to provide me the date for delivery (realistic), and do not bother them till the date of delivery. If during this period if they need anything or get stuck i expect them to reach out to me if and when required. Raise alarms beforehand not on the day of delivery. Give me time to course correct things for you and do not come to me at the last moment (off course there are acceptable exceptions)
2. I do not bother how you are running your show. I just tell the expectations and guidelines and then do not bother. But then when i do the review i sit with the intent of ripping u apart. But while i rip apart everything u have done i also provide with the solution to each and everything and how to achieve it
3. I do not ask the reason why u want a leave but expect u to manage your work without bothering me unless u r not able to. Then u can reach out to me and i will tell u what to do.
4. I give growth plan and goals to everyone and tell them right on the face once its out of my hands
5. I have been accused of rejecting high performance candidates just because i had a gut feeling they are gonna promote office politics
6. I focus on how good you are at your current job and do not ask mindless syntax but focus more on algorithms and real world situations
7. Most controvertial part is when i go nuclear which sometimes you have to i chose to scream at the person in private rather then documenting it else it would impact their growth path.
8. I have been accused of sitting over a box where i limit transactions with my own leadership with the team so that i can present a garden while their is a fucking graveyard. (Dont tell me its bad we all have done that in acceptable limits)
9. Also I demand a lot of loyalty from my folks. I mean i share them high paying jobs elsewhere at times if they are deserving and i am unable to do shit about their current compensation.

1brh5f3,Is QA Engineering a good track to stay on at the beginning of your career or should I focus on switching to SDE? ,"Got a job (currently an internship, will be converted to full time some months later) as a QA Engineer in a product based MNC. It's been a good experience so far but I want to make sure I'm taking the right steps towards the future. 

So with that in mind, do you think QA is a good place to be for the next 5 years or should I try and switch to a SDE role within a year or two? 

The advantages I see for a SDE is that they have better pay - 40-45% more than my current pay for someone who's at the same level as me. Exposure to more tech and they'll be more technologically capable in a year or so given the experience. Probably easier to find a new job and less risk of their job being made redundant? 

The advantages I see for QAE are that it seems like a simpler job to do (don't mean to say that people who do it are less skillful or that it doesn't get complex, but from the outside at least SDE stuff seems more complex), the work life balance may be better? Seems like a job with low pressure too. And I suppose the competition is less. 

I wanted to try and learn the stuff needed for both tracks but that's not really possible atm as QA Engineering itself can be quite a deep topic and I've fully immersed myself in it given that's my main job. 

So what advice would you give me? 

About myself - I'm good at problem solving and I think decent at Dev work (though I haven't done many projects) , but I don't really know much DSA apart from the basics.

1bnwzoe,Am I in trouble? Old employer is not providing experience certificate. Big4 company released offer and asking to submit all past experience certificates. Tricky situation.,"I recently got an offer from a big4 company and they are asking me to send all my previous employment documents. Problem is, I don‚Äôt have my 1st employer's experience/relieving letter/service letter.

A little history about that old company:
I used to work in the Mechanical engineering sector before I switched into IT sector just before covid hit. This is a power engineering company based in Hyderabad. They are a service provider company that provide Power Plant operations & maintenance, overhauling, repairs, manpower and other services to major power plants and industries across the country. I was deputed at one of their client locations outside the city. After a while I couldn't continue with the grind, decided to quit that job and to pursue software job.

I discussed my career plans with my then manager. He suggested me to put down a long unpaid leave of absence letter instead of resigning, saying that I may return to work within that period if my career plans didn't work out. I trained my replacement the next one month as ordered by my manager. On the last day I submitted a typed and printed letter to my manager asking for 2 months unpaid leave, and left on good terms(however I didn't keep a soft copy of this letter, this was in 2019).

When I was on the second month of my long leave, I received an email, a termination order that read: ""Due to management decisions, unit-1 stopped operations leading to cut down of manpower and hence your services are no longer required. However we are keen to have you back and we will let you know if we find any role suitable for you at our other client sites"". They lost the contract deal with the client I was working at and they packed everything up. During this time I was too deep into pursuing my software learning and IT career and didn't care much about it. I wasn't going to go back anyway. Few months later I go Jr. Developer job as a fresher through a referral. And all the following years I have worked with small companies who didn't care about all my past employers.

Fast-forward to now, when the big4 company asked to submit all previous employments relieving/service letters, I realised that old company never gave me a experience/service letter. All that I have from them is the offer letter, termination order and the Id card.

On the resume, while I was applying and interviewing, I excluded that company and only included my IT experiences to keep my profile relevant to the role I was applying for.
But that company is visible on my EPFO service history since they deducted my PF. I learned that all big MNCs check PF service history while performing background checks.  I could simply not tell the new company anything about that old experience but they're going to find out on their own anyway. It could raise a red flag questioning why I didn't show that experience when submitting the BGV details form. ""Has this guy absconded? Did he commit a fraud?""

So I reached out to that old employer last Friday. I wrote an email to which they didn't respond. I then called them a day later and explained everything. They made me talk to their HR&AR head. That guy was less than helpful and there came a new twist in the story. He says ""after that contract ended, all the records are lost and all the employees data has been deleted, we cannot do anything for you now"". The BGV would definitely fail with the way he was talking to me. When the BGV team is going to call them he would simply say ""we don't have any data about that person"".

This is a nightmare. All he has to do now is take reference of my offer and termination letters and print me a new experience letter. He is a very stubborn middle-aged man. I explained how important this is to my career and life and he still repeats the same words like how a customer care executive would. To make this more difficult, all the old staff are gone now including my then manager.

Their desk guy suggested me to come to their office and  meet that HR &AR head in person and try to work it out with him that way. I called that HR&AR head guy again today and he says that he won't be available to meet in person for another week and asked me to come next Monday. But the big4 company is going to send me background verification form tomorrow to submit complete details about my past work experiences.

I don't know what to do now. Should I explain all this to the new big4 HR exactly what happened or should I completely not mention that experience in which case they may find out and flag my profile red and withdraw my offer? Please put down your suggestions and workarounds, those who have experience with stuff like this. Help me out of this situation. Thanks a lot.",2024-03-26 02:41:36

I'm reaching out because I'm embarking on an exciting journey to launch a GTA5 FiveM server, and I'm in need of a knowledgeable developer to guide me through the process.

Need some clarification on this.
With the concept when the demand is high and the supply is low, the salaries will be high. But in india, the demand is low and the supply of engineers is too high so that we have always been getting lower salaries(idk how to mention it) than the average salary of a IT employee in SG or US. My question here is
1. if Indian engineers can provide quality work at lower salaries why are we still here ranting about the job hunts and feeling depressed?
2. Why Companies abroad don't consider Indian engineers for a lower salary package who can do the same work as the guy who is getting around 10k USD per month for the same work in US
3. Why aren't the Indian based companies or foreign companies in india don't offer the same as they offer in other countries.
PS : I'm talking about the countries where salaries are higher and I'm talking about skilled people (not the ones with having a degree and not putting in any effort but still continues to rant)

1b8r885,I am just too much tired of rejection and competitive market software engineers.,"This might go a little long.
I resigned from my previous company back in mid November due to hell toxicity at the workplace. Had been interviewing with few companies as of now but no success. The real issue goes below:

So recently I had a chance to interview with 3 companies Google, Okta and Postman. For Okta and Postman, behavioural/culture fit rounds were scheduled first and i had prepared for them from the internet and am quite fluent with my English too. Both were for SDE-1 roles and their roles were exactly aligned to my current experience (1.5 yeo) and expertise and also I come from one of the mother IITs (IITK) with decent coding and problem solving skills. And today I saw both of them rejected my application and that too in culture fit round. I remember one of my friends was interviewed by Zomato for an internship back in 2020 and he was asked that what does he know about Zomato, to which he replied ""zomato is a software company"". He was my batchmate in college, still he got the internship. And then I see myself now failing in culture fit rounds.:((

In Google, it was preliminary round and it was medium level priority queue question. I was a bit confused about syntax for max pq and min pq and mistakenly wrote min pq in my code, but I did communicate with him that I am using max pq. And he too didn't point this out during coding. I solved the question and he seemed satisfied too with my approach.Idk what came to his mind,  and after 4 days, I received a rejection from them too. 

I am still interviewing few more companies, but I feel like giving up now. I am literally crying while writing this man. Why so many rejections just because of some silly mistakes?? Don't accept the application rather if you already have many candidates lined up. This has been ruining my mental health since long, and now I feel like going for some government job rather than this.

I've noticed a puzzling trend in the current economic landscape ‚Äì stock markets are reaching all-time highs, cryptocurrencies are soaring, real estate and gold prices are on the rise, and companies are reporting increased profits year over year. However, amid these seemingly positive indicators, I keep hearing reports from employees who claim they are getting fired due to a recession.

Adding to the confusion, India's GDP is also on the upswing. If companies are indeed overhiring during the pandemic, wouldn't a straightforward solution be to halt further hiring instead of forcefully letting go of existing employees?

I'd appreciate any insights or explanations to help me make sense of these seemingly contradictory signals. Is there something I'm missing, or is there a broader economic phenomenon at play? Let's discuss and try to unravel this complexity together.

1bkcj7z,Messed up my big promotion project and life seems messed up,"I work as an SDE-1 at a big tech firm and I'd been working single-handedly on a huge project since the end of December. This project was huge for our team and my manager touted is as my ticket to a promotion. Due to pressure from the higher-ups they wanted it released in early January.

I've worked on a lot of big projects in the last couple of years, but never completely alone. I got my tiny team to review my very detailed tech spec but since the work started around Christmas and NYE time, no one reviewed it very well. Due to a time crunch, I decided to start development. My entire project was split across ~10 PRs, and I kept opening the PRs for review as and when I was done. I scheduled calls and added detailed descriptions to help reviewers but due to the holiday season and people being on leave, my PRs were not being reviewed. I raised this to my manager, but short of reviewing the code himself there was nothing he could do. I was done coding by the time the deadline came but my PRs weren't reviewed. The first mid January deadline rolled by. And then January ended. My PRs still weren't reviewed because our tech lead was super busy with other P0 items and the team and I weren't okay with releasing such a huge project without the lead's approval. I'd been working in the same team for a very long time and was supposed to switch teams after this release, so by end of January I was getting really desperate to release this project. 

Mid February rolled by and I was onboarded to the new team with no sign of my PRs being reviewed and released. After a lot of back and forth within the team, we decided to release the project with only 2 other members reviewing all my PRs and the team lead only reviewed the initial few PRs. The feature released at the end of February and I started working for my new team. Along with my new work, I offered support for issues with the project release since I'd coded it single-handedly and had the most context. Juggling two teams was difficult but I really wanted that sweet promotion, so I did it quietly. My new manager didn't care about me splitting my time, but he didn't want his projects being affected. I slogged my ass off, but made things work. I thought all was well.

But of late, things have gotten really bad. A lot of issues are cropping up. I feel extremely stupid for not having caught them during my testing. I get on calls with my old team to discuss and fix issues but I can almost smell the silent resentment they have at my shitty code. I'm being asked questions about why I made certain design choices but they were clearly mentioned in my tech spec. If people had issues, they should've raised them back then. I'm working late into the night, struggling to support the old team and barely managing to get work done in my new team. I know I fucked up with my code. I feel like a loser. But I also know that if the rest of the team had bothered to pay more attention in the reviews or asked the questions they're asking now, I would've made different design choices. I did what I thought was best at the time. I should've known better, but fuck me, I didn't. 

There's been a lot of data issues and user escalations in the last few weeks. I just know that I'm going to be crucified for this fuck up. My promotion chances are next to nil. I'll be lucky if I don't get fired. I do not think it's fair, because if I wasn't moved to a new team right around release time I would've monitored my release more closely and some of these issues would've been caught way earlier before they snowballed. 

Eh. Fuck it. I just hope this doesn't destroy my career already. I'm just so fucking tired. My mental health is in the dumps because of this. I just want this to be over.",2024-03-21 17:44:42
1bi3jep,From three 18Lpa offers to No offers and No Hope. ,"Hi everyone. This post is going to be pretty depressing but I don't have anyone else to talk 
I'm a senior Android developer with 6years of experience

It all started with college. I come from a very poor family. I braved my way to school by walking everyday 10kms back because my parents refused to give me any Rickshaw money.

After finishing highschool. I saved some money by working in a paper factory nearby.  I begged my parents to put me in a college with hostel and they took loans and did everything to put me in a college in a small city. I struggled my way through college without any books, money or new clothes for 3 years. I only had 2 pairs of clothes which means I could not go to college 3 consecutive days.

I braved through and won some programming competitions in my college in other nearby colleges in the city. Everyone respected me for being a great programmer.

I somehow made it to the final semester with 4 backlogs and came back home with a campus placement offer letter.

I knew that if I joined this company and started working I'll never be able to get a degree. 

After 1month of nagging that I'm a free loader and them refusing to give me food I revealed that I have a job offer. They celebrated and I died inside. I kept working 8-12 hrs everyday for this organisation everyday and 4hours commute which involved mostly sitting at the railway station because most trains don't stop at my Village.

I switched jobs to a slightly bigger company worked for 4.5 years with almost no appraisal.
This year I got no appraisal and they laid me off at 6years of experience at 6lpa.

I persevered. I cleared interview at Practo. Got stuck in management round but I got some confidence.

Slowly I got an offer for 15 lpa. 
Then another offer in the same week with 18 LPA by a payroll company for the EV startup matter.in but they didn't release the offer letter 

Using this offer  I got a 19lpa offer from  HCL technologies for SAP labs. 

Everything was going well and I sat for the HR interview round and the HCL hr asked for my educational qualifications casually. It appears they missed my college dropout part of my resume. Still asked for documents and BG verification undertaking form but the client rejected my profile after they realised I don't have any undergraduate degree.

After this anticipated rejection. I called back the company that that had given me the 18lpa offer and they blocked me on WhatsApp and don't receive my calls . Maybe they also realised I have no degree.

I interviewed at Giant Eagle today and I think it went pretty well but I know I'll be rejected in the HR round again.


I'm so frustrated right now and yes I know I can do an online degree. I have even applied for an education loan with Amrita University but that'll still take another 3years and I literally can't afford food right now. I have to pay the Emis for my sister's phone and the degree. I feel like my career is over now.

1ba3mnl,Got an offer but the reviews of company are not good! ,"So I got approached by the company and I aced their interviews. Its in USA and they are okay with my doing my normal 9 AM-5 PM shift provided I give them the day updates before leaving. 

Coming to pay its triple the amount what I am getting. 

The only reason I skeptical about joining is I have read reviews and they say that they are always on deadline and need developers who are just working like a mad dog and basically hiring from india because they have low funding and need cheap labour.

In my current company I am appreciated, given proper leaves ( without any questions ) like I have proper work life balance and the pay is decent enough. As for work its normal nothing fancy but now getting quite boring I think I am now in comfort zone.

So I just wanted know like what should I do should I join this company for money ? Both are remote by the way. 

Thanks for helping!

1b82k3r,My experience of getting three offers in a recession (or how to deal with this market - a guide),"I have meant to write this for a long time, so here it goes. Sorry, it is going to be a bit long, but I have mentioned in detail every strategy and tactic that I used, so please bear with me. I am tired of doom scrolling in these subs of reddit, with people having 100s if not 1000s of applies, and no offers, or even interviews. So I am writing this to give a different perspective. Hopefully it is helpful to a few of you, a few things may look a bit off, take it or reject it, that's upto you.   


First, to set some context, I am a pretty experienced dude with over 11 years of experience in SAAS-based companies. I won't name the companies for obvious reasons, but they are not household names and not in any of the tier 1 IT hubs or cities of India, I can assure you that. Take an unfunded bootstrapped company in a west indian tier two city with less than 300 employees that makes decent money and pays okayish.   


Of these 10 years, 3 have been in Data Science as a data scientist. I have been with the same company for over 7 years, and my experience has been pretty satisfactory. Yes, the salary is not up to the market, one can say, but I was not optimizing for salary.   


During these years, I have dabbled with a lot of tech because I was wearing multiple hats in a small organisation - starting with languages like Python, JS, TS, frameworks like React, Vue, Django, Flask, to microservices using Docker, Kafka, hive, spark and more. You can say I am more of a generalist and pick up technologies based on the purpose than a specialist. Last few months I have also upskilled in LLMs, Gen AI and other hyped tech. Which, as you will see later, has been an advantage.   


Regarding my tenure, surprisingly, no one has even asked why I stayed in the same company for a long time. Of the 50+ calls I have gotten from recruiters, no one has mentioned it once. I am writing this because often you hear people saying that staying in the same company for long is bad - and I thought that was true. However, experience showed me it is not. Maybe many people just eliminated me and didn't bother to call after seeing a long tenure in my resume - which can be true. However, that hasn't hampered me, as you see, to secure a job. My point - just do not take people's opinions on their face value.   


Now that we have set the stage let's proceed further. The first step here - the preparation. If you are not in a very toxic situation that is hampering your mental health, I would say stay some time off from the market and job sites and prepare. This was perhaps the single most important decision that has altered my course greatly. Why? Because you can't prepare well in anxiety. Many people will say otherwise - i.e., start applying for jobs right away and prepare at the same time. What I have observed is that when applying for jobs, you will face rejections, and also no replies and progress. This is going to hamper your learning and retention of knowledge greatly.   


I figuratively lived under a rock for over three months while preparing. I didn't browse LinkedIn or other job sites and avoided doom-scrolling on Reddit as much as possible. The only social media I did was memes and self-help and comedy videos on YouTube. Maybe I missed a lot of good opportunities in these three months‚Äîwho knows? But I did this to preserve my sanity.   


For preparation, try going broad overall but in-depth in a few areas. For me, I went broad with machine learning concepts and deep in deep learning and NLP. Of course, this matters only when you are experienced, if you are fresher, go broad with everything.   


Give the preparation phase at least 6 months. I did 3 because I started getting calls after 3 months, from January, when there was a deluge of new job openings with NLP expertise in the market. However, in hindsight, if I had started 3 months earlier, I could have cracked a few more companies and maybe have gotten better offers.   


DS & A - for data science, it matters, but only up to a point. No sane company is asking a data scientist to traverse a graph. 3 interviews asked me 2sum, and a few other companies asked questions related to sorting. I got an offer and closed it early, so if I had increased my sample size, I would have encountered companies that asked harder questions. I will say the truth - I didn't prepare at all for data structures and algorithms. My leetcode problem solved will be in low 1 dight, less than 5. From what I have seen, many companies are happy to hire you if you can use loops, conditionals, and arrays/dicts well. So, if you want the biggest bang for your buck, practice array, string, and sorting questions well. You can go for more data structures and practice until mid-tier questions, but that honestly feels like an overkill, and there are better uses of time than leetcode.   


Note: I was optimizing to get 'a job'- a decent job that was better than what I was working at that time. I was not targeting FAANG-level companies or high-growth startups. Why? FAANG has fired a lot of people, and I don't see them changing their trajectory this year. They have opened hiring, even in data science roles, but the competition there is fierce. You can spend months to a year to get those roles, and still, there is no guarantee of success. The same is the case with high-growth startups, which run with huge losses on VC money. So my strategy and tactics are molded accordingly. If you want to be a part of FAANG-like companies, sorry, I can't help you. There are hundreds of people who are giving advice for that, please follow them.   


However, with the strategies I used, you can crack interviews and hopefully get a job in good enough and decent companies. Seeing the condition here where people are struggling to get any job, I think this will be more suited to them.   


Now comes the next part - the resume. The best advice I can give here - keep it dead simple, but also a bit aesthetic. Why? Because your resume will also be read by a human, and if they see the boring old Jake's template and likes, many of them will get turned off. So the sweet spot is to make the resume look good, and then use tactics so that it can be also optimised for ATS.   


I used this template: [https://ayushsah.gumroad.com/l/restemp](https://ayushsah.gumroad.com/l/restemp). It is mostly text based, but has a nice blue section dividers, which looks good to the eyes.   


The most important tactic in resume building - use bullet points and small sentences. Don't write paragraphs. In the summary section, the first point should be your years of experience and the domain. Don't make recruiters estimate that from the timeline of your experience. The second point, mention some areas/skills that you are specialized in. The rest of the summary, you can can mention some other bullet points, like your college (if you are in tier 1/2), or previous companies, if they are well known. However, don't make summary bullet points more than 5.   


The resume template that I used also has a section for mentioning the top 8-10 skills. Use that.   


Our purpose of the summary section is to show the recruiter at one glance what our experience is, what our chief skills are, and, if possible, a brief description of our education. These are the three most important things needed in any job. If you can convey this in less than 10 seconds of reading, you are already ahead of 90% of your peers.   


Next, when it comes to experience, you will have to do some research here. Find 30-50 job posts on LinkedIn that you want to target, and copy and paste this prompt in chatGPT.   


""I am applying for data scientist jobs and need help optimizing my LinkedIn profile and resume. You will get a job description, and you will return the most important keywords and skills mentioned in the job post as a python list.   


This is the first job description. From the next message, only the job description will be provided. Return only the python list as the output.   


Take keywords only related to data science.""  


Modify the prompt for your role. After this prompt, paste the job description in triple quotes. This will return you a Python list. Create a python program to count the keywords and put the counts as values in a dict. Do this for around 30-50 jobs, and you will get a nice list of keywords and skills that you need in your resume. You can then sort the list by mentions, and find top 50 keywords that you want to use.   


The purpose of this exercise is to not fill your resume with the keywords found in job descriptions. We want to write your experience section in such a way that the keywords relevant to you are mentioned there. \*Do not write skills that you don't know\*. We are not doing keyword hacking here, where you mention all the skills of data science in your resume. Find keywords relevant to you or skills that you have experience in, and only use those.   


Like summary, mention experience as bullet points. Each bullet point, try to make it a single sentence, and max 4-5 bullet points per company or position. Eliminate positions or experience that's not relevant to the jobs that you are targeting - e.g. I don't mention my full stack developer experience. You can mention previous experience as a single sentence, and when you get the call from recruiters, you can also mention that. Resume space is more expensive, so preserve that.   


Summary, Experience and Education are the most important sections that should be present in resume. You can also add one more section for skills. This is more for ATS to find the skills and rank your resume higher. If you are in data science field, you can also add publications and projects. I did that, and my total resume length was 3 pages. I don't know if I would have got more callbacks if I reduced it to two. All I can say is that I got decent callbacks even with a 3 page resume.   


Now the profiles - create one in Naukri for sure and add all the text you have in resume to sections there. Upload your resume there too. Do the same for LinkedIn, update the profile there with the resume content. Add the summary section, and a bit more about what kind of roles you love in the LinkedIn about section. The most important part of LinkedIn and Naukri, make sure you add your skills there. Utilise them to the maximum limit.   


LinkedIn has a open to work feature which makes your profile more visible to recruiters. What I have observed is that, with a complete profile and open to work, I get atleast 2 in mails from recruiters everyday.   


You can purchase a paid plan of Naukri if you want, this gives you more visibility at around ‚Çπ1000 a month. However, your profile should be good and have content that's relevant. Paid plan will give you some visibility, but no recruiter is going to call you if your profile is bad. People have got calls from Naukri even without paid plans, so this step is absolutely not necessary.   


I also uploaded my resume to instahyre, and have got a couple of calls from them. You can also try platforms which directly connect employees with recruiters. They have a better conversation rate, and I have got an offer from one of the companies that contacted me through them.   


Some of these platforms have a profile headline. Mention your current role, your company if it's famous, your years of experience, and some skills you have. This will especially work, if those skills are trending. For me, it was LLMs and Gen AIs.   


I know these are very basic and common sense things. But I am saying all this because I have seen terrible resumes and profiles in the wild. People don't put even half decent effort to their resumes and profiles, and then wonder why are they not getting calls.   


Why are we doing all this? Because we want recruiters to approach you, rather than you approaching recruiters. Why? Because there is a higher conversion in inbound, rather than outbound. A recruiter can send max 20-30 inmails for a position a day, out of which may be 5-10 will be replied. Of those 5, 2-3 will have relevant experience to move forward with interviews. The people who are applying in job roles are in 100s, if not 1000s. You have already eliminated 95%+ of your competition.   


That's why I focused more on inbound, and also have got offers in inbound. I also did outbound - applying to jobs, and there was some success in that.   


In total, I applied in around 100 jobs, or even less. Majority of them were in LinkedIn Easy Apply. Some 20-30 I applied on company websites.   


Max 30 odd applications of me got viewed, and resume were downloaded in 8 of them. I got calls from total 3 or 4 from outbound applications in LinkedIn. From applying in company websites, I got around 5 calls. I have already been rejected without even a call back in 4 companies. Rest of the applications I haven't even heard back.   


Many people advice to customise your resume for each role and apply. I didn't have any time for that, so I mass applied with the same resume to all companies. I was going for volume instead of quality.  


Naukri however, was a different ball game altogether. I get atleast 3 calls from them everyday, and on Mondays, I easily get 10+ calls. Same with LinkedIn In mails, I get atleast 2-3 inmails daily.   


This is not me bragging. This is just to show how powerful inbound strategy of getting hired is. If you are not getting any calls even after applying tons of places, maybe you should change your resume and profiles and make them better.   


Hopefully, after doing these you will atleast get a few calls. The rule to remember here - HRs usually are not too technical people. At best, they are glorified keyword matchers (no offence please). Which means, when they call, don't blabber too much technical stuff to them. Mention your years of experience, your key skills, and answer questions if they ask. HRs job is to find if you are fit, and schedule interviews. If they mention skills that you don't have, instead of saying a direct no, be tactful in approach. Like, some HR asked me if I have experience in administrating Kubernates cluster. Which is odd for a data scientist to do, because we have a whole devops department for that. I said we don't use Kubernates because we deploy on cloud. Buzzword eliminated with another buzzword. A win!  


Why am I saying this? Most job description has no relationship with the actual job. The role I am joining required PhD in Computer Science. Most job requirements that you see are a wishlist, which is put together by HR by copy pasting similar roles from other companies, or worse, by using ChatGPT. Developers are too busy to write job descriptions. Which is again why you should apply in volume, rather than customising your resume for each role, unless you are applying in top tier companies which have a half decent HR process.   


This is why you should also not self eliminate yourself if the job description mentions a skill that you don't have. Submit your resume anyway. It's the HR's job to eliminate you, if they feel you are not a good fit, they will reject you anyway. There is really no downside of applying in a role which you are only 40% fit.   


The purpose of all this is to get your foot inside the door of the interview process, and atleast take you in front of the hiring manager. It's they who will hire you.   


The first interview round is usually just done to see if you can code. That's where your DS Algo knowledge will come in. In Data Scientist position, mostly this will be the only round where you will do some pure programming. Some companies ask SQL questions too. Some others test your knowledge in libraries such as pandas.   


In many companies, the second or subsequent rounds will be the hiring manager round. This is actually the only round that will be related to your job. Only here you will learn which skills are actually needed for your job. If you are not familiar with those skills, don't lie, and be honest. Most hiring managers I have interacted with are even open to hiring people who don't have the required skills, provided they show an aptitude of learning.   


So that's it. If you can apply the above, and get your face atleast in front of hiring manager, you will have a much better chance of joining a new job. The competition is way less fierce there.   


So that's what you should do. Optimise your job hunt to atleast come in front of the hiring manager. The rest of the rounds depends on your knowledge and preparation. You can find advice related to there elsewhere.   


I will now come to things that I didn't do. Hopefully you will find things to avoid here.    


1. I didn't took any paid course for job hunting or to optimise my profile. If you do what I have mentioned above, your profile will be in top 30% of the job market.   
2. Similarly, Naukri guys called me to purchase their paid services of resume writing. It was a ‚Çπ8000 plan for 6 months. I didn't avail that. Don't hire a resume writer. Most resume writer have scant knowledge about your domain and industry, and they won't be able to optimise the resume the way you do.   
3. I didn't join an edtech to upskill and get a placement guarantee. To my understanding, they are of no use if you are experienced. Even YouTube has better content for free than what edtech's can offer.   
4. I didn't message hiring managers in LinkedIn, to give an introduction of why I am fit for the job, you know what people call the hustle. Hiring managers can't schedule interviews, or don't have time for that, it's the HRs job, and they won't recommend you to HR unless you have a personal relationship with them. You can email or message HRs directly, that has more ROI.   
5. I did take one referral to apply. However, most companies have a pretty high turnaround time, and I already had the offer in hand to accept fast. Till yet, I haven't heard back.   
6. I did some projects and added them to CV. They had zero impact. I didn't do any open source contributions.   
7.  I didn't take any OAs. They feel like a drain on my time. I have atleast 5 OAs that are in my inbox right now. I may just take them just to see what questions they ask, but if a company's first round is an OA, that's just a turn off for me. I would rather choose companies which just take interviews right away.   
8.  Likewise, many recruiters just dropped an inmail asking me to email them my CV with a template (current CTC, expected CTC, location etc, you know the drill). I haven't emailed anyone my CV because I was too lazy to do that.   
9. You often get the vibe how the place will be right from how the recruiter talks. E.g., one recruiter bluntly asked me, you are from x state, people from x state don't usually stay in Delhi NCR, what's the guarantee that you will move and stay here. Another recruiter upon hearing my already high offer in hand, said okay let's conduct interviews and then we will discuss the CTC. Which each interviews, she kinda mocked my performance, saying that it was 'borderline'. I felt these are all tactics to not offer a better CTC. And I won't touch these companies with a 10 feet pole.   


Finally, let's discuss the numbers. I got a 15% hike in my last company this January. The offer I accepted has a hike of 50% over that. Overall, I am getting 75% more than what I made last year. Not crazy like covid times, but still pretty decent. I come from a 4th + tier town, and this is a lot of money for me.  


The two other offers I had, one was fully remote series 2 PBC. I didn't join that because they had reviews of toxic culture and bad WLB. The third one was one of the big 4s. The one I am joining is a PBC based in Bangalore working on Gen AI.   


Was it worth it? I will say so. I am on notice right now and life right now is pretty chill. I am excited to go on a new place and take a new adventure after a long time. I am still giving interviews in some companies, just in case the current company rescinds the offer for some reason. And rest of the time, I am just playing Minecraft.   


10/10 will recommend. And will do it again. Maybe after a couple of years.

1b7xzwh,What would classify as spoon-feeding an intern in your company?,"I am working as an intern in the backend team. My lead is very hesitant to help till the very end (Which is good in a way so that I figure out things myself). He is always so irritated to help. I got no kind of KT whatsoever. The only thing he was patient enough to help me with was setting up the repo locally on my system. There is no documentation whatsoever. No DB Schema, no API design doc. There is no README for the repo as well. 

My real question is: Is it a giveaway to share the Postman collection for all the APIs? It makes my life relatively easier while working on tasks. Is this too much to ask for? The first time I had asked him he said he didn't have it saved. He is lying here since he had himself sent me for a few APIs initially when he wanted the task done quickly.

I gave one interview and I messed up. Firstly I apply OOPS in my code all the time but when they asked a simple OOPS concept question, I failed to answer it. 

Secondly they asked a question related to palindrome and I haven‚Äôt solved such problems so I took more time to solve it in front of them. I was writing pseudo code and if found any issue, would go back and change something and write again. Took more time to finish it.

But the thing is, neither are important for my actual job. I very rarely have to think about constructors and overloading in spring boot application and very rarely have to worry about string functions. Everything is found online, all I have to do is know how to code, write crud operations, manage db, upgrade spring, work with generating documents, files, etc.

So I am very stuck!

Have been working as a Mainframe performance engineer in a WITCH company. Don't see any future in it.

Have been contemplating switching into a new domain. But the cliched question "" Will any technology remain secure with Al coming in?"". If YES , which domain will remain open for hiring for atleast for the next 5-6 years.

Open to any NON-TECH suggestions too which might peak in the near future. Is Certified Financial Planner (CFP) helpful?

I mentioned in a for earlier that my expected CTC is around 15-25 LPA and my current is around 9.32 LPA.  Should I go with the same expectation? Or should I lower it considering the current job market and other candidates who might be having a lower expectation than mine ? I just don‚Äôt want to lose out on a good opportunity.

I am a recent CS engineering graduate from a tier 3 college. I am currently working in a Service based company in Bangalore earning 8LPA. This is my first job and its been 5 months now.

Story:
I worked hard in my college times on developing skills that will be needed for me to get a good PBC. I am a good problem solver have 700+ LC solved and come up with algorithms. Also good in development, Can adapt to any tech stack in a short time. In 2023 ,Got an opportunity to interview at Amazon Dublin but due to recession scheduled interview was cancelled and rejected.

So I joined the service based company and started my career. But still I am really depressed as I wasn't able to join the PBC which I dreamed of. 
Currently I am doing the grind again, Solving leetcode every day(for interviews) while also preparing for system design (Because it's interesting). Managing time between job and learning is also very difficult.

I want to ask is it possible if I keep doing this will there be a chance to land a PBC after 1 YoE ?. Because everywhere I got rejected is only due to my experience <1YoE. Also some of my friends say it's not possible because you are from tier 3.
I request to guide me by giving your insightful advice and highlight any mistakes I am doing.",2024-03-25 06:42:25

So I passed it and I‚Äôm eligible for the 6 months training. But the catch is, it won‚Äôt be considered as internship neither they will be providing certificates for it nor any stipend.  But we have to dedicate around 20 hours a week, assessments every Sunday, and at the end the final assessment. We need to pass this assessment in order to get the final offer letter.

And for anyone who has a decent knowledge about backend, and what basic cloud is, follow the below path. 
1. Go to aws builder, and take their 8hr course on cloud practitioner. It's not only good just for exam, but they teach you a lot of things. And they are intresting af.
2. Once finished, go to YouTube and look for question dumps. Every question, pause, don't look at options and guess it. And also, think for which question the other options would have been the right answer for. This reinforces your learning.

A lot of companies that came for placements last year came again this year. But they haven't yet onboarded the students who were placed last year. Why do they do this? 

Most of my seniors are waiting for the call from their recruiters to join. A majority of them went for higher studies or found jobs elsewhere.

Close to 15 companies came this year, most of them took no one after the 1st round. They just conduct their online test and then ghost us.

Here's my experience:
I got shortlisted in Dec from the online aptitude round of a company's recruitment in my college. The last 3 rounds were conducted in a remote college in a popular holiday destination, and students from all over the state (600+) attended. They even made us pay 100/- each as reg fees. 

The process was not easy but not tough either. I got through the 2 technical rounds to the final HR round. This was one and a half month ago, and they haven't published the results yet.

On the day before the recruitment I called a senior who was placed in this company last year and he told me don't go as it's a waste of time because they haven't called him yet. This was really demotivating but I still prepared and got to the last round.

Tbh I've let this one go. It is what it is.

But still why do companies conduct recruitments even tho they already have a pool of talent from last year to hire from?",2024-03-16 13:15:56

1bbkhlc,Quitting job because of stress. Need reality check,"TL;DR. I am a 30F Software engineer, working for a high paying company. After the recent attrition the work has been overwhelming me. I feel burnt out and stressed. I consider quitting my job but have some mental block. 

Long story:
I have always put my academics and career in the front seat and think being successful there has been my entire identity. I have done Masters in computer engineering with decent grades. I also have a patent and published a few papers. Then after working for a Bigtech for 2 years I quit my job as I was very depressed during covid and couldn't continue working there. I was performing poorly at that company and they were happy to let me go. After 8month break, I joined another company in India. 
 
Now, I have been working for this company for 2 years now. In the two years I had a personal health glitch because of which I had 2-3 slow months but other than that I was an above average worker. My team, when I joined was a high performing team and the expectations were too high from me and my manager has always thought I was maybe just average. Since then, a lot of people have left the team. We were a 8 member team when I joined. Since then 5 of them left which leaves only 3 senior employees(including me) and 2 new joinees in the team. I don't see the work getting any better even though new people are going to be hired. 

I love what I do at work and there's a lot to learn and grow. The problem is that my manager considers a few qualities like being innovative and creative as important ones and I don't have them. I am good at finishing what's given to me. I am willing to learn to be better but we are stretched too thin at this point to focus on working on my weaknesses. So my manager still thinks am just an average worker despite me picking up so much extra load. He often adds other teammates to shadow me if he thinks I am slow. I feel like I am doing a thankless job. This has been going on for over 6months now. I am so stressed.  I often wake up before my alarm with a lot of anxiety.  It has even started affecting my productivity at work and in my personal life. Last week I didn't sleep for 2 nights because I was afraid of admitting a mistake I made at work as it would cost some time and effort from other teams to rectify.
 I quit my previous job for the exact reason but the difference is that I think I am actually doing good work now unlike last time where I was terribly unproductive. I am beginning to get concerned that this is becoming a pattern where I quit my job in 2ish months without a backup option. 

This might sound silly, but please bear with me. We are planning to get pregnant soon and I am afraid of moving job at this point of my life as I think maternity breaks might be difficult in a company I would have just joined. It might become an extended break which am terribly afraid of. 
 
All said and done, I so want to take a break and work my physical and mental health and look for a new job leisurely. But I have always been an overachiever and the idea of not having a solid career goal is something I am unable to come to terms with and am worried if I am ruining my career.  Also, salary is not my motivation to work as I feel I am financially stable enough to take about 1year break. 
Please advice me what to do.

My close friend, a Senior UI/UX designer, and I created a components library for React. It's called Matro UI, and it's fully Open Source. We cooperate together almost a month just to release this MVP, and I really hope it will grow in pover over time.

**Core Features:** 

1. **Flexible class handling:** Matro UI allows developers to apply classNames almost everywhere and directly to the parent element, providing more flexibility in styling components compared to libraries that apply classNames to wrappers.
2. **Preserving event handlers:** Unlike some other libraries that may lose onClick and other event handlers, Matro UI ensures that event handlers are preserved, maintaining the expected behavior of components.
3. **Customizable elements:** Matro UI enables the creation of elements from the element it receives in the ""as"" prop, allowing developers to customize components by specifying the element type while still benefiting from library styling. This approach helps to not break the W3C Standards and help avoid unnecessary divs and wrappers, resulting in cleaner code.
4. **Balance between customizability and simplicity:** Matro UI strikes a balance between customizability and ease of use, making it easier for developers to understand and customize components without sacrificing flexibility.

Check it out, if you find this useful, please **give it a star**. Also, we're looking for contributors, and if this project takes off, we plan to add it to Open Collective.

I don't think they take us developer/investors seriously, They have no proof of other account (When I have none) Based on similar names maybe they just blocked someone's business/investment.

1br5ee6,Nobody owes you a job just because you have a degree -- Important lesson everyone should know.,"I think a lot of people start with some incredibly wrong expectations in this field to begin with. So many students see these news articles of incredibly high packages in CS, or the fact that CS is the easiest path to getting rich, and end up choosing it as their college major. The reality is that it might have been true just 5 years ago. But now? Not at all. People don't keep themselves updated with latest conditions and trends. Job market isn't doing well, and admit it or not, AI is significantly responsible for a lot of these changes. Profits are declining, companies have to get rid of employees.  


Simply learning a programming language is not even sufficient anymore. Heck, even learning technologies alone is not sufficient as you should have good communication skills, problem solving, pitching yourself etc. Everyone these days is building the same personal projects, everyone has good marks these days, everyone has done an internship before. Things that were sufficient even 2 years ago are not sufficient anymore.  


You are not unique, there are lakhs of students who graduate every year with CS degree, why would a company pick YOU? Sure, degree helps, but does it guarantee a job? Absolutely not, and we should accept that. Especially in India, we have a huge population and the world is getting exponentially competitive.

1bodxlh,First Freelancing website project - an Indian client,"This website had to be built from scratch. I suggested them shopify. I have experience with US based clients who pay almost 100$ an hour for the same work.

1beivda,"I need career advice, I am very much confused reagrding my future.","Hello guys, hope you all are doing well.  


I am a final year BE ECE student. I had multiple backlogs due to personal circumstances which I had succesfully cleared this semester and I am in my last semester right now.  


Now I have to make a choice on what to regarding my career.  


A few options come to mind:  


IT jobs:  
I ahve always had a soft side / fascination towards programming and technology in general. So I am naturally drawn towards this field. The problem is my parents heavily advice against entering into this industry because of a lack of  ""job-security"" and that people are very much prone to layoffs. They also scare me by saying you have to keep yourself always updates and if you show incompetency you will be thrown out at any time and replaced by a fresher who performs better than you. And that companies won't keep you in payroll after you cross 40 etc for cheaper and better young talent. My friends keep saying that AI will replace programmers anyways in the coming years so what is the point?  


Govt jobs:  
My parent's favourite option. They are Govt employees so they are naturally more inclined to make their child to also become a Govt employee. They talk of advantages of a Govt job, especially job security which is that even when you do no work / get injured to a point where you can't even work, Govt will not fire you and a job will always be there for you till the very end. I like these perks like anyone would but when I look how fierce competition is for Govt exams like UPSC, SSC etc., I feel intimidated and reluctant to choose this path.  


Higher studies:  
Thing is, I have faced too much trauma of facing arrears while my close friends got class-first and struggling to climb outside of the academic hole that i put myself in that the thought of studying further makes me anxious and scared. I don't have much interest in Electronics side of things maybe because I haven't learnt them well but I have a slight interest towards the concepts of Communication.  


To do highers in India, I have to appear for TANCET / GATE and the competition for that again scares me and I feel reluctant to study for it.   


Highers abroad seems very cool and I would like to do it but I don't know whether it is worth such a high investment and moreover what would I even study? The stuff about feeling reluctant to study further still applies. Also I feel like the thought of going abroad and experincing a whole new set of circumstances is what excites me than the idea of studying.  


Core companies:  
I simply don't know / don't have an interest in this as of now. I do not know ECE well and IDK if that will change in the future. But people say that comapred to a software job, core job will have better job security and less prone to layoffs since not much people are there who are inclined towards a core job.  


I have an interest in photography and I have been told by my peers that I am good at it but my parents have indoctrined in me that it is not a valid / sustainable career path.

This is my situation folks. All my friends are placed on-campus and because of my bad decisions I am left alone with confusion and regret.  


What do I do guys?",2024-03-14 11:21:17
1bcuo53,Software Developer with 5 YOE - Am I Asking Too Much for 20 LPA?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a UI developer with 5 years of experience under my belt, primarily working with ReactJS, Angular, VueJS, and some backend experience in Node.js. I'm currently interviewing while on notice period and have an offer on the table for around 18 LPA (Lakhs Per Annum). My current package is 8.5 LPA, which is a significant jump.

However, I was genuinely curious if I might be asking for too much. When I mentioned my desired salary of 20 LPA to another recruiter, they pushed back saying:

&#x200B;

* UI developers typically don't reach that range.
* It's a ""greedy"" ask considering the current hike.
* My current offer is already a good jump, why keep looking?
* Developer salaries are inflated.

This left me wondering if I'm being unrealistic.

Just wondering, am I asking too much? Any similar experiences or advice on how to navigate this?

1bg2w68,Help a fresh developer not to get benched in his first job.,"Hi devs, hope your weekends are filled with happiness.

I am working in a startup (joined recently) and got tagged into a project (product support). Initially I was the only one. Then 2d later, a colleague got tagged into the same project. He has exposure in the previous company, and the company I'm working in took him in as a fresher.

Everytime some issues or bugs come up, he takes it onto himself, and gives it to me. I fix it (he too does some coding), push the code to production. There's a weekly meeting, in which we have to read out the status of the project. He takes it most of the time. 

Now, a senior came up to me and told me that the manager asked him if I'm doing anything. The senior told the manager that I'm doing my part.

Senior told me nothing to worry, just be cautious. This is a headsup.

I feel like the coworker who got tagged with me is overshadowing me. He takes up the meetings, talks to the client even when I say I would do it, etc etc.

Kindly help me to figure out where I'm going wrong, and what can I do to atleast let the managers notice me..?

TL;DR - Coworker is overshadowing me, manager says I don't do anything. Help.",2024-03-16 10:16:11

1b86wjx,Inputs on quitting current job without existing offers,"Hey everyone,
I'm a Software Engineer at a startup (slightly niche domain) here in India, and will soon have ~3 YOE. I've been with the company for over 2 years now and they've treated me really well. My current CTC ~31LPA is 4√ó the offer I had been placed out of college with, and this is my second company. Overall, the people are very friendly, there's a lot I've learnt (and am still learning), and has been a fun place to work at.

However, recently work has been hectic, and with the company being profitable and expanding, a slight culture shift has been created, with decision making being spread across multiple people and layers, thus taking a lot of time, feedback and approvals to get work done, while there is still deadlines to be met. Over the last few months there have been several nights where I've felt like I've had almost no work-life balance, working late nights to meet deadlines, or worried about work, and while most people are understanding, I've set a reputation for getting work done, and don't like not meeting timelines. 

My question here is - if I stay with my parents and have saved a fair bit  of money, and do decide to quit, is it okay to do so without a job? It is near impossible for me to prepare for interviews or do the research on where I'd like to go next while at my current job, but I definitely want to take my time to find the right place (maybe even remote for a bit). How good does one have to be to be able to quit their job without another offer?

I'm also a little scared about quitting, because it is possible the opportunities I get might not be as good as this, and also the possibility that this company continues to do great things in the future, and I'll regret jumping ship. I also am in a slightly niche domain - gaming, and don't really know if my current experience at a gaming company hampers offers from different domains. If anyone has been in a similar situation, please do provide your guidance on how you decided on your path. ",2024-03-06 18:17:54

Initially before the process started, I mentioned that my expected salary is 18 LPA. My current is 11.5 LPA with 6.5 yrs of experience in MERN. My salary is a bit lower and needs market correction because i started in a Tier 3 city and also i was working remotely so i was ok with that salary.

My rounds have gone pretty good, but i wanted to ask for a higher salary in the HR round.. maybe around 20-21 LPA. I have no other offers to negotiate and probably wont have any since i have a longish noti d period. 

How can i talk in the HR discussion so that i raise my intial expectation by 2-3 LPA. 
I am thinking to raise the following points for my reconsideration of my initial expected salary.

1) Market correction of salary 
2) Relocating to Tier 1 city having higher expenses
3) Discussing with peers of same experience of what should be expected salary for my role and experience

I also want to bring up the fact that the company itself offers 20-21 LPA average salary according to ambition box but not sure how i can do that.

1. Better pay for my time, can save more to come back to India.
2. Comparatively good work culture. In India, leads & seniors work easily more than 10hrs plus needs to be available for meetings in US hours which is a big no for me.
3. Better infrastructure and in general, quality of life.
4. Want to invest my time in studying the subject deeply.

What‚Äôs bothering me for going to US?
1. No financial support at all. I saved some money for my parents(no income) and can afford 40% tution fee from my savings.
2. Worried about AI taking the jobs looking at the rapid progress it‚Äôs making.

We have an own house to live and no debts. But zero assets, so I have responsibility on me to take care. But I don‚Äôt want to end up in adjusting my whole life arranging finances and struggling with mental peace with poor work culture.
So I thought of taking a risk on myself for my masters and applied for universities. I am going with a public university with fee around 20k for whole masters. I have to apply for some loan without any co-applicant.
Hence, before doing that I want to take all of your suggestions on it. What do you think should be done?

Right now, I'm BA for a project where the client wants things done quickly, with 3-4 deployments every week. Our company is very sales-oriented, and exceptions are made for all processes, especially for big clients who bring in a lot of revenue. Unfortunately, this extra workload doesn't translate into extra compensation or appreciation for the development team, who often work extended hours or night shifts.

I'm hesitant to disturb the developers during their personal time or weekends because I value team morale and the quality of our work. However, if I don't push them, I might be replaced by someone who will. Do you have any suggestions on how to manage this situation? I'm finding it difficult because I've never had to play the role of the ""bad guy"" before, but I feel like I'm being forced into it.

I feel fortunate that I am getting these opportunities. I joined Tech M on the 1st of March with an almost 100% hike as I was underpaid in my previous org. I have a total of 3.5 YOE as an MLE. I have worked extensively on cutting-edge AI projects. And these projects were the reason I was with my previous company for 3.5 years.

""I aim for good work and money will be the by-product"" is what I believe in. It is not like the previous org was lowballing me they were giving the best compensation one can get in a tier 2 city.

With responsibilities, the need for money also increases. Hence I started looking for new opportunities. Luckily got from Tech M with 100% hike but not very sure about work. Got a Senior AI Engineer role over here. **I have joined on the 1st of March, 2024,** it is 12th day and yet to receive even the official creds. NO WORK SINCE DAY 1.

Now I **got an offer from another amazing firm with a 50% hike o**ver tech m offering it is remote work and I am feeling to join that org due to these reasons:

1. Healthcare domain
2. Really good work
3. Perma remote (this is really imp for me as I can't relocate due to some personal reasons)

The answer I am seeking is for these questions:

1. Should I go for this new firm or stay at TechM?
2. Will TechM give me an early release as there is no dependency?

Sitting idle at TechM has started to bother me now.

Edit: Will techm give me an early release or I need to serve whole 3 months NP",2024-03-12 13:09:24

1bb5ab0,(S)campus Placement got me questioning all my choices.,"I've been doing web development and app development since my 1st year of college in 2021.
I've done multiple internships in startups. Being in college(pursuing BSc CS) that couldn't even be considered a tier 3 college (maybe tier 4 or 5) we were not expecting any placements. But at the end of our 2nd year there was a placement drive in Mumbai for a consultating company (one of  the biggest) for a role of Associate Analyst(the package is much less than expected). We applied to it since no other companies were coming. Cleared the Aptitude and technical round and got shortlisted for the interview. The interview was with a lead developer regarding my tech stack and my project and the tech they are working on. After clearing the interview we got to know that from my college only 2 people(my friend and I) got selected out of 110 students from CS and IT department. We were very happy be placed in a company in the 2nd year itself.

We recieved the goodies and completed other formalities in next few months. But then we had to wait for next 1 and half year for the offer letter. We were losing our hope and thinking that we won't be getting any offer letter now and we had started applying in other companies. But at the end of December 2023 we recieved the offer letter. We weren't as happy as we were on getting placed when we read the offer letter saying that we will have to relocate to Hyderabad for the job (we are from Mumbai). Given what our package is, it will be difficult to live in PGs, manage food and also send some money home. But the reputation of the company was what got us the motivation to move to Hyderabad (Biggest mistake).

After coming to Hyderabad, we had our orientation and in the same week we got to know that we are assigned to a project. We were happy but when we got to know that we will be in a finance role our heart was broken. And no, I'm not talking about FinTech, it's a finance role that should have been given to a commerce grad not a comp sci grad.

Now our team(around 50 people) consists of 80% of freshers coming from BSC CS and BCA background doing finance here. And we cannot switch our department for next 18months as this is a new project that we have recieved.

I'm blaming myself for accepting that offer and relocating here. If I'm working here for next 18months, will I be hired outside for a technical role? Whats even worse is the notice period is of 3 months, so when we apply somewhere they ask for our notice period and after knowing it's for 3 months they back out.

Feeling like I made the biggest mistake by chasing the reputation of the company. They hired us for a technical role and put us in the finance department from where we can't even leave now.

I need some advice on what I can do for next 18 months while I'm here working a shift which is even worse, 2pm to 11pm.

Example - 

There was this thing in my project, where the code would decide, to which Database Table, the SQL INSERT Script will be implemented in, based on the file. I gave some ideas, and the client appreciated it. And I implemented it.

But, the other day, I had an interview where the person asked me, how to reverse a number without using Array or String methods.

The code goes like this :-

    number = 4567
    def revNumber(num):
        revNum = 0
    
        while (num != 0):
            revNum = revNum * 10 + num % 10

        return revNum
    print(f""Number = {number}, Reversed Number = {revNumber(number)}"")

I got everything. Just couldn't figure out this part = `revNum * 10`    The interviewer gave me a hint and I was able to do the rest.

1bm5spq,Need advice! Should I proceed with an offer from a startup?,"I graduated from a Tier -1 college and have been working as a Data Scientist in a company similar to WITCH for ~5 years. Recently, I received an enticing offer from a mid-size startup with a base salary approximately 1.8 times my current salary, along with additional variable components.

I‚Äôve attempted to negotiate with my current employer, and while my manager verbally agreed to match the base salary, I haven‚Äôt received any written confirmation despite following up for 4 weeks. Although I‚Äôve submitted my resignation, the company hasn‚Äôt accepted it yet as they‚Äôre keen on retaining me.

However, I‚Äôm facing some hesitation about joining the new company for a few reasons:
- Relocating to another city definitely induces some inertia.

1bkzdtn,9 soft skills that will level up your game as a developer," 

You can develop really cool applications with sophisticated features, but if you lack soft skills, you will have a hard time working with people from other teams and, inevitably, clients, who are prone to have their own ways.

Here are 9 soft skills that will level up your game as a developer:

* **Building in public:** Using social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn to publicly share your developer journey, which can attract collaboration opportunities. Think of it as online networking.
* **User-centric empathy**: Understanding and prioritizing the user‚Äôs experience and needs in software development, especially when catering to users with disabilities.
* **Critical thinking:** Assessing various solutions to a problem and choosing the most effective course of action.
* **Communication:** Clearly articulating ideas, concepts, and technical details to team members or clients.
* **Adaptability:** Staying flexible and adapting to new technologies, tools, and methodologies.

For the remaining 4 soft skills check out the full article [here](https://www.developernation.net/blog/16-essential-technical-and-soft-skills-for-modern-developers-staying-ahead-in-a-rapidly-evolving-tech-landscape).",2024-03-22 13:35:16

I was hired for automation, I have good experience with Excel VBA. But later I was pushed to perform manual tasks including SAS scripting( It was new to me, and I started learning it, as it's a scripting language as well ). I was taking more time than rest of the team. But I am willing to learn without any direct support.

Some months back, Manegement decided to let go SAS, and all of my efforts to learn and exceed my role, went down the drain. 

Next I know, I am told to work on Databricks. I again inspired myself to learn it, as it's python scripts and will help me learn something. I hardly had worked 2-3 times on it. Yes, it took me time to learn the grammar and the usage.
I was again reached by my seniors to process it like other teammates. 

But now I am assigned to VBA automation again, and seniors expect me to code a tool from scratch and are giving me a week to produce it. I have no option to connect with the right person asked for this automation. Working my way out. 

I feel I might be kicked off soon. Need help to know my options and if this sub can help me find a job.

1bgrl5r,Maximizing Career Growth: Balancing Job Switching Every Two Years with Transitioning from Data Analyst to Data Engineer - Stay or Switch?,"Hi everyone,I could use a bit of advice. It's commonly said that to grow professionally, one should switch jobs every two years.

 I'm in a bit of a dilemma because I want to transition from a Data Analyst role to a Data Engineer, but given the current market situation, it's proving difficult to secure new opportunities.

I'm not receiving many callbacks from the positions I've applied to. However, my current role offers ample opportunities to gain experience in data engineering, including ETL, pipeline management, and data warehousing. 
While the workload is very heavy, I'm grateful to have a job during these uncertain times.


TL;DR: Is it acceptable for me to stay in my current role for the next year or so, rather than switching jobs? Would this be frowned upon? It's my first job, with a fixed CTC of 8 LPA.

I appreciate any insights or advice you can offer. Thanks in advance!",2024-03-17 07:05:50

1. Personal project - Build a pipeline which fetches data from an api, stores in s3, loads into looker. 
2. Learn all theory and practice a bit of DSA on leet code

1b821go,30 yo system admin looking to move into developer role.,"Hello Good people of Reddit!

As the title says , I am a 30 yo who works as a system admin and I am interested in switching to a developer role.  Lately I've been having this huge urge to learn coding and become a SWE. I find Backend developer role to be very interesting and from past few days I've been watching many youtube videos/reading about it to understand the required set of skills needed to be a backend developer.

&#x200B;

Currently I am here:

I have 8 yoe in system admin role. I have my engineering degree in ECE field and I have python knowledge and have used it to do scripting in my current role. I have good linux experience along with basic networking and sql knowledge. 

&#x200B;

Now to the main part:

I realize It would take many months to learn the required skills , I intend to learn Django since it is python based along with a DB (maybe mysql). I understand that I will be a person with zero experience when I apply for SWE jobs after learning the required skills. 

&#x200B;

But the problems I see are:

(\*) My current salary ,  I earn 22 LPA and I understand little to no company will pay that salary for fresher developer roles.

(\*)  I can't take a pay cut since I have few EMIs/expenses and I take care of my retired parents.

&#x200B;

But there are few positives too:

(\*) My current company encourages Internal transfers a lot and I believe I would be given a fair chance  to interview should the position be open. I did see one open BE developer job position in my company and I believe I can move laterally without any pay cuts to a dev role if I can clear the interviews.

(\*) My current company has good job stability so I don't have to worry about my current job role while I learn coding.

&#x200B;

I am aware that my plan to move to a dev role hinges on the fact that I clear the interview for switching within my company as I am not sure I will get paid what I earn now with zero experience outside. 

But I really wanna give this a try , I'm not getting any younger and I realized now might be the right time (and the only time) for me to do this, what do ya'll think?

1b5do7v,Fear of PIP and returning joining bonus and relocation,"So I recently joined company Amazon 2 months back after they posponed my joining date. But I have a feeling that they don't want me here, because there was no need for me in team in the first place, secondly they are not giving me work related to my field. 
So I feel they might put me in PIP. I have already started looking for jobs outside, but I have few questions in case they put me in PIP before that.
1. How much severence will I get incase they put me in PIP.
2. Do I need to return my joining and relocation bonus, if yes then how can I avoid this.

Any help is appreciated.

Devops - onsite(current) **V.S.** Dev - remote(more pay as well - 20%)

Iam in my last semester of college, currently doing an intern as a devops role but after this I have the choice of switching company to a dev based role (with more pay) or continue here with slightly lesser pay(by 20%). My current company is really reputed and I can see myself upskilling here, the dev role is in a smallish startup. And I dont really mind going to the office. Potential growth is an important factor as well.
How should I chose? Or what would you keep in mind and advice for potential growth?

2 days ago I logged in randomly in my second LinkedIn account , found that some details were missing, so simply went ahead and filled them up like like job and all ,""cyber expert"" - fake. This account does not have my real name.

I was surprised to see from past 2 days , suddenly I am getting random recruiter emails for Cyber security jobs, via job portals. In all job portals I am Project manager so how come suddenly from same portal I am now getting Cyber security jobs ?

What kind of linkage is this ? 
It can only mean one thing LinkedIn is sharing my details with job portals or data brokers. 

I checked my browser  there are no issues or malwares. 

I had to log into my job portal accounts to see if anything was wrong but found nothing, it still says Project manager.


This data stealing and data brokering mafia is going unhinged , mix matching who knows what with any profile.

Company Culture
It's not that great. They always want you to put extra effort. They will not ask for overtime but they will give so much pressure that just to finish sprint you will need to put your own time without pay.
Working hour is 10hour including lunch. But you can't start before 9:30 AM.

&#x200B;

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to share a recent turn of events and seek your support during this challenging time.

&#x200B;

My previous company recently made the difficult decision to lay off the entire department, leaving me in search of new opportunities. Despite my best efforts and numerous interviews, I've encountered hurdles in securing a new role. Many prospects didn't respond, while others seemed to overlook my qualifications due to reasons like recent project focuses.

&#x200B;

Here's a bit more about my background: I've served as a Software Engineer for 2 years, where I led the development of robust web applications using Ruby on Rails. My role involved engineering RESTful APIs, ensuring code quality through comprehensive testing practices, and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions. I have a Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Technology with a strong GPA.

&#x200B;

My expertise spans database design, ActiveRecord, and Heroku deployment, with certifications in AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Docker Essentials. Additionally, I've showcased my problem-solving skills through achievements like being a finalist at Industrial Hackathons and achieving a Silver level proficiency in problem-solving on HackerRank.

&#x200B;

I'm reaching out to this community in the hopes of finding referrals or potential job openings in the tech industry. If you know of any opportunities or have connections that might be beneficial, I would be incredibly grateful for your support.

1blvfjd,Desperately need health advice to cope with night shifts,"Hi guys..

I recently joined a  service based company where I was assigned to an Application support role. During my training, I worked in the usual hours (9 AM to 6 PM) but now my lead has informed me that they're going to pull me into night shift for the entire month of April (and most probably even more after that). I'm a bit scared as I have heard some really bad things about working in the ""graveyard shift"" and how it effects one's physical and mental health. I have never worked in night shifts before.

So please suggest me what proactive measures I can take to atleast minimise the damage it'll cause eventually. Keep in mind that the work I do is not hectic at all and I can relax (but not doze off) for hours with no work stress at all. And also... I currently can't even consider the possibility of quitting this job for the sake of my health.

Any advise will be very much appreciated.

1blu4hn,LAMP Stack Dev Seeking Career Growth: What's the Next Best Step?,"Hey fellow developers,

I've been working as an Associate Software Developer for 2+ years, primarily focused on the LAMP stack across various projects for my company. While I've gained valuable experience in this role, I'm keen to expand my skillset and transition my career towards the MERN stack.

To prepare for this transition, I've been taking courses and working on a personal MERN stack project. However, despite my efforts, landing a job in this field has been a bit challenging so far. I've had a few interviews, but I stumbled during the technical rounds, which has left me a bit confused about the next steps I should take.

I've received various suggestions from colleagues, and my thoughts:

1. Study DevOps (as some job descriptions require this knowledge)
2. Learn the Java stack, which could potentially lead to better-paying opportunities
3. Continue working on more MERN stack personal projects.
4. Strengthen my DSA skills with JavaScript.
5. Learn Laravel or other PHP framework.

What would you guys recommend as the most effective path forward? Should I prioritize one of the suggestions above, or is there another approach you would suggest?  
  
Any thoughts or advice would be gold!",2024-03-23 14:56:54

I graduated in 2023 and recently secured a position at a consultancy firm with a salary of 7 LPA.

This has left me feeling disinterested and unsatisfied. Additionally, I am currently preparing for the GATE exam and have enrolled in classes. At times, I contemplate quitting my job to focus on my exam preparation full-time, as I believe it would offer more personal satisfaction. Furthermore, I am experiencing health issues which further complicates my situation.

I've been grappling with the fear of what might happen if things don't go as planned. I'm torn between sticking with my job, even though it doesn't excite me, and dedicating myself fully to exam preparation. My heart tells me that the job isn't fulfilling, but there's uncertainty about leaving it. Additionally, I find myself easily distracted, with numerous thoughts running concurrently, which further complicates my decision-making process.

I also have concerns about what will happen if I don't achieve a good result in the GATE exam. I currently lack a backup plan, which adds to my uncertainty and apprehension about the situation.

What should I do? I'm hesitant to make any sudden decisions. I value hearing opinions from experienced individuals before taking any action.

I don't feel that I am growing and whole day feel very down. All the conversation i have with my colleagues is how we can move out.

I applied for product roles couldn't manage to get offers. 

In a dilemma about what should I do next. 
I always liked cp, but never gave enough time. I was decent at dsa. Was thinking is it sensible to leave and just prepare.

Or should I go for an MBA ? Is it better to do an MBA if i wanna continue in product, cause I heard without a branded college it's hard to move up in product.

Or should I just stick to searching for another product role?

Loneliness (despite living at home) and a lack of social life has got me thinking whether it is viable to look for work in a company in India.

1bh5x71,Notion as Your Website's Backend? Building a No-Code Builder and Need Your Brainpower!,"Hey Folks.

So, I've been working on something for some months and thought, ""Who's better to share it with than you guys?"" It's about making websites out of Notion pages. Well Notion already has it but it's not out of the box and it is also limited to customisations and what you can do with SEO.

**Here's What I've Been Up To:**

* You can put your website on it's custom domain or use a subdomain. And don't worry about the technical stuff like generating SSL certificates. I will use caddy to handle that
* If you want your site to look cool? You can change its look and feel, make sure people can find it on Google, you can change SEO, and even add your own style with CSS. If you're into some scripting, you can add your own JavaScript too.
* I'm also playing around with AI to make your site super smart. It can help people find what they're looking for or even chat with them. For this I am using basic semantic search over website content that can be trained first to create embeddings. Also, it would be handled by a vector db like: qdrant
* For all this to happen I am using Next js 14, Mysql with vitess, qdrant, redis and caddy and kubernetes or docker.

**What I am curious about?**

* If this was a free or a paid service would you use it to create websites?
* Would the AI feature produce any real value?
* I am thinking of having a free and paid service, a free service would have Free plan and would be limited to single site, with subdomain and limited chats and training with AI.
* A paid model would have PRO and Enterprise plan with features from their previous plans, support, custom domain and full access to all features.
* If this was a paid service, How much would you pay for it?
* If you were to use it, would there be more features you would like to have?

I am also pasting some screenshots to show the POC.

I have seen mass hysteria about AI and I just saw the devin video demo and it was impressive. It was like a superpowered human that can learn anything from internet in seconds.   


But being a developer is more than just churning out code. It is about collaboration, analysis,creativity and much more.I just can't imagine AI creating EXCEL out of nothing. Even though devin gave you a webpage how are you going to manage it if you are not a developer? Who is going to create a branding for your page? Who is going to make the scaling decesions ? Who is going to maintain your page?  Am I wrong?

But I also realise AI is becoming more and more relevant . I have used colab gen AI and it is really helpful ! It also debugs better than me and makes it super fast writing standard codes. And chatgpt is my bread and butter.

  
1. I chose  ML specialization for my Btech but got an intenship in dev role.  
So, What skills will be necessary to stay relevant?

2. I have seen lot of genAI courses popping up like google genAI hackathon and AWSdeep racer. I am very confused. Should I work on my AI skills and learn about LLMs ans try to integrate AI into my projects? Will they really be helpful?  


3.What new roles are going to pop up?  


4. If you are a working professional can you give the impact you have observed in your work flow?

1bbesq6,How do you work with a difficult manager that wants everything done asap? ,"TLDR -
manager is being pushy and tries to shorten the deadline for every task that is done and then gets pissed off when the shorter deadline is breached.


So I have recently joined this company around 4 months back and everything was going well until this new manager joined. It was okay in the beginning but now it seems like he's got comfortable and started to show his true colors (I don't know if I can put it in any other way).

He always tries to undermine the deadline and expects things to be done as fast as possible. Plus, it seems like he's from a non-technical background and therefore might be having difficulties understanding the full technical context of all the technical changes that we do.

For example, recently he gave me a task which I broke into separate components and gave him a timeline of 1 month with each deliverable being separated by 1 week. Although the task was high priority, he pulled the full team into it and cut the deadline from 1 month to 1 week. Now, since the task was not really simple, issues and bugs came up and as a result, the deadline set by him was breached. Then he started getting pissed off that we were not able to complete the work by the deadline. The culture also took a little bit as everyone was under extreme pressure. This was the first time that he did this but I'm afraid this is going to be a pattern to follow for the time to come.

How do you handle it in a graceful manner? I've stood up to him about the issues and told him that we are working at maximum velocity. He has also shown some passive agressive behaviour and I've confronted him about that as well. It's just that leaving is not a really an option for now since I kinda just joined lol.

1b9tzj1,Feeling low today as I couldn't remember the 2 weeks old code in Live code review,"I was few minutes away from logging off today, then my manager pinged me that if we can do a Live high-level code review (more of code flow & functionality verification). So, there were 2 managers and I in the call, one of them is technically strong. We were going through my code which I wrote 2 weeks back. I'm 70% almost was able to explain the code-flow and justify my code, like why the way I did it and what my routines do. 

At some near point in end of the code-flow, I was stumbling to explain that it was missing a little piece of functionality (kind of validation check) and I failed to realise myself, and to be honest I missed a test case they asked me to handle in earlier discussion. I was totally unprepared for the live code review and I said ""I think it works that way"" couple of times. My manager said, ""You are the one who wrote that code, right?"" Little sarcastically.

I accepted that it was my mistake to fail to spot that missing case. I'm totally ashamed of myself that I couldn't remember the code I wrote 2 weeks back. I know that using YOE as an excuse is so lame. But just saying this to myself, I'm 10 months into this software industry. We don't have standard process of documenting code.

This is how it looks like on mobile right now: https://imgur.com/a/4AiAy4R

I am quite happy with it and I feel like there is a broader audience that would also appreciate it. It doesn't have all the features yet (star marked is future) but I envision this to work as:

* Single dashboard view of all things your cat.  
* Important highlights and details in the dashboard. 
* Reminders for scheduled events, purchases\*. 
* A gallery of your cat pictures in the dashboard. 
* A place to store important documents - vaccination certificates, health reports\*. 
* A place to track the expenses, a ledger. 

I want to get away from Streamlit - as much as it is an excellent prototyping system it is not very app like. So, my ask is the following:

* What features would you like, as a pet owner, to see in a Cat Management System like so. 
* What is the tech stack I can use to build this out, I am comfortable with Python and starting to learn Golang, do I have to get my hands on some React framework? Anything easier?

1bqgkbz,Machine Learning feature versus Mobile/Web feature shipping ,"Hi redditors!
I am a Machine Learning Engineer with 4 YOE in a product based startup where the tech team is of around 20 members and I am the only Machine Learning engineer here. The problem that I am currently facing at the moment is that ML features are expected to be shipped at the same rate as Mobile/Web features. Nobody here understands ML including the Engineering Manager. I am also expected to create Jira tickets the way developers do and I know for a fact that ML tasks never really follow the usual To-Do, In Dev, In Staging, In Review and In Prod lifecycle. The estimates are always subject to experimentation as one never knows what could go wrong during the training and so many variables that one person cannot handle it all alone. 

I don‚Äôt find the workplace to be toxic for sure but I would certainly like if people here start looking at things with a fresher perspective. Being here has made me go hands on with JS alongside Python. I have a good idea of how to take ML features live on production and how things work in native (both iOS and Android) although I might not be able to code in Kotlin and Swift. I love the growth here but I would certainly love if a few things change.

The first offer is for a work-from-home position with a fixed annual salary of 3.2 lakhs. However, this job comes with a one-year contract that may be extended for another year. The second offer is for a position in Noida sector 63, requiring me to work from the office.

I have 1.5 years of experience as a UI/UX Developer and Designer, along with 6 months of experience as a graphic designer. I am inclined towards the office job because I believe it will provide me with better opportunities to learn and grow. Working remotely, I fear I may miss out on interactions with colleagues and valuable guidance, as I am the sole person with my profile in the team.

1boftcd,What would happen if I don't get placement in college,"Currently I am in 3rd year in college in cse and placement in my college was really bad this year (less than 50% of students placed and even those placed are currently in internship and ate saying that they have high chances of not getting selected for ppo) and a lot if students in batch ate better than me with great skills in dsa and good  projects 


So my main question is what would happen if I am unable to get placed by the end of college, what should I do and how difficult is it to get job if you are not placed directly after college? From what I have heard if you have some gap after college it becomes really difficult to get job and even then if you are not really lucky you can only be hired at low packages . So is this true ,?

And what others options should I look into like gate , studying abroad etc.",2024-03-26 18:56:26

1bo5bgi,Reflections on Engineering: Quality Hires and the Importance of Peer Review,"I'd like to share another honest conversation about engineers, focusing on a pressing issue: the quality of hires within our engineering team. It's concerning how someone with 15 years of experience, recently hired in January, has been responsible for a string of bugs in a vital banking project.

Let's break it down: none of the APIs created by this employee has maintained idempotency. This means they're not ensuring consistent results, which is crucial, especially in financial systems. Additionally, database transactions haven't been adequately checked to ensure they comply with essential standards like ACID. There are several other noticeable issues, too. Even when given all the necessary information, the employee still struggled.

This raises a critical question: how did someone with such significant shortcomings in their skillset manage to be hired? It's as if the person who hired them wasn't paying attention or didn't understand the requirements.

In engineering or development, precision and attention to detail are vital. Mistakes like these aren't just unacceptable but could also have serious consequences. Nobody can achieve perfection, but at least give it for peer review; ten eyes are better than two.",2024-03-26 11:14:52
1bnnlwc,Are Data Engineers paid less than Frontend/Backend Engineers,"I am working as a software engineer, but have been basically working on a product for data transformation using Spark and orchestrating it using Airflow.

Some of my friends who are in FAANG are getting 8x (i.e more than 50lpa), some others are getting 2 to 3 times more than me and almost all of them are in Web dev or Backend roles.

I have been confused about this for quite some time now. I was tricked into this role and have been stuck in it for more than 2 Years now.

Is this not a first choice for many of the developers? Also is someone with around 3 YOE earning that much in the data role?

1bnkc7c,Best way to learn DSA? Learn all Data Structures First and Solve Problems after learning all DS or Learn a Data Structure and solve problems based on that Data Structure first before moving to the next one? Need help from experienced devs.,"I am a developer with 1.5 years of experience working in a small product-based company. Due to low compensation, I am looking to switch companies. To improve my chances, I've decided to learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from scratch. However, I'm facing a dilemma: when learning a new data structure, such as an array, should I focus solely on that before moving on to other data structures and algorithms, or should I concurrently learn different concepts?

Initially, I started by diving deep into one data structure and solving problems based on it. However, when attempting problems on platforms like LeetCode, I encountered difficulties because some questions required knowledge of additional algorithms and data structures. This confusion led me to repeatedly revisit the same data structure without making much progress. As a DSA novice, I'm seeking advice on the most effective approach and recommendations for useful websites to aid in my preparation.

Please provide guidance on how to navigate this situation, and suggest reliable websites that can assist me in my DSA learning journey.",2024-03-25 18:03:41

1bifsgk,Fear of missing out the experience of being a techie in India,"As a 22-year-old developer who graduated from a European university, I find myself facing multiple job offers from India (Bangalore/Hyderabad), Germany, and the UK. After considering factors such as purchasing power parity, taxes, expenses, and other aspects, the offers rank as follows: UK = Germany > India. This has left me in a state of confusion when it comes to making a decision.

Although I spent 18 years of my life in India, I never lived in any major cities and always dreamed of experiencing the vibrant college life in tier 1 cities like Bangalore or Mumbai. However, I eventually moved to Europe for a better college. Despite being in Europe, I had a limited number of friends and didn't have the same level of fun as my college friends back in Bangalore or Mumbai. From what I've heard, Bangalore is renowned as one of the best cities to live your twenties if you have the financial means and a good network of friends.

If I were to migrate to any of these cities, I would need to make new friends regardless. In that regard, Bangalore seems like an easier place to do so. My friends who studied and work in Bangalore have expressed that they have a fantastic social life, with opportunities for partying, dating, hooking up, enjoying good food, and just generally having a relaxed and enjoyable lifestyle. I don't want to miss out on these experiences.

Therefore, I am curious to know if the life of a well-paid tech professional in Bangalore or Hyderabad is truly as enjoyable as it seems. Additionally, I wonder if I would miss out on any of these opportunities if I were to move to the UK or Germany. While I am unsure if I will ultimately settle in India, I am concerned that I may regret not spending at least a few years of my twenties in tier 1 Indian cities. I would greatly appreciate insights and advice from people who have lived in these cities or have made the decision to move abroad",2024-03-19 09:00:54

So I started searching stuff up on internet about it and it confuses me more the more I learn. Most say Either B tech, BSC CS, BCA/MCA or Bsc it. But some claim B tech > Bsc CS > BCA while some claim Bsc CS is only way to go. While some claim Bcs CS is wasting time because of maths and BCA is better for more technical knowledge. And then there specialized courses like ai ml. How can I be sure whether I wanna do this specific field for rest of life? Is it better tho because you are more specialized for certain jobs? Is it to spend 4 years in one subject/ concept while you can whole CS in that time?

I've been fascinated by the rise of the side hustle culture in India lately and I'm curious to learn more about it. If you're currently involved in a side hustle or know someone who is, I'd love to hear your insights!

It would be great if whoever is answering can put their age and what are they currently pursuing.

Here are a few questions to kickstart the discussion:


1. What motivated you to start a side hustle? Was it purely financial, or were there other factors at play? 

2. How do you balance your side hustle with your main job or other responsibilities?

3. What challenges have you faced while pursuing your side hustle, and how have you overcome them?

4. Do you see your side hustle evolving into a full-time venture in the future, or is it more of a temporary pursuit?

Once the game is completed or if it's game over, I  want to prevent the user from restarting the game until the day ends,  even if they refresh the page. However, currently, even after completion  or game over, users can refresh the page and start the game again.   


 

Here's what I have tried so far:

* I'm using local storage to store game state data and check if the game is completed or if it's game over.
* I have implemented logic to update the game state in local storage when the game is completed or if it's game over.
* When the user refreshes the page, the game allows them to play again, regardless of whether the game was completed or game over.

What are the things I should focus on right now? PS : I'm in my third year of clg, I know native app development but haven't done any internships yet.  


I'm a third year clg student who explored native app development a year ago for 4 months. It surely interested me, but as I'm someone who jumps on different stuff if I find other stuff interesting, I jumped from app dev to Machine Learning and did that for 6 months. I haven't done any internships yet, but when I look up on the internet comparing the entry barrier; I see app dev is much more easier to break into than ML, and the pay is almost about the same (around 6-8LPA) for a fresher. It could go down to maybe 3-4LPA but that's another thing.  


The thing which concerns me is that I really aimed for about 10LPA when I started my college, and then I thought full stack developer (MEA/RN) is only way to land a job paying this much as a fresher. I explored both and found out I prefer developing apps. But at the same time, I doubt if there's any way I can get a job paying around 10LPA for app development?

1b5q8li,django-boot styling package for django [Python Framework],"Hello devs,

I hope this message finds you well. Recently, I scaled back my development with Flask and shifted towards Django due to its automation and delivery speed. This led me to delve deeper and discover the beautiful universe of reusable apps. Consequently, I decided to create a package for personal use, styling the Django admin interface simply with Bootstrap 5 (something hard to come by). I'll share the repository in case you'd like to test it out. The app is easy to configure and is indexed on PyPI.

1brigg1,"I'm graduating next year, what's your opinion on this advice by my friend","I asked my friend(he works at TCS if that matters,cause I see lot of people trolling WITCH companies and their employees on this subreddit)

This question:
""what should I do if I don't like coding at all?""

He said just learn python for a month ,then search ""TCS NQT Coding Questions"" and start to solve them ,if you can't even build simple problem solving/coding  skills required to 
solve TCS NQT level problems then you should just look for jobs in other fields or govt jobs or something ,don't bother about I.T .



Here's a bit more background information about me :

Diploma in information technology (2019-2022)
Sem 1 : I sleep
Sem 2 : I sleep (mass promotion thanks to covid)
Sem 3 : I sleep
Sem 4 : I sleep(mass promotion thanks to covid)
Sem 5: I sleep
Sem 6: Real shit ,had to build a final year project to pass the semester,forked a shitty looking site and made some changes needed for it.

Graduated diploma with 7.83CGPA and close to zero coding skills/experience,I had realised IT isn't for me ,I wanted to dropout during 3rd semester,but wasn't allowed.

So after completing diploma ,I Wanted to get a degree in Languages or in History ,but it falls under ""arts and humanities"" so wasn't allowed to pursue ,same shit happened back in 2018,I wanted to pursue Arts ,they forced me into Science that too in PCM group (I hated maths,still do)
,Anyway I went to science school for like 3-4 weeks then I gave up going to school cause I wasnt interested in it.



Bachelor of Information Technology (lateral entry):
Sem 3: I sleep

Sem 4 : real shit ..realised that I'll be unemployed and homeless soon if I don't get a job..

Sem 5 : real shit ..tried learning c++,frontend(html,css,js), java all at once and obviously didn't succeed, stupid move .

Sem 6: real shit : talked to the only guy I know who works in IT field , the TCS Guy I mentioned at the very start.
He suggested me to learn python in Jan 2024 ,told me not to worry too much about building projects and web development and anything that requires a framework or library or tools ,and told me to focus on my basic programming skills.

Now the problem is that ,he himself hates coding and therefore isn't willing to teach me anything,he just keeps giving me hope and motivation that even if you're shit TCS will accept you if you are able to solve easy level leetcode problems ..the problem is I can't solve even the Two sum problem, tried watching solution videos got confused,what even is a ""hashmap""

I learnt the syntax of the language,can solve very basic programming exercises,but when it comes to anything a tad bit complex ,my mind goes blank,I can't write anything.

Any advice , opinions,suggestions ,hate comments ,
""stop wasting time on reddit and wake tf up"" type of comments are welcomed and appreciated.

* **Company Profile**: [**Cognition Labs**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cognition-ai-labs/) burst onto the AI scene recently, positioning itself as an ""applied AI lab focused on reasoning."" Founded by [**Scott Wu**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-wu-8b94ab96/), a Harvard economics graduate, former Addepar software engineer, and co-founder of the networking platform [Lunchclub](https://lunchclub.com/), Cognition Labs is an intriguing mix of fresh faces and tech-savvy origins.
* **Potential**: The company's ambitions are grand. They are backed by big names in the venture capital world, including Founders Fund. Their initial focus is on Devin AI as a showcase of their reasoning-based AI approach.
* **Domain Registration**: Their domain (cognition-labs.com) was [only registered for one year](https://www.whois.com/whois/cognition-labs.com). Could this be a sign of uncertainty about the company's longevity, or is it a temporary placeholder? Only time will tell.

## Devin AI: Fact vs. Fiction

Devin AI's marketing boldly paints it as a nearly autonomous software engineer. It writes code from scratch, debugs existing programs, and even crafts basic websites. Additionally, Devin AI operates within its environment, complete with a code editor, web browser, and unique interface.

But how much of this holds up to scrutiny? Cognition Labs uses the [**SWE-Bench**](https://www.swebench.com/) benchmark to demonstrate Devin AI's prowess. This benchmark involves resolving actual GitHub issues in real-world open-source projects.

Here, Devin AI claims to resolve an impressive 13.86% of the problems entirely autonomously. This vastly outpaces previous AI benchmarks on the task.

**However**, it's essential to keep perspective. Even with this impressive-sounding figure, there's still a **significant gap between Devin AI's success rate and flawless code generation**. This raises the question: Does Devin have the potential for real-world impact as it stands?

## NotDevin: An Open-Source Devin AI Alternative?

Adding to the buzz surrounding **Devin AI** is an intriguing open-source project called **'NotDevin'**. The emergence of 'NotDevin' ([github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Not-Devin](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Not-Devin)) adds another layer to the story.

There are lot's of dicey things about this company, and my theory is that ""startups"" like Byjus are actually trojan horses placed by big corporate IT companies to dissuade the masses from the startup ecosystem generally.

Not a single profitable quarter since last 2-3 years, yet they're able to pay the salaries, run adverts, sponsor IPL, etc. Did anyone question where did they get this money from?

The more hate and disdain Byjus gets, people will be more wary of small startups and the small people (like you and me) who go into entrepreneurship. This automatically serves the interest of larger IT companies, people will have more faith in them, their brand value will increase due to this. They must be having a great laugh right now watching you throwing all the hate at Byjus.

I'm not sure if I'm able to convey this point across through my words, they might sound a bit too abstract or deep. Like the cattle and sheep, most people will continue hating the Byjus company but I hope there will be at least a few among that sheep who has the vision to see this larger picture of what's happening in corporate IT.

v91pjm,A tale of Indian Devs,"I have interviewed 100+ devs from ranging from various YOE's and College tiers, combining this with the posts in sub, I have noticed some characteristics in our home grown devs.

a. **The Arrogant MF** \- It's a standard practice in the industry to start interviewing at places which for some reasons are inferior than your current work place (compensation / stack), but these guys enter the interviews are start dropping attitude - *Ohh you use RabbitMQ, but Kafka is better. But MongoDB is so much better than PSQL (On asking why did you make that particular choice, a standard answer is it was there before I started).* These is weirdly common between junior/mid level devs. Sure you must have worked on a stack but these kind of comparisons shows shallowness of your knowledge and incapability to learn about newer stuff.

b. **Pseudo** **Alphas** \-  They think they are someone above the crowd, have this attitude of - Either their solution is right or the question is wrong. They jump on the question and find themselves stuck because this is not a textbook problem. This is pretty common with senior devs. Please become a better listener, it's a trait for life.

c. **DSA punks**  \- 200+ Leet code heavy weight champions (Rarely but they even flex it in introductory call), Very good at solving text book problems but will drop balls ass soon as you frame the same question in a real world example. Majorly common in junior devs.

d. **Workplace Shamers** \- On asking why are you leaving your current organisation, they have a list of complains. A lot of times there are legitimate ones, but god if I can write a book about the first world problems these guys have someone can create a season of stand up comedy from this - *I sleep late at night and office is not letting me come at 12 pm, My workplace does not have a in house canteen, Our company is forcing us to serve a 90 day notice period (They are not forcing you to do shit, it was there in your contract when you singed it)*

e. **Creative offer decliners** \- I think you have all heard the stories.

**Feedback**:

1. You are in a top 1% cr√®me de la cr√®me in the world, start acting like it (World is hard, learn the ways to deal with it). There are people far talented then you in various streams which do do not pay exorbitant amount of money.
2. There are no culture rounds where you get to play guitar and impart your coolness, all the rounds are culture rounds. Prepare well for some small talks, have some hobbies and please start listening to people in general.
3. Please have the decency to decline the offers in a meaningful way, there is nothing wrong with saying - I have got a better offer. Don't just drop dead on the joining date and do not use the reason of companies being un ethical (call them out but expect them to call you out too) to justify your indecency.
4. You are standing on the shoulder of giants, A few thousand CRUDs do not make you Jeff Dean, so please show some humility inside and outside your workplace.
5. If your are in it for money, say it, don't twist it be upfront. It will save a lot of parties a lot of time.
6. This attitude issue is pretty well known in global startups now, I personally know a few senior members from US and Indonesia who are not hiring from India now due to this. Shitty ethics and great work culture does not gel together.

My credentials:

I am a CTO at a Series A funded Fintech Startup. Graduated from Tier 1 college.

Why I am writing this:

My senior level team is frustrated with un-ethical nature of software engineers we are interviewing these days despite paying a great compensation. We are just trying to convey what we have learned over years to fellow Devs.

Out of 100 discussions happening on this sub 98 belongs to compensation/notice period/ X better than Y. It's becoming a hiring forum. Rarely anyone asks a well defined dev challenge in here.

Edit:

1. Could not read all of it, but I got the gist in comments. People are angry (very angry) to the extent that even my personal credentials are up for shame (I did not write my credentials to brag, it's just to ascertain my position). This is due to sickened company policies by most tech companies.
2. On the compensation part - it definitely does not match Uber/Amazon but is at par with Linkedins of the world. We have a small team and for every hire we had 10-12 rejections. We have even started offering consultant positions if employees do not want ESOPs and want better cash component (not sure if this would be a good idea, nevertheless did it).
3. Hiring -
   1. All rounds have a mid/senior level guy along with HR.
   2. Salary discussions are either with me or someone from leadership team.
   3. Salary bands are told upfront at the end of first round.
4. I have been there - 3-4 years ago, I got rejected from a big startup in the HR round. I cleared all rounds with CTO and CEO and was pretty sure of the offer, but none the less HR rejected it. Landed somewhere else - so hang tight, IMO hard work is never wasted.
5. Hiring scene is tight, do write reviews on ambition box/glassdoor. Let's force companies to have better work environment.
6. Read your contracts carefully, if you do not understand something take help fro someone who does.

12enbr5,Why candidates lack basic integrity,"I  am a senior developer who is involved in hiring and interviewing at my company. We interview 5 candidates on an average every week and this is what I have observed:

1. Candidates dont bother to show up at interview calls. The agencies have to remind them like kindergarten kids to join or respond if they want an alternate schedule

2. Our company is happy to give candidate demand or match our internal salary benchmark. However shortlisted candidates accept offer and ghost us on joining. 

3. We incur cost to procure laptops & set up for onboarding the candidate. And resource time spent for interviews. Thats money and time we are talking about.

Some of the reasons given for declining the offer are funny. Last week a candidate said her grandfather is suffering from cancer and she cannot join. To the extent that it‚Äôs laughable and they expect us to believe it?

Why cant people be honest and let company know if you are not joining? We know they take offer and shop of better package elsewhere. But they keep saying yes till the last moment. 

What  I believe is many of these are average developers who believe their capabilities have a shelf life and want to make as much as money before they are discarded. Any developer worth his salt will be confident and know hes here for good. I am disappointed with the average developers out there. 

They have the right to a better package but dont make others stepping stones.",2023-04-07 14:35:51
10k37zq,UK based company: Hiring an India based dev employee," 

Hi guys

My business is a small UK based service with a custom built CRM, app and booking platform which we have operated for over 8 years now. Up to now we had used a software company/agency to build and maintain our platform rather than have actual employees. The reason for this was purely due to it being unaffordable as developer salaries in the UK are too high for our business to be capable of sustaining.

Recently the company we are using have been doing some sloppy work and then trying to bill us to correct mistakes that they made. For example, they quote us to develop and deploy a feature and then when there are bugs related to that feature they try to charge us on top. In some case we don't mind but lately it feels like we're being used a cash cow to compensate for what I suspect is a lack of new business for them.

So we are exploring the idea of hiring a full time full-stack developer and India seems a wise choice. Good quality devs who speak fluent English seem abundant and the salaries are lower than UK which makes it affordable for us. Just wondering if anyone could offer any advice on how to approach this, from testing and selecting the right candidate to then making sure we are legally compliant with being an employer under Indian laws. We would even be willing to bring the right person to London for a few days if things went well, as we want a long term investment in the right person (or people).

Budget is circum 10k USD per annum

11tqvcj,When to WFH and when to WFO-hybrid,"If you 

1) are top .01 % in terms of skillset (1 in 10000) 

2) have great mental health and discipline and have an exercise regime

3) are really good with  online networking & collaboration (think open source projects) 

4) have great written and verbal communication & ability to negotiate 

5) have life skills to handle life once you have to live by yourself (and not end up like a man-child or woman-child post marriage/if you move abroad for studies/work) 

6) are great at objection handling and conflict resolution (can argue about merits of architecture etc without resorting to name-calling) 

7) have a career path mapped out for 20+ years 

8) have a supportive home environment 

9) are not a manager / lead engineer with a team reporting into you

You can safely wfh / remote without needing to go into office, move out and live by yourself. An office environment has nothing to offer to you and the commute is probably going to add to your stress. 

&#x200B;

If you do not meet at least 50% of the points above - you are better off going to an office in some hybrid mode and ensure you match your schedule with other folks to learn some of the skills/network/find a mentor/co-founder etc.

If you have no prior work-ex - do consider a hybrid work environment which can provide you some of the softer skills needed to be successful in your career and life. 

If your hybrid office org does not have an ""office day"" when all folks meet in person - try getting alignment with your team to ensure there is in-person interaction - especially around user story grooming, estimation, design discussions & architecture review, UX sessions, test plan review, customer feedback review sessions ...",2023-03-17 13:18:07

I agreed with him at that time but when I went home, I realized that the electricians' and plumbers' work is very tough and it requires years of practice, one small mistake by them can have dangerous consequences (electric shock, flooding bathrooms, or flooding hallways, etc), they should be very smart at their work. Coming to me and my colleague, our work doesn't contribute anything to society, our work can be done by a 5th-class student with ease, all we have to do is, we have to see if the webpage has the expected values and click ""yes"" and next. It is unfair for us to think we have to earn higher than others just because we work in IT. I eventually learned programming and earned higher money but if given chance, even plumbers and electricians might get good at programming, who knows? 

I wrote this because, I see a lot of comments on Facebook,  Instagram, and Reddit saying that blue-collar workers are earning more, this is unfair, etc, etc. Instead of getting jealous of them, why can't you upskill? If you think you are underpaid, go and fight with your boss, why do you insult hardworking blue-collar workers? May be their job is important so they are getting paid more.",2024-02-05 15:31:30

1arz47q,Product based company but practices worse than Service Based.,"So i am currently working in a big PBC. What I noticed is that they don't follow general software making rules and procedure. 
Like there is no sprint planning..Daily standups are long, there is no timesheet filling. 
Add to that there is no development, testing, integration team. 
We got only one dev team and one testing team. Dev team has to write unit tests themselves. 

When I used to work in SBC, there was clear demarcation of responsibility. As dev team.. We didn't write test cases.. Our code had to to go through a lot before getting merged to main branch. Daily meeting never exceeded 20 mins.. Teams were small. 

While I agree that I was mostly idling in SBC as the project was super stable.. The PBC is behaving like a satrtup with no rules etc.

17g5e3s,Why companies need big team to build software? Isn't two or three engineers enough?,"I think a full stack web developer, an android developer and a ios developer are enough to build most of the software in three months like codecademy which is basically text editor running unit test, quora is basically saving an object containing question and answers, pinterest is simply a database with images, flipkart basically an eCommerce website which many have already built as a project for resume. They say, as users grow and scaling is difficult, but I can find many managed cloud services which many not handle millions of concurrent users but atleast they can handle few hundreds, which is the most case other top big companies.

But I also understand that there are big software like AWS, windows, sap, chrome are complex software, which need more developers.

I got this doubt as I started out as freelancer and doing project and as of now are simple static websites. I always thing what If I get a client who wants big software like custom eCommerce or billing software or mock test software? I know how to build they but then this thing pops in to my brain, that I a building a flipkart clone in three months, but flipkart has hundreds of software engineer working on just coding website. Even if they are coding, testing, fixing it professionally even then ten developers should be more than enough. You can find clones of billion dollar companies products on junior developer's resume or 15 hour YouTube tutorials.

**What am I missing?**

Edit: I see many negative answers, I asked a genuine question, maybe I should have posted this in r/NoStupidQuestions.

Edit 2: I agree that the question I asked questions the work of hundreds of developers at flipkart. But what I wanted to convey is, as  a freelancer, If someone can mimic in short period of time the core functionality of flipkart that is shopping products, can I as a freelancer build a custom ecommerce with just core functionality to shop products for a small business with having to build a team and pull it off? Or am I missing something that would force me to must have a team?  


Edit 3: So I copied and pasted the exact question in chatgpt and the good part is that it didn't judge me or my dumbness, but answered it elaborately. This can be considered as fun experiment where mostly I recieved negative answers but some positive answers which tried to explain the same thing as chatgpt's answer. So naturally I got this question in my mind.

**How would a human attachment evolve to a real human community where he receives answers with some judgments, and to a AI Chatbot where he mostly receives answers without judgments? Will a typical man prefer real humans answers over AI Generated answers on the cost of his emotions?**

ChatGPT Answer

>Your question touches on a common misconception about software development, especially among developers who are just starting out. While it's true that the basic functionality of websites and applications, like those of Codecademy, Quora, Pinterest, and Flipkart, could be built by a small team in a few months, the reality of developing such large-scale software is far more complex. Here are some of the critical aspects you might be missing:  
>  
>  
>  
>1. \*\*Software Complexity\*\*: Large-scale software like the ones you mentioned are not just about the primary functionality that they provide but also about the underlying complexities that come with scale \[Source 10\]([https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development](https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development)). This includes handling large amounts of data, managing multiple simultaneous users, ensuring high performance, and maintaining availability at any time. These complexities increase the time, effort, and skills required to build and maintain such software.  
>  
>2. \*\*Features and Enhancements\*\*: The initial version of the software might be simple, but as the product grows, new features and enhancements are continuously added to improve user experience and to stay competitive. This constant development requires a dedicated team of developers \[Source 10\]([https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development](https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development)).  
>  
>3. \*\*Testing and Quality Assurance\*\*: Large-scale software needs thorough testing to ensure that it works correctly and efficiently under various conditions. This requires a team of testers who work alongside developers to find and fix issues \[Source 0\]([https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/achieving-success-in-large-complex-software-projects](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/achieving-success-in-large-complex-software-projects)).  
>  
>4. \*\*Scalability and Performance\*\*: As the user base grows, the software must be able to scale and perform efficiently. This requires careful architecture and design decisions, as well as continuous monitoring and tweaking to handle increased loads \[Source 10\]([https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development](https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development)).  
>  
>5. \*\*Security\*\*: Large-scale software, especially those dealing with user data or financial transactions, must be secure. This requires a dedicated security team to ensure the software is secure from various threats \[Source 10\]([https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development](https://northell.design/blog/large-scale-software-development)).  
>  
>6. \*\*Maintenance and Support\*\*: Once the software is live, it needs regular maintenance and support to fix issues, handle user queries, and ensure smooth operation. This requires a dedicated support team \[Source 0\]([https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/achieving-success-in-large-complex-software-projects](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/achieving-success-in-large-complex-software-projects)).  
>  
>7. \*\*Integration and Compatibility\*\*: Large-scale software often needs to integrate with other systems and should be compatible with various devices and platforms. This adds another layer of complexity to the development process \[Source 7\]([https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/what-your-tips-managing-complex-software-development](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/what-your-tips-managing-complex-software-development)).  
>  
>  
>  
>To handle all the above aspects, companies like Flipkart have hundreds of software engineers working on just the website. While it's possible to build a simple version of such software with a small team in a few months, building and maintaining a large-scale, feature-rich, secure, and efficient software is a complex task that requires a large and diverse team of professionals.

Background/context:
I'm a 22-year-old B.Tech. (computer science) student studying in 3rd year at a Tier 3 college. I'm also pursuing an online B.S. degree (data science) from IIT Madras. Although I'm a full-stack dev, I'm currently working remotely as a front-end engineer at an international product-based company, making around 28 LPA in-hand/post-tax. Sounds too good for a person my age but I have 5+ years of work experience as a software engineer (8+ years including informal experience). The work culture at my current workplace is pretty fun and there's no work-related stress whatsoever. On a tight day, I work 3-4 hours a day.

Question:
Is it worth it for me to grind Leetcode to get into FAANG in India or abroad? DSA isn't really my strong suit and I'm only slightly above average at best.

Things to consider:
- Compensation
- Work culture
- Learning environment
- Growth
- Happiness

&#x200B;

This was a really long journey, that began months ago.

&#x200B;

It started with the most simple prompt of all: ""give me 20 great business ideas based on gpt wrappers""

&#x200B;

Once I settled on the idea, I followed with another simple prompt: ""help me brainstorm about how the product will look and what it will entail""

&#x200B;

After some back and forth, the idea was cemented.

&#x200B;

Then it's all about tech:

&#x200B;

""Help me plan the tech stack for the aforementioned product""

&#x200B;

""Outline the code I'll need, break it down into chunks for me""

&#x200B;

Then begin to implement, chunk by chunk. You'll need to ask GPT a lot ""how do I debug this?"" or ""write this with debug console log comments"" to help get through the inevitable bugs.

&#x200B;

Eventually you'll need to deploy (of course GPT helps with that too)

What's a 23 Yr old kid living in tier 2 city, with his rich parents gonna do with 70-80k per month. Those kids who have to take care of the entire family and have a few loans, for them it makes sense to ask for this kinda salary. 

Doesn't matter if they are from IIT or tier 3 college every young IT graduate directly wants 10-15 LPA, without even working in a proper team in a proper development project in a MNC. No matter how skilled they are, I'll highly doubt it can be compared to a skilled developer working full time in a proper development project in a MNC. 
Not just kids almost every IT/Tech person seems like they are only doing the job for money because most of the times that's what everyone talks about, (wo Rajesh ko dekha bas 1.5 yrs dot net exp Hai and he's getting 8 LPA, ma toh 2 Yrs exp hu muzay toh minimum 15-18 LPA chahiye). Even reddit developer sub is filled mostly with wanting higher salary posts.

My senior(tier 2 college) who has like approx 4 years of experience in advanced ML solutions, also doesn't have this kinda mindset that he should be asking 20-30 LPA, he's happy with what he's got, which is 18 LPA, which seems reasonable to him.

What is this/ what can it be called? .. Ego Or Attitude or Ambition?

I feel like I am thinking wrong, I have a wrong mindset, I too should have this mindset irrespective of my experience or skills or college and start asking any high LPA. 
I am currently in a small company with 3 years of experience in analytics(SQL, Power Bi, python, apache airflow) should I ask for 20-25 LPA when I switch?

Edit: not jealous, just trying to understand the mindset. I don't get that feeling of wanting more than I should get. I think something is wrong with me. Or maybe I am not ambitious enough. Idk.

17zrhy8,Saw this conspiracy theory on the internet that suggest OpenAI might have achieved AGI internally,"I stumbled upon this internet conspiracy theory suggesting OpenAI might have achieved AGI internally.

1. A comment from Sam Altman on this subreddit says, ""*AGI has been achieved internally (EDIT: obviously, this is just memeing; y'all have no chill! When AGI is achieved, it will not be announced with a Reddit comment...)*"".

2. Sam Altman's departure from OpenAI raises suspicions. There might be internal AGI achievement, leading to a conflict of interest between Sutskever and Altman regarding OpenAI & AGI's future.

3. Elon tweeted, ""I am very worried. Ilya has a good moral compass and does not seek power. He would not take such drastic action unless he felt it was absolutely necessary.""

4. Sam Altman & Greg Brockman teamed up with Microsoft to start their own AI company. Could it be that OpenAI achieved AGI internally, and Sam is running out of time, so he joined with MS to compete with OpenAI in the AGI race?

1as57s2,"Scaler alum here, sharing my unfiltered, no BS review of the course","Long time lurker, first time poster here. 

I‚Äôve seen questions about this course pop up a lot on this sub, and being an actual alum, I thought I‚Äôd share my two cents about why Scaler may or may not be for you. I‚Äôll discuss in detail what I liked or disliked during the 9+ months I spent doing the course. 

Quick disclaimer that this is just my personal opinion based on my own experiences with Scaler so take it with a grain of salt. 

A bit about my background: 
I switched from a service-based to a product-based company (hated my job and the work I did), but it wasn‚Äôt easy. Being a full time working professional, it became hard for me to learn from random online sources. There‚Äôs just too much information available online and I didn‚Äôt know where to even start. 
To get some help, I joined Scaler and would attend classes post-work from 9 pm to 1 am. On top of that, I also had to study and practice on my own. It got pretty exhausting and overwhelming after a bit. The result? I started neglecting my health a lot.  Stopped hanging out with family and friends. Realized that I would burn out if I continued like this. 
Took some time to realise that hustling for 20 hours a day is not the answer. You can say my story has a happy ending because I got into the company I wanted, but the struggle behind it is also just as real. 
After going through it all, here‚Äôs my take: 

The Pros

1. Helped organize my learning: The way I learned before was all over the place. This problem solved once I regularly started attending the classes. The curriculum covers everything from DSA to system design and web development. The sessions I included were live and interactive, and the instructors were good and experienced enough for the most part. There were a few things that could have been better here and there but nothing major. 

2. Good community support: One of the best things about the course is the community. It‚Äôs even better than the course itself. You get to meet with a lot of like-minded coders who are on the same path as you. You can ask questions, share doubts, exchange ideas, make friends. I made quite a few good ones who I still am in touch with. The community is very active and supportive and you will always find someone to help you out. 

3. Decent enough career support: You get assigned a mentor, who is usually a senior software engineer at some reputed company. My mentor was a SE at Amazon and later AI Startup. How a mentor works is by helping you with your doubts and giving real-time feedback (these are done in one on one sessions usually, arranged as per your need). They also help you with your resume, portfolio, and interview preparation, which includes mock interviews and feedback on your performance. The end result was me getting some great offers.


The Cons 

1. The course is long and demands time: Before you join a course like Scaler, PLEASE make sure you have enough time. It‚Äôs not a casual or easy course‚Ä¶it‚Äôs more like a 9 month-long marathon. If you join without fully committing, you will fall behind easily. So think twice before signing up. I made this error and was stuck for a long time attending classes from 9 PM - 1 AM post my working hours. 
2. It‚Äôs pricey: Scaler is not cheap lol. It costs around 2+ lakhs for the entire course, which is a lot of money for most of us. You have to pay upfront or in installments, and there is no refund policy after the grace period is over. So make sure you can afford it and that it‚Äôs worth it for you. 

3. Doesn‚Äôt guarantee success: Joining the course will sadly not guarantee you  good placements. It‚Äôs not a shortcut or a hack. Like any other course, it‚Äôs just a tool that can help you learn and prepare, but it‚Äôs not a substitute for your own hard work and dedication. YOU still have to put in the hours and the effort to master the skills and concepts. YOU still have to apply for jobs and do well at the interviews. YOU still have to face the competition and the challenges of the industry. Scaler can only guide you and support you, but it can‚Äôt do everything for you.

So take your time and talk to people who have been a part of such courses before you commit, and just take time to understand their experiences. Your mileage may depend on your background, goals, and expectations. Just do your proper research and you will be fine.

But my college work is too hard ! Talked to the seniors here, they said forget about coding in 1st semester, the coursework here is too hectic, I don't know about other colleges, but we have 9 to 5 classes and labs, in classes also, I am hardly able to understand anything, and then when I come home, i have to watch lectures on YT, same thing with my classmates as well

College is in my home city so I do updown on regular basis, approx 15km one side.

And believe me I am not giving excuses, but things are not going as good as I expected, and neither as bad as I expected (worst)

I have come to point where I have started thinking, not that why did I joined this college, but why did I selected engineering as my career option

Kya kya sapne dekhe the amazon me sde Microsoft me sde, sab next to impossible lag raha hain üò≠

Its not like I choose cs just for money, i dont even know basics of cse, but I was curious to know about it, how an app works, how a website works, how a multiplayer game is made,and still I want to learn different coding languages....

10kako0,The epidemic of mediocre profiles,"Spent nearly a month at my company trying to hire some engineers, primarily for web dev. We‚Äôve always had difficulty finding good engineers. We doubled down on this effort, brought in a recruiter and expanded our job posts across different mediums drastically. At the end of it all, 95% of all the people I came across were just average. They had the basics right - worked on some basic APIs, a frontend app, some dbms experience but that‚Äôs it. It was extremely rare to find someone who had done anything beyond that. All of that is fine if you‚Äôre just starting your career and trying to get a job. But these candidates had an average of 2 years of experience. What really irked me was their expectations in terms of salary. 30LPA was the average ask. My point is there is a massive pool of people vying for jobs but a very small fraction of that is competent and a much smaller fraction is creative and driven.",2023-01-24 17:18:05

14nox1m,It's tax season. This is how professionals earning more than 75LPA will save 12 lakhs in taxes legally.,"The following post is based on the research I have done to help clients who earn more than 75LPA as freelancers and remote workers. 

# Context:

Freelancers and remote workers earning professional income can file ITR under section 44ADA to declare 50% of their revenue as expense, thus avoid paying taxes on 50% of the income. However, the ceiling for 44ADA is 50 lakhs for last year, and 75 lakhs for this year, after which you will be required to declare actual profit earned, which in most of the cases is greater than 90%, as the freelancers usually operate as one man team or have one or two admin/tech staff at best.

&#x200B;

# Problem:

The issue with not being eligible for 44ADA is that the **tax payment** is more than two-fold when getting out of 44ADA, and it leads to either of the four scenarios:

1. The individual pays the greater taxes, however, it leaves a bad taste in mouth due to steep rise in taxes, sometimes offsetting the additional income, leading to a net loss.
2. The individuals resort to shady expenses like payments of salaries to relatives which puts him/her in a vulnerable position as the expenses are usually on the higher side compared to industry average and can be disallowed by the Income Tax Officer in case of assessment, leading to heavy interest and penalties.
3. They receive the payments directly in the bank accounts of their relatives, and file the taxes for them as freelancers and remote workers, while the contract with clients is only in the name of the original individual, leading to a situation of no justification if called out in income tax assessments and clubbing of income in the hands of original individual, and levy of interest and penalties.  

4. A combination of 1, 2 and 3

# Solution:

The solution is to understand the nuances of Indian taxation system and deploy a legal tax strategy wherever possible.

In such scenarios an individual, through carefully taken measures can start a private limited company to contract with the clients and become a contractor for the company himself/herself for a contractual income of less than 75LPA, thus not only continuing to enjoy the benefits of 44ADA, but also getting benefit of lower tax rate in case of companies.  


# Issues with the proposed solution:

Like with anything, it is easier said than done. Moreover, some issues are perceived rather than actual. Here are few issues when it comes to implementing the solution:

1. The income tax department may contest that the structure is merely a tax sham.
2. Income tax department may disallow payments made to you stating that the payments made are excessive in nature.
3. Transferring majority of the income to individual as contractor will be seen as red flag.
4. There is no GST on export of services, however, if you supply services to company as a contractor, you will have to start paying GST.
5. There will be a lot of additional compliance that will be needed to manage the private limited company.
6. The rest of the income will be locked in the company.

# Counters to the issues:

# The setup can be justified as non-tax scam. Private limited company leads to increased brand value across all the stakeholders like vendors, customers and employees, leading to better business opportunities, moreover, in order to prove that the same is not a tax scam, additional vital steps need to be taken with regards to documentation and formation of company. 

1. The payments will be disallowed only if they are excessive in nature as regards to what is paid by the company to unrelated parties and to rates prevalent in the open market. The same is emphasized in case law: Plaspack vs ITO where the assessee paid 24% interest rate on loans to related parties, however, same was allowed by ITAT as a valid expense.
2. There is no law preventing businesses from doing that. However I understand the concern that it may raise some eyebrows. Hence I quote the case law: CIT vs Oriental structures where the shareholders were withdrawing 98.47% of the revenue from the private limited company.
3. The GST an individual will charge on his/her invoices will have to be paid by the company at time of making payments to the individual. However, the company can claim refund of the GST paid or claim the same as Input tax while filing it's own GST returns, thus leading to a net zero GST effect.
4. **This is correct.** Hiring good experts for the same not only leads to minimum headaches for you as an individual but also leads to lesser issues throughout the journey.  

5. It is possible to take out the income from the company. In case of quick fund requirements, the company can extend a loan to you as individual, however, to withdraw cash permanently, you can distribute the income as dividend or increase your contractual income. I would also like to state here that money being locked in the company is not as bad of a thing. There is no investment a private limited company can not make that an individual can. A better mindset would be to think of the company as an additional bank account.

# Tl;dr

It is possible to legally save huge taxes by employing a solid tax structure with the help of an expert, which can contribute to your financial goals like early retirement, own house, going abroad and the like.

170fvch,WLB or better pay for a fresher?,"So I graduated in 2022. I work as a full stack dev in a startup (~300 employees) joined them as an intern in July'22 and got converted in Nov'22.  So my current CTC is around 7LPA (which is pretty low according to me) and now my appraisal time is coming up. My seniors say since you're performing well enough you can expect 30-40% appraisal. So in best scenario my CTC becomes 12LPA. Which is still low for me. 
It is a completely remote job with excellent work hours flexibility and a very very good working culture. I'm even liking the work but it is all JS based web dev work. I'm inclined towards Java based frameworks but it's fine. 

I've been surfing for jobs online and I noticed most of the better paying jobs are not remote. So my question is.. as a fresher should I focus on getting a better paying job but WFO and no surity that I'll like the culture or should settle for my current job with such good 'working' benefits?
Thanks in advance.",2023-10-05 11:46:46

Python has a function called `map()` that can help you reduce performing iteration stuff and avoid writing extra code.

I'm a non tech background person working in sales, have started learning python from few months now, wants to get into tech in future 

Now, I noticed in my gym there are around 100-150 subscribed people but the owner is still using a note book to track the payment.

So, thought I could built a real-life useful project which could do these things

- notify the owner and the gym guy maybe by sms or what's app that your payment is due on every month on particular date, according to the joining date.

- work as a data management or crm tool to save the details 

For now I would like to keep this simple.

WHAT I WANT FROM YOU GUYS

- A road map to build this tool.
- what would be the required languages or skills I should learn to build this.
- is there any cost occurrence for me in this?
- How long will this project takes?

116ol3a,Mark Zuckerberg is right about the Metaverse,"People have been calling out on him that he isn't doing the right thing by investing heavily in Metaverse. 

But i believe he is right, to understand this we have to know the target audience.

The target audience of Metaverse is currently in the age group of 3-10 and they'll be spending on Metaverse more than Zuckerberg is investing.

The reasons:

1. Let's start from the past, after the world had enough of wars, there was a time of love and peace. The countries who got freedom started their personal growth, they produced a working class generation where everyone was happy with their 9-5 and felt a responsibility to contribute to their country.

2. Their children had a safe and sound future, they didn't had the fear of dying at 19. They lost their grandparents in wars, their parents have enough to provide but as their parent's generation had a great trauma, they created a societal pressure of earning enough. But technology came and everything changed.

3. The children of the working class generation saw radios to neuralink in their lifetime. From exchanging love letters to swiping on tinder - they did both and they got a great exposure. But as there was abundance of everything, their struggles became different. Saving up money and generating wealth in this capitalist world is their dream. Their peers started the startup culture and motivated to become more of themselves. 

5. But the next generation who is the prime customer of Metaverse will have different struggles. They already have 2 lives from the time they start speaking, one online and one offline. There will be many who will fail to succeed at both of the segments. Some will have social anxiety and some will be living a digital life. Some may become better at public speaking but opening social media will be a nightmare. So what will happen? 

6. They will chose the place where they're more comfortable, either online or offline. I won't say that Metaverse will become necessary but as we classify business into traditional and digital. They'll classify their lives into these two.

And that's where Metaverse comes in, with years of experience and experiments. They'll provide services to the people who will choose to live their life digitally. Just like Visual studio code is for developers. Maybe just like Google is for everyone right now.",2023-02-19 21:32:19

zjmo0x,"Hi there! let's discuss database management systems (DBMS), what they are, and why they are important.","1. A database management system (DBMS) is a software application that is used to interact with other software and users to store, retrieve, and manage data in a database.

2. A DBMS allows users to create, read, update, and delete data in a database by providing a structured and organized way to store and retrieve data. This helps users to easily access, manipulate, and analyze data.

3. There are different types of DBMS, including relational, object-oriented, hierarchical, and network. Each type has its own unique features and is suited for different types of applications and data structures.

4. One of the key advantages of using a DBMS is that it allows users to access and manipulate data in a consistent and efficient manner. This helps to avoid data redundancy and inconsistency, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies in data.

5. Another advantage of using a DBMS is that it provides security features to protect data from unauthorized access and manipulation. This helps to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data, which is critical for many applications.

6. In conclusion, a DBMS is an essential tool for managing and accessing data in a database. It provides a structured and organized way to store and retrieve data, and offers many advantages, including data consistency and security.

Over the past week, with all the OpenAI drama, my Twitter feed was flooded with OpenAI employees' tweets. I couldn't help but notice there were a lot of French, British, Asian(excluding Indians) folks. But so few Indians (Indian-American- some of them, actually Indian- even few). This led me to search a lot on LinkedIn too. 

I know, they are very selective and it's very competitive to get a job at OpenAI. They mostly hire folks from top unis w/ PhDs but that isn't the norm. 

OpenAI ( and also Anthropic, and other AI research cos) are out there building genuinely interesting and revolutionary technologies. It got me wondering even though so many Indians go abroad to work and yet so few end up working on cutting edge tech. ( I would assume most chase FAANG title/ TC, etc).

I think am done with the HTML part as I have pretty much covered all the tags that are used commonly . Moved on with CSS. Understood combinators and inheritance. Done with basics of it too. Started with the box model and the display property. Seemed easy initially until I had to actually position the elements where I wanted to. I think I'll have to practice this one little bit more. Most of my time went in correcting a bug which I later got to know was due to a ""feature"" called margin collapsing.

It‚Äôs really frustrating ,"So, I recently started working as a DevOps engineer at an online shopping platform, and boy, let me tell you, it's been a rollercoaster ride already. The interview process was insanely hectic, and there were very few openings available. 

Here's the kicker: my senior doesn't seem to know much about what we're actually working with. We're using GCP and Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC), but they're clueless about even the basics. I'm talking about not knowing how a simple Cloud Build file is created or how it functions. 

In our meetings, it feels like we're discussing nonsense most of the time. They're adamant about creating our own Google Cloud logs because apparently, using Logs Explorer is too expensive. but then they stumble when it comes to knowing which machine types are suitable or understanding the differences between them. 

It's frustrating because there are countless talented, unemployed freshers out there who could bring so much more to the table. And don't even get me started on CI/CD pipelines ‚Äì they're a foreign concept to my senior.

I am currently in the my first semester and been following a lot of news , trends about the current Tech market . I try to learn from other people's experience and make sure I don't repeat what others have done.

&#x200B;

People on this subreddit are talking about the current recession trends, How most of them aren't able to get into a job / Internship, How people from WITCH companies are just receiving 3.75LPA, LAYOFFS happening everywhere, People being put into PIP etc.. 

I know that people are lot more vocal when something bad happens to them but this makes me a little worried , How could i survive in this market in the coming years?

There is a lot of stuff here which I can't make sense of like there are so many languages , frameworks, libraries, web stacks , databases and what not. As an 18 year this is overwhelming, I want to contribute  something, learn something while I grow old. I want to make decent when I establish my career.  


What I want to know is , What should I do from now on so that I don't have to face a lot of trouble in the future after completing my degree?

* 3-6: 7 to 10 LPA 
* Above 7 years: 10 LPA to 18 LPA

The OP tells that the pay scale doesn't change that much in 20 years, so it's okay just to copy-paste.

v0v9oe,how to become a software developer without a BTech degree in India?," 

I am a 19-year-old.(india). my parents are well-off(economically).  
will join the college in 2022 and want to get financially independent as soon as possible.  
I am interested in politics, geopolitics, and history. (but not sure if it is just an attraction or a real passion). (i have never read any book on these just I watch youtube videos and all)  
but I am not sure of the economic feasibility of my decision to study these subjects in college.

My mind says to do a BTech cse and acquire skills and get a good job and then do whatever study I want to do.(i may not be able to make it to IIT or nit as I am not interested in PCM)(though I am also interested in coding, software, and cybersecurity .) (but not sure if it is just an attraction or a real passion)

Is it possible to become a software engineer in India without going to college or doing BTech that is just by acquiring skills for 2 to 3 years(rather than doing BTech as you even have to attend classes and cannot focus fully on skills required for getting a job)?

I also do not want to stay at home, for the past 2 years(12th + drop year I am at home with no one to talk to about important things, lost all my friends in the past 2 years after covid came( i consciously choose to do so). and also have become very indisciplined.

116xujb,UNPOPULAR OPINION : People (esp. Freshers) who dream of working at FAANG are not unreasonable.,"Its become a trend to smash down on people who express the desire to work at FAANG these days. A fresher friend of mine got called ""FAANG ka 14"" the other day for casually mentioning that he's looking for someone to refer him at Amazon after they start hiring again. 

Think of it - Your job is probably the strongest social definition of you that you'll ever have. Us humans, we are quick to judge people based on what they do for a living. And there's no doubt that telling your family, friends and acquaintances that you ""Work as a Software Engineer at Amazon"" comes with a certain prestige. 

The argument that ""There's better work places who will pay you better than FAANG"" is certainly true but it only makes sense on paper. Nobody wants to work at FAANG only because it pays well. The biggest perk is actually the implications that come with it. FAANG is what it is because it comprises of literally the most popular and wealthiest brands on planet Earth. There's not a single person who somehow does not make use of a product which is produced by a FAANG company. iPhones, Windows OS, YouTube, Netflix, Instagram, Facebook, etc. are some of the products that have literally defined the 21st century lifestyle. Imagine a life without Google Search. Imagine if Amazon did not bring about the E-commerce revolution. 

People are attracted to FAANG because they (subconsciously at least)  want to be a part of that legacy. They want to work at the company that produces their favourite products and there's nothing wrong with that. 

And either way, working at a FAANG is also going to be a huge bright shining star on your Resume. Just the mention of Microsoft or Apple or Google or Amazon is enough to at least get you inside the door for an interview, ANYWHERE, WORLDWIDE. And thats because EVERY person who hasn't been living under a rock for the past 20 years is well aware of all these companies. Heck, even if you DON'T end up landing a job at a FAANG, you will still end up at a great place after the kind of preparation that FAANG interviews require you to do. Knowing DSA does help quite a bit when you want to write efficient code, even during Development.

So for those of you who are dreaming of working at Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc. please march forward. Your dream is very reasonable and makes complete sense. At least for a short term. Dont make it your life goal, of course.

16wcog5,[JEENEETards.com] I created a website 1 month back and it had already reached 10K+ MAU benchmark. Reached Google Page 1 search results.

I have received a buyout offer from a new ed-tech startup but passed the offer as the amount was too low. Will keep developing my product (literally 0 effort was made on product till date, all went into marketing).

t4csb2,Don't just run after money. Decide on your future based on multiple factors.,"I have never posted on this sub but I've noticed a lot of posts here involve ""get into FAANG"" or ""shift for a good increment"".   

A little bit of background, I am an ML & Infrastructure Engineer who has about 5 years of experience. Straight out of college I got into LinkedIn with their data insights team. I worked there for 2 years with a pretty decent salary. I shifted to Amazon and I was making over 45 LPA (including bonuses) in my third year but i was never satisfied with what I was doing because I never got to work on things that I find are rewarding (Google is probably the most free company in FAANG when it comes to doing what you want as you can pick up personal projects and pitch them directly to management and do them using company's resources if it doesn't affect your performance. But in reality, most of the pitches are never accepted if there's no profit for the company).   

Later I shifted to an early stage startup, the work life was a little bit more hectic but i was able to work on things I like. The work domain coincided with my likings and my teammates were super friendly and the manager was very helpful. It was just a team of 15 people but I really enjoyed my time there and was able to see a real impact on my performance with a nurturing environment.  

It's been almost 2 years with the same company and I still enjoy working here. The team has increased quite a lot but it's still the same carefree culture that I have always loved. I am making less than what I was making during my job at Amazon if we count the bonuses but i feel like this has been the best decision of my life.  

All I wanna say is don't look at the money and accept jobs blindly. Do some research about the kind of work you'll be doing and see if it aligns with your interests. Job satisfaction is a big factor along with seeing your contribution actually making a difference (it helps with imposter syndrome as well which is super common but no one addresses it).   

Stay safe and treat your interests at the same level (if not higher) than the CTC on your offer letter.",2022-03-01 17:08:16

&#x200B;

Why do I see so many people defending the the dev  who applied?  
I mean isn't it a basic knowledge for someone who worked in python to now how venv or git works? How is such a  person supposed in a coordinated coding environment? It is one of the most basic things a not only a python dev but anyone who has been coding for more than a few months should be comfortable with, let alone not knowing about it. Its like knowing how to code but not knowing how the code works. Would you trust yourself with a surgeon who doesn't know about paracetamol because that's ""just not his field""?  
I saw many people saying in the comments saying he can learn that in 1 or 2 hours. If so he should have learnt it two hours before the interview. You don't know a person's future, you can only judge on what they bring to the table at this moment.

yauvx4,What to specialize in for my first job as a Software Engineer?,"# What to specialize in for my first job as a Software Engineer?

**Overall plan:**

I want to first work for a company while gaining experience and then change to freelancing remotely when I'm more experienced. Whenever I get an entrepreneurial idea, I would like to execute that idea (being a Software entrepreneur is my ultimate goal).

&#x200B;

**The thing I specialize in should ideally help me with all three things:**

1. Job in a company using the niche (ideally remotely... Or is it too hard getting a remote job as an entry-level position?)
2. Highly paid freelancing niche (So I have money to spend while executing the next software entrepreneur idea)
3. Developing apps as a Software entrepreneur (I think most of my ideas will be Web apps or mobile apps, maybe involving machine learning)

&#x200B;

So which thing can I specialize in for my first job that I can later specialize in when freelancing remotely and that is also useful as a Software entrepreneur (most likely web apps and mobile apps).

&#x200B;

**I'm interested in these things:**

* Webapps and mobile (mostly because most of my entrepreneur ideas are web apps or mobile apps)
* Machine Learning
* UI/UX/Psychology
* Music 

&#x200B;

I don't know if I want to specialize in front-end, back-end, or both (full-stack). 

Should I start out with front-end because it's easier and then later switch to back-end to see what I prefer? Then if I prefer front-end I could get some UI/UX skills and specialize as a front-end UI/UX Developer? If I prefer back-end I could get some machine learning skills and specialize as a backend machine learning engineer?

I'm considering specializing in Flutter or React Native because I only have to learn one thing I can use for Android, iPhone, and web apps.

Maybe I should start out in a big company because they can invest more in people who have just graduated?

&#x200B;

**So to sum up everything I have these questions:**

1. Should I specialize in front-end (maybe with UI/UX), back-end (maybe with machine learning), or full-stack as my first job, if I don't know which I would prefer? (Ideally, it should be useful for getting a remote job in a company, a highly paid freelancing niche, AND useful for creating web/mobile apps as an entrepreneur).
2. Is it a good idea to specialize in React Native or Flutter, so I can make web AND mobile apps with one technology? Or should I specialize in something else?
3. Will aiming for a remote job be too ambitious for a newly graduated software engineer entry-level position?
4. Is it best to aim for a big company, because they have more resources to invest in newly graduated software engineers?",2022-10-22 18:25:51

17xx59j,Why humans are so afraid of relentless innovation?,"Sam got fired, even after revolutionizing how humans will essentially think and work. As was expected, Greg Brockman, the guy behind the enormous scale of OAI's products and infrastructure, also left. It seems like the safety advocates won. It's a bit sad that they had to let go of Sam and Greg, who were the forces behind what OAI had achieved. Bringing such an amazing product to production and scaling it to what it is today is sheer brilliance.

Given how the board of OAI is structured, it looks like Ilya Sutskever (Chief Scientist) must have voted for Sam's firing (the board consisted of Greg, Sam, Ilya, Adam D'Angelo, Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner). Ilya was leading the superalignment division, and I feel that suddenly firing Sam was due to how Sam's approach towards delivering cutting-edge products to people might have misaligned with Ilya's position on prioritizing safety.

Considering the massive outages that OAI faced recently, and their complete halt on the Plus subscription, it could have been the case that Sam was pushing too hard. But that's what it takes to stand apart; you cannot just stand in a corner and wait for everything to be perfect. It requires a relentless approach to seek what's impossible.

It's early to take sides, but from what it is today, I am completely on the side of what Sam and Greg wanted to achieve: AGI that helps exceed what humans can achieve. I'm just hoping they won't dumb down GPT-4.

Finally, a big thanks to Sam and Greg for what they have built. I hope this is a delta moment where they come together and create something that exceeds what OAI is today. Also, I'm looking forward to Grok; it seems promising, given what they have done in such a short time.

Let innovation be relentless in every aspect; it's the essence of humanity.

The modes are there for a reason. There are there to aid your visual experience. If you use dark mode in a well lit room, you are literally straining your eyes more.   


* If room is well lit - use light mode.
* If room is dark - use dark mode.

I am ready and willing to seize any opportunity that comes my way, to work tirelessly toward building a future that aligns with my aspirations and ambitions. All I need is a chance‚Äîa chance to turn my dreams into reality. threw another curveball my way when I was struck by a car while crossing the road, leaving me with a painful back injury.

For many, such setbacks might seem like mere bumps in the road. But for me, they shattered the carefully laid plans for my career. Having left my previous job in anticipation of further studies, I found myself at a crossroads with no clear path forward. Forced to take a hiatus to tend to my health and sort through the aftermath of the accident, I felt my dreams slipping away.

After a grueling recovery period, I found myself back on my feet, albeit with a renewed sense of determination. Despite the setback, I refused to let go of my passion for data science‚Äîa field I had intended to master abroad. Instead of succumbing to despair, I seized the opportunity to enroll in private classes in Mumbai, delving deeper into the intricacies of data science and honing my skills in algorithms and analytics.

Yet, despite my efforts to upskill and reinvigorate my career prospects, the elusive job offer remained out of reach. The endless cycle of job applications through portals like Naukri, Monster, Indeed, and LinkedIn yielded little more than automated responses and dead ends. The promise of opportunity often turned out to be nothing more than a deluge of scam calls and false hopes, leaving me disillusioned and disheartened.

Through it all, my family stood by me unwaveringly, offering their support and encouragement. Their belief in my abilities provided a glimmer of hope amidst the darkness of uncertainty. But as I approach my 27th year, the pressure to secure stable employment weighs heavily on me. While some may see my predicament as a minor setback, the reality is that each passing day spent in limbo feels like a monumental loss.

Despite the setbacks and disappointments, my resolve remains unshaken. I refuse to compromise on my dreams or settle for anything less than a fulfilling career in the IT sector. With a solid educational background‚Äîa three-year diploma followed by a three-year degree in IT‚ÄîI am determined to carve out my place in the industry that has been my passion for years.

To anyone reading this, I extend a plea for assistance, not in the form of monetary aid, but in the form of opportunity. I am willing to go above and beyond, to learn and adapt to any role or expectation. All I ask for is a chance to prove myself, to reclaim the sense of purpose that has eluded me for so long. A job offer would not just be a means to an end but a lifeline, pulling me out of the depths of uncertainty and despair.

If you have the power to offer that lifeline, know that your assistance would not go unappreciated. I am ready and willing to seize any opportunity that comes my way, to work tirelessly towards building a future that aligns with my aspirations and ambitions.

I  basically have about 6 to 7 months for University.
I want to prepare well for uni so that I don't struggle to cope after i start classes.

Please forgive me for my ignorance but what exactly does a computer science engineer do ?

What skills do cs engineers possess that make them employable?

What subjects are important among the core cs subjects?

What programming languages should i learn ?

What are the different domains in which engineers work?

I asked some of my family and friends the same and all of the advice theyve given me is overwhelming and incredibly confusing not to mention contradictory too.

Apparently,  an engineer could be a front-end Dev,  backend Dev, full stack Dev, application Dev, cybersecurity, data analytics,  ai and ml , SDE , SWE, Devops engineers,,   web developer, game developer, security developer,  SAP security consultant, AR Dev, Blockchain Dev, quality assurance engineer...etc 

The sheer volume of information available is making me want to crawl into a cave and never come back.

The most common one  SDE , SWE.  what does a software development engineer do ?
What does he learn? What does he work on and work with(programming languages)?

Also programming languages off the top of my head

C, C++,JAVA , PYTHON, SQL ,MYSQL,  PHP, RUBY , HTML, CSS JAVAscript , MATLAB, NOSQL, RUST, C# , TYPESCRIPT, SAP SECURITY , R , GO , kotlin , swift etc 

what are these languages? What is each one used for ?  What do you reccomend i learn ?

Which domain do you think will have the best opportunities in the next 10 20 years ? What will be all the rage in the coming future?

Everyone I asked gave me one common piece of advice.
That was to explore , find out what you like , practice , do projects, internships and look for jobs . And also DSA. Is DSA the only thing that matters for all domains?
Advice taken but how do I explore ? What do I explore ? How do I get into doing projects that hold value? 

If  you have any  advice for me about this or anything else in general please help me out.

I would be eternally grateful for your advice. Please please help me figure what on earth I should be doing.

DM me if you are not comfortable commenting under the post.

If I should post this in a different subreddit please let me know.

rlx78g,Am I doing it wrong?,"So im a fresher a tier 1.5ish college (mechanical but have high hopes of changing branch to CS/IT coz of legit interest) so I know basic C++ like loops and arrays only.

I'm self learning C++ and Java but I have a doubt which is:

is it bad for first timers to look a coding question solution? Like even for a basic factorial program and Fibonacci series program, I couldn't code it completely. I was close enough everytime but I had to look on the internet. I am worried if I am not able to do these basic programs all by myself then how the fuck will I do good in future?

On the other hand, I also think like -- ""Okay its okay coz I know just the syntax, to develop problem solving skills, I will have to see first how to write code by seeing the solution, that's how I will learn"" 

&#x200B;

How to find the balance between the two? is it right to first see how the questions are done and then try newer questions (what im worried is that i might accidentally ""memorise"" the solution of a particular kind of problem and that will lead to 0% usage of my brain and 100% usage of memory abilities)?

1304nk3,Could r/developersIndia please stop propagating the state prejudice against Telugu-speaking states?,"Recently, I came across a post on this sub calling a fresher an ""Idiot"" and a ""Village girl"" for not keeping up with OP's expectations. Both the post and the traction it gained are alarming. This post subtly brings a regional aspect into the discussion. OP could have very well stopped after saying that the fresher's English skills are sub-par. The point, OP was trying to make reached us i.e. lack of communication skills. But no, OP had to bring the Telugu aspect into this? Could you tell me why this is not an attempt at stereotyping? How is the fact that she is a Telugu girl helping the discussion other than propagating an insidious narrative?

As if this is not enough, calling her village girl in every other comment as if it is an insult. Since when did being from a rural area become an insult? I don't know but how about showing some empathy towards poor unprivileged people building their life? These posts are not only useless but also harmful as they deviate the discussion from improving the interview process to profiling Telugu people. Can we collectively start calling out the attempts at subtle attacks like this on certain regional and linguistic groups in this sub?

The Telugu-speaking states have a massive population of 14 crores, and the odds of finding a dumb guy in this population are no more than the odds of finding a genius. So stop generalising a region. This is not a one-off discussion and there was a similar post last month and occasional comments that pop up now and then. I am coming across these posts with increasing frequency.

1bbbhrt,"As requested, write up on my blazingly fast fintech project.","In my previous posts, I was getting a lot of comments regarding how I did it and what do I do etc.  I will try to share my experience but I can't share my code as I don't want to link my Github to my Reddit. I want this post to be easy to understand so I will skip the details of fintech and try to write about things that are applicable everywhere.

Tech stack used : C++, C, Lua, RapidJson, Cmake, libcurl and my beloved text editor NeoVim. I wish if I could use Rust but I had old code written in C++ so I had to continue using it.

My software works on Windows XP(after selecting few compiler flags), Android, Linux. I haven't yet tested with Windows and Mac but most likely it will.

My aim was to make a blazingly fast, cross platform tool that will fetch past financial data, do some magic to it and return result in a machine readable format. I initially choose INI and wrote my own INI parser using PCRE regex but it became tedious as the project grew. So I decided to ditch INI in favor of RapidJson. It was a right decision as it's really rapid as it's name says so. The speed was increased by almost **twenty five times.**

Another bottleneck I noticed that the `std::cout` was too slow. I could use `printf` but then my code base wouldn't be a C++ project anymore so I dropped that idea. I wasn't using much C++ features anyways due to performance and compatibility issues.  So I just leaved it as is and came up with idea of using buffers to store dara and print it all at once. Here is a pseudo code implementation:

    data = data.append(""xyz\n"");

So that's pretty much it for this post. I will probably make a part two in which I will cover how I integrated Lua, did some more optimizations, fiddled with third party libraries and Cmake.

18vdp3w,"US or India, where should we live ?"," Every day i am seeing tons of posts either sucking off the West or sucking off Indian saying X is better than Y, either hating on india or vice versa. The real answer is nuanced but basically boils down to your priorities and how rich you are.

The US/Any Western country has a high quality-of-life economy wise meaning the worst-case scenario if you lose your job there and have tons of debt, you will be still leading a life similar to a middle-class working indian. But people who can afford to go to the US are already an upper middle class in India (basically rich compared to 90% of Indian population), for them the question would be would you rather be a king of a small country or minister of a huge country i.e having $100k in India or having $100k US. $100k in India means you can now afford a mansion, own a lot of land, laborer etc while in the US it just puts you in the middle class there.

There are lot of people in this sub spouting bullshit like ""Bro you can easily bag a $200k offer in US, just go there"". Please shut up and check subs like [r/csMajors](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/) where actual Americans reside, you can see there are struggling to get jobs for even around $80k. Any realistic way of even getting such an offer would be to take masters in Ivy League which then you will be riddled with student debts, but if you are lucky enough a company will hire where they will help to wipe off half your debt. Check [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi/) for average realistic package you will get in US. If you are think along the lines, i am a immigrant so i will have more chances to get hired due to diversity then check this [leaked meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrfVIbXKqtg) from IBM CEO where he claims ""Asians"" are an overrepresented minority and are not considered diverse hires.(Fun fact He is from tamil nadu).

i got lazy to type the last paragraph, i was going to weigh pros and cons of taking masters in indian and in US where US is much riskier. But the fact your standard of living is tied to your income, if you are rich 90% of problems wont affect ypu. But its better to be poor in US than in India, but point being answer becomes nuanced if you are rich",2023-12-31 18:22:35

The company I work at a tech consultancy proficient in providing cloud solutions and is still a start-up having around 40 employees, I joined at < 10. I graduated in 2022 with B.E. in CSE but had around 5 backlogs in the first 2 sems only, because of which I was not getting accepted in a good university abroad. And I didn't want to go to a local college which can't really provide value to the fees I would pay. So decided to work in India. 


I've around 2 YOE working with mostly backend systems using Nodejs. I've worked heavily with both JavaScript and TypeScript. Pretty good with MySQL/DynamoDB/RDS/MongoDB/PostgresQL. I now work with totally AWS infrastructure. Have very good grasp over serverless architecture, serverless framework, AWS CloudFormation, SQS, Lambda, API Gateway, proficient with writing CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and GitLab too. So, I mostly work with backend and recently getting heavily involved into system design as well. My experience varies with working in Retailer/E-commerce/On-Field and Fintech sectors.


But, I really wanna move to a foreign country mostly because of the atmosphere, independence and finance. I don't have any bias towards which country to move to. USA is a priority(ah I don't think I'd be able to make it), Canada, Australia, New Zealand, any europian country with good software engineering culture would work for me.

171xpe5,How hard is it get and internship in big tech companies OffCampus," I am currently a first-year student at a Tier 3 college and I'm eager to secure an internship with a major tech company. Since big tech companies typically do not visit Tier 3 colleges for campus interviews, I understand that I will need to pursue off-campus opportunities.

I've noticed that many successful individuals I've seen on platforms like YouTube and social media come from prestigious institutions like IIT, and they often secure internships through campus placements.  I have a few questions:

1. Is it particularly challenging to secure internships with big tech companies when you're not from a top-tier institution?
2. I'm actively learning web development through The Odin Project. How good should my web development skills be before applying for internships?
3. What are the key elements I should focus on to make my resume stand out to potential employers?

wg32cf,Help me make a better decision to get into FAAMG,"I want to work at FAAMG and similar big tech companies. The motivation is money, career growth and learning, prestige and once you are ex faamg, you can mostly hear back from other companies as your resume will have these companies in it.

I am currently at the end of third year of a 4 year bachelor's degree in information science and engineering (practically CS but 2 subject change in 6th semester) in a no name college. Also I didn't learnt much from college as most prof. Either don't know the subject or don't know how to teach. Also due to covid and online classes, I didn't learned much. Also I'm not surrounded by great people, I mean people who are serious about this stuff, my peers mostly want to just get a job, that's it. I'm also not in the bad company, just neutral. So I'm kinda alone in this journey.

So I'm basically a self taught engineering student and know C, C++ and Python. I am a quick learner and passionate and curious about my domain (CS). I've solved around 100 leetcode questions, mostly easy ones. My strongest language is C++ although I'm also practicing with python as I'm planning to use it in interviews. Coming to DSA which is crucial for these interviews, I don't know it and I am working on it. I'd like to think I'm intelligent (at least not much dumb), a fast learner and willing to put in the work.

I have one year to finish the degree and have 2 options.

1. Get a job in tech and then prepare for FAAMG while working. The first part, getting a job is easy at service based companies or even in small startups. But the pay isn't great, so only motivation to work there is not to be unemployed and to learn and get experience.

2. Persue a master's degree in a decent college.
My current college and university is not practical e.g. we have to do 1 internship for the sake of certificate and the uni only allows 1 month time period. Most internships ranges from 3 to 6 months. So I'm planning to get my master's at xyz uni, and so I get an additional 2 years time to prepare. I am networking with people mainly through LinkedIn and the plan is to get a referral, and do well on the interview, get the internship at FAAMG, and work my ass off to get the return offer. This xyz uni's bachelor degree is great, as most undergrads get offers from Microsoft, Google, Apple etc but I'm not so sure about it's master's program. I have chatted with students from both programs and from personal experience, I believe masters program is not so good as compared to bachelor's. So the only reason to get a master's degree is to take a chance and try to get the job via the internship route which is relatively easier compared to full time positions interviews. Another reason is to have a master's degree in my resume, but it doesn't matter much as skills are important.

I am also not financially great and I already have taken loan for my bachelor's so I will end up in more debt if I try for master's, although getting that offer justifies the investment.

I'm not so sure which path I should take, I know there's no right or wrong path and it's not the end of the world but any edge I can get, I need it.
I've nothing going on for me, no big name school, not from a rich background, no great achievements, just a normal individual and I have people who look upto me. Also, I don't have a great resume at the moment as I'm not much interested in building projects as I enjoy problem solving. I do have a decent GPA btw.

So any suggestions, advice, insights and experiences would be greatly appreciated.  I believe it would help me make an informed decision.
Also, please don't comment something like there are better companies out there, or money isn't everything. It might be true, but I believe that it largely depends on one's individual experiences and perspective. I know what I want to do, to work at FAAMG and and any information about the same or anything you want to add or correct, feel free to do so.

I apologise for the long questions but I want to convey things properly with clarity so that you can better understand my situation.",2022-08-04 14:45:06
vlctwd,About the life - a function of time,"&#x200B;

Life is a function about time, i prepare it like:

    life(time):-deathtime(time).
    life(moment):-life(moment)

But life is not stateless it is statefull:

    life(time,state):-deathtime(time),toanswer(state).
    life(time,state):-newtime,newstate=moment(time,sate),life(newtime,newstate).

And what life to return? Is there metafunction on it? On what that returns to couple?

    foreach(life in alllifes) do universe(0,life);
    universe(time,life):-life(time),newtime=inc(time),universe(newtime,life).

Function universe() executes all life's in parallel:

    universe(alltime):-
      foreach(life in lifes) do life(alltime),newtime=inc(alltime),universe(newtime).

For which life Universe can't forget:

    toanswer(state.capital>1$mln);
    toanswer(state.age>100);
    toanswer(state.followers>X);
    toanswer(state.carma is maximum).

But all life interfered and have common factors, like wars and others:

I'm not satisfied with myself and I don't believe I have actually realized my true potential, until now. I
I geeked out during my undergrad, I loved every bit of it, but unfortunately pure sciences do not pay.

I got exposed to compsci stuff about a year ago and I believe the geek in me has woken again, because of these reasons -

1) Software pays well. (I'm not desperate to enter the tech world but I really want to)

2) I am fairly confident I could do it because I have got the basic hang of HTML, CSS in the past month. I'm spending more time at Javascript at the moment - In another month or so, I believe I can have a basic one page website up and running. 


I believe I have a knack for it but I also know learning compsci concepts will take time - I have started reading up on basic stuff, probably half hour everyday and I realise I like this stuff intuitively. I don't feel myself getting forced to read it and feeling burnt out at the end of it. 

My question to you guys -

1) How realistic is my belief that I would land a dev role, if I have my concepts straight and have a good hang on a certain tech stack? 

2) I see on YT - guys making good websites and earning $50k in a remote role ---> How realistic is this? 

3) Can I get my foot in the door (thru frontend dev I guess!?), given that I have a MSc degree and a MBA? (not interested in PM role )

159van2,I made LeetBuddy chrome extension to help during interviews,"Hey fellow developers!

I wanted to share with you a chrome extension that I have made - [**LeetBuddy!**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gjbogplpdlgmojginmempnicbpbledkn) üåü

If you're someone like me who needs a helping hand in tackling complex problems during interviews, this extension might just be your new best friend.

You can find it on the Chrome Web Store here: [**LeetBuddy Chrome Extension**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gjbogplpdlgmojginmempnicbpbledkn)

**What is LeetBuddy?**

LeetBuddy is an extension that detects coding problems in your browser and returns an optimal solution for it.

**How does it work?**

Once you've installed LeetBuddy, simply navigate to any problem statement or coding challenge online. With a quick click of the extension, you'll receive a concise and efficient solution to the problem.

&#x200B;

[Leetbuddy extension in action](https://i.redd.it/0wt19jwyh8eb1.gif)

&#x200B;

**Why should you try LeetBuddy?**

1. **Save yourself in an interview**: We have all been there. Practiced hundreds of problems and yet, can't figure out the solution under the artificial pressure of an interview. Wouldn't it be great to quickly look up the solution when stuck? üöÄ
2. **Tells you everything about the problem:** Algorithm, code and time complexity, all included.
3. **Works everywhere**: It works not only on [Leetcode.com](https://Leetcode.com) but also on hackerrank, coderpad, even google drive.üöÄ üöÄ
4. **All programming languages:** It works for all programming languages. üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

&#x200B;

One thing to note is that while this extension has a paid subscription, you can try it out for free in the beginning. The reason for the cheap paid subscription ($1.99/year) is to maintain my server costs as I am trying to make the solutions very precise.

&#x200B;

**Feedback Matters!**

I have been working in the industry for over 10 years and I firmly believe that the days of memorized leetcode patterns are over. Much like no one needs to remember how to find the square root of 845634253465, I believe no one should need to remember every algorithm. So, I made this to assist myself in coding interviews.  I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences with it.

If you decide to give it a try, please take a moment to leave a review on the [**Chrome Web Store**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leetbuddy/gjbogplpdlgmojginmempnicbpbledkn)**.** And the website is [leetbuddy.dev](https://www.leetbuddy.dev). 

Happy coding, and may the bugs be forever in your favor! üêûüíª

Reference: [This comment on a post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/12t7jqo/comment/jh1hvsi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

A little background: I have highest respect to all genders. I once attended an interview in a service based company that sounds similar to accupuncture. Interviewer grills me for 4 rounds, I answer every freaking question, visibly accepting his defeat, interviewer says he will get back to me. My friend (F) goes to the same interview, accepts that she doesn't know anything, gets the job with a decent salary hike.  


Three years later, I am working in a product based company where they have to replace my team lead who has dropped his papers. I have put in my 100% so I apply to this position and the HR calls me to their cabin and they say that they are looking for a female for this position.   


So long story short, aren't we doing the same mistake in reverse here? Men oppressed women and we didn't take skill set and knowledge into consideration so now let's do it in reverse? Am I the only one who has faced this?",2023-04-21 04:56:31

quec7n,"Is ""code with harry"" java playlist complete or Should I go with ""Kunal kushwaha""?","I am a mechanical engineering graduate who passed out in 2018 from an average institute. After working 1.5 years in a low-paying job and sitting at home for 1.5 years trying to crack government exams but couldn't do it so I decided to switch to software due to several reasons, one of them was parental pressure as they wanted me to do an MBA from amity(global distance course) and I knew I am not fit for MBA(reviews were also really bad) so had to choose this option as I knew I would just waste more money as I did after graduating from a private college.

Recently 1 month ago I joined a coaching institute and gave 1 lac fees for java with web development course but the thing is that I am not able to understand java and the course is going really really fast and I am not able to catch up. So after searching I came to know about Code with harry and saw that he has good videos so I just wanted to know if he has all the topics completed and if after completing his playlist can I attempt questions and solve them. Also. there is not much time with me like I have 3 weeks and after that, some other language will start in the course and that's why I need to catch up fast. Also, they said that they will provide placements after 5 months and that's the duration of the program FYI.

So, should I go with Harry's playlist or some other resource? I also came to know about some Kunal kushwaha DSA java series but I am not really sure with whom I should go. Also, I think this is the last investment from my parent's side on me after this I don't even know what am I going to do if I will not be able to cope with the course.

12cq0z2,I NEED SERIOUS ADVICE (AS 12TH PASS OUT),"Seeking Advice: Choosing between Dropping a Year for JEE Preparation or Pursuing Programming Skills in Private College.

I'VE  completed my 12th and I have to join college in few months , I have 2 options for myself.

\-1) take drop year and try for jee(mains) again.

\-2) or join a private 3-4 tier college (where I dont have attendence issue) and work on my programming skills.

&#x200B;

option 1)  :-

 PROs : it is less risky for carrer and job .I already have been preaparing for jee , I can say 50% syllabus is done and this year I got 75percentile .

 cons : it requires doing chemistry and maths for hrs. and honestly I dont have genuine interest in these subjects. this year jee was on my priority and from my experience  , I've always found my self slipping into procastination even though I know how much this is important to my future. there never been a day where I wake up and I am not worried about what I have to study still not getting enough done. I feel like this is something which is not for me , I wanted to do it for the outcome it has and couldnt achieve it because I never had genuine interest in the subjects it require. and let this year (which I consider as failure) be a lesson that I should puruse things where I have interest.



option 2)-

 PROS: I'M INTERESTED. unlike pcm everytime I've made effort in this direction I've gotten things done as much as I have expected . 

(*if u want to know how much I have achieved*  ) -> I started with gameDev in class 9 then I switched to learning a language , learned c# from a book in 10th ,in 11th I tried DSA from udemy (abdul bari's (if u know)) I was able to understand recursion and even backtracing was making sense(I traced the program myself) but due midterms I had to leave it and then I started for jee.

&#x200B;

cons: I might struggle for getting decent job as I will not have college placement. and every depressing post on this sub makes me think I might end up like so many other people who have enough skills but still not getting anywhere.

&#x200B;

According to my experience :

what I have realised is that I might have ADHD or something, that I cannot learn to learn something because its important for me , and believe me-I have spent 1.5 year in the preparation and also I have maintained a journal for accountability  to say  this . programming is atleast something which my brain has allowed me to do, where I dont slip to procastination, where I am not anxious If I will be able to complete this topic today or not .

and then I have this second thought which prevents me from making this decision - if I am passionate abt doing programming then  I can also do it a year later also (being 1 year late to this thing will not be a big deal) but this is the only year where I have option to take drop and join college (where I can have some other meaningful things  to experience) otherwise  I would be only coding in my room  without the chance of having any meaningful experience.",2023-04-05 16:35:12

I have just started DSA. I used to excel at coding (the level of problems taught in my college, TIET, Patiala) in sem 1 and 2. Then things went straight up downhill, I just lost my edge.

Didn't practice, screwed up my Coding skills, messed up my DS and DAA grades. A horror show.

There are reasons for that but those roads are better left uncharted.

I am familiar enough with C++, a little rusty in OOPs but trying to redress this lack. 

I can be considered a total beginner in DSA. 

I have 4-5 months, want to reach at a level where I am confident about my skills regardless of the company.

I am following Love Babbar's DSA course (works for me)

Anyhoo, my main question is, 

1. which platform should I pick? Leetcode vs GFG vs InterviewBit. (Will get to codechef and codeforces later after being good enough at DSA).

2. How many problems to practice (in total, topic wise, difficulty wise).

3. How do you progress from Easy to Medium to Hard?

4. How much time should this process of being proficient in DSA ideally take?

She wants to learn coding, the reason being she can do WFH as we are planning on staying in small town in the mountains. 

Whats the best way to get started from the basics? She wanna see if she even likes it or not. Any input is appreciated.

Edit: If it seemed like I'm forcing this idea on her, it's not. She worked in a job (fashion industry) for 10 years but that career has no growth potential.

15od61n,I am a bit happy that tier 3 grads like me are unemployed.,"**READ BEFORE JUMPING TO CONSLUSIONS**  


I have been seeing a lot of posts on this subreddit about the horrible conditions for CS/IT grads from like tier 2/3 colleges, I am from a tier 3 college myself but I see this as a good thing.  


So many of us who chose these colleges never did it on our own will, I personally wanted to go for Commerce but i was rejected by my parents to take anything other than Engineering  
Their justification was look at that uncle  who made it in IT from a tier 3 college by doing this

* Get a CS/IT degree from a tier 3 college during 2000s boom
* Get into WITCH companies
* Switch after getting some workex to a product based company
* Maybe work in US

This was the norm , but now with this IT crash, fresh grads have very little hope of getting off-campus opportunities. Even firms like Scaler and NIIT are struggling to find JAVA jobs 

I wrote all this because I honestly want this tier 3 engineering college thing to crash and burn , so many people have been shoved into this system mindlessly and some of them who eventually ended up just fine are the justification of these colleges to exist .  


In my 4 years of engineering I didn't have to write one single line of JavaScript , except for like projects , but not in the curriculum

These people were happy teaching me semi-conductors and engineering drawings...  
I am actually a bit happy that I am unemployed and I can save so many guys who were just going to get into engineering not take it after seeing my condition right now",2023-08-11 16:15:53

1b21tzc,Wishful thinking among software engineers about future ,"This post is being made to ask people those are working in tech or are aspiring to 

PS: Mods this post is not found anywhere in this sub Reddit 

A lot people believe that replacement by AI (LLM) is not possible but  here‚Äôs my take (I may be wrong)

1. Growth of LLMs (ability for being smarter, cheaper and faster) is exponential (3 years ago we did not even think ChatGPT would do things it‚Äôs doing) just compare gpt3.5turbo with gpt4 and now imagine what  gpt5 would be capable of (like massive increase in context length and tokens and being able read new documentation real time and just being really smarter )

2. A lot of people seems to say 
‚ÄúBy that logic, every job on the Earth can be automated. There's no need for humans anywhere‚Äù  
but it‚Äôs easy to replace people in sectors where regulation is less like it‚Äôs harder to replace people with self driving cars on our roads but it‚Äôs easy to replace us (software engineers)

3. Some say 
‚Äúwhen you develop complex products, you don't prepare for times when everything works, you prepare for times when nothing does. That's why we have TDD, CI/CD, code reviews, observability, open telemetry etc. All of tech is making code as robust and resilient as possible.‚Äù
But what‚Äôs stopping future AI models like GPT5 and beyond to do the above things far better than humans since they would have seen codebases more than an average human would see in their entire life.

4. So many people argue saying software engineering is about problem solving and not writing a bunch code but again nothing is stopping these LLMs to become better than us in problem solving communication etc(for many problem solving is just leetcode but cmon these LLMs which would have seen so many code bases know how to handle dependencies far better than any senior dev again not gpt4 think about the next evolution of models)
  
5. And this the fun one when people say AI Won‚Äôt Replace Humans ‚Äî But Humans With AI Will Replace Humans Without AI
 This one is the most funny cause when productivity increases we just need a lot less people to do (instead of 50 ppl in a team we would only need like 20 of them using AI ) also just let GPT agent into your customer database and it would know better about their requirements than you would.

 And finally some people are confusing these LLMs with sentience which is not the topic of this post it‚Äôs about LLMs replacing us 

Based on all this don‚Äôt you feel like a significant portion of software devs would become unnecessary like 80% since most of the work would be taken by GPT agents for $0.04 per api call (no issue of privacy as OpenAI api calls are used for training models)

Also don‚Äôt forget the capitalistic nature of companies 

Every time I see most of the devs are so optimistic about AI never replacing them (all of them are just seeing the current capabilities not the future which like very near in ~2 years)

To sum it up majority ~80% of the software engineers could be laid off or just would paid a lot less since most of the heavy lifting would be done by a cheap GPT agent

1b7tdt0,"Disheartened, Dejected, Uncertain - Seeking Frontend Internships","Hey folks, so I finished my IT degree at Pillai College in Navi Mumbai, and guess what? I've been stuck without a job since then. Back in college, I was a decent student with a 9.29 CGPA, and during the lockdown, I got all geeky with coding, focusing on data structures and algorithms. LeetCode became my jam, and I was dead set on becoming an SDE at a cool product-based company. But, darn it, only service-based companies showed up for interviews.

**First Interview:- Jio**

So, there I was, dreaming of a sweet gig as an SDE at a top-notch product-based company. JIO was in town, and I thought, ""This is my shot!"". The coding assessment in the morning? Crushed it. But here's where the drama unfolded. After the test, they told us, Cool, now wait for the interviews. Great, right? Wrong. Fast forward to 9 or 10 PM, a committee member casually mentions, we'll do the interview tomorrow. Starving since 7:30 AM, I dashed to a nearby caf√©, ordered food, and got a call from a friend yelling, ""Dude, where are you? They called your name, they're doing interviews now!"" Panic mode upgraded to full-blown chaos. I sprinted back to college, but my name had already done the rounds. I pleaded with the committee, but no dice. They made me wait till everyone else got grilled. Picture this ‚Äì it's 11:30 PM, I'm mentally and physically exhausted, and I finally get my shot. All the people who had not cleared the coding test but had to clear the GD had also been interviewed. The interviewer wasn't thrilled; he grilled me on DSA like there's no tomorrow. Despite my fatigue, I held my ground and answered questions on trees, sorting, and algorithms for a good 10-12 minutes. Rating the interview, maybe a 7 out of 10. I flubbed my intro and felt meh about it, but the committee dropped the bomb ‚Äì rejected! So there I was, shattered, heading back home from the station, tears mixing with my packed caf√© leftovers. Later, I heard some guy blabbing about blockchain for 10 minutes and making it to the final interview. It stung, but let's not make excuses, right? That rejection hit hard. I wanted a top-notch company, and JIO was my ticket. But life had other plans, and the first real taste of post-college life was a bitter one.

**Second Interview:- Media.net**

Just after I came back from my final year trip to Shimla-Manali, media.net arrived. Nailed the coding assessment, check! I aced the MCQs and breezed through two coding problems, all DSA-based. Feeling like the coding maestro, I snagged a spot for the interview. The interview kicked off with the web developer, and I was on fire. My introduction? Smooth as butter. Three coding questions were thrown my way, and guess what? I aced them all, breaking down solutions, and flaunting time and space complexities like a coding rockstar. The interviewer was impressed, and so was I. Made it to the final round ‚Äì just me out of 13 candidates. Round two, is the director's round. A mix of anticipation and nerves fueled my excitement. We started with intros, and then he hit me with database concepts ‚Äì ACID properties and whatnot. I rambled about databases, and he kept throwing counter-questions like a verbal ping-pong match. We danced around two coding questions, and despite being in the ring for almost 2 hours, I held my own. But then, reality check ‚Äì fatigue set in. I couldn't optimize the first problem as it was already 1 hour 45-50 minutes and I went blank. Couldn‚Äôt understand the second problem itself. It was like hitting a coding wall. The director probably sensed my exhaustion, and there it was, the interview that felt like a marathon ended. No rejection, no closure, just radio silence. No callback, and no closure email. A 2-hour interview and I was left hanging. What was going on at Media.net? Did they forget about me? The uncertainty stung more than a rejection.

**Post-Interview Period:**

Following this, I focused on completing my bachelor's with a good CGPA. Despite applying to multiple jobs with referrals, I received no responses. Deciding to pursue a Master's in Fall 2024, I prepared for the GRE for 2-2.5 months. My first attempt resulted in a lower score than expected (294) and despite improvement in the second attempt (302 (idk what went wrong), I was dissatisfied. Subsequently, I prepared for TOEFL, achieving a score of 98. I have received good admits from universities, including Rochester Institute of Technology, George Mason, UT Dallas for MS in CS, Virginia Tech MEng CS, IUB MS CS and Northeastern University Boston for MS in SES. While I await other decisions, I am currently inclined towards Indiana University Bloomington for an MS in CS. The joy of being selected for the final interview at Media.net and receiving my first admit from RIT brought some relief. However, seeing my friends working while I'm at home has been challenging.

I'm gearing up for my Master's in August, but I'm a bit anxious about the gap year (23-24) potentially causing issues. It's been tough lately; despite being a hardworking guy, I'm currently jobless. Somewhere between the JIO mishap and the Media.net rollercoaster, I found myself in an unexpected **ego battle**. You see, I've been diligently preparing for a role in a top-notch company, and the idea of settling for a service-based job didn't quite sit well with me. It's a bit confusing, but I guess I had this internal struggle‚ÄîI didn't want to compromise on the standards I set for myself. However, here I am, with no job in hand. Despite losing interest in competitive coding, I'm eager to dive into a software engineering internship before I kick off my Master's. It's not just about gaining experience; it's also a practical way to earn some much-needed cash. If anyone out there has leads on Frontend internships, I'd truly appreciate the help.

Thanks a bunch!",2024-03-06 06:59:40

17wl2hy,"I feel like Data scientists and Data analysts are overpaid. The work they do, doesn't make sense at all yet they receive so much.","Datascientists are overpaid, they make no meaningful contribution yet they get so much. Even if they don't exist, the company's operations won't stop, the production won't stop. Very rarely, they may find some patterns that might or might not improve the production rate by 0.0001% and they get heavy rewards for that. I have never seen a datascientist making useful contribution, they just make some graphs, show some numbers, speak some stats that is it, those numbers are not useful anywhere in the society. One such example is, some company sold some datascience product to IPL team, that software will help the team to buy players and do some data analysis, for the first half of the IPL, the team performed well and the datascients of the company celebrated like an achievement, so many clients contacted them for that software. After the end of the IPL, that team didn't even reach playoffs. so the software didn't work, the team won first half just randomly. Almost all the stats they make are just random. They make random predictions, if they turn out to be true, they take credit, if they don't come true, they don't take accountability. Sometimes I feel, what is the need of doing stats, what is the need of drawing graphs, how do they contribute to society? Imagine, a society, workers work long hours producing the product that is used by everyone earn so low and the so-called data scientists who do some numbers on the labours' work earn so much. I have seen so many data science projects, the graphs they show us for results make no sense but they are very colorful with numbers so the executives get hard looking at those. Just because there is so much data doesn't mean it is useful.   
These days everyone is picking datascience because it has no real work and no accountability, just use numbers, create garbage graphs etc. No matter how much datascientists act like their work is tough and they are very important, i never take them seriously.   
Artificial intelligence and Machine learning are good though, they at least create the products that do some work.

In today‚Äôs article, we will delve into the world of monads, breaking down their concepts and exploring their use cases in TypeScript.

15zqkbu,üî•üöÄ Unleash the Fury of TypeScript Generics: Dominate Type-Safe Coding Like a Beast! üöÄüî•,"Hey Reddit community

In this latest edition of [Typescript Daily](https://typescriptdaily.dev/?utm_source=r-devindia), I covered Typescript Generics. üöÄüîí This is going to be a simple post that covers this topic with basic and advanced-level examples. 

üí° Trivia Corner

Well, did you know that the concept of generics can be traced back to the early days of programming languages? Generics were first introduced in the programming language Ada, which was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense in the late 1970s. The idea was to create a way to write code that could work with various data types while maintaining type safety and code reusability. This concept of parameterized types laid the foundation for the modern generics we see in languages like TypeScript, Java, and C#.

Generics is a powerful concept that enables clean reusability, and extensibility across different use cases. Generics provide a way to create functions, classes, or interfaces that work with different data types while preserving type information. They're like flexible tools in your coding arsenal, allowing you to write reusable and type-safe code.

Consider a scenario where you want to create a function that takes an array and returns its reversed version. With generics, you can make this function work with arrays of any type, maintaining type safety.

[https://typescript-daily.beehiiv.com/p/unleashing-typescripts-power-exploring-magic-generics](https://typescript-daily.beehiiv.com/p/unleashing-typescripts-power-exploring-magic-generics?utm_source=r-devindia)

üî• Ready to Conquer?:

Below are some of the things you can read about in the article at a very high level.

1. **Fiery Problem-Solving Mastery:** Say goodbye to tedious code repetition and incinerate any threats to your type integrity. Generics are your ultimate weapon, turbocharging code reusability without a hint of compromise on type security.
2. **Rampaging Array Revolution:** Imagine crafting functions that tear through arrays of any kind, leaving no room for type vulnerabilities. Generics transform into your code's fiery battering ram, smashing down barriers with unparalleled power!
3. **Fury Across All Frontiers:** Hold onto your hats as Generics rage through promises, classes, and beyond, leaving a trail of seamless type adaptation in their wake.
4. **Unleash Unrelenting Advanced Techniques:** Ignite your expertise with iron-clad type constraints. Command Generics to kneel only to types that meet your most stringent criteria. Watch your codebase evolve, baptized in the flames of dominance.

15jjyak,Guys guys guys ... Listen,"NEED GUIDANCE RELATED TO PROJECT !! PLEASE READ

Hi everyone, this is throwaway acc for specific reason

I am Data engineer have 1 yr of exp currently. For past couple of months i have been used as buffer project resource.

Project technology is also old etl tools, no cloud, Unix , SQL, git.

I have been able to grasp and help some small tasks, today the project director has said I would be working billed now.

But the issue is that it is shift working 12 pm to 9 /9:30 pm. I don't want to during this shift, as one family member has some health issues. 

Intially I was working 9 to 6. Clock out exactly 6 

Also I don't know I value wlb too much as I have seen my family members stamped on by corporates


The salary is also base 5 lpa (metropolitan city)which requires 2 day working from office. I don't have variable pay, while other received their annual bonus I wanted sitting ducks.

Haven't received annual appraisal yet, the process was done way back in March.

The company work culture is also okay, but the once deallocate from project. It's very difficult to get back another project. 8 + exp people are on bench , waiting to be assigned..

15i3j44,Landing a Job abroad.,"Background: 

I have just given and passed my final semester exam in my bachelors (E&TC) a month back, from a tier 20 college, having offer from a WITCH company.  
>!I know a bit of python programming, Flask (!<[GitProject](https://github.com/sinhaharsh077/bledblood-the-blood-app)>!), and I have taught myself Autodesk Maya and Zbrush. !<  
   

This may seem like na√Øve question but:

Scenario:

Initially I thought that freshers from Tier -1 institute only can join the jobs in foreign countries. But to my surprise nowadays I am seeing most people are going abroad!  


Now I understand that, many people go for a masters and then get offers post their studies, which requires a nice bit of financial support from their families. But is it that prevalent?   


What skills an individual must possess to get a job offer + relocation support from foreign countries? Especially for the ones like me, who missed an opportunity to join a tier -1 college, to go abroad some day?",2023-08-04 15:44:38
15gqndl,What is the process of background verification?,"I'm working in a service based company (lets call it A). This is my first job and as a part of it, I've worked for a few tier 1 clients (lets call them x,y,z). Now when I start to look for a change, I'll obviously mention those clients on my resume because I think it'll give some more edge over other applicants to be considered for a job interview. However, since I was never an employee for those clients, I won't have any proof (for e.g. work experience letter) from the client itself to verify that I worked for them. So 

(1) Will I fail the background verification ? 

(2) Should I not mention the client's name in my resume if background verification check includes verifying whether you worked for a client or not? 

My work experience letter would only be mentioning that I worked for company 'A'.",2023-08-03 01:47:03

15cb43j,"I need help, i think i am doomed","hello seniors/fellow mates

i need some genuine advice.

i joined a tier 3 college in 2020, Computer science engineering. Currently in my final year (7th sem just started). In my initial days, it was the covid time so i passed two years of my college life at home. I didn't had any guidance about what to do and what to choose. I got enrolled to abdul bari sir's cpp course, because i had cpp in my higher sec. But i had no idea about what to do, cause my college seniors were not that supportive regarding this, no worrier why tier 3 colleges are bad.

In my second year i got to know about gate, so downloaded RBR sir's course for gate prep. I love computer science, it was my dream since childhood to study computer science, i got interested in core subjects so invested my time into it.

I was also loving the coding part too, got myself enrolled to coding ninjas DSA course, completed that course by the end of 3rd sem, then in 3rd sem college started calling us back to campus, so got busy with that, new place took time to adjust, then when things got normal again another wave arrived, had to go back. I started studying core subject in good dept.

My second year went like this, in my 4th sem got myself enrolled to coding ninja's CP course. There one of the (main) educator told us to not to participate in contest until we complete the course, to support his point he said, once we complete the course, we will be able to solve good amount of problems, which actually made sense to us. So i decided to leave codeforces and study the course.

I completed the course towards 5th sem then went to compete in contest and started learning web dev from The Odin project. Didn't had a good experience cause lost the contest mindset due to a long gap. Then since my 3rd year was happening offline so had to appear for the first sem exam ever so had to study for that too.

I studied the core subject to a good depth, i am able to solve gate pyq, and made easy gate DPP.

Now i have realized to sit for placement too.

My current scenario is :

i am a final year student who did no development, still a newbie at codeforces, and studied Core subjects.

what i am doing for now (current goal) :

practising on codeforces trying to get to the mark of specialist, complete upto react js from the odin project curriculum, revise core subject.

&#x200B;

please help or suggest me, if you think something I should do, or am I really doomed.

thanks",2023-07-28 22:23:21

And also, what technology is in demand (it would be okay if the demand is moderate) with less competition compared to web development??

11d5y3o,The rise of single-page applications (SPAs) and their impact on web development," 

The rise of single-page applications (SPAs) has had a significant impact on web development in recent years. SPAs are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content as the user interacts with the page, rather than loading new pages from the server. This results in a more seamless and interactive user experience, similar to that of a native desktop or mobile app.

However, building SPAs presents some unique challenges for web developers. For example, SPAs can be less SEO-friendly since search engines typically index individual pages rather than a single page application. Additionally, server-side rendering and caching can be more complex since the server must render the initial HTML and CSS content for the entire app.

To overcome these challenges, developers have developed various techniques and tools, such as client-side routing and pre-rendering. Client-side routing allows the SPA to simulate navigation between pages while still being a single-page application, which can improve the user experience and help with SEO optimization. Pre-rendering, on the other hand, involves generating static HTML pages on the server-side for each route of the SPA, which can be served to search engines and improve the app's performance.

Overall, SPAs have revolutionized the way web applications are built and consumed, and developers must continue to adapt to this trend to build high-quality, performant, and accessible applications.",2023-02-27 07:39:21

14oorbe,"PhonePe vs GPay, the contrast!","So if we go by the history, PhonePe has always been the leader in UPI payment segment. And I have used PhonePe, GPay, PayTm, Amazon Pay etc. I found PhonePe the best, fastest and most reliable payment system for UPI payments.

But what I don't get is how hard is the learning curve for people using GPay to use PhonePe as GPay is worst, worst than Paytm. I know it is second by the market share because it ran elaborate schemes to get people to their platform 5 years ago. 

I guess the purpose of this post is to know who have used payment gateway(UPI) during their development, why is PhonePe so fast?

Tldr: Why is PhonePe so fast as compared to other UPI payment apps, and why GPay is still second by market share despite being shity.

Edit: I would appreciate more insights on the technical aspects of implementation. Like why one is faster than the other. For instance, GPay has least features but still the UI lags(my experience) and PhonePe/Paytm have lots of features(read bloatware) but at least their core functionality works flawlessly.
Also, more insights on why you prefer one more than the other.

I roughly went through UPIs API docs(not original, but more like summarised) and I thought what if we give an app just for payment usage only, without all the bloatware( I know it gives no means of revenue from business perspective, but let us keep it aside for now).",2023-07-02 13:47:58

12b7keq,"Diff between a prod, service & startup ?","Scaler Academy CEO says "" service based companies focus on your tech stack as they can make you billable that way. Prod companies need to get a work done. So they don't focus on tech stack"".

Startups they want a specific tech stack person too right ?
Which has better growth & learning.


A nodeJs developer in a service based company & in a startup. What's the difference between theese 2 ?

A nodeJs developer in Bajaj finance earns 12 lpa.

A nodeJs developer in Service based earns around 4-5-6-7 lpa 

Tell me the difference in terms of growth & learning .

What is it that is required to learn ? Is that a specific tech stack or a generic person.




I thinka person should have both. Making a project or being dev oriented gives us a taste of what it's like to do development. And having those problem solving skills makes us capable to be eligible for big companies who can trust us that we will be comfortable with any tech stack. The way to assess is DSA for them.

1bgcslt,CSE College Students' Placements Guide from a Recent Graduate,"I've been getting a lot of messages from college kids asking for advice about placements, so I'm writing down what I wish I knew at that stage.

**Who is this for?** \- Mainly 3rd year CSE students who are about to go into placements in a few months.

**About me** \- B.Tech CSE, Tier 2 private college (2023 batch). Got on campus internship at a FAANGMULA company. Applied off campus for many months. Now SDE at a similar company. Also had gotten an offer from a CHWTIA company (this acronym always cracks me up lmao) on campus that I rejected.

Ok so coming to the questions I had before placements:

**How much do my grades and college courses matter?** 

If your CGPA is below 8, try your best to bring it up. Above 8.5 is sufficient to qualify for most companies. 9+ is stellar. CGPA is only used as cutoff to Online Assessment eligibility. College courses - OOP, OS, DBMS, NetCom - these are quite commonly asked in interviews. Prepare all these well. Ignore others.

**What level of company should I aim for?**

This was something I struggled to understand because I had no point of reference. If you're in a reputed college, have CGPA above 8.5, and got around 90-95% in 12th and 10th, I think you're smart enough to get an offer of 18lpa+. That being said I've heard many people say they lost out on getting an offer at all because they rejected all companies that paid below 20 lpa. Don't do that, but if you have good grades, don't settle for anything under 12lpa. 

**Resume Preparation**

Most college kids feel like their resume is barebones and full of crap. It's fine, just do your best to fill it up with things that sound legit. Do some online courses from reputed companies. (Google has a bunch on Coursera). Do some projects that cover the complete web stack. Nobody really cares about fancy stuff like ML, AI, Blockchain. Especially if you just copied and pasted some package in python. It's fine to have one or two projects on this but just focus on basic, frequently used development tools. This could include JS, React, Node, Java, Spring boot, Git, Docker, AWS services, Firebase, etc. When you describe projects in your resume, focus on the tools and technologies used, over the detailed functionality of your project. If you don't know where to even start, I like Ania Kubow's youtube channel. Maybe mobile dev if you've done a good amount of web dev already. 

If you're part of college clubs, add info that would showcase your teamwork & leadership skills. Remove any sentences from your resume that don't tell the recruiter anything important about you. It's better to have a short resume than one fluffed up with nonsense. Recruiters aren't dumb. 

**Recruitment Process**

Most of the mass recruiters will have aptitude heavy online assessments, then interviews about basic college subjects. 

High-paying MNCs will generally filter by CGPA, hold an online assessment (OA), then have one or more rounds of coding interviews. 

Online Assessment - DSA type questions. Maybe SQL, behavioural, aptitude, theory based questions as well. Look up past tests of same company. 

Coding Interviews - Generally 2 Leetcode style questions in 45 to 60 mins. Might be preceded with questions about basic CS theory or projects on your resume. 

HR/Manager Interviews - Generic. Plenty of info online about these. 

**How to prepare?**

If your placement season starts this year, you have plenty of time as long as you get serious starting now. First, do up your resume. If you're doing projects and courses to perk up your resume, do them simultaneously with other preparation. I've seen people not prepare important things because they're waiting on completing some unimportant thing. Don't do that, prioritise and do things in parallel. The main thing to focus on will be DSA. 

**What to prepare?**

Resume should be complete, and constantly get updated as you complete new courses/projects. Regularly brush up the basic theory subjects. 

DSA - This is the most important part. It will seem daunting at first, because you won't understand anything. The ""secret"" to this is just doing a bunch of problems until you have a mental database of common tricks/algorithms/methods. Start with either [Striver's list](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) or [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). Complete either one at minimum. If you have time to do both, you're sitting pretty. 

Coding interviews aren't just about solving problems optimally, they're also about explaining your thought process clearly and in a structured, easy to follow manner. Often they won't even ask you to code, just to explain the process and efficiency, and walk it through sample input. Practice this by mock interviewing with friends. Even if you don't know how to solve it immediately, the interviewer will judge how you break the problem down, eliminate options, and narrow down potential ways to solve it. If you already know the problem, don't let the interviewer know this. Always start with a brute force approach, and then move up to more efficient solutions. Just a brute force solution is vastly better than jumping into the optimal solution and not being able to get it. Cardinal sin of coding interviews is jumping into the code and writing it just to realise you read the question wrong. Confirm the requirements properly, ask smart questions about it, before you start ideating. 

**Other stuff I wish I knew back then**

You don't need to be an IIT grad or a college topper to get a high paying job. It does help, but mainly just being very very good at DSA is enough. I know there's a huge debate about how useless DSA is in an actual job, but who cares? Do what you gotta do to get paid, it's simple.

It's ok to feel overwhelmed or that you're lagging behind. Engineering is just an oscillation between imposter syndrome and feeling like a god. Such is the developer life. Nobody knows anything when they start out. But anything is learnable with enough time and patience, no matter your IQ. 

If you're having trouble with discipline just imagine the fat stack of cash you'll get soon and all the cool shit you'll buy your family with it :)",2024-03-16 18:33:54
1bfivtc,Just Earned CVEs for Critical Vulnerabilities [Achievement Bragging],"Hey everyone, 

I wanted to share an exciting milestone in my journey: During my recent Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project, I was able to identify critical vulnerabilities that led to me being assigned two CVEs:

* **CVE-2024-23\*\*\***
* **CVE-2024-23\*\*\***

This achievement is a significant personal milestone, reflecting my commitment to improving software security and the real impact that diligent testing and vulnerability research can have. I'm eager to continue this path and contribute more to the cybersecurity community.

Would love to hear your thoughts or if you have any advice on furthering my journey in cybersecurity!

I was expecting at least 10% this year as previous year it was huge hike. Now I‚Äôm confused to what to do? I asked one more time about hike but they denied and said giving only bonus.

1b5b3sx,Is It Too Late to Redirect My IT Career? Seeking Wisdom to Overcome My Technical Mid-Life Crisis. 35 Yo M,"I'm a 35 year old guy with 13 YoE IT experience. I've made pretty bad(no) decisions in my career and now I want to rectify some of those.

Background: I was a star coder in my school days (C++). Did Engineering from a good Tier-2 college. Joined a service based organization (Non Witch) where your skillset doesn't matter and thrown into Manual QA for clicking buttons. Didn't Focus anything on career and focused on Music (Guitar/Singing). That passion didn't work out. Along with that wasted 9 years switching 3 companies in Manual QA. 

After 9 years, joined an organization where had to management roles of planning Manual Testing projects on a high level. After 2 years (11 YOE) realized I used to love coding so started coding again and switched to a Python Automation Role in another service based organization (Non WITCH). In just 2 years became pretty important Automation guy, no one could have guessed I faked the automation/coding experience. 
Now I've good knowledge in GitLab Pipelines, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Python, Shell. 

Problem: I'm not a leadership material. I've plateaued the Automation QA role in the current organization and have to again start doing core Management stuff; the blame games, mail chains, working with zero technical Managements, late night unnecessary calls, creating excels/ppts/words etc. I hate this stuff.
How would I survive in this pyramid structure of Indian IT industry where even if I change nobody expects me to code after 13 years. I loved doing technical stuff during last 2 years. But now it seems, sooner or later I've to move to non-technical role. I feel so bad and sad I switched my career to coding after 11 years.
I heard, in DevOps and Data Science you could remain technical for a very long duration. In last 2 years, I became somewhat familiar with DevOps areas. Now I've three choices:
1. Remain in QA Automation. Switch company?
2. Study DevOps (Azure certification) and Move to DevOps career.
3. Study Data Science/AI/ML (1 year at least) and change career. Would be the most difficult to switch with 0 industry experience. Is it possible?

Can someone please guide me.",2024-03-03 07:11:26

1axcbbs,Honest question about generative AI - what's your take on  Gen AI,"See, I have a very short Dev exp , I am mostly into business. 

And from my POV or works that I am doing righr now. 

Most of the basic level works, like DA, BI, RPA now a days can be done with someone who is an enthusiastic team member, have a eager to learn, knows how to get solutions from gpt, and then use their personal knowledge to build solution around business problems. 

And in our organization, most of the devs qre now shifted to things where core knowledge is really required. 

Recession or not, this is a fact and can see same thing happening in organizations of my peers. 

While leadership and mid level manager roles are staying mostly safe because business models arw numerous and every business is unique so apart from gpt based solutions human intervantions are still required. 

See, I love tech and I keep learning new things everyday, I literally learned coding, dsa, DA, development by myself and still learning. 

And I just can't bear the idea that devs are actually getting replaced by gpt, also for those people who are really earning high end salary, this vaccum is shifting the supply demand dynamics. As a result more devs for a few roles are becoming new reality. 

In this environment, how are core devs feeling about the future? 
What do you guys thing will remain intact and a niche where no one can interfere? 

Also in long run does anyone else feel that DAO will be a thing because obviously if I see some high  ASI is running organizations, I will be more than happy to contribute to a DAO rather than working with ASI. 

Also, what's your take on salaries, because it's only a matter of time that anyone with basic knowledge starts coding with gpt and stops entry level jobs thus increasing the competition and decreasing salaries. ",2024-02-22 17:34:45

I wanted to join MAANG when I graduate because I feel like I code really well and have the necessary skills. But I was rejected twice. When I uploaded my resume here and asked for review, pretty much everyone said the achievements were weak. 

So I had planned to start doing CP, it started out great mostly because my initial rating was much lower than my current skill level ig but now that rating has caught up to my skill the rating changes are very low. I have only attended 3 or 4 contests in total but I don't know if I am motivated enough to spend hundreds of hours practicing questions to jump each 100 in rating and get to 5 star / expert in a couple of months. I feel like this is a waste of time, but I also want to stand out in my resume and get shortlisted for an interview. I am really conflicted on what to do.

I am not naturally good at problem solving which makes me fear my choice(once I get hold of something I do better at it, but this fear is stopping me). Additionally, last few years have been tough for me mentally(which indulges fear, anxiety, brain fog in the picture).

It's not like I came to learn this blindly to college, as a junior college student I visioned making projects which solves real world problems but I could never do it. The college experience has been horrible too, where everything is on us to figure out. Now it's feel like I was just a kid with big dreams but couldn't sustain anything. Now my life is full of fear of future, regrets of past, my present is my inefficiencies. This brain Fogg, this procastination, this irratation of not being able to figure out things eats me completely. 

I know somewhere as a college student I have a very pessimistic way of looking at things, but this thing has been me since four years. My entire junior college, my inability of making a right career choice, confusion between streams, my mental breakdown, and everything which went wrong made me this.

Are the acer and asus laptop worth the cheap or should I go for Dell one , 
I tested Dell in showroom it was good .
Lenovo IdeaPad's processor seemed old .
Msi not at all interested cause of its less centres in India.
Talking about tuf series under 70k it comes with i5 11th gen which is not par with this dell model.

Apps I use:-
I play mostly free games , like valorant ,warzone, Tom raider, etc .
For video editing I use Davinci resolve , Flowframes.
Photoshop.

Extra points:-
I will go to Andhra so heating is the concern.
Will live in hostel.
I will upgrade the laptop to 16gb later.

Will try to buy laptop offline for assurance.

2) Initially can just work for equity in after job hours(as will I).

3) Is interested in bootstrapping the business in the beginning rather than just burning cash from investors

4) Actually believes in providing value to the customer.

5) Has knowledge about App development and Artificial intelligence.

About what I bring to the table- I have planned out the whole thing, done some solid research on the topic + I'll be handling the day to day operations.

About equity share-  That solely depends on the level of skills, experience, personality traits and this is something I wish should be discussed after I know the person a bit more

Why not VC's in the beginning- I want to add VC's when I'm in dire need of cash to expand. I have a particular vision for the company I don't want investors messing that up because this company will be my kid!

Why not full time from the beginning-

I'm 100% confident both product wise and about my capabilities. Developing any idea into a product takes time and I don't want myself or people I work with to feel dependent just on savings/their parent's money. Lastly it depends on need.

18202or,Why are Westerners so toxic to Indians who go to study/work abroad?,"

Now the comments are deleted by the user, but TLDR- they were saying that  
: Indians who go to look for jobs abroad are beggers  
: When I told them the Japanese or other countrymen don't complain if westerners go to their country, their response was that ""only a few westerners do that as opposed to '1.6Billion Indians' coming to their country"", spoken like a true hypocrite.  
: They said- ""They"" don't want ""Us"" . \~ but I guess their governments do? coz ppl are paying taxes,but not 'they' cause they are lazy to upskill and compete with some one from a '3rd world' country?  
: After my last comment where I tried to ask through some logic that- the ppl going abroad are not 'begging' for their work, they are 'earning' it through hard work,  
to this their final response was that Indians are simply cheaters, and scammers and whatnot, and before I could read it all the comments got deleted-  


I know western media/chinese media try to portray India/Indians as such, and brainwash their people. Even though its true to some extent that some Indians shame our name by doing scams and whatnot, but that's such a small percentage of the population, that the other 90% hardworking hustlers are getting such treatment by westerners-",2023-11-23 12:24:18

1. No teaching. You will receive daily tasks focused on one concept.
2. You learn the concept, explore solutions, finish the assignment and submit it for review.
3. A senior dev reviews your code and provides tips and insights to improve. You work with the same senior dev for the entire module.

Why?

1. Well-structured roadmap and tasks that build on top of one another.
2. Relieves you from ""I have completed the basic tutorial, but I don't know where these things apply.""
3. Step out of ""The code works, but it might not be clean or good"" and boost your confidence.
4. You get familiar with the learn-code-feedback cycle before your first job.

Mustafa founded DeepMind when he was a  36 year old policy officer who worked with politicians and  international organizations. Someone who is already a veteran in their  field of work, all of sudden seeks out a completely different career  direction which has an impact on humanity's progress in AI.

Something  doesn't add up. A person needs a STEM degree to just land a job in AI. A  person also needs to have some academic understanding of math and  engineering to start a research company which spearheads human progress  in AI.

119g5jw,Problem with coding tutorials like Fireship.,"Unpopular opinion alert! I dislike his tutorials.

The whole idea of putting a framework which takes a month to learn and even more time to master into a 90 second video has really misled people into believing that they can become good coders in just a quick matter of time.

It has taken me back to my time learning Web Development for the very first time, feeling very lost at every step. Everything took time to get used to. Heck I hated even understanding HTML. I would also go in a lot of depth trying to understand why a particular tag exists or how the browser interprets the HTML code and how the Application Layer protocols in Computer Networking work like HTTP.

These were things I could never take for granted and just ""cut the drift and pick up later"". Neither should you in my honest opinion. These fundamentals are what help you in understanding the next stages. Kind of like progressively attacking each layer of the problem before getting to the core of it. I don't mean to disparage anyone from watching him, but you have to understand that coding is a patient business. You don't build the next big Facebook in a day or the next Social Media Giant in a day.

Coding requires so much patience, I cannot emphasise this enough. Debugging that terrible logical error in that routine you wrote while being half baked is time taking. Because it is meant to be, it takes time to learn. Most of my college mates have looked up to Fireship under the false impression that they'd able to learn tech in the fastest way possible. 

NO, NO JUST NO! Learning to code takes time. It takes a lot of time. It's going to feel unintuitive, tiring and stressful especially debugging.

Also one more thing about Fireship, his constant shitting on other frameworks, i.e, the frameworks that are not React or JS based. The thing is when we get jobs most of us aren't even going to know which framework or technology we will be working on at these big tech companies. Sure there are people that work on their desired framework but that's not all of us.

Not to mention his awful speed(which is extremely fast) and lacklustre explanation which gives you the illusion that you're learning something new but you're really not!

By telling people that a framework is shit and useless I feel it sets a bad precedent for those that have a job to do in that particular framework. Like they immediately lose interest if it's not React. 

Please don't let your learning be Framework Oriented. You have to be flexible in picking up and implementing new frameworks. From my experience the design patterns, the fundamental basics remain the same, except the coding philosophy which differs. Similar to how looping, conditionals and OOPS are language agnostic concepts and rooted in Programming Logic.",2023-02-22 22:34:10

It was an amazing release, and the videos they posted demonstrating its uses were also a blast. But as a dev, it is my sole responsibility to be scared to death with each advancement in this AI race and that is exactly what I did.

Watching the demonstration video I felt like it was not an AI for the first time. It felt like watching a 5-year-old human interacting with that person in the video which is really really really scary. Because all of us know how fast kids get all big and eat your jobs.

My point is these AIs are already starting to feel like humans. And Gemini can interact with everything like a human.

I thought, nice, I have recently completed 3 years now I am ready to switch company. I saw all my peers leaving around 2 years and jumping to good good packages so I was like let's do it now that I have learnt a lot and it's about time.

To my dismay I didn't get a single call for 2 months. I was shocked as my profile was goo,  I had screened my resume from seniors but 0 calls. Then I sought help from my elder brothers and asked them what was wrong with me. They said folks nowadays change the notice period to 1 month, keep updating profile daily once even if small space here and there and put keywords properly in naukri. I did just that and here we are around December and no call. Just 1 maybe last week but that HR also didn't call back.

My question is am I doing something wrong here? All my friends collegeues seniors got like dozens of calls when they were switching even after the fact that their resumes were not that good. I had a colleague who had just put random stuff I saw his resume on naukri even he used to get calls plus he asked me for content for writing emails to client and even took help for small small things at work didn't have sound technical skills (not to talk bad about him but tbh) but he somehow managed to get crazy calls. I saw him go out of office to pick those and I was also there with him when he got the calls. Now he is not replying to my messages where I ask for advice on job search so I also stopped reaching out to him for help out of self respect.

Can someone please guide me here with tips for naukri job search and whay am i missing?

My cousin comforted me saying it's year end time don't worry and don't take it to your heart it's usually no hiring season. Start next year or next FY. But in this year end time also many of my friends got calls. So all in all my confidence has shattered.

wfsnt9,"[Hiring] MERN stack + TypeScript developer. Pay: 7-10 CAD/hour. Fully remote. Full-time (around 40 hours/week), Monday-Friday.","**TYPE:** Full time

**DESCRIPTION:** IT is a SAAS company, located in Canada. Permanent work from home, 10 AM to 7 PM working time (timezone Indian standard time) Monday-Friday.  And the pay is hourly so if you work overtime you will get compensated for it. You will be directly working for the company so there is no middleman or agency to take a commission. If you have the required skills and are selected you can directly discuss the pay rate with CEO. 7-10 CAD/hour is my rough estimation, may vary according to your skill levels.

**LOCATION:** Canada

**COMPENSATION:** 7-10 CAD/hour

**REMOTE:** fully remote

**CONTACT:** You can contact me u/to_hire_MERN_ts

**Skills required:**

Programming language: javascript/TypeScript

For frontend: Reactjs, Redux (with redux-toolkit), Ant Design, CSS(in-depth knowledge is **NOT** required for CSS. Because there will be a separate CSS developer and designer).

For backend: Nodejs, Expressjs, MongoDB with mongoose ODM

Other tools and libraries: Github, Chargebee, stripe, socketio

Knowledge of React native will be a plus.

I am working at this company as a full-stack developer. So if you have any further questions you can ask. In my opinion work-life balance is great because you will be working around 40 hours a week and there will not be any calls or messages from the company when you are not working. If you think this role and pay structure is suitable for you, you can send your resume/cv, Github link, or any other link that shows your skills to me via dm.

I have always been interested / liked technology sector in general and with my limited knowledge of programming from CBSE high school curriculum, have fairly enjoyed to code. But that's as far as I have dipped my toes in the IT sector. I have admired from afar at how UI and operating systems like Android are coded by using custom ROMs in my mobile and always wanted to learn further about it.  


Now, the problem is that almost everyone in my circle including parents and friends are averse of the IT sector mainly due to lack of  ""job-security"" and that companies will easily do layoffs leaving you without a job at any point of time.  


My friend who is very much inclined towards a core-job insists that core sector is advantageous because once you do a masters and get into a good core company, no one will be able to replace you since the knowledge you possess is very hard to come by but whereas in IT sector, if a new candidate performs better than you, you will be replaced easily.  


Frankly I am sick of his arguements but I am not able to completely deny him because I dont have much experience / knowledge regarding this matter.

Usually grinding on one coding platform and making a few portfolio projects used to be sufficient - now even LeetCode, HackerRank, HackerEarth, etc are not enough - you also need decent CP rank on Codeforces, Codechef, SPOJ, etc - you need tons of open source contributions on GitHub and portfolio site with tons of self-made projects - you need to market yourself on social media, blogs, online video platforms, etc - then you need many referrals, contacts and networks to get you a chance to prove yourself - then also need to clear extremely difficult OAs or Interview rounds.

Now the ones who advocate for freelancing, remote jobs, etc - they say just learn one or two major in-demand stacks and keep gaining skills through projects - keep marketing yourself and someone will hire you as a contractor so you can earn high return forex while staying in India itself - others suggest to go into extremely niche and less crowded fields like blockchain, web3, distributed computing, etc using mostly C++, Rust, etc and focus on advanced computing concepts to yield much higher returns.

Was in home the entire time and just scrolled yt the entire time while constantly thinking I'm not putting my entire effort into JEE prep( which I never did till the end) . Gave the jee mains 2018 and fucked it up(20k rank, ik it's not bad but I wanted <2-3k) so didn't prepare for advanced but somehow did well in advanced so dropped a year( worst mistake) . Again the cycle repeated, didn't study while constantly blaming myself for procrastinating. Now I really don't now how but I secured a 4k rank( probably my guesses worked) but atp I didn't even care, i just wanted it to be over with. Ended up taking admission in a nit( cse branch). For the 4 years I was just extremely depressed and I never got out of my comfort zone constantly thinking I'm a failure whose never going to be good enough at anything, tried my hand at leetcode but it just isn't my cup of tea( i actually enjoyed solving physics/maths questions in 11-12th but i get this cloudy vision now if i try too hard at a question), i have a job but the pay is meh( i got placed very late and the company that I got placed in originally offered a CTC of  14 lpa is now saying they can only do 7(base).

A dude named Pushpal Roy is seen verbally thrashing his colleagues for not fulfilling sales targets.

What is happening to our country, folks? There are many abusive people here, we know. But at least until now, they had the fear of being exposed, they feared the sunlight. Nobody was so blatant and explicit to say such abusive things on a video call.

We know that HDFC has already sacked this guy but that isn't enough. We need better processes across all our institutions, processes that care for the humans who toil there. I think the situation is much better in IT, at least the big ones, and let's work to ensure it stays that way.

Always keep the larger picture in mind, it's too easy to lose temper on the other guy in desperate and economically depressing times like these. But always remember that we are humans, the other guy also has a family at home like you, people who care and want to see them rise. Have some empathy and kindness, these are stressful times but that's exactly when empathy is needed the most.

So far, I worked 7 months at Company 1, 2 months(contractor) at company 2, 4 months (current) at company 3. All have been startups and I switched mostly due to money as well as growth in challenges at daily work. And my current company is a well funded startup in bangalore where I have 15LPA base and interesting work. But no remote options and I have been working on weekends and I am stressed to death. I just want to go home for some time for deepawali and my manager is saying to me to work remotely. And this is all coming after me receiving a company-wide award for best performance and impact. Tasks are constantly under-estimated and folks at my company are setting on-call. And remote work is frowned upon.

I am beginning to think most startups are this way. I wanted to grow in my career through aggressive learning and constant delivery of new features. Though I delivered a lot of things, my upskilling has taken a hit due to strict deadlines, overworking and deliveries. And I am very unhappy with the housing market here. I am paying hefty money with no proper facilities. So I would like to try remote.

I am afraid to make a switch because I switched few times within the last year itself. When I joined this company, I wanted to stay here for a while and grow into an SDE-2. But now, I am skeptical if I would even get the opportunity. So, If anyone of you or your team or company is hiring, I would like to be referred or can someone point me to good companies with good wlb and remote options?",2022-10-18 02:05:29

15y46b0,"Unpopular opinion: Problem Solving rounds are a good way to shortlist good candidates. Don't downvote, let's discuss.","Before going ahead, I am assuming a couple of things.

1. Having good problem solving skills is one of the core requirement of being a SWE.
2. DSA is a good way to shortlist SWEs with good problem solving skills.  
If you don't agree with these two points, we can discuss that as well.

So I am one of the rare folks who supports DSA rounds as part of technical interviews. And to be honest, I consider myself average when it comes to DSA. The reason why I support DSA as part of interviews is that it helps to filter out candidates with good problem solving skills. And people with good problem solving skills are able to understand and communicate better IMO. I have worked at a service based org for 10 months and have been working for a product based org for 2+ years. My current org was heavy on DSA during the interviews but it wasn‚Äôt the case with the service based org.

While working in a team of 8-10, you will be collaborating with Manager, Product Managers, other SWEs and scrum master. You should have really good communication skills otherwise things get pretty hard and annoying for everyone. And communication is a two way street, being able to understand what others are saying is as much important as conveying your thoughts. While interacting with teammates I can feel the difference, people here are too the point and things get resolved quickly. By ""too the point"", I don't mean we don't have small talks or people are rude here, it's completely intended towards the technicality of the discussions we have in the organisation. People are able to convey their thoughts in simple and easy words and it's very easy to convey my thoughts as well since they are good at understanding.

So I would say it all boils down to hiring SWEs with good problem solving skills and DSA is the way to go!",2023-08-22 12:19:00

131n6vw,IIT tags and it's predicaments xD,"So there's a lot of uproar in this group regarding a post from a random half-wit who probably suffered from a deflated ego when he encountered a real life situation where companies care more about skills and less about IIT tags. I believe he has successfully triggered a lot of people here who have tremendous inferiority complex for not having the IIT tag. Otherwise, that post wouldn't get as much attention as it actually got. 

B.tech CSE from IITs doesn't really count when it comes to Software development. The curriculum is almost the same even for tier-3 colleges and let's be honest people can self-learn and move ahead of the curve when it comes to Software engineering.

It gets interesting when it comes to M.tech CSE from IITs. LinkedIn and YouTube influencers have successfully instilled this notion that IIT tag is an important social tag which demands respect. Another aspect which bothers me is when people sell this IIT dream only for the sake of the ""20lpa on-campus package"". Of course placements are great in IITs but if you choose to do a M.tech from IITs and placements are your end goal, your ambitions are highly flawed. You can land a 4lpa job after B.tech, keep upskilling and land the same 20lpa job after a period of 2-3 years. You will have more work experience and actual development skills which are sought after by the top companies compared to theoretical knowledge and an ""IIT tag"".

It's worth it to pursue a M.tech from IITs only if you belong from a core branch ( EC/EE/ME ) or if you belong from CSE and want to pursue PhD / research/ teaching. If money is your end goal, there are a lot easier ways and better ways to earn that money. More and more students keep getting into M.tech only for the sake of jobs and then you wonder why India couldn't produce quality scholars and researchers. M.tech is supposed to be a research-oriented higher education and certainly not a means to land a high paying job. 

I don't see people talking about these aspects. I would love to hear all your views regarding the same.",2023-04-28 09:56:40

18foujn,Any reason why there's still no separate CS entrance test for Undergrads?,"I just find it a little insane that even something like B.Arch (Architecture) has it's own paper during JEE, without sitting for which afaik you cannot apply for B.Arch courses, and yet, for getting into a CS course, all it takes is physics, chemistry, and math? Regardless of whether it is a government or a private college. No one seems to test for even basic computer knowledge. I had a guy tell me in 2nd year, ""mera Apple wala phone hai isme Google (search) nahi aata"". 

And the result I see is thousands of people in these colleges learning to print ""Hello World"" in 2 year (because surprise, physics/chemistry/math again in first year of CS degree). Wouldn't it be a better use of resources if people would at least be tested on basic coding/DSA as *part of* the entrance exam for CS courses (a separate paper mandatory for CSE eligibility)?

After all, you don't start studying the constitution after cracking UPSC, you don't *start* learning law after passing the Bar, then why is it so different for Computer Engineering?",2023-12-11 07:14:37
17u7juk,Which country to opt for Masters CS? Details below,"Im planning to pursue Masters in CS abroad but given the recession conditions all over world I‚Äôm confused about which country would be the best for that.    
Since many of you guys are knowledgeable about this topic, please suggest a country considering these aspects:   

- I have 2 backlogs in sem 1 which i cleared in sem 3. 
- Is work ex necessary or not?
- Long term stability (Is it possible to settle there easily or start a family).   
- Visa (Is it easy to get work visa/ citizenship). 
- Job opportunities.  
- Work life balance.  
- Chances of getting admission in top universities    
- Quality/Standard of life. 
- No. of years to complete Masters.  
- Should we rely on agents who help in admissions?   

For so many years, I was convinced that I will be settling in UK and my mama‚Äôs family is living there since 15yrs too. I have always adored the beauty of Europe and always wished to settle there but recession has spoiled my plans but i still want to live in a cold, beautiful, less populated country. Im biased towards Uk and kinda hate US because of their laws, government, shootings and city full of buildings where 12hr work and hustle culture and less vacation days is glorified. Im aware that salary in US is way more as compared to UK but i prefer spending my weekends in europe more (i hate city life). Also considering the Visa and sponsorship situation in US, its more difficult to find a job there as I‚Äôve seen so many people come back to india for jobs after masters in US. I definitely want to settle outside India.   

But apart from all this I still want to pursue Masters from a country where i can get a job and repay my loan and have a decent life. So if there are other countries apart from US UK pls suggest them too",2023-11-13 10:09:48
16fm1gs,Unpopular Opinion: DSA as an evaluation parameter for jobs and internships is outdated.,"I'm not saying you shouldn't learn DSA, as a programmer you should know about different data structures and Algorithm and also what should be implemented when but grinding leetcode seems pointless. If there is a DSA problem and you have an idea of how to solve it then you don't need to code it because AI can do it for you. So giving DSA questions for evaluation is pointless now because of that, rather implementing something moderately big should be there by using all the tools at your disposal like AI and the internet in general.",2023-09-11 04:39:41

We asked our lectures and they weren't much helpful about it. They just said ""we'll see once you're in 5th sem"".

Cut short to today: i gained significant knowledge both in business as well technical stuff (with no certification! I lost respect towards it you'll know why) now every day i spend atleast 3-4 hours sitting and debugging with the other certified devs because they cant bloody solve simple bugs, up until the point that dictate the code what needs to be done and they just type it. I'm losing my mind. I'm able to somehow finish my stuff within gievn timeframe thats different. When i ask my lead how do I handle these issues he says it's the part of work to deal with those guys. I'm up for lead developer position in few months in this team. I need real suggestions on how to deal with these guys.

Should i ask to be moved to a different team? Look in other business unit in same company?

I finally started learning it properly last month and I am making one small Event Management Website for practice where I am using Firebase for the backend, but planning to eventually port it to my own backend once I start learning backend. 

Now I kept delaying learning React just after Tailwind because I want to be a Game Developer. Amd I was learning and Practicing Unity, a Game Engine. It is my dream to make my own studio one day, since I was in class 8, and I came to know about Unity. I have made a couple small games in Unity, and currently doing a Game Development internship. Unity uses C#, therefore I have quite good practice with it. But the thing is being a Game Developer is hard, and making a Game Studio is harder. As for the jobs in this field, the salaries are less, the opportunities are limited. So I just want to keep one backup option if Gane Development as a career fails for me. Making a game requires money, which I don't have. That's why I am trying Web Development and want to do freelancing projects so I can get money to make games.

1aceqm3,Need advice transitioning to IT from mechanical design,"Hey techies,

A Mechie here, I have 2 years international and 6 months in a local startup work experience in mechanical design engineering. During my engineering days I self taught myself coding and then learnt data science and analytics through IBM data science program and udacity nanodegree. Right now I feel I should have taken the Data science track after graduation. 
The salary and benefits in mechanical field is not even 30% of what IT offers even for an expert in the field.
Please suggest me what would be a right path for me to make this transition. Is it better to release the data science concepts and go the DS route or learn some other language and take the software development/web development route.",2024-01-27 16:33:26

next sem(4th), we have to search for interships as its compulsory.

feeling extremely depressed and downright suicidal, can you guys suggest somethings that I can STILL do to cover up all this and achieve better, options in your mind.

1. willing to work hard now

I want to help you guys out.

I) Graduated with a Good GPA ( > 8.5 ) from a well known university majoring in Computer Science - so you know my academics are sorted.

II) Scored 328 in GRE and received admits from the top universities in USA ( including universities with stature of Ivy League )

III) Work in a Unicorn / Decacorn Startup - so that you know my credentials are verified.

IV) Promoted from Software Engineer to Senior Software Engineer in about 1.5 years - so that you know that I know how to do actual work.

V) Have Had Remote Jobs in the past and once upon a time during my college years , I had been a top rated freelancer on Upwork as well .

17l5yxl,"Commemorating our ""70 hours a week""","Hey Guys,This might be a long post to read but please bear with me as it is likely that you may find it intriguing and fitting.

So I was watching this video on Ted Kazcensky, the notorious Unabomber. One of the highlights from his long and paranoia-inducing case, (circa 1970-2000) was his famous ""*Unabomber Manifesto*"".

Published by the New York Times, his original writings, back in 1995, it had 33 pages split into concise paragraph-like bullet points explaining his thoughts on ""*What is wrong with the modern Society*""

Now being a social pariah, a serial bomber and a murderer (3 out of his 12 bombs, unfortunately, proved to be lethal), I neither want myself to immerse nor promote any of his philosophies, as I said before, he is a terrorist.

But since here in India, the celebrations of our **""70 Hour Work Week""** are going on in full swing. I found something in his manifesto (will quote directly here), that adds a little more flavour to the statements spoken and supported by our capitalists.

Before I mention the excerpts, I'd like to roughly simplify the quote said by Mr. Narayan Murthy so that we dive into this from the same perspective.

""*To make India an economic superpower, we need our youngsters to change their work ethic. They need to work harder, essentially suggesting to put in even 70 Hours per week.*""

Okay, here are the points....

&#x200B;

>...*Apparently it never occurs to them that you cannot make rapid, drastic changes in the technology and economy of a society without causing rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevitably break down the traditional values*...  
>  
>  
>  
>...*Beyond that, a technological society HAS TO weaken family ties and local communities if it is to function efficiently. In modern society an individual's loyalty must be first to the system and secondarily to a small scale community because if the internal loyalties of small-scale communities were stronger than loyalty to the system, such companies would pursue their own advantage at the expense of the system...*

&#x200B;

Again, I repeat, **I DO NOT support the Unabomber or any of his writings or his ways,** but this is something I found interesting and thought I should share.

I hope it does not get removed by the mods.

Peace out.",2023-11-01 06:30:14

15va8hw,Should I join a company with 6 LPA salary?,"I am a 2023 computer science graduate from a Tier-2 college, and I had got a 6 month software engineering internship offer from a reputed company which paid a lot. I regret not trying off campus for a full time offer at that time only. 


Now my internship is over (where I couldn't get a full time offer due to less vacancy), and I've been looking for a job from 1 ¬Ω months. I have applied to 150+ companies and even took referrals by cold messaging people on LinkedIn for many of them. 
Till now I have only received 3 interview calls, where 2 of them were due to directly emailing HRs of startups, and other one was a company to which I had applied without a referral.


I haven't received an OA/interview call for any other company even after referral, and that is quite disheartening for me. 
Now I have a chance to apply at a company (based out of Chandigarh) which is offering a 6 LPA salary, but the role is Research Analyst. The work would be trying to invalidate patents filed by other companies by searching for similar topics on google.


I feel fairly confident that if I apply, I'll get an interview for it (as my friend works there, and he said they're hiring at the moment). 
As far as I know the work would not be too difficult, but to be honest the role as well as the compensation is not what I am looking for. I really want to be in a coding role for now, and I was applying to companies with atleast 9/10 LPA+ salary.


The only reason I'm considering this company is because I haven't been receiving any other interview calls and I thought I would join here, and continue applying to other companies as well as doing DSA for interview preparation in my free time.

But again the cons here for me are the compensation and the role (as it won't require coding). 
Also I had a surgery some time back so I need to have a physiotherapy session everyday for atleast 6 months. If I go for that in the evening after work, I would reach late at my PG/flat, and I think I would have less time and energy left for applying to jobs and interview prep.

15kszzd,I've joined this one service based company 35 days back. I'm feeling a bit weirded out by the whole setup of the company as I'm in my training period with nothing to do and still am being paid in full.,"I've joined this one service based company 35 days back. I havent been assigned to any projects as of yet. 

Today I spoke to one such employee from the company and from them I've understood that , every new employee goes through a 70 day training period where they won't be assigned to any projects. At the end of the training period they'll be assigned to a project which matches their current skill set.

I'm honestly feeling a bit weird about this , as the company has been paying me the full salary without me doing any work.

Is this whole setup a red flag?

What do I do to make my time more productive?

Please suggest me.,"I am IT employee having nearly 18 months experience in a small low-paying company. I don't know how to ride a bike & scooty. I don't even know how to ride a bicycle because it has been years since I used a bicycle. I feel ashamed when girls & even youngsters ride bikes/scooty that too in heavy traffic areas effortlessly.

Now things are becoming very difficult for me. I see my parents aging quickly.  Friends are ignoring me as they always have to pick & drop me whenever we meet.

I must learn bike & scooty driving as soon as possible and I should get perfection to comfortably  ride in tier-1 heavy traffic areas like bangalore.  But there are no proper two wheeler driving schools having places like uncrowded open grounds to learn driving basics. So, I am thinking to put resignation and go back to my village and take break for 3-4 months for learning driving. But is it a good idea? I don't have any EMIs to pay. I have enough savings for 4 months.  But is it a good idea? Please suggest me. What should I do now please suggest? What will you do if you're in my place?

I'm planning to get a MacBook for my development needs, but I'm a bit confused about how much RAM I should aim for.

So, if any of you have any knowledge about how to apply to these mentorships then it'll help me a lot. My skill sets are Java, JavaScript, node.js, React, git & GitHub which are aligning with the skill sets which are needed for these mentorships. But I didn't know which to choose to maximize my selection chance as I can only apply for three mentorships at a time and I also didn't have any knowledge of writing the cover letters.  
So, if anybody is reading this post and has any type of knowledge of how to approach these mentorships then it'll help me a lot.

11wolvh,My bittersweet job experience at Apple,"Long Post Alert:

&#x200B;

I am a data scientist in Apple (with 3 y/o experience here and 1yr. somewhere else before) in Bangalore. 

&#x200B;

I started off at ICT2 level (lowest level in tech) and got promoted to ICT 3 level last year. In my 3 years at Apple, my fixed compensation grew from 16lpa to the current 26lpa. Not sure what to feel about that, but to me the growth is kind of slow given that it also includes the increment due to promotion. However, not slow enough to be a deal breaker. 10-15% of the fixed compensation is the typical annual bonus.

&#x200B;

Lately, I have been thinking of switching to a new company, but here are some reasons which stop me: 

&#x200B;

1. One noticeably big part of the compensation is Restricted Stock Grant (RSU). Apple grants a ton of RSUs which have a vesting schedule of 4 years (1/8th quantity half yearly schedule). I did not get stock grants as part of joining, but after annual reviews and promotion, I have close to $160K under vesting and about another $20K already vested. So, switching means saying bye-bye to over 1cr which is too big an amount to let go for me. Not to mention, if over the next 4 years, I'll continue getting more grants and the stock is also going to rise (hopefully).
2. The team I work for is a project based team where every person has multiple projects under ownership. I have about 3 projects under my ownership, and I assist with four other projects. The issue is, in every project, the context is different, but the kind of work I do is the same. This is saturating my interest big time. 
3. I, being a 26 y/o, the team is good, but refuses to have young people in there. There is one person younger than me, one person at age 30 and the rest of them are 35yrs and above. I feel like I am becoming more mature than my age allows for when I hear the discussions around real estate, finance, schools, parenting, etc.
4. In the kind of work I do, I frequently work with teams across globe. As it turns out, I might have meetings late evening like 10:00pm and early morning like 7:00am. This may be OK for now and people on the other end are understanding if there are circumstances, but I do not know if I can sustain it once I move on in life. 
5. There is no real non-monetary benefits to working at Apple apart from getting discounts on Apple products (which help my friends and relatives more than me). No free food, no goodies (except for iPhone and MacBook for work if that counts), no Sodexo, no NPS contribution option, no good eating facilities (even on payment basis), no company paid health insurance for parents, etc. 
6. This is tied to 2. point. These days, I do not feel like I am learning anything new. For some, it may be OK, but at least at this stage of my career, I want to get exposed to more things than just work what is given to me. My job fails to do it, but not sure, even in other jobs, it'd be any better. 

&#x200B;

So, my request is how should I plan / continue with my career? I have the following options:

1. Continue with how it is. 
2. Change teams within Apple. Won't be happening this year at the least due to economic situations and cost cutting measures.
3. Change job / profile. This would be really expensive for me.",2023-03-20 17:07:45

Scaler could actually work well if they were to offer corporate training. The problem is, their courses are very expensive and they are targeting freshers or existing employees. Employees already earning well do not need their courses. Employees who have started with a small income 
and freshers can't afford their courses. There are much better options that do not cost a fortune.

Given that many of the ones teaching are well qualified, they are no doubt offering better education than colleges. But then, if all the money is already wasted on college education, how can the college graduates afford to spend a similar amount on upskilling?",2023-11-09 13:37:05

I'm in my first year and it has genuinely put me in the lowest spot of my life. In short, the College is terrible and I don't see myself surviving 1 year here, much less 4. 

I've started looking into other colleges, mostly abroad but there's one that stood out to me in India. This college offers transfer admission, but they only have a BSc in CS rather than a BTech. The reason I want to attend it is because most of the people I've grown up with are attending that University, and the college environment (judging from my few visits) is monumentally more friendly and accepting. I feel like I would fit in there much better, and it would improve the quality of my mental state by leaps and bounds. However, what I'm concerned about it the placements. I understand the opinions on this sub are varying when it comes to B.Tech vs B.Sc, and though there are many people giving hope for BSc students, I genuinely wish to know if it'll affect my future in a realistic sense. 

At one hand I really want to transfer, but I'm legitimately concerned it will ruin my possibilities at a successful future. In your opinion, is it worth sacrificing B.Tech for B.Sc if it means I'll be happier for the next 3 years?",2023-11-12 09:30:34

Now for this particular full stack project that I am in, they are using some weird ass platform that no one has ever heard to design the frontend. Even google and chatgpt gives no response when I type the name of this platform. Basically they have partnered with this company which provides a platform to create web applications in a low code no code manner, but it is so crap that you have to write entire page in vanilla JS anyways.

I have literally no support, the training videos do not help at all as they are building entirely different application than the one built in the training videos. My senior who is supposed to be the 'expert' in this platform is busy everytime and does not come to the office (permanent wfh). I just have to say that ""I am still learning"" in my daily standups, the manager also ignores me and do not assign any tasks to me, everything is taken care of by my senior, I feel useless as I just create a UI the whole day without knowing whether it will be useful or not, the entire project I don't know what is going on.

I've learned basic HTML, CSS, JS, and templating view engines like EJS for the frontend. I've also delved into Node.js and MongoDB for the backend. Using these technologies, I created a simple OLX clone and also using socket.io for chat functionality.

My aim is to secure a job, regardless of the salary, to validate my progress.  I've applied to numerous positions through platforms like Hirect, LinkedIn, Naukri, etc. However, I haven't received any callbacks. The jobs I applied had like 1LPA salary and 10k per month internships.

17g6yjw,My story for those people scared about their future,"In 2014, I began a job with a modest salary of 3.3 lakhs per annum. A mere few months later, the company shut its doors, and I found myself jobless. It was a tough period, filled with family pressure and self-doubt.

Yet, I came to believe that this adversity was a test, a preparation for the power and position I might hold in the future.

During these difficult times, I learned to distinguish between true friends and others. Some friends stuck by my side when I needed them the most. There's a significant difference between those who genuinely care and those who don't. One such friend was always there to comfort me, to listen to my worries, and to help me see things in a positive light. I was fortunate to have this person with me.

With this friend's unwavering support and my newfound determination, I decided to prepare for the SSC exam. After two years of hard work and their constant companionship, I successfully passed the exam and worked for four years and went on to start my own business. I grew in confidence and learned to navigate life's challenges.

Finally, I realized that this person was the one chosen by a higher power - my partner, my lady luck. This person was with me when I needed them the most and continues to be my source of strength. Some things and some people are sent by God, but we often miss recognizing them. It's better to see them, to talk to them and cherish their presence. This person is my wife, my lady luck now who even though had a busy schedule still never failed to reply me, take out time to talk to me.

In these difficult times, Its better to talk and release that negative energy that is within you and spread out the positive aura from inside.

Hello! So for context, I am 19 (M), currently in 3rd year(6th Semester), BE(Bachelor of Engineering) in a Tier 3 College in Bangalore.
I am currently working as an intern in 2 startups and earning well enough for an intern.
And seeing the current industry environment, where it is very difficult for fresh grads to land internships, I am pretty sure I will land a good job.
Though I am not looking for MNCs right now, but I am positive that if needed I could crack a job since I am already good at CP, just left the practice after starting Fullstack web dev(since its very easy to make money).

So now, for my future I really dont have any plans. My father wants me to do Masters but I after the experience of studying in a tier 3 college I just do not want to study anymore. But now that I am thinking about it more and more and I feel like doing masters from a good university abroad would be good.

So I googled some top level queries but couldn't get useful information and the information was overwhelming and I don't know a proper source of info for this.

Here are some of my queries - 
1) Masters for a BE Grad would be MTech right?
2) I have a strong interest in Maths, and I always wanted to study advanced maths sometime in my life. So any suggestions?
3) if MTech, what are my options, and what are some good universities abroad and whats the process of getting into one? And how difficult is getting into it?
4) being from BE instead of BTech. Does that impact any of this in any way?
5)What would be the difference in my career if I complete  masters?

Note: Though I wanna earn money, I also wanna do something that I like. And right now, development or coding is what I like. And I guess I would wanna continue that in future.

One last thing, I do not wanna make it feel like I am self obsessed or something, but by looking at my friends, my peers, other interns at my company, other graduates devs at my company, I can easily say I am a way better developer. I am sometimes treated as a prodidgy in development because of how good my skills are compared to my age (19). And I feel I can become a very very experienced and skilled CTO or something. 
Dont really know. 

Thankyou for reading this far.

Code here:

    @Configuration

and on the other hand some says it really doesn‚Äôt matter.

Some say not to pursue it in US due to current scenarios with war going on and recession hit.

18ptlza,Tips needed: 2 months into the new job and already feel like quitting,"TLDR: Joined an ex government company, regretting my choices due to long working hours and micromanagers.

My background is in Analytics & Data Science. I have ~ 3 YOE. I recently joined a legacy Indian company which used to be a government company but was recently acquired (or taken back) by an Indian company. (It is very obvious :P)

Anyways, coming to my issues, I am already experiencing a burnout. In two months. The work hours here are really long. Often you have to work on the weekends. And the worse is the ex government Babus. They never had to manage people in 15-20 years of service, now they're managing and most of them are micromanager. Even when you ask for a leave, they aks questions why, what I will do etc.

My previous company was a startup kinda company. And the work culture there was far better. I had high hopes from this job, but nothing is happening. And whenever I had shared this ""radical"" idea of leaving this organisation, people are acting in shock. And asking me to give it some time. Which is correct. But I want to be in the same company for the next 3-4 years. I don't feel like this company will be it. I want to have a personal life outside work which I had, but it might be difficult here.

Another aspect is the notice period. Once the probation is completed, it will be 3 months. Which will be a turn off for a lot of companies.

Don't know what I should do. These guys are hiring massively, but I don't know if the work culture will change much.

My question is should I start looking for other options? What do you guys think?",2023-12-24 11:37:27

Basically, you are allowed to skip characters in between to find the appropriate string, but not look behind from what you have already selected. And from all this logic create a program that finds the longest common string found this way, print it with its length.

183k57q,9 micro SaaS Ideas you can build in 1 Day using no-code tech,"Today, I‚Äôm gonna give you a gift 9 micro SaaS Ideas you can develop very fast, with no tech background (or at least you should use no-code tools that often require management of development flows), but these ideas I‚Äôm going to present you can build and launch in less than 1 Day.

Before we go into the details, there are 3 common points between all the ideas:

They will be based on a no-code tool named Bubble;

They will be based on the AI Market (market size research);

They already have competitors, then they are ‚Äúvalidated‚Äù. There is a proven market, and you can jump in!

**1. AI-Generated Comic**

Artificial intelligence has been transforming various industries, and the world of comic creation is no exception. The use of AI-generated content in comics has been on the rise, with more and more creators and publishers adopting this technology.

Then the first idea is based on comic creation using AI. An example is Neural Canvas.

**2. Buy ChatGPT APP Source Code**

**Helper-AI** ‚Äî [www](http://www.aihelper.buzz/).helperai.info  built the fastest way to access GPT-4 on any site.  Just type ‚Äúhelp‚Äù and instant access GPT-4 on any site without changing tabs again and again. 

Why use it?

‚úì 3x Productivity, Write code & Excel Formulas, Rewrite, Research, and more.

‚úì Work Great with all macOS + Windows.

‚úì Resell at any cost ( 100% Ownership + Source Code ) 

In just 2 months Helper-AI made $2750+ by selling their own AI Startup source code and 100% Ownership, So other also can start their own AI startup in this golden era!!

Download - Helper-AI Source code - Modify, resell and anything you want to do!!

www.helperai.info

**3. AI-Developer Tools**

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly essential to various industries, the market for AI developer tools is rapidly growing. A lot of developers and not only are using AI Developer Tools for increasing their productivity at work.

With the term AI-Developer Tools I mean all the tools that can help people with more complex tasks, using tools like SQL, or Excel, or Python. There are a lot of AI Tools that can help you write SQL, Excel formulas, or Python Code from a description of what you need to do.

For example: ‚Äúwrite me an SQL for analyzing the best markets in my database named Market‚Äù. Or the same example is on Excel formulas, like: ‚ÄúGive me the sum of the columns B and C, minus the negative values‚Äù. Then these tools are going to translate your input (text), into codes, formulas, and more. An example is AI2Sql.

**4. Generate Quizzes from any text**

This is a very interesting market (niche market). You can generate quizzes from any kind of text (input), and any type of quiz, like true and false, Q&A, FAQ, and more. I never invested in this market until now, because I have launched a similar product in that space a few weeks ago.

So I‚Äôm biased, but this product is also one of my favorites.

**5. AI Legal Writer**

The legal industry has traditionally relied on human lawyers to draft legal documents and contracts. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought significant changes to this industry.

AI-powered legal writing tools are now widely used, enabling lawyers to generate high-quality legal documents efficiently and accurately.

Warning: these tools do not replace the work of the lawyer, who is highly qualified and professional, but rather give tips on ‚Äúmass‚Äù topics, or can help you generate ‚Äústandard‚Äù documents like NDA or LOI.

**6. User Persona Generator**

This topic is always very important in marketing strategies and target setting for a business.

What is a User Persona?

User personas are archetypical users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. Usually, a persona is presented in a one or two-page document

Very often, however, it is difficult to ‚Äúconcretize‚Äù, or in any case requires considerable intellectual effort to achieve an efficient result. Well, here I don‚Äôt have a competitor to show you, but there is a YouTube video that really impressed me, and that might be interesting for the development of this idea.

**7. AI Meme Generator**

Raise your hand for those who love Memes. Memes have often become a very important and memorable brand communication strategy.

Memes have become an integral part of our daily lives, providing a quick and often humorous way to communicate ideas and feelings. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), the creation of memes has become more accessible and efficient.

This is definitely an interesting market because it involves not only meme enthusiasts, but also companies engaged in advertising and promotion for their customers, or even small startups with a ‚Äúcomic‚Äù tone of voice. We could be in the B2B market now, or B2B2C.

An example here: Supermeme

**8. AI Background Generator**

To be honest, I don‚Äôt know how ‚Äúsaleable‚Äù this business target is, but it seemed very interesting to put it on this list.

It is definitely very niche and you can use stable diffusion to generate images.

Based on your request (describe the image you want), you have a final result. An example is Photoroom

**9. AI Job Description Builder**

Crafting a comprehensive and effective job description is crucial in attracting the right candidates for a job. However, it can be a time-consuming task for hiring managers and recruiters.

AI-powered job description builders are now available, enabling users to quickly generate job descriptions that are tailored to their specific needs.

This is definitely a very interesting market, definitely B2B. The only limitation here that could arise concerns the ‚Äúhuman touch‚Äù often required for these types of tasks. But I‚Äôm sure giving the user the freedom to edit the job description, and eventually add sections, then giving the user some freedom over content management, can be the winning weapon.

183jxyh,Delhi-Based Lawyer Seeking Tech Collaborators for a SaaS Startup,"
Hello Reddit Community,

I'm a lawyer based in Delhi with a keen interest in technology. Though my expertise lies in law, I've been actively exploring the tech world and am now at the cusp of starting a SaaS venture. To bring this idea to fruition, I am reaching out to find collaborators who share a similar passion for technology and innovation.

I am particularly interested in individuals or teams with experience in AI, ML, NLP, and full-stack development. However, more than just technical skills, I'm looking for partners who are problem-solvers, capable of thinking creatively and navigating challenges in the tech landscape.

If you consider yourself adept in these areas, or possess a unique blend of skills that could contribute to a tech startup, I would love to hear from you. Whether you prefer working in-house, remotely, or as an outsourced partner, there's flexibility to accommodate different working styles.

Let's explore what we can learn from each other and see how we can collaborate to turn this idea into reality.

Looking forward to connecting with the talented individuals in this community.

Thank you.",2023-11-25 13:38:28

17xk90e,A 17 year old PCM student worried about his future.,"Hi, im in class 12th with PCM and as a science student want to pursue engineering(IT related) its not like i took science for money or something, heck even my parents told me to take something else as this might be tough but i took this subject as i love Tech and im into anything and everything IT related (even won a national level hackathon) but i just don't know what would my career look like if i didn't go to a Tier-1 college.

The thing is that i see news going around that grads aren't skilled enough to get jobs and those who are aren't from good colleges so what would happen if i don't get into a Tier-1, Tier-2 college? 

Its not that im not willing to work hard enough to get into those good colleges but the loophole in our system is that i see my classmates and friends are making OBC cards. These guys own fortuners and they want a OBC card. This gives them a unfair advantage in this rat race, they can get the same college in 100 marks that might ask for me to score 170. And if i don't get into these colleges, is my career in tech gone?

I've also heard that first job is something that you get from your college, GPA, connections and not from skills and the 2nd job you get is from your skills. So, if i get  a 4lpa job work hard enough in that job will i get a 30lpa job? Not like just after that job but in couple of years? Cause i am willing to work hard as its something that i enjoy, coding, tech, etc.   

I know college will give me a headstart but will not getting into a good college destroy my career? Will every recruiter that i might face i future look at me and say' You are notqualified for the job as you aren't from  a Tier-1 college'. 

This scares the shit out of me. Please someone help me out, please. And please answer taking in consideration to the time like the situation in tech industry as you guys are really experienced here, some of you are even recruiters. I just want to work in this field.

Now my life has become so monotonous and i m confused of the options that i have right now. I m scared i would be stuck here and loose precious years.

I come from a middle class family and i always wanted a big things in my life no matter what it takes for that. So right now one conventional option that i have is switching the company . Considering the job market looks like its not much feasible. So i can stay here for couple of years and then may be switch and keep doing it till i get nice fat pay check. But i ll prolly be 30, 40 by then lol. Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.

Other option is going for masters. My parents wanted me to go for masters in US. I gave my GRE and scored 314. The only thing thats stopping me is if its right thing to go for masters in US at this point. Also i ll have to take a loan of entire tuition fee cuz my parents are not in a position to fund. So may some 30-40lakh debt if i happen to get a scholarship and then living w insecurity till i pay my debt back (considering current job market). Worst case i might end up jobless and crib about paying my debt back. OR i get a Job and make decent money and payback my debt in no time and then live off life with nice pay. Which otherwise would take years to reach that ladder if i dint do it.

I cant happen to take suggestions from people cuz its entirely from their experiences. Doesn‚Äôt  mean same is gonna happen w me( could work out well or shit hits fan ) .

17liujo,analysis 70 hours work week for Developers productivity,"The 70+ hours work statement has not gone well with the netizens, but people are failing to see the key point. Using a throwaway account to not reveal my identity. Not that the contents of this post would change anyone's mind.

The statement made ""India's youth should work 70 hours every week in a bit to boost the country's overall productivity"" has a few key elements

1. working hours
2. Individual productivity
3. remuneration and recognition 
4. countries productivity

\#1

Comparing working hours with outcome seems to be unmeasurable but can be estimated based on looking at historical data.  If someone assigns you a task, to complete the task, a time is required. From person to person, this takes quite a variance. The number of tasks completed in a quota of time defines one productivity. The data Mr. Murthy got was from his own company Infosys. And he can claim that the current productivity is low in his organization. To achieve an optimal productivity the person would need to work 70 hours. But it is not ideal to expand the same notion to all the companies and all the developers.

\#2

Developer's productivity is hard to define. You cannot decide against number of codes written nor hours worked. Businesses however compares this against goals set vs goals met.  Efficiency will result raising the bar for goals set in future while inefficiency will result in lowering the bar. Considering a constant realistic bar, the productivity can be increased by working more hours or finding efficient techniques. 

People are commenting that giving more salary would result in more productivity. That will apply to inefficient people who needs extra working hours to maintain the expected goals. The extra money motivates them to spend more time. 

Efficient people on the other hand, to increase productivity finds efficient methods. They should be rewarded for being efficient. This is how all these great developer productivity tools are built because someone somewhere got bored of doing things the plain way. Giving more money upfront does not guarantee efficiency. 

\#3

Advertise a job for 50LPA, 50 hours a week. Here everyone with current salary lower than this will be applying (so assume 99% of Indian IT workforce) , cause we love money. 

Advertise a second job for 50 LPA, 72 hours a week (12 hours x 6 days). Here also people will apply, why ? cause we love money. 

Loving money isn't bad, but you are a worker. Since you didn't go into the way of starting your own company, you are likely to work FOR someone. The Company proposes a work requirement, a remuneration, working hours and range of benefits.  You as a Worker advertises your skillset.  As per recent trends, irrespective of what you can provide, people tend to choose maximum benefits with less work. The company on the other hand looks for the best person with lower remuneration. Why ? the company needs to generate profits while maintaining the productivity.

Is it wrong for workers to ask for high money, lower working hours, better benefits ? NO ! 

Is it wrong for companies to advertise low money , with higher working hours, poor benefits for their requirement ?  Is the company obligated to ? NO !! 

Are you obligated to join these companies ? NO ! 

Can a worker with ambition of high money, lower working hours, better benefits join a company offering lower money, higher working hours, poor benefits ? Yes if they wish to . Is it justifiable to whine and blame the company cause your requirements are not met ? NO !! It is you who failed to acquire your requirements. 

Would you, if you don't have the skill but offered to join a company with better benefits ? 99% of us would do.

Both company and workers are having the same goal. Earn more money. Who is going to be recognized, Zomato or an employee of Zomato. 

You are a mere number in their system. You deliver as promised, they pay as promised, irrespective of hours worked. End of story. Don't get ahead of yourself.  

\#4 

Countries productivity even though it should not is measured by GDP to hours worked.  If you work for more hours while the GDP stays constant, there is decrease in productivity. On the other hand, if the GDP increases while hours worked in constant, there is an increase in productivity. 

Unlike Mr Murthy, I would suggest, get more productive by being more efficient. 

Next, 

For any organization, there is an investment and there is an return. if a US investor invests in Indian Company, assuming the company grows, the return also grows. Assume there is 100 rupees in the Indian system \[Over simplification\]. A US Investor came and invested 20 more rupees into a company that is worth 10 rupees. The system has now 120 rupees and company worth 30 rupees. The company earns revenue an revenue of further 20 rupees from the system. The system has now 120 rupees, company 50 rupees. The investor sells his stake to the system and gets the return of 33 rupees. He withdraws it. The system has now 87 rupees and the company 50 rupees. 

Who is in loss out of investor/company/system ? The system. 

Now assume another scenario. There is a Indian system of 100 rupees. A company is present with 30 rupees. The company earns an revenue from US company with 10 rupees. The company now has 40 rupees. The Indian System now has 110 rupees. 

Who is in loss out of clients/company/system now ?

Linking the money present in the system to GDP, which case presents a better scenario for Indian economy ? 

\#5

Few more observations

1. I have seen many people fighting to earn additional percent in annual review while demanding more work from the maid with less money. If you are one of them, so don't deny with Mr. Murthy 
2. I have seen developers knowing basically nothing, earning in huge salary while good developers with good skills working for a lower salary.
3. Redditors here impose the perception that market pays you 20-30+ LPA for average developers. Learn about survivorship bias folks.  ",2023-11-01 18:32:41

17l8rub,"Bad Job, Bad Company, and Bad Management: My Recent Work Nightmare","So I joined this company 3 months back in July 2023. It was a service based company and before my joining I even low-balled my expectations for them. They told me that my current location is Ghaziabad  and they will try to keep a project i.e. remote or close to my location(Delhi/NCR). Then they gave me laptop which was not even properly formatted, was so dirty that I had to clean the hair and dust of the previous developer who had used the laptop before. I still persisted and gave interviews for the client. I cleared the interview and after clearing they told me the location of the client is in Gurugram, which was 2-2.5hrs from my location. I told them that it would really be uncomfortable for me to join the client at that location. After that I still went. They assigned me a manager that was so dull and unprofessional. The client management and people treated me like I was a thief. Since it took me 2-2.5hrs to reach the office, it was told to me that just go for 2 days. So this continued. They gave a bad feedback of mine during the time I worked there. They delibrately called me to office and all the other people there was so horrible and did not want to talk to me.The head there even said,

>*See you come from Ghaziabad, again that's not my fault etc.*

After that on 5th October, they gave a final feedback that my performance is poor etc. When I confronted them, they said there is no more work which we have for you that's why we have ended the project from our side. On the same day my parent company told me that we are putting you on notice period and that's why please look somewhere else.

I even had reported the same issues while I worked at the client side to my CEO and HR regarding the behaviour of management of client. HR did nothing. CEO started yelling at me for not giving a better **performace.**

Before going to the client side, the CEO of company even had a call with me saying me BS like

>*We are developer friendly company etc, non-sense.*

TLDR: Horrible work experience at an organization

If you've heard the term but are still scratching your head, fear not. We're here to break it down into bite-sized pieces. RWA tokenization might sound like a mouthful, but it's a game-changing concept that's poised to shake up the global economy.

 

[**Impact of RWA Tokenization on the Global Economy**](https://www.aconomy.io/aconomy-blogs/impact-of-rwa-tokenization-on-the-global-economy)

[ Impact of RWA Tokenization on the Global Economy](https://preview.redd.it/ecw6enoh1ytb1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=77d7e65d6030376edb0e02b4c293486f88e5f34a)

In this article, we'll unravel the mystery of RWA tokenization, exploring what it is, how it works, and the profound impact it's set to have on our world. So, buckle up and join us on this exciting journey!

**What is RWA Tokenization?**

To get things rolling, let's begin with the basics. RWA stands for ""Risk-Weighted Asset."" But what's a Risk-Weighted Asset, and how does it relate to tokenization? Let's break it down.

Risk-Weighted Assets are a way for banks and financial institutions to assess the risk associated with their assets, like loans or investments. Not all assets are created equal when it comes to risk. Some are like a stroll in the park, while others are a rollercoaster ride.

RWA tokenization takes these risk-weighted assets and turns them into digital tokens. It's like transforming physical money into digital coins for your online transactions. But instead of dollars or euros, we're dealing with assets and their risk profiles.

**How Does RWA Tokenization Work?**

Now, you might be wondering, ""How on earth do they turn assets into tokens?"" It's not magic, but it's pretty darn clever.

**Here's how it works:**

1. **Assessing Risk**: First, financial institutions evaluate the risk associated with each asset. They consider factors like the likelihood of default, market volatility, and other variables to determine how risky an asset is.
2. **Tokenization**: Once they've calculated the risk, they assign a digital token to represent that asset. The riskier an asset, the more tokens it gets. These tokens are like a digital certificate that says, ""Hey, this asset is worth X amount and comes with Y level of risk.""
3. **Trading and Transactions**: These digital tokens can be bought, sold, or traded on digital platforms, just like cryptocurrencies. This makes it easier for financial institutions to manage their assets and for investors to diversify their portfolios.
4. **Regulations**: Of course, it's not a free-for-all. There are regulations in place to ensure transparency and security in these transactions. Governments and financial authorities keep a close eye to prevent any monkey business.

**The Impact of RWA Tokenization on the Global Economy**

Now that we've got the basics down, let's explore the exciting part: how RWA tokenization is set to rock the global economy.

1. **Efficiency and Accessibility**: RWA tokenization makes the financial system more efficient and accessible. It simplifies the way assets are managed and traded, reducing the need for intermediaries. This means lower costs and fewer barriers for people to invest in assets.
2. **Diversification**: For investors, it's a game-changer. RWA tokenization allows for easier diversification of portfolios. Instead of putting all your eggs in one risky basket, you can spread your investments across a range of assets, each with its risk profile.
3. **Reduced Risk**: Risk doesn't vanish, but RWA tokenization makes it more transparent. Investors can now make informed decisions about their investments based on the risk tokens associated with assets.
4. **Liquidity**: It adds a layer of liquidity to the market. Tokenized assets are more easily tradable, and this can help boost liquidity in financial markets.
5. **Inclusivity**: With lower entry barriers, RWA tokenization opens up investment opportunities to a broader audience. People who previously couldn't access certain assets can now participate in the market.
6. **Global Reach**: The beauty of digital tokens is that they are not bound by geographical constraints. This means that investors from around the world can access and trade these assets, opening up global opportunities.

**The Challenges**

Of course, no innovation comes without its challenges. Here are a few obstacles that RWA tokenization faces:

1. **Regulatory Hurdles**: While regulation is necessary, navigating the regulatory landscape can be a challenge. Financial authorities need to strike a balance between enabling innovation and protecting investors.
2. **Security Concerns**: As with any digital technology, there's always the risk of cyberattacks. Ensuring the security of these digital tokens is a top priority.
3. **Education**: People need to understand how RWA tokenization works to make the most of it. Education is key, and financial institutions must play a role in spreading awareness.

**The Aconomy Perspective**

Aconomy, a leading player in this arena, has been at the forefront of RWA tokenization. They offer a platform that simplifies the tokenization process and provides a secure environment for buying, selling, and trading tokenized assets.

You can learn more about their vision and the impact of RWA tokenization in the global economy by visiting their blog [here](https://www.aconomy.io/aconomy-blogs/impact-of-rwa-tokenization-on-the-global-economy).

**Conclusion**

In a world where digital innovations are changing the way we live and work, RWA tokenization is set to redefine how we handle assets and investments. It brings efficiency, accessibility, and transparency to the financial world, empowering investors and institutions alike.

While there are challenges to overcome, the potential benefits are enormous. RWA tokenization could democratize finance, allowing more people to participate in the global economy and make informed investment decisions.

So, whether you're a seasoned investor or just someone curious about the future of finance, keep an eye on RWA tokenization. It's a game-changer that's here to stay, and it might just be the key to unlocking new opportunities in the global economy.",2023-10-13 10:05:01

16erhcu,FOMO is real.... Guide me little,"I've been actively following this subreddit lately, and I'm in search of some guidance.

To get straight to the point, I'm a second-year Computer Science student attending a college that falls somewhere between tier 2 and 3, somewhat in the middle. Unfortunately, I've found that my seniors aren't particularly inspiring, and our faculty seems to be stuck in outdated teaching methods.

I've been coding and tinkering for the past 4-5 years, which has given me a substantial edge over not just my peers but also the broader department (I'm not trying to boast here).

Here's a snapshot of my technical skills:
- Python: Advanced
- C/C++: Proficient
- Web Development: Solid knowledge of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (although my frontend skills could use some improvement)
- Backend: Proficient in Flask, I've touched  in Django and FastAPI as well.
Also databases like nosql and sql

I've completed many projects that uses these technologies, and I also possess a strong understanding of electronics, including microcontroller programming, sensor interactions, and IoT protocols like MQTT.

However, I've recently hit a wall in my learning journey. A friend of mine is delving into AI, but they primarily rely on pre-existing logic rather than creating anything original. This has sparked FOMO within me, as I'm not well-versed in cutting-edge technologies like AI.

Since you guys have industry experience,

Could you please provide some insights into where I currently stand with my knowledge? While I understand the importance of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for coding interviews, I'm open to guidance in other areas as well.

Thank you, fellow redditors! (‚Å†‚úø‚Å†^‚Å†‚Äø‚Å†^‚Å†)",2023-09-10 05:10:05

So, now my question is: Is it actually possible to get a job in IT sector with Arts degree? Before switching to humanities, I had a goal of doing B.arch, but I realized that tuition for colleges in my state was not great (meaning they were quite high) and being an architect might not be for me. So, now I am thinking of doing BCA after 12th. I quite liked my time with computer in class 8 through class 10, when we were being taught Java, and since I do not think I want to do a BA in english or history or something, I thought BCA is a good idea.

But, seeing people from this subreddit (and getting feedback from my friends and family), I am getting a bit disheartened, some are saying BCA is useless while some are saying BCA is good, while some are saying to do BCA + MCA. So, what should I do? Please help.",2023-09-03 19:45:07

I've spent two years in investment banking (finance) and make 15-17LPA covering FinTech (B2B SaaS) companies, well-versed with the business and fundraising side of things. Long term goal involves doing a tech startup (most likely FinTech) and was exploring the feasibility of switching career paths to acquire tech skills.

I've thought of switching into product management and/or developer roles but was not sure if anyone would take a chance on someone who doesn't have an engineering degree. Was wondering if it's possible without a paycut?

Some relevant information:
- I'm generally pretty smart and learn things fast (overall a polymath)
- Got experience managing/mentoring juniors
- Excellent communication skills (esp. with international folks)
- Basic knowledge of Python, HTML, CSS and a bit of JS
- Can make B-plans, financial models and pitch decks
- Good at strategising and planning from a business pov

Definitely not looking to join TCS/Wipro/Infosys, would prefer younger product based companies with more responsibilities.

So I've been doing leetcode questions but I've noticed that I always ending to up trying to optimise my code as much as i can. I try to write clean readable code, but bhenever I submit my code it is on average better than 70%, but at this point I end up wasting hours trying to optimise it to reach higher. Not to mention the inconsistency with leetcode servers, sometimes the code will get 90%tile,  run it again and it'll get 60%tile or visa versa.

Anyways, so i usually end up trying to optimise my code as much as possible, after getting an acceptable score I'll go check the top performing code, and most of the time it's usually the same code copy pasted by everyone. They don't even bother to change the variable names or the comments. There are others who have done their own work sure, but 70% are the same, searching for the problem on Google and copying the first result. At this point does the number of problems solved even matter?

My two questions from this, 
1. Should I actually even try to optimise my code, or just continue to the next problem after solving it at any time percentile? Ie quantity over quality?
2. If everyone can just copy paste leetcode solutions, how and why does it have any value at all?",2023-07-30 04:14:34

14vp8iu,Should I consider a career in CS?,"I'm about to enter my UG and I'm confused as to what career I should take considering I'm gay. 

A little background: I was preparing for med college (NEET-UG), and during the preparation, finally accepted that I'm gay. This year, I am getting a govt medical seat, but I am also getting CS in a reputed govt college. While I was very passionate about medicine, I feel burnt out, and the prospects of medicine don't seem very good, specially because I want to move abroad. It's a lot of hard work, and their are a lot of tests for getting a license to practice medicine abroad. 

Opposed to this, I have the image that it is relatively easier in CS field to move abroad, and it pays well too. But having no prior experience in this domain, I am not sure if this would be the right choice for me. Also, going into CS will mean I will probably have to leave Biology, except if I specialize in Bioinformatics/Comp. Biology, which again are very niche fields. With the recent mass layoffs, it also seems risky. I will probably have to go for masters, which is quite expensive. I'm from a middle class family, and it might complicate things.

I want to ask what your experiences have been, if you're in medicine or CS. Do you feel it's worth taking the risk? What will you advice a young gay person?",2023-07-10 09:38:57
14uyovu,Should I practice LeetCode or Work on Foss projects as a frontend developer?,"I'm currently at my final year and I'm already doing an Internship as a Front-End developer and I also have some side projects.

I'm trying to find new opportunities as a Frontend developer and I can't get any success. I'm getting nothing but ghosted.

I'm confused on what to do next.

Should I continue working on side projects and keep on applying (I completely lost hope on this)?

Or should I learn DSA (I suck at DSA) and try something like relevel or apply for companies that take in people using DSA?

Or is there any other way?

So here is my situation : 

I just passed out 12th class in PCM, I got average rank in jee mains and other entrance examination although I worked hard but maybe it wasn't enough,

Now i am confused between colleges, branch, and many other things,

1. I am getting very unknown kind of branch (not even BTECH it's BSC) in Tier 1 college : this branch have placement of median 12 LPA,  mostly in finance & consulting and excellent infra and facilities and college life
2. I am getting branch like production in Tier 2 college : this branch have placement of median 10.10 LPA,  also mostly in non core/finance....., average infra, good college life 
3. I am getting CSE Branch in State Government college : placement for this college is median 7.2 LPA for CSE branch, average infrastructure and college life, I have attached placement stats of this college.

Fees is not issue as all three are government colleges and select students through gov counselling

Now I have interest in CS but these days i guess everyone has interest in cs and job market is also not good right know which is making me nervous and i am getting it only in this college, my question may sound dumb but i am confused what to choose and my main goal is placement but cs branch has alot of growth potential and i have interest in this CSE Branch, also i want to do ms from abroad also but it is too risky to think from now only because who knows what will be situation after 4 years, first i was happy choosing tier 1 college but my mind is unsettling and somewhere in my mind and heart i want to take cs branch but then also there is this Tier 1 college which i am getting so i am very confused and my mind and heart just changes from one option to other

The catch is that the company kinda looks shady due to it's low number of staff, the director literally being the recruiter and HR. The company has been running for 6-7 years (according to a public website which shares info. about registered companies) but it still seems like a start up (again due to low number of employees). There are many conditions to abide by which includes Mon-Sat working days(10am-7pm), no stipend for the first month and only onwards from second month etc. Im guessing ill be in a team of 3 as the recruiter(aka director) told that they have 2-3 ""critical"" projects coming up.

14t3juq,Tech is done for humans with the advent of AI tools like ChatGPT and with oversaturation of people from other fields.,"I see so many non-techs posting about switching over to tech, the understatement being it's for the pay. Well here are some facts for you:

1. If you don't have a BE/BTech, you're most likely not gonna be hired by a big firm since this is one of the minimal requirements. You're going to get rejected in resume shortlisting round.

2. DSA takes time to understand, and understanding the intricacies of system design, best practices, and other under the hood stuff of being a *good* coder takes even longer. 2-3 mahine DSA karke kuch nahi milne wala, agar kuch milta bhi hai to it'll be very short-lived esp because in the next 5 years low-level human coding will be replaced by AI.

3. So many of you have jumped on the Python train after hearing AI/ML buzzwords or on JS (and related stacks) after hearing about webdev that the market is too saturated even for internships. There's plenty of evidence on this community to prove how much the market is willing to pay a newbie like you. And it's EXACTLY like that.

4. AI/ML is research driven, it requires that you read a lot of research papers and keep up with what's latest. Additionally, you need to have excellent understanding of probabilistic models to understand what's going on and why a certain model works. 

5. Companies have started testing replacing human low level coders with code generated by AI (which requires some tweaking as of now). Watch some of the talks by Sam Altman, he says that soon we will just need to give proper prompts and AI will write the complete code for us. This will be much cheaper than having human coders and will result in inevitable layoffs. 

6. You're becoming prone to scammers who take huge sums of money in promise of a job, or to below par content creators selling their bullshit courses. 

Please stop this starry-eyed switch to tech in hopes of big money, our industry is inevitably on the verge of mass layoffs. If you're planning a switch, be very careful.",2023-07-07 10:39:07

13z3jhc,Going to be working for an Indian manager for the first time. What should I watch out for?,"**Edit:** This post was late approved. I thought it was not going to be posted so I shared this post in r/india instead.

So I went to masters directly after [B.Tech](https://B.Tech). Never worked in India.

1st manager, white American: A pushover. Would never say no to anything. Was very detached. Max freedom, but the team became very chaotic. Another older Indian uncle in the team took advantage of the situation to create some absolute painful to work with systems. Horrible team to begin software engineering career with. I pitched some nice projects in this team and got to build them, but I absolutely did not grow as an engineer in this team.

2nd manager, Chinese: Micromanager to the core. Never used to fight for his people during appraisals. Another newly minted manager in the department who was a very close friend of mine told me this. Constantly belittled people publicly. Narcissistic. Competent, but used to bend over backwards to cover his shortcomings. Insecure. Good mentor and good engineer though. Learnt a lot in this team. In a way regret leaving this team.

3rd manager, white American: Was on his way to returning back to being an IC. Was not happy being a manager. Was managing an extremely talented team. The team pretty much managed themself. Again, very detached. Didn't really care about the affairs of the team. A complete pushover. Max freedom, a lot of scope for chaos. Nobody took advantage of him. So the team ran smoothly. Incredibly smart. Extremely strong engineer. Compassionate and empathetic but deeply introverted.

4th manager, Indonesian: Racist asshole. Used to say shit to me like ""All you Indians are toxic people. All you Indians are scammers"". Very very incompetent. Absolutely clueless about what was happening in the team. Felt like a character from one of those Saas Bahu serials. Was more interested in gossip than actual work. Couldn't rely on him for mentorship or guidance or thought leadership. Did not get any work done at all. Cause I was constantly fighting with him. Talking to HR about him. At one point, I just stopped doing office work and focused completely on Leetcoding and interviewing.

Now. I am switching jobs. I will be working for an Indian manager. 20+ years of experience. Worked as a Principal engineer in Intel. Strong resume. A bit crooked. Contradicted himself quite a few times during the interview process itself. But the role is very very interesting and the pay is very good, so I couldn't say no.

He will be eventually handing over the reigns to a newly minted team lead. Sri Lankan, MS in CS from Princeton.

What do I need to know about working for Desi managers. All of my experience has been with very famous product based companies.

13p8j9l,Urgent. Help me choose: BCA from a decent college VS B.Tech CSE from a local college which is somewhat expensive too.,"I have two options. 

1st option is I'm getting Btech cse from a local college...fees isn't on the cheaper end... Would cost around 16-17 lakhs for 4 years totally(management quota) and college life wouldn't be great either. Pretty strict culture there so assignments would also be plenty.

2nd option is BCA course from SRM main branch. It's pretty affordable and college life would also be decent if not great. 

I am willing to put in hard work to upskill myself. So, I'm thinking what if i go for BCA itself instead of btech from a lower college cuz i think the first job package wouldn't be much different and since BCA is only 3 years, I'll get 1 year of job experience too compared to btech. Hopefully i won't have to do this but if things don't go well i can always do MCA too.

What do you guys say?? Please give some suggestions if you have any.",2023-05-23 00:27:52

I just gave my 7th sem exams (offline mode), and sat in almost all the placement opportunities provided by our college till now (it's a Tier 3 college under IPU).

I spent the last 7 semesters doing absolutely nothing, except making a bunch of basic web projects with vanilla JS. That's about it for my project part in the resume. As for my coding skills, I just kept procrastinating and slacking off after school. At this point my knowledge is as good as a XII pass-out student. 

Talking about my previous placement exams, I qualified all the aptitude rounds except in one company. Passed 1 or 2 coding rounds (were fairly easy- pattern/primes etc basic stuff, and one company didn't contact me for the interview after the coding round even though I was shortlisted, hence the ""2""). At this point I just feel wayy too behind (which is actually true) and just don't know what to do in order to bag a job in my final semester. I don't even have an internship under my belt.

I am a btech cse undergrad from tier 69 college, entering in sem 6 next month.
Till now I am pretty good at acads, my cgpa till sem 4 is 9.5. 
I have chose path of native android developement. I have done one internship and one full time job which was supposed to be for 1 year but due to college leaves they terminated me within 3 months with an overwhelming experience letter cuz I worked their hard and learnt sooooooo much I wouldn't be able to learn if I were at home and selflearning. 
Now about my dad he is just marks oriented that marks are everything cuz my uncle who's in US and pays my college fees too says that only marks matter in industry for 2 years, we get hired only on marks base and big tech companies teach us their stuff so don't apply for jobs right now. Just get marks above 9 

Why am I doing a job? That too fulltime in 3rd year of my college. My college is very bad at teaching and everything. They say if you have a job/internship or anything don't come to college no attendance shit.

I still not believe about the marks thing but my dad get stressed about it, I can handle a job and cgpa (well this sem will tell everything, cuz I didn't attended college and did job and internship only) 

What should I do? I can make my dad understand that marks are not the tier 1 thing for jobs but I am not sure about that too.

I have 2 options now 
1st is I learn more android development and upload my own apps I have ideas of and learnt the playstore stuff from prev firm. And do leetcode grind so I can enter MAANG after college. Also i am fond of backend too so that too cuz I have left with 15 months.

14lvs4g,Thinking about leaving IIIT-H CS for Architecture.,"I know this may not be the best subreddit for the question but please hear me out.


quals: Getting into IIITH CS as well as IITR Architecture.


So throughout my JEE journey I thought if I perform well, I'll study CS in an IIT. So I kept grinding. I cleared KVPY. I cleared all the other olympiads, kindof. 


But here's the twist. My dad is an Architect. He runs his own well-functioning firm where he works on projects. In these last 6 months, he started telling how taking up Architecture, and working with him, might just be a great choice, hell maybe even better than CS. Money won't be an issue as the firm runs well enough. Plus I felt like its the benefit of not being in a 9-5 cs job but having something of your own.


After the advanced results got declared, I realised I would not have a lot of great CS options anyway so I thought I should take up Architecture at IIT-Roorkee. With my BITSAT score I prolly can get BITS Hyd CS but I was willing to leave that for Architecture.


But the whole dilemma started once IIITH interview results got out. I got a great rank, with which I'll probably get CSD (1st preference) in the next rounds. Now this was a real dealbreaker, because I always viewed CS at IIITH very highly. Almost creamed my pants when someone posted placement stats of this year today. 


When it comes to my interests, I feel like its very easy to appreciate and be interested in Architecture. Architecture came way before computers so I feel like it comes from within ourselves. I feel a lot of glamour and satisfaction in the work. But when I look at the tech world and all these startups and innovations, I long for that world as well and this is a great oppurtunity(iiith) to be a part of it.


My parents are now really not forcing me into anything since they know the value in both the careers. They have left it on me. But really how much does an 18 year old know about the world and future? I feel like its impossible for me to predict whats the better decision. For the past 10 days, I've been talking to a lot of alums and other people in general, they all tell me how great both options are but ultimately it boils down to what my interests are. What if I'm mildly interested in both and the lifestyle they'll offer.


Here are a few things about each profession:


If I take up Architecture at IITR:


-Likely live in my own (tier 2) city, but not get to experience a really big city life/lifestyle.


-Get to expand our practice. Work may/may not be interesting after a while. But I won't leave behind the big setup of the practice and properties that my father worked so hard for.


-Its a glamorous profession. I'll get to study what I never imagined but sure seems really interesting, when I get to hear it from people or my father.


-There could be innovating work, but definitely not a lot.


-Ill get to stay close to my family. A lot of people need to leave their parents for better oppurtunities but I have the option of not leaving them, and staying with them through thick and thin, which I honestly appreciate a lot.


If I take up CS at IIITH:


-I'll live in a big city and experience that kind of lifestyle. It excites me somewhat.


-The oppurtunities are immense. I saw alumnis working at Google London, Facebook research New York. Surely the college holds reputation and value.


-I won't be close to my parents and most likely work abroad. My parents are in good health fortunately but I could've chosen to be with them.


-It could be a boring ass 9-5 excel sheet job at some big ass soulless MnC but it could also be some innovating work like I've heard that really changes the world.


-It'll most likely be a job. But I would be leaving behind a well functioning practice which would've been my own thing and not under any boss.


-I'll have to start from 0. Being in a new city, I'll have to pay high rent, travel expenses and stuff when I could've avoided all that hassle and started at a higher level as an architect in my own city and spent that money in expanding our own firm.


Whenever I think of one, I wanna do it. But when I think of the other, I wanna do that now. Its really confusing.
Those are all the points I can think of. I'll be glad to hear your opinions. Help a brother out!",2023-06-29 05:06:46
13t1if7,AI Revolution in the IT sector,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought about significant changes in various industries, including the IT sector. 

1. Automation of Scrum Masters with AI-integrated Tools: One role that could be impacted by AI in the IT sector is that of Scrum Masters. Scrum Masters are responsible for facilitating the agile development process and ensuring effective collaboration within development teams. However, with the integration of AI-powered tools, such as ChatGPT, into project management platforms like JIRA and GitHub, certain aspects of a Scrum Master's role can be automated. These tools can help streamline communication, generate automated reports, and even assist in decision-making processes, potentially reducing the need for a dedicated Scrum Master.
2. Automation Testing Suites and Reduced Manual Intervention: Another area where AI can revolutionize the IT sector is in software testing. Traditionally, testing applications and software required significant manual effort and time. However, the emergence of automation testing suites powered by AI can significantly speed up the testing process and reduce the need for human intervention. These suites can be developed alongside the application or even run in parallel, executing tests and identifying potential issues with minimal human involvement \[[**2**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddit-co-founder-the-ai-revolution-is-bigger-than-the-smartphone-165320829.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall)\].
3. AI-driven Data Analysis and Automated Reporting: The abundance of data in the IT sector presents both opportunities and challenges. AI tools have the potential to analyze large volumes of data and extract meaningful insights at a scale and speed that surpasses human capabilities. By leveraging AI algorithms, these tools can identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data, making sense of complex information. This capability extends to automating reports, as AI tools can generate comprehensive reports by analyzing relevant data points, reducing the reliance on human managers for manual report generation 

These are just a couple of things I feel can be done on the top of my head. I would like to know more what my fellow developers think is possible with this technology.

&#x200B;

I mean for a couple of days it was EXTREMELY stressful during training, literally had to come home and then code more for 4-5 hours.

For the last 2 months I became very disillusioned seeing literally 100's of people dying to get into 6lpa job at some bs IT companies who have horrible reviews if you just google them and I was one of them. I studied embedded C (it was easier to learn after doing all that DSA) and brushed up my electronics knowledge. The package is 12lpa and I'm really happy. My advice to others in my position is just focus on your main core man. There's a hundred thousand other CSE students in your own college and you can't possibly compete with them. Even I made it till the interviews of many good IT companies but always lacked good projects which CSE department people have been doing for 4 years. Just use your coding knowledge to develop skills in your domain. Mechanical people can develop skills in robotics . Fuck these CS people and their bs webdev ü§¢.

3 I'll ask the security guy if I can submit my resume to the HR or someone in the help desk

4 if he asks me to apply online I'll say I made a mistake and so I can't re-apply and my only way to correct it is through the hard copy.

5 if he allows I'll submit it or try another company if he doesn't

Idk if it's ever going to work but I feel like giving it a shot once. I feel like this might increase my chances since they know that
1) I'm willing to commute to work easily since I'll tell them I live nearby
2) I'm desperate and will settle for peanuts

Interview of Jensen Huang - Nvidia CEO has some interesting insights.

QUOTE - ""It's going to sound completely opposite of what people feel. You probably recall over the course of the last 10-15 years, almost everybody who sits on a stage like this would tell you it is vital that your children learn computer science. Everybody should learn how to program. In fact, it's almost exactly the opposite. It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human. Everybody in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of artificial intelligence. For the very first time, we have closed the gap; the technology divide has been completely closed."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUOrH2FJKfo&t=1090s

Regarding, he's literally an AI company CEO who will be biased to say good things for AI. Still, I think the fact that he encourages studying something other than computer science (for him, he said he'd choose biology if he went back to school, interview timeline 21:10) says something about the future of computer science. I know he's not the person to predict the future, but as the CEO of a company at the frontier leading this AI boom where Nvidia's goals are headed, their money and energy will be focused on closing this technology gap. Therefore, the future of computer science majors seems to be changing dramatically. I think CS will become like general education classes and not considered a major in the future because it will be so easy to program or learn CS with the small gap in technology.

I don't know ‚Äì as a computer science major, I've recently had lots of thoughts on the future of software engineering and CS in general, and now, listening to Nvidia's CEO and where all the money is leading, I feel like I should be prepared to start studying different interests, maybe not just CS.

Ranking like CSE > ECE > IT..... 

I thought such thinking would change over time but it seems to only have grown. And this mindset is mostly seen in India. 

The guys from EU/US come from such a variety of backgrounds. I have worked with SDEs having a background in Physics, Maths, etc. Specially researchers/scientists come from all over STEM. 

Given how the curriculum is in our country not a single stream is actually preparing students for SDE roles out of college. Most students even Tier 1 students have to learn most of the stuff on their own. 

Considering being from CSE/ECE helps with SDE roles. What about MLE roles. I see students run to CSE departments with the goal of becoming MLE whereas the foundations of ML lies in Math and Stats. And EE is probably the only branch that can give you a flavour of ML in college without any specialized classes.

17rv6yy,Would Indian developers ever build something like Omegle?,"With Omegle being shut down for good now, would Indians ever be able to build anything that opens up Indians to the world like Omegle did?

I understand that not everything was rosy with Omegle. The negatives probably outweighed the positives, especially since there was no age restriction or a bot filter. But it also provided a platform for people of different countries and cultures to mingle. For the introverts it was a platform to speak up, for the talented it gave a stage to present their talents and for some others it helped build friendships.

I'm probably less educated in the topics of Open-source or free software but why do we hear such freedom of speech tools generally coming from outside India? Would Indians ever build a platform that is safer and better than Omegle?",2023-11-10 03:34:52

The establishment showed initial interest but have not responded, which is okay. These things take time but I plan to sell this domain to someone who is not in India (to avoid trademark issues). 

Legal clarification: A registered trademark of a particular class in India can be used beyond india on the basis of right of first usage unless its a well known trademark like (Samsung etc). 

I pulled the company‚Äôs records (Private Limited) and its networth is 40crs with 8cr rev and PAT of around 4 crores.

Company- Established Startup (US based)
Role- Manual Tester (Knows automation also, but in this company, manual testing project is going on)
Package - Base 17.2 lpa (after 8% hike)

My manager rated me 4 out of 5 and gave me 8% appraisal 

This is my 2nd year with this company. Last year, i got 9.5% with the same rating.

4 being- meeting expectations 
5 being working beyond expectations.

Now some of my colleagues got 10-20%
8% being the lowest.
Now all of the employees who got 8% hike are on 4 rating but additional 5-8% is also given to them as per ""industry package to create a balance bw new hires and old""

So here's the situation,  I asked my manager that I'm disappointed in this, and also I'm not promoted as a senior role.

He told me everyone who got 4 rating got 8% only.
But that's not true, obviously, but i can't disclose that i know the hike % of X employees.
The lowest hike is 8%, and everyone whom i talked to has 11-20% hike.

He said your package is above and good for the industry standard, and that's why we can't give you a higher package.

Now, what fault is mine? If i got to a good package as i switched 2 companies in my past.
This is my 3rd org.

I told my manager that this is my skills that have gotten me to this package, as per the industry. YoE *3 packages are given.
What is my fault if some employees have not switched from this company and are working for low salaries as per this, you are giving them 20% hike and this comes equal or more than my package.

I dont have an issue that old employees are getting good hikes to balance the salaries, but why im getting low hikes? i have done the good work, which got me to 4 rating out of 5.

1be0lo0,Should I ask HR regarding onboarding update via Email ?,"Hello Developers!!!  


I am 22M, completed BE in computer Engineering.  Upon completion of graduation (May 2023), I worked as an ML engineer (internship); fast forward to December 2023, I had interview scheduled for ML position (off-campus) at reputed company (non-IT), which I passed and after interview in December, I was told to wait for offer letter. Actually, I was referred by the employee of the company. So, till the end of January, I did not receive any update from company regarding offer letter. I asked a person who referred me, he told me that HR has been changed and due to that reason, your onboarding process might be on hold. However, In February new HR got hired and I literally left the hope to receive callback from the company, but after some time I received call from new HR, and again scheduled interview with same manager with whom I was previously interviewed. Manager was quite satisfied with me and asked me If I was ready to join as soon as possible. I assured him to join ASAP. After this interview also I was eagerly waiting for the offer letter; Again, left the hope of receiving any response. However, now it was a beginning of March, and one day I received call from HR, asking for my documents, to release the offer letter. Now it's almost mid-March and again no callback from HR, and no update regarding my joining. It's a journey of 4 months. I never wrote a follow-up mail to HR or manager regarding, onboarding process. Till now I was just asking my referee regarding any updates. It seems cumbersome to him also to ask manager repeatedly regarding my offer-letter. Should I write follow-up mail to either HR or manager. If yes, what should I mention in it?

1bqdxcy,Should I go back to C++ from Go? Or should I learn some more Rust.,"For some context, I'm working on a peer to peer, blockchain based project. I am making it in Go but I have already made a working prototype in C++ because I don't know Go very well. Another similar [project](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chooseausername6544/comments/1bbbl8e/write_up_on_my_blazingly_fast_fintech_project/) of mine is also written in C++.

The issues with Go I'm facing is that it's too verbose, bloated, unhelpful messages and unconventional, hard to read syntax, no function overloading and some other stuff.

The reason I stopped using C++ because of overuse of templates, exceptions and no standardized package manager or just dep management in general. C++ modules were meant to solve this but they aren't much used.

I've dabbled a bit with Rust too. While I love it's helpful error messages, ownership system but it isn't used much in India. The only time it's used is in blockchain, embedded and other similar stuff that I would like to avoid.

Python, node.js are out of question so I won't even cover them.

So basically my question is what language and stack should I make my project in?

  
edit : I knew i would get comments like ""LanGuaGe iS jUst a ToOl"". But it's not that simple as it sounds. The reason I excluded some tools like Python, node is because it's blockchain based p2p software where performance is a concern.

During the post resignation meetings with manager and partner, I told them I am leaving for higher education. So is there anyway my current employer can know if i switched and moved to a new organisation and can they do anything about it?

P.S. The reason for leaving so soon was because the work environment wasn‚Äôt great and i did not feel like i was doing any meaningful hood work there.

Wouldn't even ask this question pre-covid or even during COVID. I would have jumped head first in this pool.

But now that the job market is erratic and all major companies are laying off / restructuring, is doing masters worth it?

 I work as an automation / cloud engineer and earn above average salary. But more than half of my friends have migrated to either USA or Germany to pursue Masters and I am having FOMO. My job seems somewhat repetitive at times and it is less challenging but more time consuming. I feel like I could do much better if I were in an R & D environment rather than a product release focused environment. But there are very few well paying R & D jobs in our country and most of them require a very strong background.

My job at times can be a bit stressful and my counterparts working in Europe / Canada / USA make a cushy income and usually work on  the lower layers , I am very much interested in that kind of work. They also work only 40 hrs and earn high income while I have to work 40-60 hours ( sometimes on weekends, screw release weeks, release always has to be on weekend) with an OK income. Management is also pretty toxic here. I am also a bit interested to see what kind of tech jobs do foreign countries offer? 

I would have to take out an education loan in order to pursue Masters and based on the universities it might range from 100K - 150K USD. With the current economy and job market, I am scared of not getting a job straight out of Uni.

**Things I don't like**

1. I never liked J2EE . In my humble opinion, I think J2EE is a classic case of over engineering. I am genuinely curious, do other languages have such massive standards? I think, J2EE being so bad is the reason, Spring is thriving. 
2. Handling NULL. Why can't we do it the way Kotlin and C# does. Optionals are a good savior (sometimes)
3.  Speaking of J2EE, if you think java in itself is complicated, check how some of the Application servers like WildFly do things.  [This is the way](https://docs.wildfly.org/31/Developer_Guide.html) WildFly handles class loading. 
4. Never really liked JNDI and EJB. Don't ask why. There are just so much easier ways to achieve the same thing now. 
5. JNI - I wish we handled native code better. However with Java 21,   FFM API  seems to be a massive improvement  (I have yet to check this)

1bozgo8,Pls help!!! Confused about lot of things and feeling low.,"I'm a  commerce graduate learning Go for some time now. Was reading other cs books as well. 

Haven't built any big projects yet that I could showcase in resume. 

I have only built simple stuff like movies CRUD, small booking app, Web server. 

I also haven't tried leetcode yet. I only know basic data structures and algorithm definitions by reading grokking algorithm. 

‚óè I'm looking for internship or job within few months asap. Things are getting rough. 


‚óè Should i make 3 unique but small projects or 1 big project like e commerce?


‚óè Should I give more time on building projects or solving leetcode ? Leetcode seems hard asf for me. I just started today. 


‚óè  Any other tips or suggestions as I'm a non cs grad. 


‚óè I have seen many people saying it's impossible to get into a job without cs degree in this market but also seeing others who is getting 8lpa job and job at us startups etc. 


‚óè I also want to get back my life. Lost so many things. Health is also worse. Can't see family working hard like this. I'm trying my best. I'm already 23 life feels like it's over.

1bmm63s,Should i accept or decline the offer i received from a very new startup,"Hello,

I am a third year student (end of 6th sem). I applied for a few internship positions through my university's placement program. I received an offer for an Intern position at the company(say X). The pay is 10k, the work is remote but the duration of work is 6 months (fixed), Working Hours: 9 to 6, 5 days a week.

It will be my second opportunity working in a startup (the first startup i worked with didn't pay me anything and i just worked for the experience and exposure to skills required at corporate level).

What should I do? Should i accept the offer or decline it?  Should I hold out for potentially better offers, even if I risk missing out entirely?

I have talked with my parents about it and they said that i should try for more companies that come for the placement.

Taking this offer would debar me from sitting in further opportunities that might come in the future.

Thanks.

I worked as a PM earlier, I was getting 38 Lpa. TF is going on in India ? This is full on exploitation. How do you expect a 30+ lpa to manage 40+ lpa  solution and tech leads. 
I know for a fact PMs and specially SR. PMs earning in 70+ lpa.
There is a sudden push from HR and companies to reduce the avg salaries to new low. 

By the way I am going to give the interview just for see wth is going on there. Haha... Don't ask for the name of company. 


Edit 1: simplifying , 
There is a strong push from HR when they call, they will create a sob story of how market is down and other Bs, then ask you to accept below par salary , very much knowingly that it will destroy candidates future prospects cause of LCTC max 30% hike nonsense in India. So for example if you were getting 40 lpa, and then cause of whatever excuse HR are propogatung through rumours, blogs and forums, you accept a lower salary let's say 30 lpa. Then when you try again, your lctc will be 30 and not 40. Hope everyone can understand this simple scam that is being run.

I'm representing a company with a ton of US clients, and we're gearing up to build a dedicated team for one of them. This is a big opportunity for the right developers!



What we need:



2 Experienced Devs: Angular skills, backend chops (Java or Python), and a knack for web scraping (Puppeteer a bonus).

3-4 Fresher Devs: Ready for real-world corporate experience. We get it, getting that first break is tough. We'll do a 6-month probation with a 3-month stipend to start.



The Deal

Challenging, high-value project: This isn't your average gig. It'll be tough, but the growth potential is massive.

Mostly WFH, NCR preference: Work where you're comfy, but we love local talent.

Path to a permanent US team: Do amazing work, and this isn't just a project ‚Äì it's a long-term career move.



Why the Stipend/Probation?

Look, this project is high-stakes. Mistakes can hurt us bad.  I see all kinds of devs on here, and we gotta protect ourselves (and you!). This is our way of making sure we're making the right investment, and you're proving you deserve it.



Why Reddit?

Devs here seem hungry for that one good break. If you're ready to step up, this could be it. Win-win if it works; if not, back to the usual hiring grind for us.

Edit 1: Clarification regarding the Probation and Stipend they both are linked. The first three months for the freshers, they'll be treated as interns and then after those 3 months if ,we all are on the same page, you become an employee, then you just have to serve 3 months on probation until you become a permanent employee. so overall we cut the whole process by 3 months 6 instead of 9.",2024-03-24 07:06:18

1bgdyfd,Getting Ghosted after final HR (Compensation) discussion,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently employed at a US Fintech company, where my total compensation stands at 35LPA Fixed + 15LPA in Stocks (vested over 3 years). With 10 years of experience under my belt, I've found myself in a fully remote role, unofficially of course, but I have been working from home since Covid. Surprisingly, nobody has ever called me back to the office since the pandemic began. The company culture here is exceptional, but lately, I've been feeling dissatisfied with the nature of the work assigned to me, especially given the modest 7% hike in my last review.

I've begun exploring new job opportunities, but unfortunately, many companies seem to be ghosting me after the final HR discussions. I suspect this might be due to my current compensation package. My total CTC amounts to around 50LPA, but I've been aiming for 60LPA, with a preference for at least 45LPA fixed. This adjustment seems reasonable to me, especially considering that most prospective employers expect me to work five days a week from the office, necessitating a relocation to a new city. Hence, the request for a 10LPA increase doesn't seem excessive.

Is 45LPA fixed too much for 10 years experienced person?

Is there any chance that the new employer would cross-verify it ?,"I have been offered an international opportunity, in which I am initially offered to work via [remote.com](https://remote.com) (the company would pay [remote.com](https://remote.com), and [remote.com](https://remote.com) would pay me) for at least 3 months until my VISA is approved! Once that's done, I will join the team onsite in another country (Germany), and my employment contract with that company will start. Now, I am in a very difficult situation. I initially lied to the new company, stating that I had a 30-day notice period (even though my actual notice period is 60 days) to get the opportunity to interview. In the last stages, they have offered me to join via [remote.com](https://remote.com) the very next day from my last working day (30 days). I am now in a situation where my previous company's working days would overlap with the new company's working days for the first 16 working days of the month. I am released from the previous company in the second last week, so my last week is completely dedicated to the new company (basically [remote.com](https://remote.com) in this case). I tried to convince the new company to delay my joining date due to some personal commitments and so on, but they finally said that it could be a dealbreaker for the hiring manager, so I had to agree to their joining date (which is the 31st day of my notice period with my current company). The main concern I have is whether this short duration of overlapping could count as dual employment. (Technically speaking, I would be in a 3-month contract with [remote.com](https://remote.com), right?) Will [remote.com](https://remote.com) diligently check this overlap of the 16 working days? Please help me; I am not able to think clearly at this point. I have barely managed to write this post.

1bpj1g7,Advice from experienced techies regarding UPSC and life ,"Part of the title is just to catch eyes. Please read through.

I am a M in his mid to late 20s, and posting from a throwaway account.
I was placed in a WITCHA out of college. Worked there for 4 years, got offered a European on-site but declined and left company in early 2022 for UPSC CSE exam. I learnt a great deal during my prep, and had steep learning curve, but couldn't clear the exam. 

In the meantime, few of my friends and colleagues have progressed quite well in their careers. Some are earning over 70000 euros in the Europe while others are in product-based companies now. My family is not dependent with my younger sibling in a govt job and parents managing just fine.

I had a huge fight with my parents(my mistake largely) and then I moved to Bangalore a month ago. I have lost touch with all my friends and colleagues and find a few of them avoiding to associate with me and had a massive heartbreak (but I am able to manage myself emotionally). I am at crossroads if I should go only for the IT job or should I try one last time for an exam conducted by the Reserve Bank for Manager role( a 9-5 job that offers 1.2lpm + residence + perks)

I am reading on this sub-reddit that the life in IT is not as rosy as it seems from the outside. So, giving some time parallelly(I am gradually preparing for IT comeback) to a govt job which assures me working till 60 is a prospect( a lot of techies won't ne working in their 50s). This thought also comes to mind as I had not-so-great work-cultural experience at my previous organisation(could have been part my mistake, covid over-work).

I am a reasonable man. Please come with all your advice, critiques. I am expecting it from people of over 30 years of age and above without mincing words(no dis-respect to younger folks but these guys generally have a wider view of life than us and may would have faced such issue in their lives).

P.S - I am hesitant to try UPSC CSE as it is a 2-year process unlike the RBI which is 6 months'.",2024-03-28 01:20:05

1bo18gy,Using redux for user-specific content (both ReactJS ad NextJS),"Q1. Let's say I have a user specific component like a cart component in e-commerce application.

But every user will have his/her own cart so how do we use Redux in order to manage the cart? Do we create a new instance of the redux store for every user or just include an identifier for every user and perform operations based on the id? Or do we not use redux at all and instead, there is something better that we can do?

Q2. Is there any difference in the way we tackle this problem in ReactJS and NextJS? Or is the underlying principle same? I started learning NextJS just a few days back so don't know much about it.

I am currently presuing B.Tech in ECE from JIIT Noida 62.
From the start (10th Onwards) I had interest in Electronics and Comm.
Coming to college I developed domain interest in Wireless comms, RF and robotics. All my minor and major projects are based on core IoT/Robotics. I do not have any experience in coding, nor did I try to shift into CS domain like my other fellow peeps to get a Job. I never applied to a single CS job. Mainly because of not having any sheer skills and also due to not having any interest. Though i do like IT domain a bit like CCNA, routers, config etc.
I got a job from my college which I sat in unfortunately, and got selected only to realize that the whole job desciption was a lie, and it was a call centre. This was followed by a shocker of my life, that now I cannot decline my offer letter otherwise I would be debarred from the college. Nonetheless, I had to join the company which I quit just after 30 days. I was feeling I was choking myself there.
Now, I am in Job hunt, So far no luck, just got on offer as a STEM robotics Intructor in a school. It's 15k a month not bad to start, I live with my parents in NCR only.

Now I am being asked to take admission in MTech from my parents. Honeslty, its not a bad choice but I am very confused as to 1st should I even go for Mtech in India coz i heard by many that for ECE you should do Masters from abroad. Secondly if so maybe even from India, which branch? Which specilization should I target? I am very confused about my future. I cannot decide one line. Some say think about money. Some tell think about ease of work, some simply point at your interest.

1. Establish definite goals and KPIs Before starting the redesign process, make sure your goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) are well defined. What particular objectives do you want to accomplish with the redesign? To successfully evaluate performance, match your redesign efforts with quantifiable results, such as higher conversion rates, higher retention rates, or improved user engagement.  

&#x200B;

2. Carry Out Extensive User Study  Conduct thorough user research to learn about the preferences, habits, and problems of your target audience. To comprehend user requirements and expectations, combine quantitative and qualitative methodologies like focus groups, surveys, interviews, and usability testing. When redesigning your app, take into account the distinct cultural and demographic features of the Dubai market to ensure that it fits in with local tastes and fashions.  

&#x200B;

3. Put User-Centric Design First  Use a user-centric design strategy to put users at the heart of your redesign endeavors. Make personas to represent several user groups, then customize the application to suit each one's unique requirements and interests. It is important to prioritize usability, accessibility, and inclusivity to guarantee that your software is easily navigable by all users. Throughout the redesign process, make use of design thinking techniques to iterate on design concepts and get user input. ",2024-03-21 11:33:15

I'm a data science major at Arizona State University, and I'm starting to look for internships for the summer of 2025. To make myself a more competitive candidate, I want to beef up my profile with some solid personal projects over the next year or so.

Right now, I have experience with Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tableau, Excel, and SQL from my classes, but I want to go beyond the basic stuff we cover. I'm looking to take on more real-world projects that let me flex my skills in data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, analysis, and modeling - the whole nine yards.

The problem is, I'm a little unsure of where to start when it comes to finding good project ideas and datasets to work with. I've scoured the internet, but a lot of the examples feel a bit too simple or contrived.

So I'm turning to you all, the data science community on Reddit! What kinds of projects did you work on early in your career that really helped prepare you? Any go-to datasets that are rich and interesting to dig into? Or just general tips on making my projects stand out?

- Introduction: Final year student with **no** college placement facilities. Preparing for **off-campus** placement opportunity.

- Preparation for Off-Campus Interviews:
    - As a total newbie in the job market.
    - Don't know how to prepare, where to start, whom to have as a guidance. 
    - As our college is totally unsupportive of these topics.

- Understanding Employment Terms:
    - Wanted to know different terms like CTC, offer letter, letter of recommendations, insurance, allowances, etc, ...
    - With wisdom on how the companies can trap you lowly if we don't know these terms.
    - Some resource like YouTube channel, etc, ... would be helpful.

- Standards in Different Types of Companies:
    - What are the typical benefits and compensation packages offered by both service-based and product-based companies?
    - Insights into the differences between these types of companies and their hiring processes.

- Examples of Companies:
    - What are some of the examples of well-known product-based companies and service-based companies.

- Difference in Pay and Opportunities:
    - The reasons why product-based companies tend to offer higher pay?
        - I researched this topic but wasn't able to get much clarity.


- How and where should I start from:
    - Ask for advice on how to position yourself as a competitive candidate for these companies.


In short: I don't want to be trapped in their claws of toxicity just because I don't know nothing about hiring, placement and interview processes as well as the companies and their types, and employment terms, etc, ...

I am good at studies but this is a new subject/phase of life for me.

So my idea revolves around Blockchain bascially a framework that   will let programmers make apps for the blockchain but the framework will   be cross platform and will be in C/C++ so once you write code for the   app it can run on bitcoin network or eth network.   

the hackathon is 24 hrs so we won't be making it like industry level more like a prototype.   

and on top of that we will also make 2 emulator network, 1 for bitcoin network and 1 for eth network   

these emulators will be as close to as the original but will have   some modification mostly in the algorithm department. so that time to   add a block we be less for us.   

now for demonstration i will make like a hello world type program   using our framework that will send a string or some kind of data to our   emulator blockchain   

first we will show our framework running with the bitcoin emulator,   and our emulator will be able to show people the new blocks added and   stuff like that   

then we will show our framework running with the eth emulator, and show the details accordingly   

how is this idea/prototype do guys think it is a good idea ?? pls let me know   

or give me any more good idea.   

I'm pretty confident in my programming skill so i'm confident i can make this protoype.   ",2024-03-06 16:41:48

She is 68 years old and she is recently diagnosed with heart problem. Her heart valves are getting narrower and narrower. I am her only son and her only kid.

Hello devs of India, I'm very sorry in advance for the long post aheadüòÖ

About me:

I am 24F, did my diploma from a govt polytechnic college and did my bachelor's from a state level top engineering college (not iit/nit/bits/vit/lpu/SRM/such colleges) in EEE so I have been academically good not excellent though.

I wasn't interested in getting a core job so went for campus placements, I got placed in an MNC where I was put into Quality Assurance domain and was trained on Selenium automation with Java as well but i was given manual testing project.

It has been almost 2.5 years now and I'm still in a manual testing project, I've asked my manager that I've hands-on experience and I want a automation project, I was even ready to support on automation project while I'm on manual project but still no luck.

I enrolled to learn C language even before my diploma and during as well but I didn't understand the logic behind the syntax and all at that time but for my placements I've completed python for everybody Coursera course only then I started to understand the logic behind syntax so that confidence/skill helped me in cracking the debugging round in the company that I'm now placed at.

So I've picked up java as well (not perfect though), but I lost touch on the same because of staying in a manual project for too long

So recently I've started brushing up my java skills again and I'm going through mooc fi for this and my plan is to finish this course and then brush up my selenium concepts and then start applying for external opportunities.

Please provide your suggestion for this confusion üòÖ:

Now I'm having second thoughts because firstly even though I've experience working on Manual testing I'll be still comparatively very new to automation testing so I'm thinking why not try changing my domain from testing to development (fse/fe/be) because either way I'm new to both in terms of experience when applying externally.

So anyone here who switched from testing to development or anyone who knows someone who did that, can you please share your insights, was the transition fulfilling to you ? Are you happy as a tester or as a dev (career growth wise) ? Can you suggest any other role other than dev (which has good career growth)

I've mentioned all those deets about my education and all because I want to know if it'll be difficult for me to transition into dev both knowledge wise and opportunities wise.",2024-03-31 06:26:47

1bqsbrl,Workplace Confusion and Chaos making my life really difficult.,"So, guys, this is my story, I am currently working as a software architect from the last 2 years and another 2 years in the previous org. Before that 11+ years as a developer. Currently I am working on a new eeg product, and we are in the requirement elicitation and back log creation phase. My team consists of me, my boss (partly working as an architect and manager), a phd scientist and few others who are not technical.  The scientist is extremely intelligent in the domain and software stuff, and he throws so many jargons and ideas around. There are so many topics to explore from the perspective of architecture... 

Now the problem - till last year my boss was having 1-1 - 30 mins with me once in a week and we used to discuss what work I should do. That thing stopped this year. He meets me once in a month or so and shoots questions like - What am i working on? Where is my visibility? Also, he says - I should create problem statement and come up with solution proposals. It seems his bosses are asking him what his team members are working on and contributing. In the meeting - I told him - if he gives me tasks - I don't have any issues - now he is telling me as an architect -  i should not wait for the tasks to come to me. But we are not in that phase where we can work on architectural topics as well - it will happen from next month.   What is irritating is that - this kind of conversations are going on from last 3-4 months... Also, I can't compete with that scientist who is in a different plane himself :).  Also, I requested him \_ i would like to brainstorm topics (am not looking for solutions from anyone) with colleagues which I don't have - even that was shot down. After every talk with him - I am getting irritated and bugged - even thinking I should test the waters outside... Frustration in the work has started to creep in now.

Note: I work completely in remote working. Me and my manager goes a long way (1 decade+) back - we were colleagues in previous organization; so outside work we are friends.",2024-03-29 15:39:33

1bq1e5l,What Would You Do in My Shoes? Balancing Passion and Opportunity at 24 Years Old,"Hey folks,  
  
I find myself at a critical juncture and could really use some outside perspective. I'm a 24-year-old software engineer with about 1.5 years of experience in a product-based company. Currently, I'm part of the professional services team, handling out-of-the-box customizations for specific customers using low-code tools and integrations like HubSpot, NetSuite, Zoho, and Microsoft.  
  
Lately, I've been grappling with a sense of restlessness in my current role. Despite the company's promising growth trajectory and opportunities for advancement, I'm beginning to realize that my true passion lies elsewhere. I've always nursed aspirations of building my own product and becoming a founder, recognizing that a lifelong career in coding isn't necessarily my endgame.  
  
Recently, a significant opportunity has presented itself in the form of a job offer through a referral. The catch? The salary offered is twice what I currently earn, and the position offers remote work, which would drastically reduce my grueling daily commute of around 5 hours. However, the role primarily revolves around using HTML, JS, and Deluge to craft widgets and similar automations in the Zoho ecosystem.  
  
Here's why I'm inclined to consider accepting this offer:  
  
Time and Financial Stability for My Passion Project: This opportunity would provide me with the time and financial stability necessary to focus on building my own product‚Äîa dream I've been nurturing for some time now.  
  
Continued Learning and Growth: Despite the focus on Zoho-related technologies, I believe there's still ample opportunity for growth, particularly in areas like system design and data structures and algorithms (DSA). Even if our passion project doesn't pan out as planned, I'll still be gaining valuable skills that will serve me well in the future.  
  
That said, there are certainly some reservations on my mind:  
  
Potential Career Impact: I worry that dedicating significant time to Zoho-related work might pigeonhole me and affect my opportunities in future roles, particularly if our passion project doesn't materialize as expected.  
At 24, I'm torn between the allure of financial stability and the pursuit of my entrepreneurial dreams. Additionally, I'm not sure how to navigate this decision considering my two friends who share my aspirations but will remain in our current organization.  
  
Any advice or insights would be immensely appreciated!  
  
TL;DR: As a 24-year-old software engineer, I'm torn between accepting a highly lucrative job offer with remote work to focus on building my own product and staying in my current company with potential growth opportunities. Seeking advice on which path to choose, considering my passion for entrepreneurship and concerns about career growth.",2024-03-28 17:32:58

When we started this project, we had a simple yet ambitious goal in mind: to create a banking platform that speaks the language of developers, tech enthusiasts, and forward-thinkers like ourselves. A place where innovation thrives and where managing your finances feels as natural as writing code.

CYBERBNK isn't just another banking app; it's a manifestation of our collective dreams and aspirations. From our non-custodial crypto wallet to our IDE-like interface, every feature has been meticulously crafted to empower you, the architects of tomorrow.

Whats real? Whats faked? Hard to say these days with all the AI around us - so yes, we make heavy use of AI in every aspect, so expect it to be wild - but at the same time we are trying be humble and serious when it comes to to developer ethics.

So please, keep those insights coming! Your thoughts, ideas, and  critiques are highly appreciated and instrumental in guiding our next  steps.

Hello everyone, 
 
I'm in my Final Semester of college and got placed in an edtech startup at a technical trainer role but the work/life is horrible as well as they pay salaries very very late. Paid me after 2 months that too, not in full and some reimbursements still pending. Overall, the current workplace messes me mentally, there's other factors as well.

Although the CTC is 7 lpa, It is not a proper tech/dev role which I'm looking for as well. I doubt if it would count as experience as well.

Now, I understand the market is harsh and everyone should bow their heads and work whatever they have for some time.

I don't have any financial burdens for now, Money is not critical for me atleast for some time

Considering, this might not help me in gathering experience for my dev roles, and I have some tome before I graduate,

Should I leave this and work hard to prepare for the roles I want? Or is it suggested to work here? I find it hard to prepare parallely and I do not want to continue this career.",2024-03-18 12:59:14

I graduated in '22 and joined a big 4 in their consulting division as an analyst. I had some projects related to machine learning so they put me as a data scientist in a project. So now in this project after 18 months I have been just executing existing code every month  to deliver it to the client. At first I was ok as I was learning stuff but now it seems really redundant. I recently got a chance to develop a new code, basically developing and deploying ML pipeline related to regression , but guess what client doesnot want this now. The work also does not makes sense any output or prediction is generated on a really small datasets and it is furhter ""optimized"" or basically a code is made to literally add subtract stuff from it. Why even care to do all the ML stuff. I want to get in genAI and LLMs stuff there are other people working on it in different projects but my current project doesnot wants to leave me (doing good work is also bad i think) I have also communicated to my lead about it and their reply is we will see we cannot let you go now. I have done some self projects on genai and Langchain and have been applying everywhere I get a chance but I am getting no response. In this project I have worked using python sql excel (client needs the results in excel and the more complex it is the more they love it) and have done a work of ML engineer (even written unittests for functions) and a business analyst also but half the pay.

Hi everyone,
I got fired from my previous company high pay, which had a really bad culture. I had struggled hard to get the next job but nothing really worked. Interviewers want DSA to be spot on, they want you to come up with LC hard in 20 mins. From my observation market has become a lot more competitive. For time being working in a lala ji company with very less pay. All of my lifes hardwork for this.


I am forced by my family to leave the domain ,they are mocking my efforts. They dont even consider this as a real job. Feeling depressed with no emotional support.I too have almost given up. Now preparing for govt exams. But the point is after day job I have no energy left to concentrate.

I too feel that IT is a messed up domain if you are not at the top of the game paywise.You will made to work 12 hrs , strict targets with very little pay. People will take advantage of you. People enter IT thinking that they will make good money. My experience is that its just a mirage. Some people get lucky and are sitting in big tech. For rest(majority) its just an endless grind.If the work is so much mentally straining the money should at least be good. 

I am on crossroads, I like tech I really do, problem is with the uncertainity and stress that it offers.

I'm a bit a confused about my career and could really use some perspective from all of you folks.

Background: After graduating, I worked in a WITCH for about 2 years - took a break to pursue civil services examination, but unfortunately, it didn't end well - decided to get back into the IT industry - completed a frontend bootcamp and landed a remote frontend developer role. However, the project came to an end after a year and I've been unemployed since November 2023.

For last few months, I'm hardly getting any interview calls and I'm fed up with this constant cycle of preparing for interviews day after day. And looking at the current state of the industry, esp the market for early careers web developers, the future seems bleak.

Recently, a probable opportunity has come for a business analyst/consultant role in a product company. I'm confused if I should pursue this opportunity. On one hand, I desperately need a job and on the other hand, I am unsure if switching career path from technical to non-tech role is a wise decision.

 I recently applied for a position of analyst at Capgemini India and got selected and received an inquiry regarding the gaps in my education.

I have two gaps in my education: one between my 10th and 12th grades due to severe health issues, and another between my 12th grade and undergraduate studies. The latter gap was because I felt unprepared for the JEE examination and took the time to ensure I could achieve a competitive score.

I have provided these reasons to the Talent Acquisition Analyst at Capgemini, but I'm still concerned about how this might impact my chances of receiving an offer letter from them.

1bo5i91,"If i don't care about the relieving and experience letters from the company, can I abscond?","Hi all.

I have been at this company for about 9 months now. But last month i realised that nothing is more important than family (no i am no Vin Diesel). So i put in my notice period (which is originally of 3 months) about 20 days ago, and since my mental health was going very bad, I asked for a reduction to 1 month. My grandfather passed away in the midst of this towards the end of last week. Now i have travelled home and asked the company that an early release would be very much needed since i need to take up additional family responsibility now.

Today, AFTER 20 DAYS, they are mailing me that they won't reduce the notifice period by even a day. I have debunked all their reasons of a 3 month notice period already but to no avail. They also have the option of Notice period buyout, and I would have availed that if they reduced the notice period, but I'm broke now.

The only card up my sleeve now is a Psychiatric Prescription asking for an immediate release. I understand that it would be an asshole move and it would lose me the experience letter and relieving letter from the company, but i am not in a position to really care about it anymore.

Q1: Should i play this final ace?

Q2: If i do, What would/could be the repercussions? Any legal consequences that they can ask me to buyout the notice period?

1bnkmmp,Advice Needed: Go for MS in the USA or Stay at Current Job in Europe.,"Hello Fellow Developers,

I have been working (Fullstack) in the EU for close to 6 years (living for 9 years), and now work at a large bank, I get a salary of around 70K USD. I get to save over USD 30K every year, and the cost of living in my city is similar or even cheaper than in Bangalore. I currently have over USD 55K in savings ( collected over 2 years ).  
I always wanted to move to the USA for personal reasons and tech. I applied for a master's degree in CS and AI and got a few admits.

Virginia Tech MEng cs - 1.5 Years course - Washington DC - Costs around 45K USD

NEU - MS AI - 2 years - Boston & Portland Main with 25K USD scholarship - Cost around 25K USD

NEU - MS CS - 2 Years - Silicon Valley - Costs around 52K USD.

Would you suggest I leave my current job and do a master's? What are your thoughts about the current job situation and also after 2 years? I want to get into research for AI and robotics and move from away a traditional software engineering role.

Intra-company transfer (L1B) company is playing carrot-stick games. So that option is far-fetched.

This whole plan would cost me USD 140K ( Salary for two years ) + USD 30K ( Living Costs in America ) + USD 10K ( Taking care of aging parents ).

1blmkr7,Need advice for tech career longevity: specializing in one technical domain versus being a generalist ?,"Hi Everyone,

I need some opinions/perspectives regarding how I should steer my career. I am quite confused and struggling to make up my mind.

I have been with an IT service company for over 8 years( my first company as well). The first 4 years, I worked on a project that involved support/maintenance (L3) of some applications in the Java stack( some of which were quite old and verbose). I presumed I wouldn't be considered for development roles ( and many times felt overwhelmed by the entire Java landscape) given that I had worked on maintenance projects (analysis/debugging).So, I thought of exploring something else. I got into a cloud based data engineering project and worked on it the last few years. All along I have been part of the same unit/account and found it difficult to move to other units/accounts in the company ( which I felt would have perhaps given more frequent exposure to different things).

I personally prefer sticking to one technical domain(say Front End/Back End/Data Engineering etc) and building good expertise in it along with a decent exposure to the supporting skills needed(Infrastructure/Devops/Security/Data Privacy etc). So, I thought of continuing in Data Engineering , which is my most recent skill and resigned some weeks back ( one, because my pay is low given that I have been in the same organization and secondly, because there hadn't been anything significant in terms of the work/skill development).I am holding a couple of offers now that are paying almost twice my current salary.

At the same time, my current set of managers are assuring movement to a different project along with an ""onshore"" which has a good scope for significant savings(which would certainly improve my financial condition in a short span), but the project seems to be based on Java/microservices. But, I am skeptical regarding it given that I will perhaps again have to move to a different tech stack from what I have worked on recently and feel I might end up being a jack of all trades and master of none. Apparently, my peers/seniors except myself feel that I have the capacity to take up ay work irrespective of ""technology"", but the very idea tires me.

So, should I focus on specialising myself and switching jobs to stick to one technical domain or do I jump tech stacks for some immediate monetary gain and end up being a generalist ( and perhaps ending up staying in the same org for quite long) ?

Some say that being generalist helps have a broader picture of things and later work in architect roles. What are you thoughts on this ?",2024-03-23 07:35:48

1bkrepw,Rant: Navigating the Highs and Lows of Startup Life as a Developer,"Hey Reddit community,

I hope you're all doing well. This is my first post here, and I just wanted to share some thoughts and frustrations I've been experiencing lately in my journey as a developer.

I've been working in a startup for almost 10 months now, and let me tell you, it's been a rollercoaster ride of emotions. On one hand, working in a small startup has its perks. All the senior developers and even the tech lead are readily available for any doubts and discussions. The camaraderie and support within the team are truly commendable.

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The startup culture also comes with its fair share of challenges. One of the biggest hurdles I've faced is the expectation of an insane amount of work to be done in a limited time frame. Deadlines are tight, and there's always this sense of urgency looming over our heads.

Recently, I've been assigned to work on a client project for about 2 months. This client happens to be a medium-sized startup, and to my surprise, they expect the same speed and level of productivity as a small startup, but with additional processes and protocols in place.

Tasks that were once as simple as completing a feature now require meticulous documentation, making tasks on Jira, marking them as done, raising tickets for QA approval, and deployment procedures. It feels like I'm drowning in paperwork while trying to keep up with coding.

To add to the chaos, I find myself juggling multiple features simultaneously as a single developer on the project. It's overwhelming, to say the least.

What's even more frustrating is having to entertain suggestions from non-tech project managers on implementing complex technical solutions like queues, without fully understanding the implications and feasibility.

So, fellow developers, I turn to you for advice. How do you cope with the demands of startup life while maintaining your sanity? Any tips or strategies for managing workload and dealing with non-technical stakeholders would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for lending an ear to my rant. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights.

This project was interesting. Recently, I've been digging into the functional programming paradigm. This is one of my first tries at it. I've been doing OOP until recently, but this project really was impressive to me. The whole implementation took about nine hours. Functional programming is much less convoluted. I spent more time programming than deciding on a good name for a certain identifier.

Not only is functional programming more efficient, but I can also see that it's much less tedious to write automated tests for. I only have to take care of the local scope of the function I am writing a test for; there is no need to deal with the parent's inherited mess or even any parent's mere state. I just have to write the test for the function.

I have scraped the Cambridge Dictionary to collect the data.

I don't have a job offer in my hand but there were multiple companies for placement but they merely hired 1 or 2 students. Having faced multiple interviews, tests and everything, finally ended up with nothing. So my parents advised me to look for masters so I heard that one of my friend ka friend is going to Ireland, he got admitted in University College Cork in MSc Mathematical Modelling and Machine Learning. so I told my parents fir unhone kaha tum bhi todha dekho beta. I started researching about Ireland so they have one year MSc programs also some good universities. I applied for MSc Computer Science Adaptive Cybersecurity from University of Galway and I got accepted. The university seems good, a public research university and 289th ranked by QS. Also ranked third in Ireland for Computer Science. The curriculum for the program is very unique and aligns with my interests in Machine Learning. Now I'm very anxious about whether I should accept the offer or not. Also after researching I think this is new course offered by the university. The first batch started in 2023. I connected with multiple alumni on LinkedIn they all reply like bots. Now I'm confused what do I do. I'm worried ki market aise hi raha masters ke baad bhi toh. Please guide me with proper advice. I'll be really thankful. I'm attaching the curriculum for your reference.

I recently found out about National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU). It has it's own exam NFAT for admission into its 5 year [B.Tech-M.Tech](http://B.Tech-M.Tech) course in Computer Science with Cyber Security. Now i searched about how is this course, what do they teach in it, and placements. Even though many people said that this field is ""recession-proof"" but going down, i read people saying that this field requires a lot of work, a lot of mental stress, and a person should join it only if he/she has interest in it. I also read that this field doesn't prefer freshers for this job which makes it very hard for just passed out students to land a job.

What are your opinions on this field? Is it really that 'recession proof'? And are all the points i wrote correct or wrong? And finally, if i land in a situation where this college comes up as better than other options, should i join it?

Recently I recieved a fully paid research internship at University of toronto in the domain for computer vision , ai for surgical robots.  I'm thinking about whether I should go for that research internship in Canada. At first, I thought it'd be super helpful for my future studies(MS at a top university in us, have some decent research exp  and papers too), but now I'm not sure if I'll be diving into higher education anytime soon (definitely not within the next 2-3 years). So, I'm wondering if it's really worth it for me. Right now, I'm more into just getting a job. What do you think?

My research internship in canada is from June to Aug end, and being from a tier 3 college , theres only 1 good company which comes for oncampus placement during july. so I dont want to take risks in this economy, but there a good chance that i might get rejected by this company during on campus since most of the on campus placement is highly unpredictable.

My previous research internship experience is of an offline paid research internship at IIT gandhinagar again in field of cv and ai.

So, people in fields where the **full-employment theorem can be proved** will always have something to do because there's always something that can be made better or improved upon.

This perfectly describes _compiler writers_ because there can not exist a perfectly optimizing compiler for a Turing-complete language, so there will always exist implementations of some programs for which a compiler does not find the corresponding optimal implementation. Hence, there will always be work for compiler writers.

1baqm6x,"Unhappy, unfulfilled and stuck at my current place","This will likely be a low effort post but I have been meaning to vent for weeks and guess today's the day! 

I started freelancing while I was in college, I joined a friend's company a year after my college ended(primarily because he needed help and some mutuals suggested I should try it out, It'll be fun!). I took a ~75% paycut from 3500 USD to 800 USD in doing so but money was not on the mind at all(and I am an idiot) so I didn't ask for a better comp.

Over the last 4 years, My compensation has gone from 800 USD/mo to 8.3k usd/mo(in hand. I have some stocks but that's paper money and I do not count it).

I never once negotiated a higher comp, just took whatever they gave me until last year when they offered an insultingly low increase and after pushing back, they 2x'ed the original number but added a condition, I can not ask for a raise this year to which I said, Sure.

Recently, I learned despite being the 3rd team member at this place, managing the complete infrastructure and a few backend services, I am(and have always been from the start) one of the least compensated employee at this place. Excluding CXOs, everyone's pay is over >15k usd/mo. For some colleagues, It makes sense since they are in a highly specialized role but there are backend and frontend engineers who are making considerably more than I do. While my initial pay as 800usd/mo, The colleague hired a few months after me was being paid 3k usd/mo and we do similar type of work.


I love building fast, reliable projects/tools but the attitude of the rest of the team(except for 1 other person) is in favor of shipping faster and faster without caring much about the quality of what they are deploying.

Some examples,

1. All the backend apps are in TS or JS, There are no tests, no input validation and type system is poorly leveraged if at all. (imagine app crashes originated from boat load of cannot find $field in undefined errors)
2. There is poor logging and no metrics reporting systems. Every thing is dumped into slack where it's difficult to search and I have never seen a single message in these slack channels where the log had complete context to help solve the problem. Either they dump 400 line JS object or they'll log a single generic line and nothing else.
3. Most API services frequently take multiple seconds to answer and some crash at a minuscule load of 30rps.


I have raised this issue multiple times, Some colleagues get interested in fixing it and then it all fizzles out by next sprint where every one once again is focused on shipping new features. Since no one else would do it, I built the monitoring stack, improved logging for the apps that were frequently causing problems and tried to improve it as much as I could. I don't want to modify every single app because I didn't write it, some code owners frown if I try to fix it and I hate working on frontend and some backend projects.

Despite giving people the tools to investigate production problems(and making short videos on how to use grafana to search logs), Literally all of them ping me every time there is a problem in production and they need to know what went wrong. (messages like, Here is a request id can you find the logs? stock_prune, can you check production logs see if there were any errors in last x hours? are not uncommon). These frontend and backend devs didn't even think to add request ids, I had to ask them multiple times to add it and even today the newer applications don't have it.



My role(officially and unofficially) here has largely been relegated to a ""devops"" person since I was good at it and I manage _all_ the infrastructure. This is despite the fact, I also manage a few backend services that were originally written in JS and kept crumbling under traffic. The newer versions I wrote handle large amounts of traffic at good response times, come with metrics reporting/alerts and good log output.


In the 2021 boom, I had multiple offers from mutuals in other companies to join them and I had emails to interview with other companies. At all of these places, The compensation was atleast 4x higher than my comp at the time. I didn't do it because it didn't feel right to leave a friend's company after just 1 year. Now, There are very few offers/interview invites. I prefer to short list a few companies where I want to work(compared to the alternate approach of sending mass emails) but most of those companies have insanely talented people working with them and I am not good enough(I have been practicing on and off for months and it's just not enough). At other places, I'll have to take a deep cut in pay once again and I am afraid to do that.




So the current situation is, 

I realize my pay is considerably higher than most people and I should absolutely be happy but I am not.

I am not happy because,

* People who were hired after me, are doing a similar type and amount of work as me are compensated much higher.

* Despite my interest in building fast, reliable projects, I have been relegated to a devops role(and I suspect they are compensating me with that in mind). I don't mind doing this but I want to do better in life, work on more complex products and solve more difficult high impact problems.

* The devops related work here is not challenging for me, I have been doing that for a long time.

* I am not good enough for the places I want to work at and moving to some other company implies, I have to take a deep pay cut once again. 



I guess the obvious path here is to value my sanity. Quit, take the hit, find some other job and start over. I am very afraid to do it. This place has broken me like nothing ever did.",2024-03-09 19:59:13

1b9z37n,Feeling depressed after  annual hike and going through these extremely slow interview processes,"I have been working as Data Analyst since last ~3 years in the same company, I joined as a fresher here. 

Got 4 consecutive hikes until November last year including annual n promotion hikes (10, 10, 10, 15 %). After the November's promotion my role expanded and now I also have to monitor of my team's work on top of doing my own work. I was kind of doing it before the promotion as well but in november they just made it official. 

Cut to this year, I was expecting the bare minimum 10% at least, given my previous hikes. But it came down to be a sad 3.5 %. Last year my bonus was around 15%, this year's it's ~8%. 

Feeling so dejected after all the work I had to put in. Using me they have built a team of 10, they were all freshers. They have shuffled people in different teams multiple times, and the brain drain in KTs has been crazy. And they don't even have the decency to lessen my workload either. 

I was planning to switch anyways because of this mess. I have one ongoing interview round.  

But it feels like I'm out of all my patience after this hike and these slow interviews. Seriously, why do they have these 2 weeks gaps in each fucking round. And if you have to to reject just tell me straight away after a day or two. I'm not able to see any hope either in applying at other places.

This year I wanted to start something of my own. But with all this going on I feel like that I lack the talent to achieve something of this scale. I wanted to build something with my bf, today he got a 100% hike at his job. I'm really proud of him and so happy that he got what he deserved, it's been pending for a long time now. So ofcourse I didn't share my sad hike story with him today, don't want to steal his moments. But yeah I feel he deserves a more talented and knowledgeable business partner, not me.

My fallback for this year was to start cat/GMAT prep, if everything else fails. But I have no will and interest to do that. After investing two years of time and money, I don't want to face the risk not getting a decent job in this job market. I prepared for cat in my late college days, got some decent options but I left them for my current job. I wanted to get some experience and independence. That preparation time was literally hell, with never-ending multiple exams and those unnecessary grilling interviews. I don't want to live through that once again. 

So yeah tldr, it feels like I have run out of all my career options. I just want to rot in my bed now. I don't to want to face the reality of my job and this shitty job market again on Monday .

That was my rant. I'll cry a bit more and go to sleep.

1btauy7,I need advice! Did I blow it by accidentally disclosing my current pay during an HR discussion?,"I'm in a difficult situation as a result of a recent meeting with HR during the negotiating process of a job offer. To be absolutely honest, I have to acknowledge that I misrepresented my current salary package.

During the HR discussion, I informed them that my current compensation consists solely of fixed pay, intentionally omitting the variable component. However, when HR requested clarification on my current compensation plan, I provided them with a PDF detailing both fixed and variable pay breakdowns.

Now, as they prepare to release the offer letter, I'm concerned that my initial misrepresentation may have been noticed, potentially damaging my credibility and jeopardizing the offer.

To provide some context, I was negotiating for a higher salary, and HR has agreed to offer 19LPA fixed, which is substantially higher than my current fixed pay of 8.5LPA. This negotiation was conducted under the assumption that my current compensation package was entirely fixed.

I'm seeking advice on how to navigate this situation ethically and professionally. Should I address my initial misrepresentation directly with HR, risking the offer, or should I proceed with the negotiation as it stands? Any guidance or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.",2024-04-01 18:05:29

1bten4h,Career Switch to Data Analyst or Developer Career Path,"Hello everyone,  
  
I hope you're doing well. I want to start off by apologizing for my lack of expertise in my question.  
  
TL;DR: Considering a career switch from 3D Artist to DA or Developer. Which path offers better growth opportunities for someone without a degree? Thanks.  
  
A little background about myself: I don't hold a degree, and my coding experience is primarily from my high school days, where I focused on HTML, CSS, and later learned Python to some extent.  
  
Currently, I'm in the process of considering a career switch. I'm immersing myself in Data Analysis through a curriculum consisting of six different courses on Coursera:  
  
1. Google Data Analyst Specialization  
2. SQL for Data Science (UC Davis)  
3. Excel Basics for Data Analysis & IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate (IBM)  
4. Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization (UC Davis)  
5. Python for Everybody Specialization (University of Michigan)  
  
However, after delving into the Google Course for some time, I find myself more drawn towards coding than the data analysis aspect.  
  
So, my question is: What path would be more suitable for me to take? Which career path offers greater opportunities for growth? Given my lack of a degree, what would be the better entry-level option?

1bt0rwy,Suggestions to people learning DSA and coding only.,"In present and future scenarios , coding alone won't take you anywhere and won't help u land a job. 

I would suggest you to keep learning coding if u like. Make some projects. These days people are able to create such big apps and sites within a few weeks with the help of AI. You should also take advantage of that. 

Learn the basic amount of coding from the tutorial then start making projects by projects I mean projects which the popular startups are making. Search the internet for the latest products look on sites like app sumo and product hunt. 
People post about the products they have created. Make them handle all parts of it making, deploying, marketing, customer feedback. You will really learn a lot instead of doing DSA or learning from a tutorial. Use Chatgpt it can help you a lot to code faster.

Make a strong linkden profile. Share your products and your experience into making products etc.

See at the end of the day even if u won't land a job u will know how to execute the complete journey of creating and launching a product and you will learn product management, UI design, Marketing etc..

This will give you options to apply in multiple roles.

And the last thing is to learn about economica and globalisation too. Cause if u don't understand how the world works u would get stuck in life finding a job only forever and never making enough money.",2024-04-01 11:02:58

1bt3xoc,Does Nodejs ‚Äúamqlib‚Äù listener have separate context?,"Nodejs amqlib listeners have separate context?

I have a nodejs project that uses the npm library ‚Äúamqlib‚Äù to listen to messages and consume them from rabbitMQ instance.

I also have an internal library that let‚Äôs assume sets an Id from the incoming message and logs it internally.

Now, I have some questions that Im still not sure about and I have tried searching for some solutions but not able to find any concrete answer to this.

Problem: If I consume a message, I will have an Id attached to it. I will send the Id to my (library)
 Lib.SetId(‚Äúmy-custom-msg-id‚Äù)
Then after setting this, I will use the LogId method inside my message listener function to log the Id in my file.
It will simply log the Id of the message in my file.

Now, I am wondering if 50,000 incoming messages come concurrently. Does each of them have a separate context and every Id will be unique? Or there will be race conditions involved here? If yes, then how can this be resolved? Im very new to this and confused how to tackle this problem 

If you need more info please let me know and sorry if there is not enough info or bad english.
Thank you in advance :))",2024-04-01 13:37:34

1bt8h9a,Tips and suggestions for folks trying job change or job hunting!," Hoping to counter as many common doubts as I can with this.

Context : Collection of suggestions from guy who cracked 20+ LPA SDE II offers at 2 years 9 months recently and switched from QA to Dev! Referenced at end of post.

Disclaimer : These are just my suggestions subjective to my views as per my current understanding.

Let's break this into Sections

**General Tips**

* Unless you're lucky, you'll have to exhaustively apply & make connections + ask for referrals till you crack it, don't bother about rejections, look forward to new opportunities! It might take 100+ applications but it'll only take 1 good callback :)
* Be as healthy as you can! Having a positive attitude, good mental and physical state takes you long way.
* Don't lie to yourself and others about how much you know.. Often via bootcamps and self-pace learning we skip over problems/concepts after superficial reading that w know this, please be honest that you need to revise some topics more than others. It's ok, we're not superhumans.
* Try mock interviews. Environment sometimes makes a huge different!!
* Communication skills can make an lean hire to strong hire!! Please work on communicating your solution/responsibilities/expectations/explanations.
* Try asking questions around the interviewer's team/work/challenges which showcases your interest.
* Sometimes interviewers suck at their job. Dont get worked up, dont get discouraged, it's not you it's them!
* Ask recruiter the format of interview and if they can provide any reference material/topics!

**Resume/Your profile**

* The idea is to get an interview call.. Get their attention in seconds they spend on it with enough relevant terms to get that call!
* Make sure your resume doesn't appear crammed up! It should be easy on eyes.
* Please dont write IDEs/OSs/Generic softwares which have become too common to mention or aren't relevant to the position you're applying to.
* Please ensure your resume is ATS friendly, I use resumeworded.com for personal usage.
* Keep your naukri/linkedin/instashyre/any other platform profiles updated with crisp details in such a way that ppl needn't open your resume to make decision about extending you opportunity. Use keywords which are common across most JDs matching your skillset.
* Look at your resume from a recruiter's perspective with 30-60 seconds frame and see how you can make it better.
* Keep your resume clean enough in terms of content & formatting that person reading it should be able to decide if they want to extend opportunity to you within 30-50 seconds! Because that's the amount of time most recruiters spend on resumes due to sheer volume.
* Try writing your content in format ""Did x, achieved y"". Try adding numerical metrics for better understanding. For example : ""Decoupled GET API and made internal calls concurrent leading to 40% reduction in response time"" **Result matter**
* Try asking your friends/ppl in relevant industry to go through resume and come up with questions which can be asked from your resume and prepare well for them! You can do it yourself as well!

**Interview Prep**

* **DSA** :  

   * The sad truth about DSA is due to huge supply, DSA has become benchmark to filter in most places. Practice DSA consistently instead of cramming, try to learn it for the concepts & usages, this way you'll not forget it and would be able to apply the concepts when you see new problems.
   * Pick roadmap which works for you (I had followed neetcode.io and some questions from striver's sheet). Dont get distracted, commit to one working for you, finish it and move to next one.
   * Revision is the key! Some concepts require more attention than others. Mark them and revise.
   * Write pseudo code or code in Notepad/Notebook without IDE/Code Editor if you're struggling with syntactical issues are find yourself too much reliant on code editor's help.  

      * Have a proper timer matching your pace. **Example timeline, please make your own** :
      * Reading and understanding Que : 5 mins
      * Coming up with base cases/corner cases which can help identifying pattern : 5 mins
      * Coming up with brute force but correct sol : 10 mins
      * Optimising above or finding optimal solution : 20 mins
      * Code writing : 15 mins
      * Checking editorial/Others' solutions : 15 mins
   * Learn to read code & assess time complexity and space complexity especially for Recursive/DP solutions!!!
   * Try doing code challenges on platform like leetcode/codechef/codeforces whichever one works for you.
   * Too many video solutions out there! Pick one which works for you, after understanding the solution please try to code it yourself before lookin at the solution code.
* Sharpen your skills around topics which is relevant to the role (React/DB/OS/API dev/Mobile Dev). Please learn the art of googling.. google questions asked by that company on glassdoor/leetcode discussions/etc. Google most asked questions for that particular technology.
* **System Design** :  

   * There's no ""absolute correct"" way of doing things, just best matching to the usecase given.
   * Ask a lot of questions around functional and non functional requirements. Spend first 10-15 mins in that to ensure you've got all needed info and freeze the scope of features.
   * There are too many resources out there for system design. Follow Youtube videos/Blogs which makes most sense to you, try to read the feature and solve it in your head before understanding the solution.
   * Learn the basics of different widely used technologies like load-balancer, NoSQL DB, SQL based DB, containerization, proxy, consistent hashing, etc. Where they shine, where they suck!!!

1bt8934,How do I convince HR for my time burst during lab and end examination just on the starting month of my internship.,"Hello Everyone. I have applied for the internship recently, gave interview and cleared PS and technical round for the role(frontend) and tomorrow is my negotiation call with the HR. I have worked on one start-up before and I have suffered the pain of convincing HR about i can deliver the work regardless of my availability. I was able to complete my internship before but here the problem is I will be completing my final year on 1.5 months  probably on \~3rd week of May but they want immediate joiner for the role with full time availability. I will be having my internal assessment in 2, weeks as well. My concern is that they will prioritize some other candidates in the pipeline if my availability doesn't suit the company culture. How do I convince that I can deliver my work and once I complete my exam i will be giving my all time on the internship.   
This is my first post. Please do suggest me. Also this is web3 based startup but I'm working on the web role so also wanted to ask is there any red flag to work on web3 startups (asking based on some discussions and reviews on web3 startups in this sub).

1bt86q8,70 K govt job vs Fresher in It market ( being hopeful of getting those big ctc like faang) looking for some perspective . how should i decide,"Hey everyone,

I hope you all are happy .Here's a little background about me: I am an a**verage fresher, graduated in 2024 with a degree in CSE from a tier 4 college**. I have average skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Android development, with no internship experience. i don't have any job right now . my clg placement was shit only 3-5% student got placed with 3-4 lpa package.

I am currently confused about what I should do next, and I have two options:

1. **RPSC Programmer (with a salary of 70k**): This job involves guiding and testing government websites, understanding third-party requirements, and creating software requirement specifications (SRS). **I can easily secure this state government job‚ÄîI am 95% sure of it(reson - very less competition)**. The syllabus includes DBMS, DCCN, System Design, and Java.

Family Background: **I am the only child of my parents, and they are uneducated. They cannot relocate, and I am the sole support for my family. We are from a lower-middle-class background, so I need to consider my family's needs also** .

My dilemma is choosing between this government job and a private IT job.

Why? The **RPSC exam happens once every 10 years**, so this opportunity won't come again soon. I posted about this issue on this subreddit earlier and received many suggestions. **Most people working in corporate jobs advised me to go for the government job, citing issues like poor work-life balance and various challenges in the corporate world. On the other hand, students and freshers mostly suggest going for a corporate job, stating that government jobs lack growth opportunities and are for lazy individuals.**

Now, I have to make a decision between the private IT sector and the government job. Leaving a government job is not easy, so I need to choose wisely. **I have always wanted to work in the private IT sector because it offers opportunities to work abroad (which is a dream of mine), easier job changes, and a work environment with like-minded individuals. However, there is a fear of AI impacting the IT sector and concerns about work-life balance, which is important to everyone.**

**I don't want to take the government job for several reasons, including the posting in a block-level environment surrounded by corrupt people. I never wanted to do a government job. logically and Financially, this job is good as it will allow me to do freelance work due to its low workload and lack of headaches. However, I have a dream of working in a big MNC as I've never even lived in a tier 1 city, coming from a very small village. so i want to move out of my village want to exp those tier 1 city life  but in govt job i will probably get posting near my home city.I want to stay in IT INDUSTRY beause of hope of the that i can also got those big package or those  remote jobs but IT industry scares me now a day as i don't have any corporate  exp,. in this subreddit everyday there will be one post of mental breakdown due to high work load , toxicity of managers and no life after work and most it  people are saying heavy  job cut is coming. as a college student i don't know what should i do**

Many people suggest taking an IT job and then transitioning to remote work, but after researching and watching videos, I've noticed that many companies are leaning towards working from the office. Now I am confused about what I should do. I've read previous discussions on this topic and noticed that government employees want to move into IT while IT employees want to switch to government jobs.

This MNC is not so famous for salary hikes but it gave an opportunity to work out in the Europe for few months.

My core expertise is SAP (Technical) + AWS + Noddejs, Python.

Back in 2014, I started my career as a UI developer - worked on AngularJS. Back then MNCs used to offer good packages so my goal was to join them.

And so I left this startup, did SAP ABAP certification (costed 3.5L) and joined an American consultancy company, got great experience and then after 2 years, I left it to join a German based MNC at Bangalore.

I worked there for 2 years and the joined a French MNC and till today, I work there.

I am purely into the technical areas of SAP which has strong demand in European market + have deep experience in AWS and I feel to go for this market but not sure the right approach.

If I apply for those European jobs from LinkedIn, I don't get to see any response. If I try to approach the management, I see there are not so opportunities - I mean there may be but now sure how long about the tenure.

So what could be a way I can find a long term work opportunities out there in the Europe or some other part of the world? I know about the German job seeking visa but because few family constraints, I could not go for it.

Most of my friends are working out in the US and Europe, they studied there 10/12 years back and so it opened a gate of employments for them.

I feel I can offer my expertise to European market - whats the way to get there? Automatically it makes me (or it would make anyone) sad and very demotivated knowing the fact that few SAP expertise are very rare which I luckily have and has good demand in the EU.",2024-04-01 15:19:52

Currently, my pay stands at around 10 LPA which is great for the Tier 2 city since it's my hometown and the overall working environment is acceptable. However, I've hit a road block in terms of learning and growth opportunities. 
Unlike many other BAs who have skills in SQL, PowerBi, Visio, etc., my firm doesn't require me to use these tools as we have developers for such tasks. My role primarily involves gathering client requirements, drafting documents like BRDS, release notes, user guides, and liaising with developers and testers to ensure project completion, attending client calls and discussing the projects and updates, etc. While the job isn't terrible, I'm feeling stagnant both in my career and financially. Whenever I browse this subreddit, I often encounter advice cautioning against resigning without a new job offer, which adds to my uncertainty. i am burnt out.

I'm currently in a service company where i have around 1.6 years of experience and also my total work experience. As i graduated in 2022, i joined this company and they put me in a project where i had nothing to do for like 7 to 8 months. I wasted my time during those months thinking very soon I'll be given KT and training to start working on the application or whatever but nothing happened. Suddenly they put me in a team where i was asked to write junit without any training. I struggled but thought ok atleast I'll start learning from this point but it was no use they never cared to ask whether have i completed the task or not and after that senior of mine started working on the same junit task. And for another 3-4 months, i had the same routine no update on any task or any other. Later they put me in a team where i was asked to take build version update the versions in pom.xml, make changes is yaml file and i did this for around 2 months. After that suddenly one day i got a notification that I'm no longer a part of this project and I've been moved to bench in my company without any prior information. I was in the bench for around 2 months and during that time i tried to upskill myself by learning python and reactjs. I couldn't focus on the learning much as i was going through a personal loss at that time. Now recently a 2 weeks back i put into an new project and since then i tried contacting everybody from who hired me into that project to the leads who are all tagged above me like manager and reporting manager but no response so far and was asked to wait. I feel hopeless as I'm unsure what to do now. I'm not sure whether i can focus on python now as I'm currently in a project where i was selected becoz of my java domain in tha company. I'm not sure what to do in this situation. I'm trying to apply new companies bit since I'm almost near to a 2 year experienced they ask me for technical skills and knowledge which i only have as in basic level. Please guide me through this situation and what should i need to focus on i Can't put my head in one place as i feel like I'm not doing any improvement in my career and I'm afraid that I'll be jobless if i be stuck in this situation anymore and i don't want to be jobless.

I'm reaching out for some advice and guidance regarding my career 

Here's a bit about my background and current situation:

I graduated as part of the COVID batch, which significantly impacted my college experience and the acquisition of basic skills. Despite these challenges, I managed to achieve a 9.3 CGPA also Last year, during my bachelor's, I received an offer from Wipro WILP, NTT but I had to turn it down due to location constraints and the offered salary not meeting my expenses did i made the right choice for going for master's?? 

 Currently, I'm focusing on web development as a starting point for my career. I'm learning and working on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and exploring frameworks like React.js and Node.js. However, I often wonder if I'm on the right track or if I started too late.

Some specific questions on my mind:

Is web development a good starting point for someone in my position?

How can I ensure I'm building a strong foundation and progressing effectively?

I also tried exposing an API and integrate it with Remix frontend. Overall this idea of AI agents excites me a lot, you can create AI agents for yourself too if you want to automate your work or anything like that. 

Also with so many tools availabe in CrewAI and also in LangChain, the opportunities of building something kickass is fairly high.

1bsycyo,Confused right now and need guidance regarding what to choose as a career ,"Hi, I'm a last year BCA student from a tier 3 college. I know basic of Java, C and Cpp. Now when it's time to make a career move I'm scared af, I can sleep at night and having lots of anxiety attack. I come from a humble family, I want to provide to my parents, i don't want to be a failure and all these keeps me up at the night even consider unaliving myself. Please listen to my situation and guide me-
         I like creative stuff. I used to create alot of arts and craft when I was a child and I'm also a computer hardware and technology fanatic. By considering all that I currently choose to go into one of the following industries:
1. Game dev
2. Gameplay animator
3. Web dev
  
     I was familiar with blender to recently decided to get into gameplay animator and started reaching out to people via LinkedIn. Gladly i connected with a rockstar games employee, he was genuinely a nice guy and told me everything I need to know about to be a gameplay animator but here's the thing He told me now it's rather safe to go with a character animator rather than rigging, character design etc. Now I can't see myself making character animation all the time for years and rest of my life.
      
        I really like racing games and love to work on them (I'm a automotive enthusiast) but he (R* employee) said that it's not a very demanding job as creating a car is lot easier than creating a character because you don't have to give a personality to a car and basically they are sheets of metal so less complex to create and easy to rig, this statement slightly broke my heart but I know that character animation is not my cup of tea.
   
          2nd scenario. I'm from a not math background (PCB in 12) but always had a interest in computers and their working, So I picked phyton as a optional subject in 11th standard and really enjoyed it. I decided not to pursue medical field due to personal reasons and Did BCA.
      
          Now I'm really scared to choose at what field should I make a career in. I love graphics as I was interested in arts in my childhood plus I like things that I can see the results simultaneously (like graphic design,video editing, web dev,app dev and game dev)
P.S i currently don't have any mastery in any of these areas and talking about their initial impressions only.
           
          But the programing stuff also scares me as I don't have Maths background and always been slightly below avg in it.

    As u have now familiar with my situation. I'm wholeheartedly open to all guidence and critisism. Thanks for giving me time",2024-04-01 08:35:59
1bsxzia,Seeking Advice: Transitioning from Digital Marketing to DevOps - 2nd post,"Currently, I'm working in the digital marketing domain, and while I've enjoyed my journey so far, I can't help but feel that the salary growth in this field has become somewhat stagnant. After some contemplation and research, I'm seriously considering making a switch to DevOps.

For those of you who have transitioned from non-tech backgrounds into DevOps roles, particularly in the Indian job market, I would love to hear about your experiences. How did you make the leap? What were the biggest challenges you faced during the transition, and how did you overcome them?

Specifically, I'm interested in understanding the demand for DevOps professionals in India. Is the market conducive to newcomers from diverse backgrounds, or does it heavily favor those with prior technical experience? And how does the salary potential compare to roles in digital marketing?

Moreover, if you have any advice or tips for someone like me who's considering this transition, I would be incredibly grateful to hear them. Are there any particular skills or certifications I should focus on acquiring? How can I best position myself to stand out to potential employers in the DevOps space?

P.S: Just to add a bit more context, I'm quite familiar with AI and often find myself writing scripts on Google Sheets to streamline my day-to-day tasks.

I find that when I can see the code, I understand the workflow much better.

1bsn9bw,Seeking Advice: Transitioning from Digital Marketing to DevOps in India,"Currently, I'm working in the digital marketing domain, and while I've enjoyed my journey so far, I can't help but feel that the salary growth in this field has become somewhat stagnant. After some contemplation and research, I'm seriously considering making a switch to DevOps.

For those of you who have transitioned from non-tech backgrounds into DevOps roles, particularly in the Indian job market, I would love to hear about your experiences. How did you make the leap? What were the biggest challenges you faced during the transition, and how did you overcome them?

Specifically, I'm interested in understanding the demand for DevOps professionals in India. Is the market conducive to newcomers from diverse backgrounds, or does it heavily favor those with prior technical experience? And how does the salary potential compare to roles in digital marketing?

Moreover, if you have any advice or tips for someone like me who's considering this transition, I would be incredibly grateful to hear them. Are there any particular skills or certifications I should focus on acquiring? How can I best position myself to stand out to potential employers in the DevOps space?  


P.S: Just to add a bit more context, I'm quite familiar with AI and often find myself writing scripts on Google Sheets to streamline my day-to-day tasks.   


I find that when I can see the code, I understand the workflow much better.   


Thanks for understanding, and I appreciate any advice or insights you can provide regarding transitioning into DevOps!

1. If the client is exposed in the future, could I be held responsible and potentially arrested by the police?  

2. As they are running a gambling app, it's likely that they will not pay taxes on their earnings. However, as a freelancer, I will be paying taxes to the government. Would I still be considered guilty?

2. Functional (Expertise in the appropriate Subject Matter and Focus More Depth on it)
3. Blend of (1) and (2)

&#x200B;

Hello everyone,

Three days ago (28th March 2024), I bought a laptop from HP in-store, and I believe they gave me the demo unit. When I got home and checked Google Chrome, I found random YouTube and Google searches. I deleted them, thinking they might have tested it before giving it to me. I was informed that, under student benefits, I'd receive an extra year's worth of warranty for just 365 days. To claim this, I need to check my email or HP support within 10 days. However, when I checked the laptop's status, I discovered it has been active since November 17, 2023, with only 7 months of remaining warranty making me ineligible for the student benefits. I tried contacting them via their WhatsApp number but didn't receive any satisfactory response.

&#x200B;

While getting bored, I checked the laptop's camera and found pictures of random people, along with a game installed ""Asphalt 8: Airborne"" with a total runtime of 34 minutes, which I never installed. When I tried calling the store, they said it's the weekend and ended the call without listening to me.

Now, I strongly believe they sold me a demo unit, which explains the presence of photos, games, and Google searches.

What should I do now? Should I try contacting HP support or visit the store tomorrow?

I am one of the youngest developers in this company and I feel other developers in this company are not up to the mark (we also have developers with 15 years+ of experience, in this company you can choose to code for lifetime without taking significant managerial roles) so it becomes tough to learn more not from system design‚Äôs PoV but from Technology PoV.

We work on realtime IoT data, so performance of the APIs and ETLs is significant benchmark.

2. Another product of our company is using APIs of my product recursively in an ETL job and I want them to use something like ADF or maybe a simple blob container with some delta scheduled job logic. But that product is our flagship, written in Scala(few developers of those product have contributed even in Scala Lang Community) so they don‚Äôt listen to me. How do I navigate such situations because even my manager is helpless, I believe. I cant keep improving this API again and again just to mediate this obvious design level inefficiency.

1bs72q7,"Seeking Career Guidance: Transitioning from Frontend to Backend Development
","Hello everyone,

I'm currently at a crossroads in my career and could use some guidance from the experienced folks here. I'm a software developer working in a very small startup, just a couple of months away from graduating with a B.Tech in CSE from a tier 3 college. My compensation is around 40k/pm. Initially hired as a frontend developer, I've found myself increasingly drawn to backend development, where my true passion lies.

I want to clarify that despite being hired as a frontend developer, I started working as a  backend dev from the starting within my current company, and it's only been 2 months since I joined.

Before joining this startup, I was an full stack developer intern for 8 months at a B2B company with around 60-70 employees, I did 2 major project for foreign clients with react and next. However, the experience was less than ideal, with delays in transitioning to a full-time role and a significantly lower compensation of 10k/pm.

Currently, I'm working with technologies like Nest.js and AWS, primarily focusing on backend development. However, I'm torn between two potential career paths. On one hand, I could continue to delve deeper into backend development, honing my skills in AWS, Nest.js, and other related technologies, and eventually start looking for backend roles in a few months.

On the other hand, I'm considering the option of exploring iOS app development with Swift more seriously. This path seems enticing, but I'm uncertain about the potential career opportunities and growth prospects in comparison to backend development.

My current tech stack includes MERN, TypeScript, Next.js, Nest.js, SQL, Redis, Solidity, among others.

Given my background and skill set, I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights from those who have navigated similar career paths. Should I continue to specialize in backend development, leveraging my existing skills in AWS and Nest.js? Or should I pivot towards iOS app development with Swift and invest more time and effort into mastering it?

Thank you in advance for your valuable input and guidance!",2024-03-31 10:16:28

 So the scene is like worked for 1.5 yrs in 1st company very well, left as I had a very basic package and got a 100%hike offer. then 22 days at 2nd company which I absonded coz I didn't like the work culture. assumed it won't show anywhere and I can hide but it shows up through PAN/EPF as they credited the PF (but I didn't get any salary for that month, so I was in a delusion that I quit it without leaving a trace). Then 7 months in 3rd company. This I left in disappointment (due to wrong role allocation) and arrogance as I had non understanding with my peer manager who was very dominant and very very rude  (he wanted to get rid of me I think) and at the same time I got an offer with 70% more hike. So there was a greediness angle too. Tbh, who would miss such chance as the next company was having a matching project as my liking.

So next was the 4th company. They hired me as Senior Business Analyst. The project was perfect but job was out of my skills as they gave me very high roles and responsibilities due to my package. The expectations were very high in my capacity. I was working with customer success managers and product owners and product managers. Also sometimes with engagement manager leads with new technologies like AI amd ML which I didn't know so it was very hectic to me + wfh made things and communication worse. My performance wasn't upto the mark. One of the similar performing peer was fired in a year. I was struggling with my role and responsibilities. Was put in PIP which I successfully completed. After 3 months even after completing PIP I was suddenly laid off may be due to because I missed couple of meetings.

 That time my marraige was fixed and I had 3-4 months for marriage. Had a hard time in my relationship before marraige as there were problems within us (the couple) so couldn't focus on finding job.

Was busy with resolving issues. Got married finally and then started searching for job. Its been a 8 months of career gap and searching from 3 months now. Unable to get any interview calls. I think my resume looks very risky and I was at very high CTC so even I am trying for 60-70% of my last CTC but no gains yet. Can anybody let me know what should be the further course of action. Please give suggestions. My self confidence is very low right now and I am de motivated. Depression and anxiety have already hit. Have a loan to take care of and a home to run. Let me know if you need more information. Also can someone review my resume too? 

TLDR: Had a career with 4 companies in 3.7 years with very high ctc at the end. then was laid off due to non discipline as I had family problems. Now it's been 8 months and still searching for job. Need advice / help.",2024-03-31 05:24:29

I hope all of you are doing well.

I pursued a Diploma in Information Science from a recognized polytechnic. Unfortunately, I faced a few backlogs, but I eventually cleared them all.

Three years ago, while browsing the internet, I came across topics related to web development, which sparked my interest in learning programming languages to build websites. Thus, I began acquiring resources and delving into JavaScript on Udemy, alongside frameworks like React.js and Express.js. Subsequently, I became proficient in these technologies and completed my journey as a MERN stack developer. I have undertaken several projects, which are detailed in my resume.

Despite my efforts, I have not been shortlisted for Full Stack Developer roles. Currently, I am in my second year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications from a recognized University. Additionally, I have experienced a few years of education gap. 

Now, I am facing challenges in securing a job as a fresher in Full Stack Development. I am uncertain whether I should pursue cloud computing courses like AWS or Azure or explore other platforms. Your guidance and advice would be greatly appreciated.

Since I come from a not IT background (ME) , I don‚Äôt know any popular coding languages like java , python,etc .

My knowledge is only in the space that I work in. ie , OIC , SQL , BIP, understanding of PL SQL and some idea about the oracle low code dev platform like APEX . I also have some understanding about the oracle fusion  module.

It‚Äôs more like a comfort zone here and I am getting an inner call  for a change ( of course for earning more )


Oracle gurus reading this , 

Is it a good idea to continue in this field ? I am planning to learn oracle fusion ( already have some basic understanding working with functional folks in the project) and work more on low code dev platform like apex and vbcs.

What is the maximum I can earn if I stick to the oracle fusion ecosystem? To earn more what skill‚Äôs should I acquire? 

Does anyone have regret sticking to this field and thought of changing the domain ?

1brk6ef,Advice - Should I pursue data science or continue software engineering ?,"Hi all,

I am currently a software engineer with 2.5 yoe simultaneously pursuing Masters in Data Science. 

Some background - even though I am a software engineer at my company, the team I was in did not have any coding requirement. What I mostly did was production deployments and pretty much switch features on and off as per the client's requirements. Inspite of requesting for a team change multiple times, it never panned out and I spent 1.5 years learning almost nothing new except for a solid understanding of deployment strategies.

Towards the 1 year mark, I enrolled myself into the Data Science course hoping that would give me an advantage when I try to switch since I had no real experience with real world coding. Sometime after that, I was put into a coding heavy team, but was never trusted with any actual work since my peers who joined out of college with me had much more exposure and had worked on multiple projects by then. This put me down further since I was one of the top performers in my college, and had broken a few records in the pre-placement rounds. The constant mistrust at work and the general treatment I got really upset me, affected my mental health and it made me start looking at coding with a grossly negative connotation.

The subsequent year was filled with being constantly undermined and having to fight to get work assigned to me. I used my anger to fuel my prep towards getting a data scientist role and switching when the right opportunity arrives.

A few months ago, our company was hit with a round of layoffs which was followed by mass resignations due to gross mismanagement. Thankfully, I somehow escaped (which I think is mostly due to the fact that I am probably the most underpaid person in the branch). This left me as one of the handful of people who knew a lot about what my team was working on, and I suddenly became an essential resource. The management changed and I felt trusted upon again. I was given a ton of responsibilities, and the management was delighted by my performance. 

Now, they're treating me with great respect but the last 2.5 years cannot be easily forgotten. My course will end in another 6 months and I want to switch sometime before that. But here's my dilemma - these last few months have reignited my passion. I love doing what I do and am questioning my decision to get into data science. I don't want to stop coding but I don't have the relevant experience to get a good role and will have to start with the job of a data analyst and eventually get onto an AI/ML software engineer or a data scientist role. 

I'm unsure how to proceed and what I should focus on. Moreover the market is terrible for data scientists and the number of times I have received a mail saying that the position has been withdrawn is unbelievable. 

Please advise, senpais? ",2024-03-30 15:14:46

Is there any other cloud service provider which have there server location in India (RBI Rule for NBFC)? Currently we have 3TB of data and since organization is growing we are expecting more inflow of data.

Problem with Zoho:
1) Every night we run our cron job and for every file Zoho keeps on adding file size i.e., suppose there is 1 file of 10mb which is run on 1st Mar then on 2nd March if same file gets updated then the total file size would become 20mb instead of 10mb.
2) To resolve this issue we have to manually clear previous version which is hectic since daily 1000 of files gets updated.

We are team of 10 people so we are planning to buy subscription for entire team instead of individual.

Have worked with Dropbox which by far was the best but Dropbox server is not in India and hence we needed to switch to Zoho Workdrive.

1brbj9r,Building a SaaS HMS for IVF Clinics: Seeking Architecture Advice!,"Hey folks! üëã I'm diving into an exciting project and could use some of your wisdom. I'm working on developing a SaaS platform tailored for IVF clinics. The goal is to create a solution that's both scalable and customizable, allowing each clinic to feel like the software is made just for them. Here's a quick rundown:

**Tech Stack & Current Plan:**

* **Frontend:** React, with each clinic having it's frontend served from its own S3 bucket.
* **Backend:** Node.js, leveraging the SST Framework to whip up those serverless APIs on AWS.
* **Database:** Planning on separate databases for each clinic to keep their data isolated and secure.

**The Big Question:** Right now, I'm contemplating using a monorepo for both React and the SST backend, and then forking it for each clinic to sprinkle in that custom clinic flavor. Additionally, thinking about having each clinic on its own AWS account for that neat separation and security.

However, the path of forking feels like it might get a bit thorny with updates and maintenance down the line. So, I'm at this crossroads, wondering if there's a smarter, more efficient way to structure this without getting tangled up in a maintenance nightmare.

**End Goal:** I want to create a platform that's easy to update and maintain, offers high levels of customization for each clinic, and can scale without me pulling my hair out.

Has anyone here tackled something similar, or do you have insights on managing such a project? Any advice on architecture, tools, or strategies would be super appreciated. Cheers! üöÄ

And he was like controlling the whole interview He didn't need an explanation or allowed me to talk openly.even there was no tell me about yourself. It was like a kind of filling some forms he got.

This course has 3 modules but till now only 1 module has been released for $120. As an Indian, it is very expensive for me. No idea when the other modules will be released.

I have seen his Youtube channel. There isn't anyone in this space who is as knowledgeable as him.

I have already read both of Alex Xu's books. Volume 1 is good. Volume 2 is also OK but the last 2-3 chapters are way too dense. And also I feel like by reading these books, I will only be able to  regurgitate what is there in the book. I won't be able to discuss anything deeper/any variants in the interview.

I want to have enough knowledge to discuss any variants/trade-offs with with first principles thinking in the interviews.

Anyone who has bought his course, can you please share your review? Is it worth it considering it does not have the 2 remaining modules?

1bqrbjl,Seeking Advice: Job Offer Dilemma Amidst Unemployment,"Hey everyone,

I hope you're all doing well. I'm reaching out for some advice as I'm facing a bit of a dilemma.

Since December 2023, I've been actively searching for job opportunities without much luck. Recently, I received a job offer, which initially seemed like a lifeline. However, after some thorough research, I've uncovered some concerning details about the company culture.

According to reviews, employees are expected to work excessively long hours (13-15 hours a day) with no weekends, holidays, or government leaves. There's no flexibility for comp-off or sick leaves, and office politics seem to be rampant. Additionally, there's a demanding work culture where being on-call at all times is expected.

Given my current situation of being unemployed for several months, I'm torn between accepting this offer or holding out for better opportunities, even though there are no other offers on the table right now.

Has anyone else been in a similar predicament? How did you navigate it? Any advice or insights would be immensely helpful.

Thank you all for your support and guidance!

1bqsbrc,Why freelancing sucks and my experience in this field. Need help. ,"I am software engineer with over 4 years of experience and I build enterprise grade software as a day to day job for large enterprises. 

little context: I was doing some freelancing  work with some of my friends. Got a project from a mutual reference and the guy (let‚Äôs call him GUY) is well known in our circles. 
So he gives us a project and we have a verbal commitment and a mutual understanding of delivering the project through certain phases. We agree for hourly work. 
Here is where it gets interesting. Guy runs an IT company (which does other things as well like Marketing/HR consulting etc) and gives a commitment to his client without consulting us. The deliverables are different as well, what he says to client is 1 thing and what he gives us is another. Anyway, we accommodate some deliverable items as Guy is helpful and kind since he his known to us or so we thought. 
Then his tone starts to change when we clearly say that we cannot accommodate deliverable items as we have run out of time (remember some commitment to client and something else to us). By the way at this point we have not received a single Rupee yet. 
So we decide to fix bugs and keep the deliverable items the same. Now he decides to bring in another developer and asks to do a KT. 
We object and say unless we are paid we cannot do that. 
Guy starts to go mad and at this point I am not even angry I just feel pity for him. He starts to abuse and starts to say You are blackmailing me and Running away and all that crap. We stuck to our point and said, no money then no code. So I decided to remove his collaborator access to GitHub private repositories. 
Next he threatens legal action and says he spares us because we are connected through mutual reference, we just ignore his BS. 
Now I am just waiting to send a legal notice through my lawyer friend for our labour of almost 2 months. 
Why Freelancing sucks? People like Guy exist and think they own freelancers. There is no due process. Moreover they are not at all experienced in delivering software projects. 

I just wanted to share here in case anybody else experienced something similar? 
What steps did you take? What can we avoid?
In my experience, freelancing in India is hard for Indian clients. It is better to look for International clients instead.

1bqmxrf,PHP developer on bench from next week. Need advise!,"My wife, who works as a consultant for an IT company, will be on the bench starting April 1st. She has completed three years with this company. Currently, she is assigned to a non-technical project, a role she had to accept involuntarily. With over seven years of experience as a back end developer and a current CTC of 13 LPA, she seeks a job switch primarily for a higher pay but also to return to a technical role. However, her three-month notice period poses a challenge in her job search.

We reside in Mumbai and prefer not to relocate for the next 4-5 years due to our one-year-old baby. Meanwhile, she is preparing for interviews and studying DSA. Despite receiving a call from TCS and having an interview scheduled by HR, the interview never took place, and the HR contact disappeared.

Is it advisable for her to pursue a job switch now? While on the bench, is it permissible for her to engage in freelancing work? Would freelancing violate her company's contract? If not, how can she find freelancing opportunities?",2024-03-29 11:28:43

Google Analytics seems very capable and powerful, and it‚Äôs also good that it can directly connect Firebase, but seems a bit too complicated to me.

1bpleif,Need advice on how to deal with my manager who is stressing us. ,"Hi, 

Mods if this is not the right sub to post then delete it , because I don‚Äôt know where else to post this. And I am really in need for an advice.

I am working in a banking related company as a senior analyst. By this April I will complete 1 year of service in this company and I was fresher when I joined this last year April. 

I am working on UK Based baking system and our daily targets are around 20. 

There is this bunch of people who are also on same UK based team but works on different queue. There are 4 other people in my team who work on different queue so basically there are two different queues in UK based system. 

So the other team who are working on different queue from us are not meeting their targets because their process is tough and volumes are piling up breaching the deadlines. So our manager told us to help them as well to clear out the cases as much as we can. Because if the team is not clearing out cases by breaching then the whole team would be going off track and we will be in PIP. So we said ok and then helped them clearing out the cases by doing OT as well on Saturday‚Äôs which is a week off. 

The other team they are chilling and is not giving a F and was straight up telling our manager that they can‚Äôt meet the targets because it is tough and she is letting it slide just like that and making us take more pressure in clearing out cases. 

This is going on for a while a now(2 months) and I tried communicating with her but she is talking very rudely.

And again, we also got volumes that are around 500 cases and when we asked for support from other team she straight up denied telling they are also getting volumes and they won‚Äôt be able to help us and said to manage on our own. But again, she told us to do 100 cases per day and complete it as fast as we can so that we can able to help other team members from different queue. The other team has around 12-14 members working on the same queue. And we are around 4 members who are working on our queue which is pretty much impossible in clearing out cases.

I am literally feeling mentally pressured by this. I have a patient in my house to look after them. I was already stressed as it is. And I know that I can‚Äôt combine my home or personal problems with the work or professional things but I am unable to do so at this moment. All I was telling is that I want a break. But our manager she is not treating us the same she is leaving people who are not working or not meeting targets, But making us do all the work. How should I approach her.?? Any advice will be helpful. Thank you in advance.",2024-03-28 03:13:43

1bozsds,Any recent US Graduates struggling to find jobs ??,"I graduated in December 2023 from a relatively good university (CS program at Carnegie Mellon University)



&nbsp;



The job market has been horrible, I've barely gotten 2 interviews after applying to 300+ companies. I've back to India to save costs, but still haven't had much luck.

I think one of my main problems is lack of work experience (I went for MS as soon as I completed my Bachelors - so effectively 0 work experience if internships don't count), but not sure how I can make up for this.



&nbsp;



Right now, I've decided to try for jobs in India as well...I just want a break, any job that allows me to develop and grow. I've mainly been applying through linkedin and handshake....I'm not sure if there are better ways to apply for jobs in India (I'm skeptical about sites like Naukri). I've also heard joining blind and asking referrals there helps, going to try that now.



&nbsp;



I also need a good way to spend my time while I'm searching for jobs. In a recent interview, one of the first questions asked was why was I still struggling to find a job, and I couldn't give a good answer. I've completed an AWS Certification during this time, but looking for better ways - either do some freelancing or contribute to open source projects. I'd love to hear any advice regarding how I can get started on this as I'm a bit lost.... I have strong skills in Python, C++, and Cloud technologies.



&nbsp;



Of course, I'd also really appreciate any advice or support in general, thanks!",2024-03-27 11:41:44
1bozhl2,Regarding Infosys System Engineer Role and CTC Offerings,"Hi all,

I'm a final year undergraduate. Recently, Infosys came to our college for a system engineer role, with a mentioned CTC of 9.5 LPA. However, based on what I've seen on Quora and other websites, typically for the System Engineer role, they offer around 3.5 LPA. Unfortunately, I couldn't find details anywhere, so I'm reaching out to this subreddit for insights. Can anyone help me out with what could be the case? Also, I've talked to over half a dozen people, but they say they haven't heard of getting 9.5 LPA for a system engineer role.

Additionally, I asked some of my college seniors who are at Infosys, and they also didn't know anything about a 9.5 LPA CTC. They mentioned that Infosys isn't good for fresher as we can get benched for even 6 months or more without any project.

So I'm currently on 10th, and decided to do programming as my career and looking at people younger than me (I'm 17M) starting earlier and are much better, I really need to start fast but Nvidia's ceo said don't learn computer science as ai will replace humans in terms of programming and understanding what someone wants in a programme. Basically a human programmer but chepaer and faster. Idk now if I should continue with this as my career as I'll be doing 11th and 12th then 3 years of BCA and 2 years of MCA so by 2031, idk if programmer will be relevant.

Should I seek another career? Ik someone will say this won't happen as it's not easy to replace human intelligence with artificial one unless we use a human brain. But these artificial ones are made for just 1 field which they will Excel in. By 2031 ( the time I'll be don't with mca and enter the industry) will I be even relevant? The speed at which ai is rising, I'm sure entry level and junior Dev's will 100% be replaced by then. There is also problem of increasing competition as everyone now wants to do programming. 

By what I'm saying Ik no one can know what will exactly happen, but idk If I'll be able to pick any other career. I'm stuck.

Someone please help me. Why can't we file a petition to ban further development of AI. Will the world actually turn into cyberpunk chaos because of ai? What skills should I learn to stay ahead?

1boi52b,Rust developer seeking professional advice in general.,"TL;DR: 24 y/o Rust Dev working in Web3 wants advice how a solo dev can learn & wants an idea of the market compensation in the Industry. 

I am a 24 y/o dev, who‚Äôs recently joined a small startup which provides cryptographic consultancy solutions to European Web3 Companies ( we have 1 single client as of now), 

So far in 5 months, I have written their entire oracle for the smart contract & developed sudo code/ demo for websocket clients/streams & now I am currently working on a very novel implementation of TLS. I also handled some part of their devops too for a while. 

I had some experience in MERN, so transitioning into the Web development side using Rust was just a going through docs case for me as I was aware of the basics. 

Now coming to this current TLS, it has been very taxing on me. I am no wizard or wonderkid, and things take time and some things in rust just are extremely poorly documented. I am currently doing network programming and working with core TLS implementation of rust. 

I am making about 60k a month right-now, and I feel okay about it only because the work life balance is exceptional ( and literally stuff of dreams ). 
The work itself is very hard ( given my year of experience in the domain is going to be a year in a month) and almost clueless at times, more so as I am the solo dev in this startup ( super super early stage ), but I have immense flexibility in when I can work, take time off ( obviously except for when a product is due for launch, the crunch time of which is happening right now) 

I seek suggestions as to how I can grow more as dev, since sometimes being solo on these difficult things do tire me out mentally. And sometimes I wish I had a senior/ mentor for more guidance. I do have one other colleague who‚Äôs like the Founder & the Cryptographer, who‚Äôs mad talented & super smart in her own field, but she again helps out mostly with abstraction of the protocols and so on& not able to help me out with much of the actual work ( which is also fair, since she has her own share of stuff to do & figure out ) 

Also, I would love to know what is the market compensation is like for this field.

1bobrpw,"I asked chatgpt on how can i learn html,css and js in a month to make an ecommerce website without a payment gateway, should i follow this?","Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the extent required to build a basic eCommerce website within a month is a feasible goal, but it will require dedication, focus, and effective learning strategies. Here's a practical approach to achieve this:

&#x200B;

\### Week 1: HTML Basics

\- \*\*Days 1-3:\*\* Start with the basics of HTML. Learn about HTML syntax, structure, and commonly used tags. Focus on creating static web pages with simple layouts.

\- \*\*Days 4-5:\*\* Dive deeper into semantic HTML. Understand the importance of semantic markup for accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.

\- \*\*Days 6-7:\*\* Practice building different components of a web page using HTML, including headers, paragraphs, lists, links, and forms.

&#x200B;

\### Week 2: CSS Fundamentals

\- \*\*Days 8-10:\*\* Begin learning CSS syntax and selectors. Experiment with applying styles to HTML elements, including fonts, colors, margins, padding, and borders.

\- \*\*Days 11-12:\*\* Learn about CSS layout techniques such as floats and positioning. Explore basic layout concepts to create simple page structures.

\- \*\*Days 13-14:\*\* Practice implementing responsive design principles with CSS media queries. Ensure your website looks good and functions well on various devices and screen sizes.

&#x200B;

\### Week 3: JavaScript Essentials

\- \*\*Days 15-17:\*\* Start learning JavaScript syntax, data types, variables, operators, and control structures. Understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web content.

\- \*\*Days 18-19:\*\* Dive into DOM manipulation. Learn how to access and modify elements in the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to update content dynamically.

\- \*\*Days 20-21:\*\* Explore event handling in JavaScript. Practice using event listeners to respond to user actions such as clicks, mouse movements, and form submissions.

&#x200B;

\### Week 4: Putting It All Together

\- \*\*Days 22-25:\*\* Combine your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a basic eCommerce website. Start with a simple layout and gradually add interactive features such as navigation menus, image galleries, and product listings.

\- \*\*Days 26-27:\*\* Implement form validation using JavaScript to ensure that user input meets specified criteria before submission.

\- \*\*Days 28-30:\*\* Fine-tune your website, test for compatibility and responsiveness across different devices and browsers, and make necessary adjustments.

&#x200B;

\### Additional Tips:

\- \*\*Consistent Practice:\*\* Dedicate time each day to practice coding and reinforce your learning through hands-on projects and exercises.

\- \*\*Use Online Resources:\*\* Take advantage of online tutorials, courses, documentation, and coding exercises to supplement your learning and troubleshoot any challenges you encounter.

\- \*\*Seek Help and Feedback:\*\* Join online communities, forums, or coding groups where you can ask questions, share your progress, and receive feedback from others.

\- \*\*Stay Focused:\*\* Stay focused on your learning goals and prioritize tasks effectively to make the most of your study time.

&#x200B;

While mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within a month is ambitious, with consistent effort and effective learning strategies, you can make significant progress and build a solid foundation in web development. Remember that learning is a continuous process, and you can always continue to improve and expand your skills over time.",2024-03-26 16:14:25

How does this reset work? Shouldn't the count be reset after 2 minutes from the last request? I am having it so random.

1bo3pxh,Fear of Black Listing due to working in a Contract Job company.,"I am currently working as a trainee in an IT Contracting firm for few months. I don't know if the operation of the company is legit or not.

My company hires people and ask the new joiners to self-train in technologies using internet. After few months, they arrange interviews with client firms to whom they fake the employees experience from 1 to 2 years to 5 years.

Some employees crack the interview and start working for the client firms, others who fail after 3 interviews are laid off.

My fear is that, Is there a chance for getting blacklisted if I fail the interview where my company has faked my experience? (It's obvious that the interviewer can easily find it using right questions.. and it has happened before to some laid off employees)

Another question is that, what if I pass the interview and the client accept me. Will there be some Universal Background verification database (.. if there's any) where they save my inflated years of  experience? 

Will my fake experience in the Background verification database (if any) create any conflict if I join the new company with my real years of experience?

Can somebody tell me how does contracting firms work? My parent company even shares our election Id card, PAN card etc with their contract clients.

These fears and questions, all started when a friend who is an HR intern told me that many companies share our resumes with Background Verification agencies. So even if we hide our previous employer (for whatever reasons), they'll get to know it from their database and the candidate won't even know the reason for their rejection in the new company.",2024-03-26 09:35:00

1bo34e0,Interview Experience with Solaris SE (Senior Go Developer),"I recently interviewed for the position of Senior Go Developer at Solaris SE (they are a tech company with banking license based in Germany. They also have an office in Chennai). It was a remote position and I was told there would be three rounds of interview.

**First round** \- Discussion with hiring manager about previous experiences. 

**Second round**  

* General questions from resume. 
* I was given a golang code in go playground that needed using waitgroup for solving . I was allowed to lookup documentation. 
* Your application has 3 endpoints 1. redeem coupon (receives 20% of the traffic) 2. verify coupon (70% of traffic) 3. some other endpoint (10%). Suddenly, all the endpoints are facing increased latency. How would you go about debugging this. Talk us through your thought process.

Overall, I found the interviewers to be pleasant. But the experience with the HR was quite opposite. I had to repeatedly call her for updates and rescheduling requests. Most of the time, my emails went unanswered.

After clearing the first 2 rounds, I received an invite to attend the third round which was a behavioural interview.  This round was then cancelled because one of the panel member was not available and then with no further updates, I got a generic rejection email.

In an attempt to get clarity, I contacted HR, only to find that she was unaware of the situation. She assured me of further investigation and follow-up, I received no updates for the next two days.  Eventually, I called her again today which is when she informed me that they have found other suitable candidates for the position and thanked me for calling her periodically to know about the status of my application lol.

I don't know if it is common for companies to stop interviews for candidates already in the loop if they find other suitable candidates. But I feel bad especially since I spent a decent amount of time preparing for their behavioural interview by going through their product talks and website.

The work is not complex as only in WordPress for now. Basics such as ACF and CTP would be required, in addition to technical SEO (speed optimisation, basics of h1s, not backlinks or content).

The hours would be part time to begin with and hopefully grow fairly quickly. 

What type of wage could I be looking at for such talent on:
A: a part time salary
B: an hourly rate

I‚Äôd need a dedicated resource for at least part time, so I‚Äôm not keen on the likes of upwork etc.

Hello fellow developers,

I am currently a 6th semester student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering from Chitkara University, with a specialization in Cybersecurity. Over the past few months, I have applied to more than 200 job openings for roles in Cybersecurity, but unfortunately, none of them have converted into an opportunity yet.

Despite my academic background and passion for the field, I am finding it challenging to break into the industry. I understand that the job market can be competitive, but I am committed to starting my career in Cybersecurity and am willing to put in the necessary work to make that happen.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or guidance on how to improve my chances of securing an internship in this field. Are there specific skills or certifications that are particularly valuable? Are there networking strategies that have worked for you or others you know? Any insights would be immensely helpful.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. Looking forward to learning from all of you!",2024-03-26 06:56:49

It is done in 3 phases each phase have one thing 1st have DSA and skill 2nd have aptitude and QA and 3rd have mock interview and practice. So these classes are add on classes which are commenced after the regular classes so our regular college timings are 8-12 and the CRT classes will be from 12-5:30. So this year also they introduced this program to us and the fees for registration is 6500rs. There are several terms and conditions which need to be followed which are:

1. You can't miss any class if you registered for the CRT if you missed any class due to any reason you will be registered out of the program and the fees will not be refunded. 
2. If you are willing to opt out from this program then you're not allowed in sitting in any placement activity (they're saying that CRT is completely optional but have this rule which so fuckall)
3. There is no guarantee of placement (the previous batch is crying hard for placement and they have no answers for this) 

These some terms and conditions. The main doubt which I'm having is that is it worth giving the money and time to this program but the main thing if I opt out from this that I'll be not able to to sit in any placement from the college side. 
I don't know what to do with this and also the senior batch students are just saying it is not worth it you will regret it after just 2 days.

1bnldbt,Life advice: 4 LPA job in start up or Masters in US,"Caution: Long post ahead  
Little background check: 4th year CS student from tier-3 college.

As everyone already knows job market is very bad this year and nearly no jobs. I kept trying for oncampus and off campus and no responses. Disappointed!! Thought a lot and considered lots of things and started applying to unis for masters in US. My intention behind this is completing my masters in this slow market and leveraging job opportunities by the time I complete my masters as many were predicting it will become much betterafter 1 or 2 years. So started that process, got admits, finalised a uni (MS CS- FAU) and even applied for loan. Just as I was planning to pay deposit and get i20, I was offered a job opportunity in a start up for 4 LPA+1 lakh bonus. I got it through referral from one of my relatives. If this was 2 or 3 months back I would have accepted this without any second thoughts. Becoz we can have lot of career growth in start ups and getting such opportunity in this market is very difficult.  But now after all this it feels like I have come too far with this US planning and I am maybe a bit reluctant. But this was what I wanted all this while. I just dont understand and I am a lot confused.  
I have always wanted to become independent and come out of my parents wings. I feel like if I stay here I will keep depending on them. This was also ONE of the reasons behind planning for US. I know my skills and resume were part of the reason I got this job but I was considered because of the referral  I got from my relatives which in turn again my parents helped me. But also I am little afraid if I will be able to survive in US especially with this h1 visa situation and coming US election. If I am going to US I will be having lots of responsibility like my loan and I need to help my parents with their debts too. If I am here, I am not sure if I will be able to pay off those debts.

Tl:Dr Go back and finish it. Don't worry about the gap. In the long term it won't matter but actually become an inspiration for everyone.

Long story (still cut short üòÖ) 

I had dropped out of school after I failed in 12th. I loved computers but didn't understand physics or chemistry. Joined my dad's business. Did it for 4 years. Hated it. Went back to my school teacher. Asked if I can just give my chemistry paper again. He said not possible you'll have to give 12th again from school. I was like but I'll feel like SRK from Main hoon na üòÖ. Not possible. 

He suggested to do it from open distance schooling. Decided to pursue that. Cleared 12th and joined a decent engineering college. During college I realised due to my gap my college placement chances are low, decided to take matters in my hands and started studying Linux properly. Joined several computer groups and attended many conferences to network in startup community.

Ended up getting 3 offers from startups. And now after over a decade I'm a Chief of Staff to the VP of Engineering.

When I tell people, that same gap has now become an inspiring story for everyone.

You'll do great. Create your own amazing inspiring story and tell it to others in the future.

All the very best üòÄ",2024-03-25 18:37:09

In my opinion the number if jobs are surely not going to increase and the competition is increasing day by day. Even freshers are comfortable with the concepts of system design. Everyone is working 10-12 hrs just to stay in the job.

I really dont see a sustainable future in this domain. Every company is firing.I mean come on if some one has a salary below 10 lpa you cant expect him to be retiring after 10 yoe. Most of us are in this situation. And its not like these low paing jobs are secure, you can be asked to leave anytime. 

This entire hype about software, high pay, good lifestyle is all real but in reality what pecentage of people are able to achieve this? Not even 5 percent. Its always the bottom tier/unlucky ones that will suffer. Story was completely different 15 years back but now the situation is completely different.

I am looking for alternate careers, any suggestions. I really cant take this uncertainity anymore. A career is not a joke, better pivot early than be asking for jobs when your responsibilities increase(after family and kids).

About this XYZ University ,
- It was previously a college for medical students but they newly started B.tech 
- the name XYZ is Big in India..  99% chance you know the name but not the college or university 
- But the Teaching is really Bad , they just give important questions and make every one pass

About me,
- I hate the college it's just not my thing....
- I can say with confidence that I can learn to code and have passion it 
- right I just know basic react, firebase and built a good looking e-commerce store for my friends fathers business 

I am not skilled right now but I don't think my college will take me any where and the college fee is heavy on my parents and I have 10 backlogs

Even tomorrow I have a midterm exam on ""computer organisation and architecture"",
The questions for the exam is sent to us through WhatsApp as they normally do
I don't like to do this.... So I am not going to read 

My parents hate me 
I hate my self

I am thinking to ask them for a 1 year break and try to get a job by my self 
May be just continue college and just pass the exam.. do my thing on the side....but it didn't work out until now

What exactly do I want..?
Recently I am getting interest in AI  is it possible for me to get a job at a AI model training or developing company atleast a 8 LPA 

I know some really smart friend studying at really good colleges( well I don't have their number so not sure if I can call them friends)

If I didn't match up to them my whole life would be a failure .. 
No way I can match them at the first job caz they will have advantage
After the first job I will have the disadvantage of starting low...

Should I go with web dev ( which I am interested)
Should I go with AI ( which I have a lot more interest for the money and futuristic wibe) but the entire is hard right..?  What should I do?

1bmnyro,How do I unit test my frontend utility functions?---,"Hello developers!

I have a question related to frontend testing. I have a lot of utility functions like these -

    /**
     * Returns array representation of an image element.
     * u/param {HTMLImageElement} image 
     * @returns {Float32Array}
     */
    export function getArrayFromImage(image) {
        const canvas = document.createElement(""canvas"");
        canvas.width = image.naturalWidth;
        canvas.height = image.naturalHeight;
        const ctx = canvas.getContext(""2d"");
        ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0);
        
        return ctx.getImageData(0, 0, image.naturalWidth, image.naturalHeight).data;
    }

Now, I'm trying to add unit tests for them. How do I do it?

All the frontend testing libraries/frameworks that I could find can test components and not functions that could run in a browser. The utility functions that I want to test are very small parts of the components that they are being used in, thus, adding tests for the component for the sake of testing this function won't really make sense (right?).

I am planning to take one of **Java+Kotlin+Android / C# + .Net** as the target starting career point. Which one can offer me an entry level role / intern at a good company in minimum time with my current gap & exp, provided I am very very good at learning.
